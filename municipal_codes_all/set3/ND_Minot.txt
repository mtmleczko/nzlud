PREFACE 
    This Code constitutes a complete codification of the ordinances of a general and permanent nature enacted by the City Council and is the first such codification for the City of Minot since 1962. 
    As expressed in the Adopting Ordinance, this Code supersedes all ordinances not included herein or expressly saved from repeal by the Adopting Ordinance. The Code contains only ordinances of a general and permanent nature, prescribed for and affecting the public as a whole. Special ordinances or ordinances dealing with only a portion of the inhabitants of the City, rather than all of them, or relating to special purposes, such as ordinances levying special assessments, providing for bond issues, paving, vacating and opening specified streets, etc., are not included herein. For a more specific enumeration of the types of ordinances which are not included herein, see Section 3 of the Adopting Ordinance. 
    The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order and the various sections within each chapter have been appropriately catchlined to facilitate usage. Appropriate footnotes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state laws have been included. Also, the source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. 
    The numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and municipal codes. Each section number consist of two component parts separated by a dash, the figure before the dash referring to the chapter number and the figure after the dash referring to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the first section of Chapter 1 is numbered 1-1 and the fourteenth section of Chapter 20 is 20-14. Under this system, each section is identified by its chapter, and at the same time, new sections may be inserted in their proper places, simply by using the decimal system for amendments. By way of illustration: If new material consisting of three sections that would logically come between sections 4-4 and 4-5 is desired to be added, such new sections would be numbered 4-4.1, 4-4.2, 4-4.3, respectively. 
    New chapters may be included by the addition of a fraction after the chapter number. For example, if the new material is to be included between Chapters 12 and 13, it will be designated as Chapter 121/2. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way, or in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject and in the case of divisions may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject, the next successive number being assigned to the article or division. 
    A special feature of this Code is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing for the Code. With this looseleaf system, the Code will be kept up-to-date periodically. Upon the final passage of amendatory ordinances, they will be properly edited and the page or pages affected will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to the holders of the Codes with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. Each such amendment, when incorporated into the Code, may be cited as a part hereof as provided in Section 4 of the Adopting Ordinance. 
    The successful maintenance of this Code up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the volume. As revised sheets are received it will become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publishers that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference. 
    The general index of the Code has been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of the headings being couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by city officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the index itself which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which he is interested. 
    The publication of this Code was under the direct supervision of George R. Langford, President, and Thomas B. Calhoun and Charles H. Brown, editors, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida. Credit is gratefully given to the other members of the publisher's staff for their sincere interest and able assistance throughout the project. 
    The publishers are most grateful to Mr. Vernon Fahy, City Manager, Mr. Robert A. Schempp, City Auditor, Mr. Hugh McCutcheon, City Attorney, for their cooperation and interest during the progress of the work on this Code. 
    This Code is presented for the use and benefit of the citizens of the City of Minot.

(5)  Debate limitation. No member of the city council shall speak more than twice at the same meeting on any question, except by leave of the presiding officer. No speaker shall address the city council for a period longer than five (5) minutes without permission given by the presiding officer. Otherwise it shall be the duty of the presiding officer to call the speaker to order upon the expiration of the time limit. This rule may be suspended at any time by a majority vote of the city council. 
(6)  Member called to order. When a member is called to order, he shall not proceed until the question of order is decided. 
(7)  Consent agenda. A motion that one (1) or more items be placed upon the so-called consent agenda shall be deemed the equivalent of a motion that, by unanimous consent, the rules be suspended and a special rule be adopted that the item or items thus designated be voted upon immediately without any debate or opportunity for amendment. Any council member may "pull" an item from the consent agenda by so stating, which statement by itself alone is sufficient to cause such item to be handled in the same manner as though it had never been included in the consent agenda motion in the first instance. 
(8)  Voting procedure; demand for roll call. A question which need not be decided by way of a roll call vote shall be put in this form: "Those who are in favor of the motion (state the question) say, 'Aye', and those opposed say, "Nay"; however, at any time before the presiding officer announces the result of such a vote by ayes and nays, any member of the city council may call for a roll call vote. A roll call vote is necessary, without regard to whether requested by a member of the council, upon the passage (whether upon first reading or second) of an ordinance, the expenditure of funds, or the sale of property, and otherwise when required by state law. 
(9)  Reconsideration. After the decision on any question, any member of the city council who voted with the majority on the question (or on either side of the question, if there was no majority) may move for a reconsideration of the vote at the same or the next succeeding meeting, without regard to whether either meeting is a regular or special meeting, however, unless the subject of reconsidering a specific vote taken at a prior meeting is mentioned unambiguously in a call for a special meeting, the specific vote in question cannot be reconsidered at the special meeting unless there are as many members present and voting at the special meeting as there were present and voting on the original vote. If, at a special meeting, it is not possible, by virtue of the prior sentence, to entertain a motion to reconsider a matter, then such special meeting shall be disregarded in determining which special or regular meeting shall be considered as the "next succeeding meeting." After a motion for reconsideration has once been acted on, no other motion for a reconsideration thereof shall be made without unanimous consent. 
(10)  Precedence of motion to adjourn. A motion to adjourn shall always be in order, except when a vote is being taken. 
(11)  Treatment of motions. The motions listed in the following table are listed in decreasing order of precedence, and are debatable and are subject to majority requirements, as specified in such table. 
Table of Motions 
Name of Motion Debatable Majority Adjourn No Simple Recess No Simple Lay on the table No Simple Previous question No Two-thirds Postpone to a time certain Yes Simple Refer to a committee Yes Simple Amend Yes Simple Postpone indefinitely Yes Simple Main motion Yes Simple Take from the table No Simple  
(12)  Amendment of ordinances. It shall be in order to amend an ordinance at any time before final passage. 
(13)  Robert's Rules of Order. Any question of procedure not covered herein shall be governed by Robert's Rules of Order. 
(14)  Effect of passed vote. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in state law, whether statutory or common, a member who passes his or her vote on a measure being voted upon by the city council, or who is disqualified from voting on such measure, shall be deemed to be absent from the meeting for purposes of such vote (without regard to his or her actual physical presence at the meeting). 
(15)  Equivalent motions. A motion- 
a.  To hold; or 
b.  To table; or 
c.  To lay on the table; or 
d.  To postpone to a time certain; or 
e.  To postpone indefinitely- 
will (except when the discussion or other circumstances indicate a contrary intent), be treated and recorded as being a "motion to hold." A "motion to hold" will be considered a short-hand form of moving that debate on the main motion cease immediately and that such main motion be put on the agenda of the next meeting of the body (full council or committee thereof), in which the motion to hold is made. The motion to hold shall require only a simple majority to pass and shall be debatable, but the debate may go only to the merits of postponing consideration of the main motion, and not to the merits of the main motion itself. A "motion to hold in committee," when made at the city council level, shall be treated and recorded as being a motion to refer the main motion to the committee from whence it originated. 
(b)  A majority vote of the council is required to pass a resolution establishing, amending, or repealing the rules of order of the city council supplementary to those provided for in subsection (a).

Sec. 2-130. - Water utility revenue bonding. 
    Notwithstanding any contrary provisions of statutes of the State of North Dakota: 
(1)  Pursuant to the provisions of the Home Rule Charter of the City of Minot, the city is hereby authorized by resolution or resolutions of its city council, to issue revenue bonds of the city to finance the cost of additions or improvements to its water and sewage utility (the "utility"). Except as otherwise provided herein, all the provisions of Chapter 40-35, N.D.C.C., shall apply to bonds issued under this section. In the resolution authorizing the issuance of revenue bonds in anticipation of the collection of the revenues of the utility, the city council shall establish a reserve for the security of the bonds, in an amount equal to the maximum amount of principal and interest to become due on such bonds in any full calendar year, or, in the case of bonds issued on or after August 1, 2004, in an amount equal to the lesser of: 
a.  The maximum annual debt service to become due on such bonds; or 
b.  One hundred twenty-five (125) percent of the average annual debt service to become due on such bonds; or 
c.  Ten (10) percent of the proceeds of such bonds; 
and may provide that such reserve shall be set aside from the proceeds of the bonds or from any revenues on hand and properly available therefor. The resolution shall also provide that the rates, fees, and charges for the services, facilities, or commodities provided by the utility shall be established and revised from time to time when necessary, so that the revenue derived from the utility will at all times be sufficient to pay all normal, reasonable, and current costs of the operation and maintenance thereof, and (together with any other monies appropriated therefore) to pay when due the principal of and interest on the bonds, and to maintain the reserve in the amount required by such resolution. The resolution may also pledge to the payment of bonds, other funds and revenues of the city, including sales tax collections, which are available for the purpose and the city may include the anticipated collections of such other funds and revenues in computing the sufficiency of the rates, fees, and charges required to be established and maintained hereunder. In the event that there shall be at any time a deficiency in said reserve, the city council shall cause a tax to be levied upon all taxable property in the city for the payment of such deficiency, and such tax shall be subject to no limitation as to rate or amount. 
(2)  Prior to adoption of a resolution authorizing the issuance of bonds under this section, the city council shall cause to be published at least once in the official newspaper of the city a notice describing the general nature of the addition or improvement and the estimated cost thereof, and stating that it is proposed to issue bonds to defray such estimated cost and that the resolution authorizing the issuance of such bonds will include a provision for a reserve in an amount equal to the maximum amount of bond principal and interest to become due thereon in any full calendar year, which reserve is to be established and maintained from bond proceeds or revenues on hand and available therefor, and that if at any time a deficiency exists in the reserve, the city council will levy a tax upon all taxable property in the city for payment of such deficiency, and stating that written protests against the issuance of such bonds must be filed in the office of the city auditor within twenty (20) days after the publication of the notice. 
(3)  If, within twenty (20) days after the publication of the notice required in subsection (2) hereof, written protests against the issuance of bonds, signed by electors of the city equal in number to at least twenty (20) percent of the number of voters participating at the last preceding general election held in the city, are filed in the office of the city auditor, the bonds described in the notice shall not be issued. Such protests shall not, however, be a bar to proceeding with the undertaking under the provisions of Chapter 40-35, N.D.C.C. If the protests are found to be insufficient or invalid by the city council at a regular or special meeting occurring within thirty (30) days after the expiration of the time for filing such protests, the city council may proceed to issue the bonds in accordance with subsection (1) of this section. 
(4)  Petitions described in subsection (3) shall contain the date of signature, the signature of the elector, the address of the elector, the age of the elector, the length of residency within the city of the elector. If any of these protest signature requirements are missing from the petition, the protest shall not be counted by the city auditor. 
(5)  If a tax is ever levied for any deficiency in the bond reserve, the amount thereof shall be restored to the general fund of the city from the next revenues of the utility received in excess of current expenses of operation and maintenance. 
(6)  The city council also reserves the right to levy assessments with respect to any improvement, or to establish connection charges and to appropriate part or all of the collections thereof to the sinking fund established for any bonds issued pursuant to this section.

    Purchasing agent means the city employee who has been delegated the authority to enter into a particular purchase contract on behalf of the city.

Sec. 2-134. - Scope. 
(a)  This division shall apply to the purchase of personal property by the city.

(c)  This division shall not apply to the purchase of products by the city: 
(1)  Which are controlled as to price by the federal or state government, such as, for example, the purchase of natural gas and electricity; 
(2)  Which the purchasing agent certifies in writing as being available as a practical matter from only one (1) supplier, such as, for example, water meters of a given make; or 
(3)  Which the purchasing agent certifies in writing as being required immediately by an emergency, the nature of which as a practical matter does not allow compliance with the provisions of this division, such as, for example, the purchase of protective outer wear for city emergency personnel who are responding to a hazardous chemical release. 
(d)  This division shall not apply to purchases made jointly with or through another governmental entity, such as, for example, a purchase made through the state bid or in conjunction with the school district; provided that, however, such purchase has been approved or ratified by the city manager. 
(e)  This division shall not apply to purchases which the city is obligated to make in a certain manner, or for which special conditions and limitations apply, such as, for example, when the city is obligated to make a purchase from a disadvantaged business enterprise (DBE) as a condition of a federal grant.

(g)  When a purchase is excepted from the scope of this division and there are no other laws or ordinances governing the manner in which the purchase is to be accomplished, the manner of effecting the purchase shall be within the discretion of the city manager or his delegate. 
(Ord. No. 3347, § 2) 
Sec. 2-135. - Purchasing procedure; exception. 
(a)  If the amount of a given purchase does not exceed one thousand dollars ($1,000.00), the manner of accomplishing the purchase is left to the discretion of the purchasing agent. 
(b)  If the amount of a given purchase exceeds one thousand dollars ($1,000.00) but does not exceed three thousand dollars ($3,000.00), the purchasing agent, before making the purchase, shall informally solicit two (2) or more quotes from vendors, which quotes need not be in writing, but which may be made orally by telephone or in person. The purchasing agent shall keep a formal record of the persons from whom quotes were solicited, the manner in which the quotes were solicited, the date when the quotes were solicited, and the price and other pertinent detail of each quote received. 
(c)  If the amount of a given purchase exceeds three thousand dollars ($3,000.00) but does not exceed fifteen thousand dollars ($15,000.00), the purchasing agent shall proceed in accordance with subsection (b), except that the quotes must be put in writing by the vendor in order to be considered. 
(d)  If the amount of a given purchase exceeds fifteen thousand dollars ($15,000.00), the purchasing agent shall solicit sealed bids for the purchase in accordance with section 2-136, except as provided in subsection (f) hereof. 
(e)  No purchase shall be artificially divided or artificially structured so as to avoid the effect of the monetary gradations established in this section. 
(f)  Notwithstanding the foregoing subsections, if a product is available on a "spot market" basis, as in the purchase of tanker loads of gasoline for which the price fluctuates day to day, then the product may be purchased on the basis of the lowest bid obtained on that market. The purchasing agent shall be governed by the procedures set forth in subsection (b) when acting pursuant to this subsection. 
(Ord. No. 3347, § 2; Ord. No. 3929, § 1) 
Sec. 2-136. - Bidding procedure. 
(a)  When, pursuant to section 2-135(d), it is necessary for the city to solicit bids, this section shall govern the manner in which that is done. 
(b)  The call for bids shall be in writing and shall be accompanied by such written conditions and specifications as are necessary, in the opinion of the purchasing agent, to: 
(1)  Inform the potential bidders of the exact nature of the purchase which the city wishes to make; 
(2)  Allow meaningful comparisons to be made among the bids which are submitted; and 
(3)  Allow the consideration of, or the refusal to consider, bids which vary from the specifications by way of additions, deletions, or substitutions. 
(c)  The written specifications and conditions called for in subsection (b) need not be limited to a physical description of the product which is sought to be purchased, but may also address, for example, such matters as to how and upon what conditions repairs, ordinary maintenance, and operational training would be provided by the vendor if the purchase contract were awarded to it. 
(d)  The call for bids shall explicitly require or explicitly disclaim any requirement for: 
(1)  A bid bond; 
(2)  A performance bond; 
(3)  An indemnification agreement; or 
(4)  A warranty. 
(e)  In deciding whether a bid bond or a performance bond should be required, the purchasing agent shall consider, in the light of past experience: 
(1)  Whether and in what circumstances there may have been occasions to call upon the bonding company to honor such a bond in connection with similar purchases; 
(2)  The dependability and stability of those vendors likely to submit bids; and 
(3)  The severity of the injury to the city if no such bond is required and circumstances occurred which would give rise to a call on the bond if there were one. 
(f)  A certified check, cashier's check, cash deposit or other suitable security may be substituted for a bond when a bond is required. 
(g)  When a call for bids requires a bond or other security, then, contrary to state law, the bid bond or other security may be enclosed with the other bid documents submitted by a bidder and need not be submitted in a separate envelope attached to the envelope enclosing the other bid documents. 
(h)  The call for bids shall be advertised in publications, or circulated by mail, or both, in such a manner as, in the opinion of the purchasing agent, will obtain the best response thereto for the benefit of the city. The call for bids shall specify where, when, and by whom the bids shall be opened and tabulated. The opening and tabulation shall be open to the public. 
(i)  When, as a matter of policy, the city council has reserved to itself the right of final approval of a particular call for bids, or of a class of calls for bids, before issuing the particular call or one in such class, the purchasing agent shall first obtain such approval. 
(Ord. No. 3347, § 2) 
Sec. 2-137. - Award of purchase contracts. 
(a)  The purchasing agent shall award the purchase contract to the lowest responsible vendor, as determined by the following factors: 
(1)  The price quoted or bid; 
(2)  The ability, capacity, and skill of the vendor to provide the product; 
(3)  Whether the vendor can supply the product promptly, or within the time specified, without delay or interference; 
(4)  The character, integrity, reputation, judgment, experience and efficiency of the vendor; 
(5)  The quality of previous performance by the vendor; 
(6)  The sufficiency of the financial resources and ability of the vendor to supply the product satisfactorily; 
(7)  The quality, availability, and adaptability of the product to the particular use required; 
(8)  The ability of the vendor to provide such future maintenance and other auxiliary services as might reasonably be required in connection with the purchase; and 
(9)  The number and scope of the conditions made by the vendor to its bid or quotation. 
If the price factor (subsection (1)) is not controlling as to which vendor receives the purchase contract, the purchasing agent shall make a record as to which other factors overrode the price factor. 
(b)  When the convenience of the city would be promoted thereby, all bids, quotes, or other proposals relating to a potential purchase by the city may be rejected by the purchasing agent. 
(c)  The purchasing agent may waive irregularities or errors in the purchasing process as long as no vendor is unfairly prejudiced by such waiver. As used herein, "unfair prejudice" includes, but is not necessarily limited to: 
(1)  One (1) vendor being allowed to learn of another vendor's bid or quote and being given an opportunity to undercut the other vendor's bid or quote; or 
(2)  One (1) vendor being allowed to avoid a cost or obligation which the other vendors are not given an equal chance to avoid. 
(Ord. No. 3347, § 2) 
Sec. 2-138. - Purchases by city council. 
    When, as a matter of policy, the city council reserves to itself the right to make the award of a purchase contract and the purchasing agent is merely fulfilling a ministerial function in entering into the purchase contract on behalf of the city: 
(1)  The city council shall use the same factors as set forth in subsection 2-137(a) to choose the lowest responsible vendor, and, in addition, it shall give such weight as it feels appropriate under the circumstances to the extent, if any, that an award to one (1) particular vendor as opposed to another will benefit the local community; and 
(2)  The city council has the same rights as set forth in subsections 2-137(b) and (c). 
(Ord. No. 3347, § 2) 
Sec. 2-139. - Reports to city auditor. 
    In order to facilitate internal audits and cost controls, each purchasing agent shall make periodic reports to the city auditor of the purchases made by him. The timing, contents, and form of such reports, and any exception to the reporting requirements for small purchases, shall be as established and modified from time to time by the city auditor.

Further, notwithstanding NDCC 48-01.1-06, it shall not be necessary, and again without regard to the estimated cost of construction of a public improvement or any component thereof, to solicit multiple prime bids for the general, electrical, and mechanical portions of the project.

Formerly, Div. 4 was derived from Ord. No. 1837, §§ 1-15, and Ord. No. 1997, § 3. 

Sec. 2-161. - Definitions. 
    Annual budget ordinance means an ordinance comprising three (3) parts or components: 
(1)  The annual appropriation ordinance, 
(2)  The annual tax levy ordinance, and 
(3)  Information, data and projections as to the anticipated affairs of the city during the budget year. 
    Appropriation means a preliminary authorization to expend money or to incur a liability for a particular purpose. 
    Budget year means the fiscal year to which the budget relates. 
    Encumbrance means the practice whereby money in a particular fund is designated as the source of payment for a particular obligation or a liability, which designation is made at the time that the obligation or liability is incurred, such as by the placement of a purchase order, and which encumbered money is thereby decreed to be unavailable for any other expenditures; the amount of the encumbrance equals the amount of the liability or obligation. 
    Fiscal year means the calendar year beginning each January 1st and ending each December 31st. 
    Income means revenue from any source whatsoever. 
(Ord. No. 2519, § 1) 
Sec. 2-162. - City manager to prepare recommended budget. 
    The city manager shall prepare and submit to the city council by the first Monday of each August an annual recommended budget for the next budget year. At the same time he shall file one or more copies of the recommended budget with the city clerk to be held by the clerk for purposes of inspection and copying by interested members of the public. 
(Ord. No. 2519, § 1) 
Sec. 2-163. - Budget contents; notice and hearing on budget. 
(a)  The city budget shall be prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles established with respect to governmental operations, which principles are sometimes collectively referred to as fund accounting or budgetary accounting. 
(b)  The budget shall be divided into different funds so as to segregate and to identify the expenditures and income which relate to particular operational activities or other activities of the city. For example, the budget may account for expenditures and income with respect to the following funds, which are given for purposes of illustration only: 
(1)  Enterprise funds, such as the airport fund, city bus fund, cemetery fund, water and sewer utility fund, etc.; 
(2)  Special revenue funds, such as road and bridge fund, revenue sharing, library, etc.; 
(3)  Trust and agency funds, such as the police pension fund and the city employees' pension fund; 
(4)  Debt service funds, such as special assessment refunding bond issues, flood bonds, highway bonds, etc.; 
(5)  Construction project funds to account for monies used to build capital improvements like a new fire station; and 
(6)  The general fund, consisting of all items of expenditures and income not attributed to another fund. 
(c)  Special assessment funds which account for monies listed in special assessment projects under construction need not form part of the budget. 
(d)  (1) 
a. 
It shall be the policy of the city, and the recommended budget prepared by the city manager shall so provide, with respect to the general fund, special revenue funds and enterprise funds, or their equivalent, if some other nomenclature is used rather than that set forth in section 2-163(b), that there shall be available at the end of the budget year sufficient operating capital or working capital therein to equal one month's average expenditures for the budget year. 
b.  For purposes of the prior subparagraph, the average monthly expenditures with respect to a fund shall be determined by multiplying the total appropriations for the budget year for the fund by one-twelfth ( 1/12 ). 
c.  For purposes of subparagraph a above, operating capital or working capital with respect to a fund shall mean a positive balance which would remain on hand in a fund at the end of the budget year in the event the expenditures and income attributable to the fund during the budget year actually are incurred or realized in the amounts and at the times projected in the budget. 
(2)  With respect to funds of the city other than the general fund, special revenue funds and enterprise funds, it shall be the policy of the city, and the recommended budget of the city manager shall so provide, that at the end of the budget year such funds shall not contain a negative balance, assuming that the expenditures and income attributable to each fund are incurred or realized in the amounts and at the times projected in the budget. 
(3)  In the event that the city is obligated to observe a greater degree of solvency in a fund or in an account within a fund than that level established in section 2-163(d)(1) or 2-163(d)(2), as is likely to be the case, for example, with respect to the pension fund concerning which the city must observe sound actuarial principles, or with respect to debt service funds concerning which the city is contractually bound as part of its borrowing to maintain certain reserves, then the recommended budget prepared by the city manager shall be designed so as to accomplish or to preserve the necessary level of solvency. 
Editor's note- Section 2 of Ord. No. 2519 provided that subsection (d) would not become effective until the 1986 budget year. 
(e)  There shall be set forth in the city manager's recommended budget with respect to each fund so many of the following items for the budget year are as pertinent thereto: 
(1)  Operating or working capital estimated to be on hand at the beginning of the budget year as a carry-over from the prior budget year, less a reserve for encumbrances to reflect obligations incurred in the prior budget year but not paid for within that year; 
(2)  Estimated income, divided into categories such as the following, given by way of example: 
a.  Federal and state grants; 
b.  User fees; 
c.  License and permit fees; 
d.  Intergovernmental revenues; 
e.  Fines and forfeitures; 
f.  Taxes other than real estate taxes; 
g.  Interest income; 
h.  Sales of goods or services; 
i.  Decrease in working capital or operating capital, if any; 
j.  Local real estate tax levy proceeds; and 
k.  Miscellaneous. 
(3)  Recommended expenditures, divided into categories such as the following, given by way of example: 
a.  Salaries and wages; 
b.  Supplies; 
c.  General services, that is, services or utilities purchased from outside sources; 
d.  Building and structure maintenance; 
e.  Equipment maintenance; 
f.  Capital outlays; 
g.  Debt retirement (principal); 
h.  Debt retirement (interest); 
i.  Grants in aid; and 
j.  Increase in operating capital or working capital at the end of the budget year compared to the beginning of the budget year, if any. 
(4)  The recommended expenditures shall further be divided into line items, such as, by way of example-office and building supplies, subscriptions, dues, travel expense, telephone, electricity, etc. 
(f)  The city council shall set a time and place for a public hearing on the city manager's recommended budget, which public hearing shall be held between August 8th and the earlier of (1) the second reading of the budget ordinance, or (2) October 1st. The city clerk shall publish one notice of the public hearing in a newspaper of general circulation within the City of Minot at least six (6) days prior to the date of the public hearing (exclusive of the date of publication and the date of hearing), which notice shall state the time and place for the hearing and the purpose thereof. Moreover the notice shall state that the proposed budget is available for inspection at the office of the city clerk. Subject to reasonable rules and regulations any interested person may address the council at the hearing with respect to any part of the budget. If it deems it desirable the city council may continue the hearing from time to time but no public notice of the reopened hearing need be given, except as is given with respect to meetings of the council generally. 
(Ord. No. 2519, § 1) 
Sec. 2-164. - Adoption of the official budget; subsequent amendments; effect thereof. 
(a)  Insofar as section 2-163 prescribes the format to be followed in setting forth the contents of the budget, that format shall be observed by the council in establishing the official budget for the budget year. However, in all other respects the council may change any other aspect of the budget recommended by the city manager, which changes may be made prior to, during, or after the public hearing provided for in section 2-163. However, final approval of the budget shall not be accomplished until the public hearing is finally closed without provision being made for a continuance thereof. 
(b)  The final adoption of the budget shall be by way of the annual budget ordinance, which ordinance shall be passed on second reading no later than the second business day prior to October 10th. 
(c)  The annual tax levy ordinance component of the annual budget ordinance shall consist of the aggregate of the various tax levies set forth therein with respect to the funds established in the budget, which aggregate tax levy shall be certified by the city auditor to the county auditor for collection as prescribed by state law. 
(d)  The annual appropriation ordinance component of the annual budget ordinance shall constitute an appropriation of the projected expenditures set forth therein, except to the extent that prior appropriation of anticipated expenditures is waived in section 2-165 hereof. 
(e)  From time to time the council may amend the budget ordinance in two (2) respects: 
(1)  It may transfer appropriations from one particular fund to another particular fund or it may add new line items within a fund, or both. In so doing it may act by way of resolution, notwithstanding the fact that the original appropriations in question were made by way of ordinance. It is the intent and understanding of the city council that this procedure was authorized by NDCC 40-40-17 at the time of the adoption of the City of Minot home rule charter, that resolutions of the sort contemplated by this subparagraph are consequently an inherent aspect of the annual appropriation ordinance component of the annual budget ordinance, as the term "annual appropriation ordinance" was understood at the time of the enactment of the home rule charter, and that therefore these resolutions are not referable under article IV of the home rule charter. 
(2)  It may from time to time by way of an ordinance increase the aggregate total of appropriations during the course of the budget year in order to reflect changes in financial circumstances either not contemplated in the annual budget ordinance at the time of its adoption, or which financial circumstances by their very nature are difficult to estimate with exactitude at the time of the enactment of the annual budget ordinance. For example, the creation of a new source of revenue such as a new city sales tax or income tax, or the availability of funds through a new federal or state grant program would form the basis for an increase in appropriations pursuant to this subparagraph, and the case would be likewise with respect to an unexpected significant increase in variable sources of income such as user fees or license and permit fees. It is the intent and understanding of the city council that the procedure established in this subparagraph was not authorized by state law at the time of adoption of the home rule charter of the City of Minot, but rather this procedure represents an exercise of home rule powers, that therefore this procedure cannot be viewed as an inherent aspect of the annual appropriation ordinance component of the annual budget ordinance, so that consequently such an ordinance as provided for in this subparagraph amending the annual budget ordinance is referable under article IV of the home rule charter. 
(f)  The annual appropriation ordinance component of the annual budget ordinance shall be considered an ordinance implementing those powers or functions of city government funded therein, which powers or functions are available to the City of Minot only by virtue of its home rule powers, insofar as implementation by ordinance of home rule powers is required under Chapter 40-05.1 of the North Dakota Century Code and the City of Minot home rule charter. 
(Ord. No. 2519, § 1) 
Sec. 2-165. - Limitations on expenditures; exceptions; liability therefor. 
(a)  No expenditure shall be made nor liability shall be incurred with respect to a particular fund unless supported by total appropriations in the fund in the annual budget ordinance, or subsequent amendments to the annual budget ordinance, sufficient to pay such expenditure or liability, except as provided for in subsections (c) and (d) below. However, as long as the rule in the prior sentence is observed, an amount of authorized expenditure with respect to a particular line item or category of expenditures may be exceeded in order to accommodate or to reflect actual operating experience. For an illustration of what is meant by "line item" or "category of expenditures" see section 2-163(e)(3) and (4). 
(b)  No expenditure shall be made nor liability shall be incurred with respect to a particular purpose without prior city council approval unless that purpose is described with reasonable certainty by a particular line item description in the annual budget ordinance to which the expenditure or liability relates. For purposes of this section a line item of "miscellaneous" shall serve as authority for miscellaneous expenditures without prior city council approval only to the extent the amount is originally established in the annual budget ordinance or an amendment thereto. If city council approval under this subsection is required and is obtained then regardless of the form by which such approval is expressed, the approval shall serve as an amendment to the budget ordinance under section 2-164(e)(1). 
(c)  No appropriation in the annual budget ordinance or amendment thereto shall be necessary for expenditures: 
(1)  Made from special assessment funds provided for in Chapter 40-22 of the North Dakota Century Code or in division 5 of this article; 
(2)  Made with respect to payments from the city pension funds to beneficiaries thereof, or in discharge of ordinary expenses thereof; or 
    (3)Made to discharge obligations incurred under the authority of section 31-27 (relating to long-term or perpetual obligations to purchase water for use by the water and sewerage utility). 
(d)  No additional appropriations, in excess of the amount set forth in the annual budget ordinance, need be made with respect to those expenditures incurred by the enterprise funds and special revenue funds of the city, which expenditures represent the cost of goods sold by the enterprises, if it should develop in the course of the budget year that the sales to which the expenditures relate are higher than projected at the time of the adoption of the annual budget ordinance, provided that, however, this paragraph shall constitute authority for such increased expenditures only if the variable costs associated with making sales in excess of the projected level of sales are less than the revenues derived therefrom. 
(e)  Expenditures made or liabilities incurred contrary to the restrictions of this section shall be the joint and several liability of the members of the city council who authorize the improper action or who were present when it was authorized and who did not vote against its authorization. 
(Ord. No. 2519, § 1; Ord. No. 3027, § 1; Ord. No. 3215, § 2) 
Sec. 2-166. - Administration of the budget. 
(a)  The city manager shall make available to the council no less than quarterly a detailed accounting of the expenditures and income of the city with respect to: 
(1)  The elapsed period of the budget year; and 
(2)  The period from the last such accounting. 
    The accounting shall be in a format which is compatible to the format of the budget. 
(b)  Final authorization of the making of an expenditure or the incurring of a liability shall be made by the city council acting pursuant to section 2-122, and subject to the exceptions set forth therein; provided that, however: 
(1)  The city manager may authorize the incurring of liabilities, or the making of expenditures, to the extent that he is authorized to do so in Division 2 of this article; 
(2)  The library board shall provide final authorization for the expenditure of library funds; and 
(3)  The pension boards shall provide final authorization for the expenditure of pension funds.

(a)  In preparing the advertising for bids required pursuant to Section 40-22-10 of the North Dakota Century Code, the council may specify that bids will be opened, read and recorded by the city clerk, city manager or city engineer, in the presence of at least one elected city official, at a time and place specified in the advertisement (but not more than thirty (30) calendar days prior to the meeting of the city council at which such bids will be considered). 
(b)  The elected city official to be present at the bid opening will be contacted according to the following priority: Mayor, president, vice-president, involved committee chairman, and other aldermen. 
(c)  The time and place specified for the opening, reading and recording of the bids shall be reasonably convenient to the public and open to any interested citizen who may wish to attend. Promptly after the bids have been opened read and recorded, the city clerk shall prepare a tabulation setting forth the name and bid amount of all bidders submitting proposals for the project(s) involved. Said tabulation and copies of all bids received shall be kept on file in the office of the city clerk pending action thereon by the city council.

The petition of the park district shall indicate the nature of the improvements and shall certify that the improvements are located on property of the park district or property that the park district has an interest in, or otherwise controls, and that the park district consents to the levy of special assessments on the property to be benefitted by the improvements in an amount sufficient to pay all costs thereof as determined by the city and the park district. The park district, pursuant to such petition or such other documentation as the city determines to be necessary, shall agree that any improvements so financed by the city shall be owned and/or controlled, operated, used, improved, and maintained by the park district pursuant to law as part of a park system open to the general public; and the park district shall not discontinue ownership, operation, or maintenance of any such improvements unless all special assessments levied by the city for the costs thereof shall have been paid in full.

    Pursuant to the provisions of North Dakota Century Code, Chapter 40-61 as amended, it is determined that the municipal parking system shall be used, occupied, operated and maintained on behalf of the city by the municipal limited parking authority, which was established by resolution of the city council, dated June 30, 1972, and is now duly organized and existing as a body corporate and public benefit corporation under said law. The municipal limited parking authority is to exercise such powers granted by said Chapter 40-61 relative to the operation, maintenance, management, regulation, construction, reconstruction and improvement of the municipal parking system and all parts thereof, the execution of contracts and leases and other instruments, and the fixing and collection of rentals, fees and other charges for the use of the system, save and except that:

(c)  In the exercise of said powers, the municipal limited parking authority shall also comply with the provisions of this division and any ordinance amending or supplementing this division; but no provision of this division shall constitute a covenant enforceable by a holder of any warrant or bond of the city, and the security of all such obligations shall be governed exclusively by the resolutions and laws under which they are issued.

Sec. 2-227. - Parking authority fund. 
    In accordance with North Dakota Century Code, Section 40-61-07 all moneys of the municipal limited parking authority shall be paid to the city treasurer as agent of the authority, and shall be deposited in a separate bank account or accounts and shall not be commingled with other city funds, and shall be secured, invested, reinvested and expended as provided in Section 40-61-07. However, no net parking system revenues which are at any time required, under the conditions stated in this division, to be paid into another city fund, shall be deemed to be moneys of the authority within the meaning of this section 2-227. The authority shall be required to make monthly reports of their financial condition to the city council of the City of Minot. The following separate bookkeeping accounts shall be maintained at all times on the official books and records of the authority, subject to inspection and auditing by the city auditor, for the purpose of showing all receipts of money from the following sources and all disbursements of money for the following purposes: 
(a)  An operation and maintenance account, to which there shall be credited as received all revenues derived in any manner whatsoever from the operation of the municipal limited parking system and to which there shall be charged all items which under accepted accounting practice constitute, normal, reasonable and current costs of the operation and maintenance of said parking system. All rentals and payments of whatsoever nature, received under any lease agreement or operating agreement applicable to any parking facility, shall be credited to this account. 
(b)  A reserve account, to which there shall be credited at least once each month all moneys then remaining in the operation and maintenance account, in excess of the amount then due and owing in payment of operation and maintenance expenses and the additional amount reasonably estimated by the authority to be necessary for payments of operation and maintenance expenses to become due in the then current month. The balance on hand in this account from time to time constitutes the "net revenues" referred to in the following provisions of this division.

If the net revenues on hand at any time are not equal to the amount then required for any purpose enumerated, no amount shall be expended or transferred for any purpose in a lower order of priority, and the requirements for each purpose shall be cumulative and shall include interest on any money necessarily borrowed by either the city or the parking authority to meet any deficiency in net revenues from time to time available for that purpose. In accordance with the foregoing principles, said net revenues shall be applied for the following purposes in the following order of priority: 
(a)  To provide moneys needed in the operation and maintenance account to pay valid claims due and payable with respect to current, reasonable and necessary operation and maintenance expenses of the parking system. 
(b)  To provide moneys needed in each fund now or hereafter created by the city and appropriated for the payment of warrants or bonds financing facilities comprising the municipal limited parking system, not less than thirty (30) days in advance of each date on which interest or principal becomes due and payable on said warrants or bonds, in an amount which will be sufficient with moneys then on hand in such fund to pay all such interest and principal then due, provided that the city's resolutions authorizing such bonds shall have pledged and appropriated net parking system revenues for the payment thereof. 
(c)  To credit and pay to the City of Minot such amount as shall be determined by the city council to be reasonably equivalent to the amount of taxes otherwise leviable upon properties of the municipal limited parking system if privately owned; which amount so credited shall be subject to appropriation by said board for any proper corporate purpose consistent with the provisions of its resolutions authorizing warrants or bonds referred to in paragraph (b) of this section 2-228.

ARTICLE I. - IN GENERAL 

Sec. 3-1. - Distribution of handbills and posters prohibited; exception. 
(a)  It shall be unlawful to distribute handbills, poster, or other papers in the streets of the city or for any person to throw or deposit upon the streets, sidewalks, alleys, or any public place in the city any handbills, posters, or other papers. 
(b)  Nothing shall be construed so as to prevent any person from delivering into any place of business or residence in the city any poster, handbill, or other paper in such a manner that the same will not fall or be blown by the wind upon the streets, sidewalks, or public places in the city. 
(c)  The penalty for a violation of section 3-1 shall be a fine of one hundred fifty dollars ($150.00). 
(Rev. Gen. Ords. 1962, §§ 18-0305, 18-0306; Ord. No. 4809, § 1) 
Sec. 3-2. - Restrictions on signs. 
(a)  The city council of the City of Minot finds and determines, that: 
(1)  The placement and maintenance of signs within the untraveled portion of the public right-of-way creates a special hazard and matter of public concern because a sign, by its very nature and purpose, is designed and maintained to invite the notice and attention of passersby, and consequently the closer a sign is placed to the traveled portion of the right-of-way the greater the potential for distracting the attention of motorists or pedestrians or both, thus increasing the risk of traffic accidents. 
(2)  In this regard a sign located within the public right-of-way is qualitatively different from other projections or fixtures placed and maintained within the right-of-way, so that a prohibition on such sign placement and maintenance is justified by the health and safety interests of the community, even though such interests may not or do not justify a flat prohibition on the construction and maintenance of any improvements whatsoever within the untraveled portion of the public right-of-way. Indeed, the authority to enact and to enforce such an all encumbancing prohibition is questionable given the holding of the North Dakota Supreme Court in the case of Hjelle v. J.C. Snyder & Sons, 133 NW 2d 265, which further justifies limiting the prohibition contained in this section to a ban on signs alone. Moreover, given the holding of the North Dakota Supreme Court in the case of Neumann Signs, Inc. v. Hjelle, 268 NW 2D 741, it appears that a prohibition on the erection and maintenance of signs within the untraveled portion of the public right-of-way would not unconstitutionally infringe upon whatever property rights the adjoining property owner might enjoy under the Hjelle v. Snyder case. 
(3)  Concerns for reasonable investment-backed expectations of profit justify making prospective only the prohibition herein on the placement and maintenance of signs within the untraveled portion of the public right-of-way, except that a limited degree of retroactivity to July 1, 1985, is warranted in order to avoid a rush to erect new signs during the enactment process of this section. 
(4)  Although a ban on the placement of signs upon the untraveled portion of the public right-of-way does restrict one means of communication, nevertheless an adequate substitute therefore is provided by the availability of private land within the community for the placement and maintenance of signs, albeit such signs are subject to some further restrictions hereafter provided. 
(5)  In order to preserve as much as possible the tranquility and beauty of the residential districts of the city it is necessary to limit severely the placement of commercial signs therein (even on privately owned property) and to enact reasonable time, place, and manner restrictions on the placement and maintenance of noncommercial signs therein. 
(b)  No person shall place or maintain any sign within the untraveled portion of the public right-of-way, except for the maintenance of permanent signs which were in place as of July 1, 1985, or except as provided in subsection (c), or as provided in the Uniform Sign Code (sections 9-3 and 9-4 of the Code of Ordinances). 
(c)  No person shall place or maintain any sign anywhere within the public right-of-way except as authorized or required by the city engineer, city police department or city council, or as provided in the Uniform Sign Code (sections 9-3 and 9-4 of the Code of Ordinances). Signs on vehicles shall be disregarded for purposes of this subsection. 
(d)  No person shall place or maintain any sign within that portion of the city zoned residential under the zoning ordinance except: 
(1)  Signage is permitted as allowed in the zoning ordinance. 
(2)  Non-illuminated, non-commercial signs are permitted without numerical limitation. 
(3)  Two (2) "For Rent" signs or two (2) "For Sale" signs or two (2) "For Sale or Rent" signs are permitted in respect to each dwelling unit. 
(4)  For not more than twenty-one (21) days a year (which may be non-consecutive), one (1) sign per single family dwelling is permitted advertising a "garage sale" or "yard sale" which is being conducted on the same premises on which the sign is located.

(2)  No person shall operate any sound truck for the purpose of communicating noncommercial messages in the city with sound amplifying equipment in operation contrary to the restrictions imposed by Article VI of Chapter 23 pertaining to noises. Provided that, however, sound amplifying equipment shall not be in operation at all between the hours of 9:00 p.m. and 7:00 a.m. the following morning.

(4)  The application for a permit and the acceptance thereof shall be considered as giving rise to an implied agreement on the part of the permittee that he will indemnify the city against all claims and damages, including the costs of defense arising out of the permittee's self-fueling operations, which implied agreement shall survive any revocation or abandonment of the permit. 
(5)  The permittee shall comply with the requirements of subsection (n) of section 4-21 of the Code of Ordinances. 
(6)  Upon demand, the permittee shall provide the airport manager with proof that he had ownership of or an ownership interest in the aircraft, vehicle or ground equipment which the permittee has fueled or wishes to fuel.

(e)  Upon the receipt by the city council of those reports which by way of ordinance or resolution are required to be submitted to it as part of the application process for a retail alcoholic beverage license the city council shall determine whether the license shall issue or not.

(a)  A licensee under this chapter shall enjoy a defeasible property right in the license.

Subject to that reservation of rights in the city, the licensee may sell, pledge, grant or retain a security interest in, give away in a will, or otherwise deal with the license. 
(b)  No transaction affecting a license, including a transfer (whether full or partial), lease, grant or retention of a security interest, or other change in its status, operation, or form (hereafter a "license amendment"), is binding on the city until application for the license amendment has been filed by the licensee or other interested person with the city clerk and approved by the city council. However, as provided hereafter, the chief of police has the power to approve a license amendment for a temporary period of time, and if the chief does so it has the same force and effect as an approval by the city council during such temporary period of time. 
(c)  The license amendment application shall include the information required in section 5-18 and a detailed description of any consideration received in exchange for the license transfer. 
(d)  Before being submitted to the city council for its decision thereon, a license amendment application shall be forwarded to the chief of police for such investigation and such recommendation to the council concerning its merits as the chief believes is warranted or advisable under the circumstances. Moreover, if the license amendment application relates to the physical characteristics of the licensed premises it shall likewise be forwarded to the building official for the same purpose. 
(e)  The chief of police shall have the authority to approve a license amendment application for a period of time not to exceed forty (40) consecutive days upon a showing satisfactory to the chief of pressing circumstances requiring action before the city council can take under consideration and act upon a license amendment application in the ordinary course of its business, as when, for example, a licensee dies or a secured party or lien holder forecloses on its security interest in a license. However, the chief or the council itself may revoke or suspend provisional approval given under this subsection, provided that reasonable notice of such contemplated action is first provided to the affected party or parties. 
(f)  In the absence of provisional or final approval of a transfer as provided for in subsections (b) and (e), no person other than the named licensee may rely on the grant of the license as a defense to prosecution or a civil action brought under this chapter or otherwise provided in law for an offense or cause of action involving the sale of alcoholic beverages without a license. 
(g)  No license amendment application may be acted upon until the applicant has paid a non-refundable application-review fee of two hundred fifty dollars ($250.00). 
(Ord. No. 5372, § 1)

(b)  No license shall be suspended or revoked without providing the licensee with notice and an opportunity for hearing before the city council with regard to the suspension or revocation of the license. The city clerk shall provide the licensee with written notice of the date, time, and place of the hearing. The notice shall inform the licensee that its license may be suspended or revoked and it shall set forth the factual allegations which form the basis for doing so under this section. The city clerk may provide notice by mailing a copy thereof to the licensee's last known address as indicated in the licensee's most recent application filed with the clerk under this chapter. The notice must be mailed at least five (5) days prior to the hearing, exclusive of the date of mailing and date of the hearing. 
(c)  If the licensee does not appear at the hearing provided for in subsection (b), or if he does not dispute them, the factual allegations in the complaint shall be deemed to be admitted. Otherwise the city shall have the burden of going forward with the evidence and the burden of persuasion as to any disputed issues of fact. 
(d)  If the licensee requests that the originally scheduled hearing date be continued the city council shall grant a continuance to a time mutually convenient to the licensee and the city council, but the city council shall have the discretion to suspend the license from the date for which the hearing was originally scheduled to the date of the continued hearing. 
(e)  The decision of the city council shall be final for purposes of the legal doctrine which requires the exhaustion of administrative remedies as a prerequisite for judicial review. 
(f)  The Minot Police Department will be responsible for conducting compliance checks to determine whether the licensees are in compliance with the provisions of subsection (a)(1). If (1) the licensee admits a violation occurred, (2) fails to appear at the scheduled hearing relating to the alleged violation, or (3) the city council determines a violation under subsection (a)(1) occurred after a hearing, the licensee is subject to the following penalties, in addition to any other civil or criminal penalties a licensee may be subject to for violation of any provision of state or local law: 
First violation: Letter of warning 
Second violation: Business closed for three (3) consecutive days 
Third violation: Business closed for seven (7) consecutive days 
Fourth violation: Business closed for thirty (30) consecutive days 
Fifth violation: Business liquor license recommended to be revoked 
    The penalties described above shall be for violations that occur within a period of twenty-four (24) months. The twenty-four-month time period commences to run and is calculated from the first offense by the licensee. 
(g)  The Minot Police Department will be responsible for monitoring compliance with the provisions of subsections (a)(2)-(6). If (1) the licensee admits a violation occurred, (2) fails to appear at the scheduled hearing relating to the alleged violation, or (3) the city council determines a violation under subsections (a)(2)-(6) occurred after a hearing, the licensee is subject to suspension or revocation, as determined by the city council, in addition to any other civil or criminal penalties a licensee may be subject to for a violation of subsections (a)(2)-(6). 
(Ord. No. 5372, § 1) 
Sec. 5-33. - No refund of fee when license is revoked. 
    When a license issued pursuant to this article is terminated or revoked for cause, the licensee or those claiming under him, shall not be entitled to any return of any portion of the license fee previously paid to the city. 
(Ord. No. 5372, § 1) 
Sec. 5-34. - No license to be issued until five years after revocation. 
    Where a license for any premises licensed pursuant to this article has been revoked, no license shall thereafter be issued to the licensee for a period of five (5) years after revocation. 
(Ord. No. 5372, § 1) 
Sec. 5-35. - Exceptions to the limitations as to the number of licenses. 
(a)  If because of a growth in the population of the city or because of the revocation or voluntary surrender of a license, or because any of the numerical limitation formulas under section 5-16 are amended, there becomes available for issuance a license under the authority of this chapter, and if it appears to the city council that it is reasonably likely that more than one (1) person might be interested in obtaining the license, given the then current market demand in the city for licenses of that type, the city shall advertise the availability of the license for a reasonable period of time and shall auction the license off openly or through sealed written bids to the highest bidder. However the successful bidder must qualify under section 5-18 in order to obtain a license. If more than one (1) license of a particular class has been available for issuance consistent with the numerical limitations under section 5-16 for a period of three (3) months without an application having been made for a license of that class, there shall arise a rebuttable presumption that the market demand for licenses of that class does not exceed the number of licenses of that class available for issuance. 
(b)  A license shall authorize the carrying on of activity pursuant to its authority only with regard to licensed premises at one (1) particular location except to the extent allowed under section 5-18. However, this subsection shall not be construed as prohibiting the periodic expansion and contraction of licensed premises at a particular location as the occasion demands, such as when, for example, a motel licensee dispenses alcoholic beverages at a public assembly room within the motel during a convention or other special activity, when otherwise such room is not ordinarily used for the service or consumption of alcoholic beverages. 
(c)  When the city annexes territory which contains an establishment which was licensed by the county to sell alcoholic beverages at retail immediately prior to the annexation, the city will issue to its owner a city license to sell alcoholic beverages, without regard to subsection (a) and even though one (1) of the numerical limitations on licensed imposed by section 5-16 is exceeded, or a prior condition or excess licenses under that section is aggravated as a result of the issuance of the license under this section. Unless the city council lays down a special rule at the time of annexation whereby the new city license shall carry the same restrictions and terms as the old county license, the new city license issued under this subsection shall be as similar to the prior county license as may be obtained under the then existing categories of city licenses. A license issued under this subsection shall thereafter be counted as one (1) of the licenses subject to the numerical limitation imposed by section 5-16, so that, for example, if the issuance of a license under this subsection causes one (1) of the numerical limitations imposed by section 5-16 to be exceeded, the license issued under this subsection will be counted against future population growth in determining when an additional license is available for issuance under the formula set forth in section 5-16. It is the intent to this subsection that no county licensee shall lose a license to sell alcoholic beverages simply because the licensee is annexed to the city, but that city licenses which have county license ancestors over a period of time shall be treated the same as all other licenses for purposes of section 5-16 numerical limitations. This subsection shall apply retroactively as well as prospectively, except that as a one-time exception it shall not be construed to bar the issuance of any additional licenses which became available under section 5-16 after January 1, 1990, and before January 1, 1992, under the ordinance then in effect. 
Sec. 5-36. - Reserved. 
Sec. 5-37. - Adequate parking. 
    At the time of erection, conversion or expansion of a structure to be used for a retail liquor or beer business, there shall be provided and thereafter maintained off-street parking facilities to accommodate the motor vehicles used by the occupants, customers, clientele and employees of said retail business. Such off-street parking spaces shall be used exclusively for off-street parking purposes.

(Ord. No. 2419, § 4; Ord. No. 4973, § 1) 
Sec. 9-12. - Notice of violation; enforcement; administrative search warrants. 
(a)  If the building official discovers a dangerous condition or dangerous building he shall promptly serve a notice of violation upon the owner thereof and the person in charge thereof. Service may be by any means reasonably calculated to provide the person sought to be served with actual notice and may include personal service, service by mail with return receipt requested, or service by publication. If the current address or whereabouts of an appropriate party for purpose of service cannot be found, then the building official need only mail a copy of the notice of violation to the owner's last known address as indicated by the records of the Ward County treasurer or Ward County register of deeds. 
(b)  The notice of violation shall contain the following: 
(1)  The street address and legal description of the premises whereupon the dangerous condition or dangerous building is alleged to exist; 
(2)  The name and last known address of the owner or person in charge of the building or dangerous condition, or both; 
(3)  A description of the dangerous condition or dangerous building expressed in terms substantially similar to those used in section 9-11 (and with an appropriate reference to this article); 
(4)  Whether or not immediate vacation of the building is being ordered; 
(5)  The remedial action which the building official is ordering to be taken by the owner or other person in charge of the building in question so that the dangerous condition or dangerous building will no longer exist; 
(6)  The date by which the remedial action required must be accomplished; 
(7)  A brief explanation of the city's rights under section 9-13 if the appropriate remedial work is not performed and of the owner's rights to demolish the building in lieu of performing the work;

(9)  The date and signature of the building official; and 
(10)  The name and address of the person to whom the notice is directed. 
(c)  Absent emergency circumstances, the building official shall make reasonable efforts to obtain consent from the owner or other person in possession of or in charge of a property before entering a building, structure or area enclosed with a secure fence or other barrier for the purpose of inspecting the property as may be required to enforce this ordinance. If there is not an emergency and consent is denied, the building official shall seek an administrative search warrant under Chapter 29-29.1, N.D.C.C., in order to conduct the inspection. 
(1)  If emergency circumstances exist under which prior application for an administrative search warrant is not feasible without imminent danger to health, welfare or safety of occupants, visitors or the general public, the building official or other city officials may enter the building, structure or enclosed area without consent or a warrant to inspect and verify the nature, severity, and extent of the violation and to abate such conditions giving rise to the imminent danger. 
(2)  Service and execution of an administrative search warrant shall be as provided in Chapter 29-29.1, N.D.C.C., provided, however, if the premises appear to be unoccupied or abandoned and the owner or other person in possession or in charge of the property is unknown or not readily available, the building official and other city officials may enter the building, structure or other premises for the purpose of executing an administrative search warrant without prior service on the owner or person in possession of or in charge of the property. In such cases, the building official shall mail copies of the administrative search warrant, affidavit and return filed with the court to the owner of record at the owner's last known address. 
(3)  This section is adopted pursuant to the City of Minot's Home Rule Charter. To the extent any provision in this section conflicts with Chapter 29-29.1, N.D.C.C., or other state law, such provision in this section shall supersede any state law in conflict with the section. 
(Ord. No. 2419, § 4; Ord. No. 5009, § 1) 
Editor's note- Section 1 of Ord. No. 5009, adopted Sept. 8, 2015, changed the title of § 9-12 from "Notice of violation; enforcement" to read as herein set out. 
Sec. 9-13. - Remedial work; standards for repair, vacation, or demolition; vacation of dangerous building. 
(a)  Upon the discovery of a dangerous building or dangerous condition the building official shall enter a written order setting forth the minimum remedial work required to eliminate the danger. Such remedial work may include one (1) or more of the following and may be stated in the alternative: 
(1)  Repair by reconstruction or replacement; 
(2)  Additional protective construction, including, for example, boarding up windows, doors or floor openings or the construction of braces, buttresses, and additional support members or elements; 
(3)  Fumigation or pest eradication; or 
(4)  Demolition in whole or in part. 
(b)  The following standards apply to determinations regarding required remedial work for a dangerous building or dangerous condition: 
(1)  If the building can reasonably be repaired to eliminate the violation or violations, repair shall be ordered; 
(2)  If the building is in such condition that in the opinion of the building official no one (1) or combination of other remedies is adequate to eliminate violations and protect occupants, visitors and the public, demolition shall be ordered; and 
(3)  If the building is sixty (60) per cent or more damaged, decayed or deteriorated from its former value or structure it may be presumed that the building may not reasonably be repaired and the building official may order demolition. 
(c)  The order for remedial work shall specify a reasonable period of time, not to exceed ninety (90) days, in which the work must be accomplished. 
(d)  The owner or a person in charge of the dangerous building shall have the right to demolish the building in lieu of performing the required remedial work, but the demolition must be accomplished in accordance with the building code within the time period specified for the completion of the remedial work. 
(e)  If the building official determines that the dangerous building or dangerous condition presents an immediate and substantial danger to the health or safety of the public in general or to the persons using the building in particular he may order the immediate vacation of any part of or of all of the building. The order shall remain in effect until the remedial work required has been accomplished and the building official so certifies after an inspection of the building. It shall be unlawful for any person having knowledge of the vacancy order to knowingly disregard it except in the course of performing remedial work or enforcing this article. 
(f)  The building official may allow the minimum remedial work required to rectify a dangerous building or dangerous condition to be performed without at the same time requiring that the entire building be made to conform with current code requirements (meaning thereby all applicable codes in addition to the building code, such as, for example, the fire code, the plumbing code, the electrical code, etc., if: 
(1)  The remedial work alone will leave the building in an essentially safe condition notwithstanding the continued existence of technical code violations; and 
(2)  The additional cost of bringing the building up to code is not reasonably likely to be reflected to any substantial extent in an increase in the value of the building attributable to bringing the building up to code. 
(Ord. No. 2419, § 4; Ord. No. 4973, § 2) 
Editor's note- Section 2 of Ord. No. 4973, adopted June 1, 2015, changed the title of § 9-13 from "Remedial work; demolition in lieu thereof; vacation of dangerous building" to read as herein set out. 
Sec. 9-14. - Disregarding notice of violation. 
(a)  If the owner or person in charge of a dangerous building or dangerous condition neglects or refuses to accomplish the required remedial work within the time specified in the notice of violation, or if service of a notice of violation has been made by mail as permitted herein and the mailing is returned without being delivered or claimed, then the city shall have a right of entry upon the premises in question in order that its agents, employees or contractors may undertake necessary remedial work or demolition. 
(b)  The city shall solicit bids for the required remedial work or demolition in a manner reasonably designed to produce a fair contract price and full competition among prospective bidders. A contractual provision to withhold all payments until the completion of the contract may be used in lieu of requiring a contract bond. The contract shall be awarded to the lowest and best bidder. The solicitation for bids may provide that specific remedial work will be performed or in the alternative that the building be demolished, even though the original order entered by the building official may not have required demolition. 
(c)  After performance of the contract, the cost of the remedial work or demolition performed under the contract shall be confirmed at a hearing held by the city council for that purpose. Once confirmed the cost shall be certified by the city auditor to the county auditor for collection as a special assessment against the property in question. 
(d)  The owner or person in charge of the dangerous building or building in which is found a dangerous condition shall be given reasonable notice of the city council meeting at which bids are considered and at which the hearing is held to confirm the special assessment provided for herein, unless the notice of violation has been mailed as provided for herein and returned undelivered or unclaimed. 
(e)  The willful refusal to perform or to arrange the performance of remedial work by a person having the right to do so shall be an unlawful act punishable as provided in section 1-8 of the Code of Ordinances. Moreover the city may bring appropriate judicial proceedings to enforce the dangerous building article of the Code of Ordinances, notwithstanding the availability or use of the sanctions provided for in section 1-8. 
(Ord. No. 2419, § 4) 
Sec. 9-15. - Posting notices. 
(a)  The building official may post a suitable notice or notices on the dangerous building or the building wherein is found a dangerous condition: 
(1)  As part of making service of any notice of violation; 
(2)  In order to warn of dangers presented by the condition of the building; or 
(3)  In order to advise that the building must remain vacant until it is made safe or demolished. 
(b)  If the building official posts a notice pursuant to this section it is unlawful to remove the notice without prior approval of the building official and the notice shall conspicuously so state. 
(Ord. No. 2419, § 4) 
Sec. 9-16. - Appeals. 
    Notwithstanding section 9-2, an appeal from an order of the building official under section 9-13 shall be held according to the following procedures: 
(1)  An owner or owner's representative who receives an order under section 9-13 may appeal. The owner or owner's representative shall file a written notice of appeal with the city inspection department within ten (10) days of service or receipt of the order. 
(2)  Filing a timely notice of appeal automatically stays the order for thirty (30) days, provided an order requiring immediate vacation of the building shall remain in effect pending the appeal hearing. 
(3)  A hearing on the appeal shall take place within thirty (30) days of the filing of the notice of appeal, at the next regular meeting of the city council following the appeal or at a special meeting called by the mayor, unless the city and owner or owner's representative agree to postpone the hearing and stay of the order to a later date. 
(4)  At the hearing, city officials shall first present evidence, including testimony or documentary evidence, in support of the order and the owner or owner's representative shall then present evidence regarding objections to the order or why the order should not be enforced. Each party shall have an opportunity to make a closing statement. The mayor may establish reasonable limits on time allowed for each party. Upon conclusion of the hearing, the city council may, based on evidence presented at the hearing, decide to affirm, modify or reverse the order. 
(Ord. No. 2419, § 4; Ord. No. 4910, § 1) 
Sec. 9-17. - Rights cumulative. 
    The rights asserted by the city under this article of chapter 9 shall be considered to be cumulative to and not in derogation of the rights asserted under other provisions of the Code of Ordinances, such as, for example, chapter 13 pertaining in part to the fire code, chapter 16 pertaining to the health and sanitation code, or chapter 22 pertaining to nuisances. 
(Ord. No. 2419, § 4; Ord. No. 2455, § 8) 
Sec. 9-18. - No personal liability. 
    To the extent permitted under state law including home rule powers, the city, its officials, employees, agents and contractors assume no liability arising out of the execution of the provisions of this article including by way of example and not by way of limitation: 
(1)  Liability premised on the concept that the city should have discovered and rectified a dangerous building or dangerous condition; or 
(2)  Liability premised on the concept that the city erroneously and negligently certified that an unsafe building or unsafe condition had been rectified when in fact is has not; or 
(3)  Liability premised upon the concept that the city erroneously accomplished the demolition of a building on the grounds that it was dangerous when in fact it was not.

Secs. 9-19-9-44. - Reserved. 
ARTICLE III. - MOVING BUILDINGS 
DIVISION 1. - GENERALLY 

Sec. 9-45. - Buildings exempt from this article; certain moves of manufactured homes included. 
    This article shall not apply to yard-built and factory-built buildings that have not been previously used. Yard-built and factory-built buildings shall be subject to the same requirements for permits, inspections and code as site-built buildings. Nor shall this article apply to a manufactured home (as "manufactured home" is defined in the zoning ordinance), (1) if the manufactured home is being moved into a zoning district where it may be placed as a matter of right, that is, without regard to whether it is an "'R' District Excluded Manufactured Home" (as that term is defined in item number 75.1 of Section 2-1 of the zoning ordinance), or (2) if the manufactured home is being moved from the city's zoning jurisdiction (including its extraterritorial jurisdiction) to a place outside the jurisdiction. Otherwise, moving a manufactured home is governed by this article, and in such a case the term "building" will be deemed to include the manufactured home. 
(Rev. Gen. Ords. 1962, § 9-1612; Ord. No. 1716, § 1; Ord. No. 3069, § 1; Ord. No. 3463, § 6) 
Sec. 9-46. - Moving permit required; payment of taxes, special assessments required. 
(a)  No person shall move any building into, from or within the city and its extraterritorial zoning area without first obtaining a moving permit from the city council or the city engineer pursuant to section 9-47 of this article. The provisions of the article shall supersede any conflicting provisions in the Uniform Building Code, which is adopted by reference in section 9-1 and amended in section 9-2. 
(b)  No person shall remove any building within the city until after the taxes and special assessments then due against the building and the land upon which it sits have been paid, nor until the owner shall have paid into the appropriate sinking funds of the city for the retirement of any bonded indebtedness of the city an amount equal to the just share of the taxes which would then be required against the building and the underlying property to pay its share of the unfunded indebtedness of the funds, calculated on the basis of its taxable value compared to the taxable value of all taxable properties within the city. This section shall not apply where a building is removed to permit the erection or installation of improvements equal or greater in value than the building removed. No moving permit shall be issued until provision for the payments called for by this subsection shall first have been made. 
(Ord. No. 1805, § 1; Ord. No. 3002, § 1; Ord. No. 3069, § 1) 
Sec. 9-47. - Application for moving permit. 
(a)  An application for a moving permit shall be made to the city building official. The official shall inspect the building proposed to be moved and shall certify either that it meets current code requirements (meaning thereby, the building code and other applicable codes, such as the fire code, electrical code, the plumbing code, etc,), or if he can not so certify, he shall itemize the work required to bring the building up to code. However, if the building to which the application pertains is a manufactured home, then the building official need not certify such code compliance (or lack of code compliance) with respect to those matters concerning which local regulation is superseded by federal law. 
(b)  The city assessor shall inspect and establish a valuation on the building and if, in his opinion, the building's market value is at least sixty (60) per cent of its replacement cost, he shall so certify. 
(c)  If the building is to be moved to a district within the zoning jurisdiction of the city which has been zoned as a residential district, the assessor shall certify that the building is compatible with the buildings in the vicinity of the location to which it is proposed to be moved, and if he cannot so certify, he shall require the applicant to submit a plan for the remodeling of the exterior of the building (once it has been moved) to make it compatible. The adequacy and suitability of such plan will be considered by the city council at the public hearing on the application provided for hereafter. 
(d)  If a manufactured home is to be moved to a district within the zoning jurisdiction of the city, which has been zoned as a residential district (and if such move is not exempted from this article under section 9-45), then the building official must certify that the manufactured home is not an "'R' District Excluded Manufactured Home" under any of the objective criteria stated in item 75.1 of section 2-1 of the zoning ordinance in order for the application to be considered further. If such certification is in fact made, then the city council will determine as part of the public hearing process provided for hereafter whether the manufactured home which is the subject of the hearing is an excluded manufactured home under the subjective "appearance" criterion stated therein. 
(e)  If the application is for a permit to move- 
(1)  A building to a site within the zoning jurisdiction of the city which is zoned as a residential district or 
(2)  A manufactured home to a site within the zoning jurisdiction of the city which is zoned as a commercial district where it is to be used as a residence, 
then the application will be acted upon by the city council, but otherwise by the city engineer. 
(f)  Once such information, plans, and certifications as may be required by subsections (a) through (d) have been assembled, the city shall cause a notice of public hearing on the application to be published, if the application is to be acted upon by the city council. The notice shall indicate the date, time and place of the hearing, give the legal description (and when convenient, the street address) of the sites to which and from which it is proposed to move the building, describe the building, identify the parties making the application, and provide the title and telephone number of the city official from whom further information concerning the application is available. The notice shall be published on three (3) separate days in the official newspaper, with the first publication not more than fifteen (15) days before the date of the public hearing, and with the third publication not less than two (2) days before the public hearing, in each instance the time being computed exclusive of the day of publication and day of the public hearing. Also, not later than the date of the first publication, the same notice shall be sent by certified mail, return receipt requested, to the owners of all property located within one hundred fifty (150) feet (exclusive of streets, alleys, and city-owned property) of the property to which it is proposed that the building be moved. The applicant must pay the cost of postage of such mailing prior to the third publication of the notice or else the application shall not be considered further. 
(g)  If the application is to be acted upon by the city engineer, and the building is to be moved to a site within the zoning jurisdiction of the city, he shall grant it if the city assessor has certified that the building's market value equals at least sixty (60) per cent of its replacement cost, and if the city building official has certified that the building meets the requirements of the current codes. Otherwise, in the absence of the required certification by the city building official, the city engineer shall issue the moving permit only on the condition (which shall be implied if the permit fails to so state explicitly), that the necessary work (as itemized by the building official pursuant to subsection (a)), will be undertaken and completed by the applicant in a timely fashion. 
(h)  If the application is acted upon by the city council, it can deny the permit, grant it unconditionally, or grant it subject to such conditions as it deems appropriate (such as, for example, a condition that the applicant agree to specified modifications in the plan of exterior remodeling provided for in subsection (c)). 
(i)  Even if a moving permit issued by the city council is silent on the subject, and thus appears facially to be granted unconditionally, nevertheless, if the city building official, pursuant to subsection (a), has itemized work required to bring the building into code compliance, then the grant of the moving permit by the city council shall be deemed to include the implied condition that the applicant will undertake and complete such work in a timely fashion. Moreover, if at the public hearing the city council has approved a plan of exterior remodeling (which plan was submitted to the council pursuant to subsection (c)), the grant of the permit shall be subject to the condition (which shall be implied if permit fails to so state expressly), that the remodeling indicated in the plan will be undertaken and completed by the applicant in a timely fashion. 
(j)  In addition to the foregoing provisions for both implied and express conditions to attach to the issuance of a moving permit, if the permit relates to a manufactured home, then the permit shall be deemed conditioned upon the following conditions (which shall be implied if the permit fails expressly to so state): 
(1)  Upon completion of the move the manufactured home shall have promptly removed therefrom any wheels, hitch, steel framing, transporting lights, or feature or elements required for transport. 
(2)  Promptly thereafter, the manufactured home will be placed on a foundation or equivalent support which meets at least the minimum structural integrity and stability requirements called for in the HUD publication, "Guide to Foundation and Support Systems for Manufactured Homes," or the city's building code (whichever is more restrictive). 
(3)  Promptly thereafter, the siding of the manufactured home will be extended downwards to within no less than eight (8) inches of the grade, or, alternatively, the space between the lower horizontal perimeter of the manufactured home and the grade will be filled in with panels designed to simulate the appearance of a basement foundation ordinarily associated with a site-built house, which panels may not be constructed of exposed plywood or particle board, and which may not be of a lattice design.

(Rev. Gen. Ords. 1962, §§ 9-1605, 9-1614; Ord. No. 3069, § 1) 
Sec. 9-51. - Completion bond required. 
    Before any moving permit required by this division is formally issued, the applicant shall furnish to the city a performance bond conditioned upon (1) compliance with this article, and (2) the successful and timely completion of such work as may be required by implied or express conditions (or both implied and express conditions) attached to the permit pursuant to section 9-47. In the absence of an explicit date stated in the authorization for the moving permit, the work must be completed within ten (10) months of the issuance of the permit. The amount of the bond shall be the greater of (1) ten thousand dollars ($10,000.00) or (2) the estimate, made by the city engineer, of the cost of performing the work, the performance of which is secured by the bond. 
(Rev. Gen. Ords. 1962, § 9-1613; Ord. No. 3069, § 1; Ord. No. 3463, § 8; Ord. No. 4972, § 1) 
Sec. 9-52. - Notice to affected owners. 
    The building mover shall notify the owners of overhead wires and other structures that may be affected by the moving of the building that the building will be moved. The notice must be given at least seven (7) days before the moving, the seven (7) days to be calculated exclusive of the day of the notice and the day of the moving. 
(Rev. Gen. Ords. 1962, §§ 9-1607, 9-1608; Ord. No. 3069, § 1, 3-2-92) 
Sec. 9-53. - Lights required when moving at night. 
    When any building is being moved within the public right-of-way, a red light must be kept burning at each corner of the building from sunset to sunrise. All ropes, blocks, winches, windlasses, or other equipment used in the moving of the building must, when obstructing the free use of the public right-of-way, be protected by suitable lights from sunset to sunrise. 
(Rev. Gen. Ords. 1962, § 9-1611; Ord. No. 3069, § 1, 3-2-92) 
Sec. 9-54. - Blocking of streets. 
    No public right-of-way shall be blocked, or public travel delayed, by reason of the moving of a building for more than three (3) hours unless additional time is granted by the city engineer. Each hour in excess of the first three (3) hours in which a public right-of-way is blocked, or in which public travel is delayed, shall constitute a separate offense. 
(Rev. Gen. Ords. 1962, §§ 9-1609, 9-1610; Ord. No. 3069, § 1, 3-2-92) 
Sec. 9-55. - Liability for damages.

Sec. 16-11. - Definitions for the purposes of this article. 
    Approved means approved by the City of Minot Fire Marshal. 
    Hazardous materials and hazardous substances are defined by reference to the definition thereof found in Title 49 of the Code of Federal Regulations at Section 171.8. 
    Reportable quantity with regard to any one (1) particular hazardous material or hazardous substance is the quantity specified in Title 49 of the Code of Federal Regulations at Section 172.101 as the reportable quantity for that material or substance, unless a different reportable quantity is specified by the fire chief, in which case, his specifications shall govern. 
    Responsible party means a person who stores hazardous materials or hazardous substances within the city or the extraterritorial geographical area over which it has chosen to assert its zoning powers if the amount of any particular hazardous material or hazardous substance so stored by such person exceeds the "reportable quantity." In the event a person who would be considered a responsible person under the foregoing definition is only a tenant of the premises where the storage occurs, then the definition of "responsible person" shall include not only the tenant but the lessor as well. 
    Vehicle means a motor vehicle which is licensed to operate on public highways and thoroughfares, or which should be so licensed as a matter of law because it is, in fact, operated on public highways and thoroughfares. 
(Ord. No. 2887, § 1) 
Sec. 16-12. - Regulation of the storage of hazardous materials and hazardous substances. 
    In addition to whatever other restrictions may apply, no responsible person shall store hazardous materials or hazardous substances except in conformance with the following requirements: 
(1)  The responsible person shall maintain on the premises, outside of any building thereon, an approved lockbox wherein the responsible person shall place and maintain a key for the main entrance of the structure wherein the storage occurs. The responsible person shall assure that the fire department is provided with at least one (1) key to the lockbox but shall distribute no other keys to the lockbox to other persons nor retain any other keys to the lockbox. If it is necessary to open other locks on the premises to get to the storage site as, for example, a locked gate in a security fence, then the same requirements shall apply to those locks as well. The responsible person may equip additional entrances to the structure with a lockbox in the manner just described if the responsible person so wishes. 
(2)  The responsible person shall not allow any vehicle to enter into or remain within any structure on the premises, which structure is used to store hazardous materials or hazardous substances, except: 
a.  If the entire structure has an approved automatic fire suppression system and an approved central dispatch, automatic fire alarm; then a vehicle can be within the structure while hazardous materials or hazardous substances are being unloaded from the vehicle or being loaded unto the vehicle; or 
b.  If the structure contains a portion thereof which is separated from the balance of the structure by walls and a ceiling which are so constructed as to be fire-rated at two (2) hours under the provisions of the Uniform Building Code, and if the portion is not itself used for the storage of hazardous materials or hazardous substances, then the portion can be used for the loading of hazardous materials and hazardous substances to a vehicle or from a vehicle, and it can be used for the storage of vehicles without regard to whether they are being currently loaded or unloaded.

ARTICLE III. - SUPERFUND INSTITUTIONAL CONTROLS 

Sec. 16-50. - Legislative purpose. 
    The city is a party to an action brought by the United States of America acting on behalf of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act, 42 U.S.C. Section 9601 et seq. (Superfund). By means of a consent decree, the city was ordered and agreed to perform certain cleanup and remedial work at the Old Minot Landfill Superfund Site (site), an old sanitary landfill which the city operated until the late 1960's or early 1970's. As part of its commitments in the consent decree, the city agreed to implement the cleanup measures selected in the EPA's record of decision (ROD), issued on June 21, 1993. The ROD was subsequently modified by an April 10, 1996, explanation of significant differences (ESD). 
    The ROD and the ESD require the city to adopt local land use restrictions and controls designed to prevent the disturbance of the cleanup or recontamination of the site. These land use restrictions are called "institutional controls." The "institutional controls" for this site place restrictions upon activities that would damage the clay and soil cap which the city will place over the landfill and upon the installation of groundwater supply wells within or in the immediate vicinity of the site. 
(Ord. No. 3406, § 1) 
Sec. 16-51. - No-entry premises-Restrictions upon certain activities. 
(a)  Except as approved by the director of public works, no person may enter upon, by vehicle or by foot, the property herein defined as "no-entry premises." The director of public works shall limit his/her approval to enter the "no-entry premises" to those persons who are performing clean-up or remedial action work, including inspection and monitoring activities, required under the consent decree referenced in section 16-50. Additionally, the director of public works shall grant permission for the relocation of the Minot Fire Department Training Grounds to the area identified as Block 8 (Edgeview Estates First Addition: Block 8) of the Old Minot Landfill Superfund Site for purposes of relocating the Minot Fire Department Training Grounds at said location and also authorizing subsequent access to this facility for the future conducting of firefighting training exercises under the direct supervision and authority of the City of Minot Fire Department. These firefighting exercises shall involve various training evolutions and shall be conducted with the equipment and structures placed upon Block 8 with the specific requirement that all firefighting activities will occur on those portions of Block 8 which are designated as undisturbed grounds or areas where no waste has been previously disposed of or deposited. 
(b)  No person may install groundwater supply wells or undertake any subsurface boring, i.e., geotechnical boring, on any property herein defined as the no-entry premises or within one hundred fifty (150) feet of the no-entry premises. However, pursuant to the authorization granted in subsection (a) above, the City of Minot shall be authorized to place and install water lines, sewer lines, and/or storm sewer services or lines as necessary or required for the relocation, operation, and maintenance of the Minot Fire Department Training Grounds on Block 8 of the Old Minot Landfill Superfund Site. These water, sewer, or storm sewer lines shall also be located on undisturbed grounds or areas where no waste has been previously disposed of or deposited.

(Ord. No. 3406, § 1; Ord. No. 3457) 
Sec. 16-53. - Savings clause. 
    The city is imposing the restrictions provided for in this article under the powers of its Home Rule Charter, and particularly the police power of the State of North Dakota as invoked by or through that Charter, and the constitutional and statutory provisions attendant to the Charter. In the opinion of the city, such power is adequate to authorize the city to impose these restrictions without accomplishing a "taking" under either the federal or state constitutions, and, for that reason, the city is not obligated to pay compensation to any private property owner who may be adversely affected by such restrictions. Nevertheless, in the event a court of competent jurisdiction holds otherwise, and is sustained upon appeal (if any), it is the intention of the city that, rather than these restrictions being invalidated, it instead be allowed to pay a fair and just compensation for whatever compensable damages as may be suffered by private property owners who are adversely affected by these restrictions. In other words, the city would prefer to settle an "inverse condemnation" claim, or to have such claim adjudicated by the courts, instead of allowing the restrictions to be invalidated because they accomplish an uncompensated taking forbidden by law. 
(Ord. No. 3406, § 1) 
ARTICLE IV. - SMOKING IN PUBLIC PLACES AND PLACES OF EMPLOYMENT

An employee who works in a setting where an employer allows smoking does not waive or surrender any legal rights the employee may have against the employer or any other party. Violations of this subsection shall be punishable in accordance with section 1-8 of the Minot Code of Ordinances. 
(g)  This section may not be interpreted or construed to permit smoking where it is otherwise restricted by other applicable laws.

The refusal of a person to stop smoking or leave the premises in response to requests made under this section by an owner, operator, manager, or employee shall not constitute a violation of this article by the owner, operator, manager or employee. 
(Ord. No. 5017, § 1) 
Sec. 16-57. - Penalty. 
(a)  An individual who smokes in an area in which smoking is prohibited under section 16-55 is guilty of an infraction punishable by a fine not exceeding fifty dollars ($50.00). 
(b)  Except as otherwise provided in subsection (f) of section 16-55, an owner or other person with general supervisory responsibility over a public place or place of employment who willfully fails to comply with section 16-55 is guilty of an infraction, subject to a fine not to exceed one hundred dollars ($100.00)for the first violation, to a fine not to exceed two hundred dollars ($200.00)for a second violation within one (1) year, and a fine not to exceed five hundred dollars ($500.00) for each additional violation within one (1) year of the preceding violation.

    Every person holding a license as issued by the city shall conduct his business in a quiet and orderly manner, and shall observe and conform to, and obey the laws of the state and the provisions of this Code. 
(Rev. Gen. Ords. 1962, § 9-0108) 
Sec. 18-2. - Suspension or revocation of certain occupational licenses; procedure. 
(a)  A license issued under chapters 12, 15, 17 or 26 may be suspended or revoked if the license: 
(1)  Fails to comply with the requirements of the chapter under which the license was issued; 
(2)  Fails to correct defective work which creates a condition which is dangerous to public health, welfare and safety; or 
(3)  Fails systematically to resolve valid customer complaints to the reasonable satisfaction of such customers. 
(b)  As used in this section, the term "board" refers to the HVAC board for purposes of a license issued pursuant to chapters 15 and 17; the electrical board for purposes of a license issued under chapter 12; and the plumbing board for purposes of a license issued under chapter 26. 
(c)  In order to effect suspension or revocation of a licensee, the city engineer shall: 
(1)  Notify the board of the claimed basis for action under subsection (a) and whether he is seeking suspension or revocation of the license; and 
(2)  Provide the same notice to the licensee. 
(d)  If the notice provided for in subsection (c) indicates the city engineer is seeking revocation of the license to which it relates, such license shall be suspended from the date of receipt of the notice by the licensee until and unless the board orders otherwise.The board, upon receipt of the notice as provided for in subsection (c) (1), shall fix a hearing date. In the event the city engineer has requested revocation of the license, the hearing shall be no less than three (3) nor more than five (5) days from the date of such notice, Saturday, Sunday, and holidays excluded. The board shall cause notice of the hearing to be served upon the licensee. The licensee may request a later hearing date than that scheduled by the board, but if the licensee's license is suspended by virtue of the fact that the city engineer is seeking revocation thereof, the suspension shall remain in effect until the hearing. 
(e)  At such hearing, the board shall serve as a fact-finding board. The licensee may appear before it in person or by counsel, or both. The board shall issue a written order at the close of the hearing, or a reasonable time thereafter, which shall be an order of immediate reinstatement, an order imposing a further period of suspension, or an order of revocation. Any such order may be made subject to such conditions and limitations, if any, which the board deems appropriate under the circumstances. As soon as reasonably convenient, but not later than the fifth business day following the day of the hearing (excluding from such computation the day of the hearing itself), the board shall issue a written explanation as to its basis for taking the action which it took. 
(f)  If the licensee is dissatisfied with the action taken by the board, he may appeal its decision to the city manager by written notice of appeal filed within ten (10) business days of the hearing conducted by the board (excluding from such computation the day of the hearing itself). The city manager shall hear such appeal with reasonable dispatch. The review conducted by the city manager shall be restricted to a consideration of the board's written explanation provided for in subsection (d), and such written and oral argument as the licensee may choose to make. No evidence shall be presented, and the city manager may nullify or modify the decision of the board only if he is convinced it abused its discretion or committed plain error. 
(g)  If the licensee is dissatisfied with the action taken by the board, he may resort to the remedies provided by law for the judicial review and supervision of decisions made by city officials. The appeal to the city manager shall be deemed to constitute an exhaustion of the licensee's administrative remedies for the purpose of the doctrine of law which requires such exhaustion as a precondition to the availability of judicial review. As no provision is made for an administrative record, the city agrees that it has to establish de nova in court the basis for and reasonableness of its action, and it reserves the right to do so.

DIVISION 2. - MIGRANT MERCHANTS AND CONTRIBUTION SOLICITORS[2] 

Footnotes: 
--- (2) --- 
Editor's note- Ord. No. 2545, §§ 1, 2, adopted Feb. 7, 1983, repealed former Div. 2, §§ 18-48-18-60, relative to solicitors and canvassers, derived from Rev. Gen. Ords. 1962, §§ 7-0804, 9-0301-9-0311, and enacted in lieu thereof a new Div. 2 as herein set out. 

Sec. 18-48. - Definitions. 
    As used in this division the following words have the following definitions or meanings unless the context clearly indicates otherwise: 
    Contribution solicitor: A person, other than a migrant merchant, who goes from door to door within the City of Minot in order to request of another person that such other person transfer money or something else of value to him or the organization which he represents. 
    Course or pattern of conduct: A regularly carried on activity which may be part-time or which may be seasonal, as distinguished from isolated and infrequent transactions occurring only two (2) or three (3) times a year. 
    Drummer: A person who as a part of a course or pattern of conduct solicits orders for goods or services from the ultimate consumer thereof or a person in the household of the ultimate consumer, but which person does not himself or through an agent deliver the goods or perform the services which may be ordered, and which person does not ordinarily operate out of a fixed place of business within the City of Minot while soliciting orders. 
    Fixed place of business: Physical premises used in the course of conducting a retail sales business, to which premises the general public is invited for the purpose of examining and purchasing the stock of goods held for sale, and at which premises the delivery of the purchased goods to the buyer takes place. 
    Migrant merchant: Drummers, peddlers or temporary shopkeepers. 
    Peddler: A person who as part of a course or pattern of conduct solicits orders for goods or services from the ultimate consumer thereof or a person in the household of the ultimate consumer, which person himself or through an agent delivers the goods or performs the services for which he obtains orders, and which person does not ordinarily operate out of a fixed place of business within the City of Minot while soliciting orders. 
    Temporary shopkeeper: A person who solicits orders for goods or services from the ultimate consumer thereof or a person in the household of the ultimate consumer at or out of a fixed place of business within the City of Minot, irrespective of whether he or his agents delivers the goods or performs the services for which orders are placed. However, a person shall not be considered a temporary shopkeeper if at the time that he solicits orders for goods or services at a fixed place of business he has a possessory interest in the physical premises which constitute the fixed place of business, either by way of a fee simple or by way of a leasehold interest therein, which leasehold interest was valid for a minimum term of at least one hundred eighty (180) days at and from the time that the person commenced soliciting orders at the leased premises. 
(Ord. No. 2545, § 2) 
Sec. 18-49. - Legislative findings, purpose and intent. 
(a)  The city council of the City of Minot finds that it is necessary to regulate certain migrant merchants under the police power of the municipality in order to combat criminal activity or to reduce the opportunity for criminal activity to occur and to protect the citizens as consumers. 
(b)  The city council finds that there is a substantial likelihood that certain criminals or persons who might be tempted to perform criminal acts hold themselves out as bona fide drummers or peddlers for the sole purpose of going door to door in order to "case" a residence or business premises with an eye towards using the information so gathered to assist in the perpetration of a criminal act if the opportunity presents itself. The council further finds that whether or not such activity does take place, nevertheless some citizens have a legitimate fear or concern that it may be taking place and that it is appropriate to take reasonable steps to attempt to allay that concern. Finally, the council finds that the citizens of Minot who purchase goods or services from a migrant merchant are at a disadvantage in obtaining recourse from the migrant merchant if the goods or services are not delivered as promised or if the goods or services are not as warranted and represented, because ordinarily the migrant merchant is not physically present in the city for purposes of making a claim against him or initiating a lawsuit against him when the occasion to do so arises, nor is it convenient or easy to locate assets of his subject to the execution of a levy in the event a judgment is obtained against him. 
(c)  Consequently it is the purpose and intent of the council by enacting this division to impose certain identification requirements on those persons acting as migrant merchants on the theory that if a person knows that his identification is known to the police he would be less likely to attempt to use the assumed role of being a drummer or peddler as a means of obtaining information helpful in a criminal enterprise. Likewise, it is the intent and purpose of the council to require that migrant merchants post performance bonds in order to assist dissatisfied consumers in pursuing complaints against such persons arising out of the commercial transactions in which they may engage while within the city. 
(d)  The city council realizes that under the commerce clause of the United States Constitution there exists limitations on the restrictions which lawfully may be imposed on a drummer who represents enterprises doing business in interstate commerce. However, it is the opinion and the finding of the council that the restrictions in this division do not constitute an unreasonable burden upon interstate commerce because they are applicable to both interstate and intrastate commerce and they apply to residents of North Dakota (except those domiciled within the city) and to residents of other states alike in an impartial manner, and because they serve the legitimate governmental interests identified previously. However, it is the special intent of the council that in the event that a court determines that this division is unconstitutional as applied to some or all transactions in interstate commerce that the general severability provisions of section 1-4 be applied in such a manner as to uphold the balance of the division. 
(e)  This division is designed to exclude from its purview those migrant merchants who represent wholesalers, distributors or manufacturers, or the functional equivalent thereof, because the council finds that those persons present less of a problem with respect to the concerns identified above, and because the persons with whom representatives of wholesalers, distributors and manufacturers are likely to deal are more able to and inclined to protect their own interests than is the average consumer. 
(f)  Likewise, the person who has established a bona fide domicile within the City of Minot is excluded from the scope of operation of this division because the council finds that the establishment of one's domicile within the community, in view of its relatively permanent status: 
(1)  Tends to make one's identity known to a number of persons distributed throughout the city, so that the purpose otherwise served by requiring an identification license under this division is thereby accomplished; 
(2)  Tends to offer an impediment to one's removal from the city if one should perpetuate a criminal act, thus enhancing the possibility of the police being able to make a successful arrest; 
(3)  Tends to make it more likely that one will stand behind the goods and services which one sells because the city is relatively small and there exist many social, business, educational, religious, political and neighborhood ties and interconnections among the citizens which make the business reputation of a person in business or trade extremely sensitive to and vulnerable to the complaint of even one disgruntled consumer; and 
(4)  Tends to make it more likely that one's whereabouts will be discoverable in the event that a lawsuit arising out of a business transaction is necessary. 
(g)  Merchants with long-term possessory interests in a fixed place of business within the city are excluded from the operation of this division because it is the finding of the city council that such persons are likely to have made a sizeable investment in their business which means that the chances of such persons being available for service of process with respect to a lawsuit arising out of a business transaction is correspondingly increased, as is the chance that a successful plaintiff can collect a judgement against such persons. 
(h)  The council further finds that contribution solicitors present similar problems to those posed by migrant merchants with regard to the ability of a contribution solicitor to obtain information useful to accomplish or to attempt criminal acts, and that consequently it is appropriate to require contribution solicitors to obtain a license for identification purposes, except for those contribution solicitors who are domiciled within the city, which latter class is exempted from the licensing requirement for substantially the same reasons that support the exemption from licensing of those migrant merchants who are domiciled within the city. 
(Ord. No. 2545, § 2) 
Sec. 18-50. - License required of migrant merchant or contribution solicitor; exceptions. 
(a)  No person who has not established his domicile within the City of Minot shall carry on the business or activity of a migrant merchant or contribution solicitor within the City of Minot without first obtaining a migrant merchant license or contribution solicitor license, respectively. In any prosecution under this chapter it shall be an affirmative defense that the defendant had established his domicile within the City of Minot at the time of the alleged offense. 
(b)  This section shall not apply to a temporary shopkeeper who deals exclusively in agricultural products or secondhand items of tangible personal property. 
(Ord. No. 2545, § 2) 
Sec. 18-51. - Form, terms, effect, and issuance of license for migrant merchants. 
(a)  A person applying for a migrant merchant license or contribution solicitor license shall submit an application on a form provided by the police chief, which form shall include such information as the police chief may reasonably require with respect to the identity and personal history of the applicant. At a minimum the form shall require the applicant to state his name, age, current address, all addresses used by him in the two (2) years immediately prior to the acquisition by him of his current address, phone number, driver's license state of issuance and number, physical description, birth place, other names which the applicant has gone by or used, and whether the applicant has ever been convicted of a felony, and if so, which felonies, where, and the punishment imposed. In addition, the applicant shall provide his fingerprints as part of or in connection with the application. The applicant may answer items of requested information as being not applicable to him if that is the case. The truthfulness of the information supplied by the applicant shall be sworn to by him under oath in writing. 
(b)  The applicant shall accompany the application with a proposed license bearing a current photo, which license and its contents shall conform to the specifications established by the police chief. An applicant for a migrant merchant license shall also pay a nonrefundable fee in the amount of two hundred dollars ($200.00). The license shall be considered granted upon the signature of the police chief thereto in the space provided. An initial migrant merchant license, if issued to a corporation or other business entity, may apply to two (2) individuals who shall be named in the license together with such entity. A business entity may apply for additional licenses by paying a fee of twenty-five dollars ($25.00) per individual. 
(c)  In addition to the filing of a properly completed application form and the payment of the license fee, the applicant for a migrant merchant license shall also file with the city clerk the bond required under section 18-52. 
(d)  The police chief shall issue or deny the license no later than the close of business on the third day after the applicant has complied with subsections (b) and (c) hereof, provided that, however, the three-day period shall commence to run on the day after the day on which the application process is completed and provided further that a Saturday, Sunday or holiday shall not be considered a "day" for purposes of this sentence. The police chief shall issue the license without regard to the nature or content of the information supplied by the applicant on the application form except that he shall deny the license if he has reasonable cause to believe that any material item of information appearing thereon is false, irrespective of the applicant's intent in providing the information. If the police chief takes no action within the time provided herein, then upon the expiration of such time, the application for a license shall be deemed to have been denied. No notice of denial to the applicant is required in order to make such denial effective. If an applicant has been denied a license by the police chief solely on the grounds that the police chief has reasonable cause to believe that a material item of information submitted by the applicant is false, the applicant may at any time thereafter renew his application or submit a new application, but no license shall issue to him unless he shall prove to the police chief by a preponderance of the evidence that the application which was denied was in fact substantially true or correct with respect to the challenged items, or that any incorrect or false information provided by him was submitted in good faith as the result of a mistake, inadvertence or excusable neglect on the part of the applicant. 
(e)  A license shall expire on the next December 31 after its issuance unless earlier suspended, revoked, or voluntarily surrendered. It is nontransferable. License fees are not subject to proration. 
(f)  A person holding a valid license shall conspicuously display it about his person while acting pursuant to the authority granted by the license. Before so using the license for the first time, however, he shall laminate the license in clear plastic in accordance with specifications established by the police chief. 
(g)  An applicant who is aggrieved with action taken by the police chief shall have a right to appeal to the city manager and if further aggrieved by the decision of the city manager he shall have the right to appeal to the city council, whereupon he shall be deemed to have exhausted his administrative remedies for purposes of the doctrine requiring exhaustion of administrative remedies before judicial review of governmental action is permissible. 
(h)  A person holding a valid license shall only conduct business from 8:00 a.m. to 8:00 p.m. from Monday through Saturday. 
(Ord. No. 2545, § 2; Ord. No. 3360, § 1; Ord. No. 3361, § 1; Ord. No. 4095, § 1; Ord. No. 4322, § 1) 
Editor's note- Section 1 of Ord. No. 4322, adopted Oct. 2, 2010, changed the title of § 18-51 from "Form, terms, effect and issuance of license" to "Form, terms, effect, and issuance of license for migrant merchants." 
Sec. 18-52. - Bond required. 
(a)  An applicant for a migrant merchant license shall file with the city clerk a surety bond in favor of the city in the amount of five thousand dollars ($5,000.00), in a form and with sureties acceptable to the city clerk. The bond shall relate to commercial transactions entered into by the migrant merchant within the City of Minot while acting as a migrant merchant. It shall be conditioned upon the faithful compliance with the ordinances pertaining to migrant merchants and migrant merchant licenses. 
(b)  The bond by its terms and conditions shall remain in effect and shall not be revocable until the thirty-first of December of the same year in which the license to which the bond relates expires under 18-51(e). 
(c)  The city clerk is authorized to accept a cash deposit in lieu of a bond with the deposit to be returned to the license applicant if the license is not granted. Otherwise, the cash deposit shall be held by the city clerk as the equivalent of a bond to be refunded to the licensee in whole or in part upon the same conditions and terms as are applicable to the bond itself. 
(d)  An action on the bond or cash deposit can be brought in the name of the city for the use and the benefit of the aggrieved person. 
(e)  This surety bond shall be in addition to any similar bond requirement of the State of North Dakota for migrant merchants. 
(Ord. No. 2545, § 2; Ord. No. 2617, § 1) 
Sec. 18-53. - Duties of migrant merchant; license dependent thereon; penalty. 
(a)  It shall be the duty of each migrant merchant to discharge the following obligations with respect to commercial transactions entered into by him within the city while acting as a migrant merchant, and notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Code the license of a migrant merchant shall be subject to revocation or suspension if the following obligations are not faithfully and fully discharged: 
(1)  The migrant merchant shall account for and apply all payments received by him in accordance with the representations made by him as an inducement to receive the payment; 
(2)  The migrant merchant shall deliver goods or perform services, or assure that the goods are delivered or the services are performed by others if he is not personally obligated to do so by the terms of his agreement with the purchaser thereof, in substantial accordance with his promises or representations made with respect to the time of delivery or performance; 
(3)  The migrant merchant shall assure that the goods delivered or the services performed shall reasonably conform with any implicit or explicit warranties or representations pertaining thereto which are made by him and which are not effectively disclaimed; 
(4)  The migrant merchant will promptly pay any judgment which might be entered against him arising out of such commercial transaction. 
(b)  The obligations imposed in this section shall be construed as continuing obligations even though the license of the migrant merchant may be suspended or revoked or may have expired by its own terms. 
(c)  No migrant merchant shall knowingly breach any of the obligations imposed herein, and if he does so the penalty therefor shall be as established in section 1-8 of this Code, provided that, however, if the conduct of the migrant merchant which is prohibited in this subsection forms all or part of certain conduct which is punishable under state law as an offense equivalent to a Class A misdemeanor, or as a greater offense, then this subsection shall be inapplicable thereto and state law shall govern. 
(Ord. No. 2545, § 2) 
Sec. 18-54. - Release of information by city and waiver of claims by licensee. 
    An applicant for a migrant merchant license shall be deemed by virtue of such application to have implicitly authorized the City of Minot to release and to publicize any and all information with respect to the applicant, including specifically information detrimental to the business character or reputation of the applicant, as long as there is no actual malicious intent upon the part of the city or any of its employees or agents in so doing. The applicant by submitting his application for a migrant merchant license is also deemed to waive any and all claims and causes of action for invasion of privacy, defamation, interference with contractual rights, and any other tort or legal theory of relief which might be based upon the release and publicization by the city of such information, and the benefit of this waiver shall extend not only to the city but to all of its agents, employees and officials, as long as they act without actual malice. 
(Ord. No. 2545, § 2) 
Sec. 18-55. - Suspension of license. 
    Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Code of Ordinances, a license may be immediately suspended by the city manager upon an ex parte showing made to him by any person establishing reasonable cause to believe that the licensee, while acting within the city pursuant to and within the scope of authority of the license, is involved in activity which is made criminal by state or federal law, and which activity is of a nature likely to lead to the injury in person or in property of the persons with whom the licensee is doing business, attempting to do business, or purporting to do business under the authority of the license. Further, the city manager may suspend a license upon receiving three documented complaints filed by city residents that the licensee is conducting the licensed activity in such a manner as to constitute a breach of the peace or to constitute a menace to the health, safety or general welfare of the public. However, the licensee shall not be penalized for acting under a suspended license until such time as he has been given actual notice of the suspension. Moreover, upon request the city manager shall provide the licensee with a post suspension hearing with respect to the validity of the suspension in the form and in the manner as is required by applicable principles of constitutional law, both state and federal, with respect to the concept of "due process."

    The penalty imposed for a violation of section 18-68 shall be dependent upon whether the licensee has also committed one (1) or more violations of that section within the twelve (12) months immediately preceding the violation in question, in accordance with the following schedule: 
Number of Offense Consequence First Civil penalty of one hundred dollars ($100.00). Second Suspension of seven (7) consecutive calendar days. Third Suspension of thirty (30) consecutive calendar days Fourth Suspension of one (1) calendar year.  
(Ord. No. 3624, § 1) 
Sec. 18-70. - Administrative procedure for imposition of penalty. 
(a)  If the city determines that a licensee has violated section 18-68, and seeks to impose a penalty against the licensee under section 18-69, it must serve the licensee with a written notice of a claimed violation of such section, either by personal service or by mail. The notice must state when and where the claimed violation occurred, except if the violation is one of non-payment, in which case the notice shall state when the payment was due. In either event, the notice shall also advise the recipient of the right to demand a hearing as provided for in this section, and shall state the penalty applicable to the claimed violation. If service of the notice is made by mail, the date of service shall be deemed to be the third business day following the date of mailing. 
(b)  If a licensee who has been served by the city with a notice of a claimed violation of section 18-68 pursuant to subsection (a) of this section timely demands a hearing in respect to the claimed violation, the city shall refer the matter to a hearing officer who is not an employee or officer of the city, who shall determine whether the violation has occurred. In conducting the hearing, the hearing officer shall follow such "due process" requirements under the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution as are mandated by the circumstances. 
(c)  In order for a licensee's demand for a hearing (as provided for in subsection (b) of this section) to be timely, it must be served on the mayor, or chief of police, or city manager, or city clerk, or president of the city council by the end of the tenth business day following the service on the licensee of the notice provided in subsection (a). In calculating such ten (10) days the date of service of the notice of a claimed violation shall be disregarded. A demand for a hearing may be served by personal service or instead may be served by mail, and if service is made by mail the date of mailing shall be deemed to be the date of service. 
(d)  If the hearing officer provided for in subsection (b) makes a formal finding in writing that the licensee has committed the violation charged, the penalty applicable thereto shall be deemed to be assessed (in the case of a fine), or shall commence (in the case of a suspension) on the fourth business day following the date of service of such written finding on the licensee, which service may be made in person or by mail. In calculating such fourth business day the date of personal service shall be disregarded, and if service is made by mail the imposition of the penalty shall be delayed an additional three (3) business days. (The waiting period is provided to allow a licensee who is dissatisfied with a decision of the hearing officer time in which to seek judicial review of, and temporary relief from, that decision.) 
(e)  If the licensee fails to serve upon the city a timely demand for a hearing, or acknowledges in writing the occurrence of the violation of which the licensee is charged, whichever first occurs, 
such failure or acknowledgement shall be deemed to be the equivalent to a written finding by the hearing officer that an offense has been committed. The licensee shall be deemed-by virtue of such failure to demand a hearing, or by such acknowledgement of a violation-to have waived the waiting period otherwise provided, and the applicable penalty shall be imposed on the first business day following the day when such failure or acknowledgement occurs. 
(Ord. No. 3624, § 1) 
Sec. 18-71. - Miscellaneous. 
(a)  In the event that a licensee receives an adverse decision from a hearing officer as the result of a hearing provided for in section 18-70, the licensee shall be deemed to have exhausted its administrative remedies for purpose of the doctrine of law which requires administrative remedies to be exhausted as a precondition to judicial review. 
(b)  Monitoring of compliance by licensees with the restrictions imposed by this section shall be conducted under the direction of the chief of police. Compliance checks will be conducted with respect to each licensee a minimum of four (4) times within any given twelve-month period, except that if a particular licensee has passed successfully eight (8) consecutive compliance checks, further compliance checks for such retailer shall be reduced to and maintained at no more than three (3) within any twelve-month period as long as such retailer remains in compliance. 
(c)  As used herein a "business day" means any day other than a Saturday, Sunday, a state holiday, or a federal holiday.

Editor's note- Ord. No. 2373, § 1, adopted June 2, 1980, provided for the repeal of former Ch. 20, relative to motor vehicles and traffic, and the enactment of a new Ch. 20 as herein set out. For the derivation of former Ch. 20, see the Code Comparative Table commencing on page CT-1.

ARTICLE I. - IN GENERAL 

Sec. 20-1. - Legislative intent and purpose. 
    It is of extreme importance to the safety and well-being of residents of and visitors to the City of Minot that the use of motor vehicles within the city be strictly controlled to preserve persons and property from harm, as well as to promote the convenience of drivers and pedestrians alike. 
    Although the use of motor vehicles is comprehensively regulated in detail by state law, nevertheless, there is a need for municipal court enforcement of traffic safety regulations. Moreover, the city has special problems with traffic control not specifically addressed in the state law. Consequently the city council does hereby assert the power and authority granted to it in Titles 39 and 40 of the North Dakota Century Code in order to adopt and enforce the following traffic regulations. In so doing it is the legislative intent to parallel the provisions of state law to the maximum extent feasible. However, all of Title 39 of the North Dakota Century Code is not adopted in its entirety by this city for the following reasons: 
(1)  Many parts of Title 39 pertain to matters of statewide concern which are to be enforced primarily or exclusively by state officials, such as, by way of illustration, the laws pertaining to motor vehicle dealer licensing or vehicle weight regulations with respect to interstate highways. 
(2)  Some provisions of Title 39 constitute a grant of authority to municipalities to regulate certain matters. This city may assert such authority under and by virtue of such provisions by enacting the particular restrictions desired without the necessity of also enacting the general language granting such authority. An example of such a provision is NDCC 39-09-03 which permits local authorities to set speed limitations on certain streets. Another example is provided by NDCC 39-10-35 (3) which permits the regulation of certain turning movements. 
(3)  Some provisions of Title 39 pertain to municipal court procedure, or requirements imposed on the municipal court or on municipal police officers to report certain matters to state officials. The city has no power to alter the effect of such provisions and likewise it is a futile gesture to enact a city ordinance requiring what state law already requires, particularly in view of the justifiable presumption that the local officials will do their duties. Examples of such provisions include most of Chapter 39-06.1 pertaining to hearings on alleged traffic offenses and the decriminalization of traffic offenses, and 39-08-17 which requires the municipal court judge to report certain convictions to the state highway commissioner. 
    In view of the unworkability of enacting by reference all of Title 39 NDCC as part of this Code of Ordinances, it is the purpose of this chapter of the Code of Ordinances to identify and enact into local law for this city those sections of Title 39 which define a substantive offense and which are to be enforced on a local level by this city. Furthermore, as explained more fully hereafter, such additional parts of Title 39 are adopted herein by reference as are required to give meaning to the substantive offenses even though such additional parts may not be identified by specific citation herein.

(d)  At any time after making the complaint described in subsection (c) hereof, or in lieu of making such complaint, the owner of the private no parking area or private restricted parking area may cause the removal of the offending vehicle from his property without prior notice to the owner thereof and no cause of action shall lie against him for such removal if the following conditions are met:

(1)  He has been granted a towing and storage license by the City of Minot pursuant to subsection (f) of this section and he has been requested pursuant to subsection (d) of this section by the owner of the private no parking area or private restricted parking area to remove and to store the car; or 
(2)  He himself is the owner of the private no parking area or private restricted parking area and he acts under the authority of and subject to the restrictions of subsection (d) of this section; or 
(3)  He is an agent, employee, or hired contractor of the City of Minot acting under the authority of subsection (h) of this section. 
(f)  A natural person, partnership or corporation may be granted a license permitting him or it to tow or otherwise to remove vehicles from private no parking areas or from private restricted parking areas within the City of Minot and to store such vehicles following the removal, or to do either.

e.  Such other information as the city clerk might reasonably request.

The policy shall cover any claims for damages under any cause of action arising out of the towing or storing of such vehicle, including by way of illustration and not by way of limitation, any claim that the vehicle or its contents were negligently damaged, destroyed, or permitted to be lost or stolen. 
(g)  The owner of a private no parking area or private restricted parking area, or a towing and storage licensee under subsection (f) hereof, who or which has taken into his or its possession a vehicle pursuant to and in compliance with subsection (d) hereof, may continue to maintain the possession of such vehicle even against the owner of such vehicle or any other person legally claiming an interest therein: 
(1)  Until the owner or someone on his behalf shall have paid to the person holding the vehicle the cost of towing and storing such vehicle, or 
(2)  Until ordered otherwise by a court of competent jurisdiction, and no action for conversion shall lie against such person based upon a claim that the vehicle was converted during the time that it was being held pursuant to this subsection. 
(h)  The owner of a private no parking area or private restricted parking areas in addition to the other rights granted to him under this section, may request the city to remove and to impound a junked or abandoned vehicle located on his property. The request shall be in writing on a form provided by the city. Such form shall contain language to the effect that: 
(1)  The landowner is transferring to the city any right, title and interest he might have in the vehicle, and 
(2)  He is specifically inviting the agents and employees of the city to enter upon his property for the purpose of removing and impounding the vehicle, and 
(3)  He agrees to indemnify and to hold harmless the city from any claim, costs, judgments, or damages which the owner of the junked or abandoned vehicle, or any other person legally claiming an interest therein, might bring against the city with respect to the seizure and impoundment of the vehicle. 
If the city has reason to believe that the junked or abandoned vehicle was abandoned on the property of the landowner without his consent or acquiescence, it may proceed to impound the vehicle in accordance with Article IV of this chapter, as though the automobile had been abandoned on public property. 
(i)  If any subsection, sentence, clause or other part of this section is found to be invalid by a court of law, such finding shall not invalidate the rest of this section unless the court concludes that the legislative scheme embodied herein would be completely or substantially frustrated by such a finding of partial invalidity.

However, in the event that the parking occurs because of a mechanical failure on the part of the vehicle which is parked, or because the parked vehicle is stalled by snow or ice or both, the operator of the vehicle shall have a grace period of one-half (1/2) hour after it becomes parked in which to remove the vehicle. 
(Ord. No. 3169, § 2; Ord. No. 3466, §§ 1, 2; Ord. No. 4019, § 1; Ord. No. 4226, § 2) 
Sec. 20-25. - Mobility-impaired parking. 
(a)  No person shall park any vehicle in the parking spaces designated pursuant to section 20-3(a)(11) or designated by a private property owner pursuant to NDCC 39-01-15(9) (1987 Supplement). 
(b)  Subsection (a) shall not apply if the parking of a vehicle otherwise prohibited by that subsection occurs: 
(1)  As the driver is loading or unloading a mobility impaired person; or 
(2)  If the vehicle parked bears the certificate provided for in NDCC 39-01-15 (1989 Supplement) and it was parked by the person for whose benefit the certificate was issued or by another person who is accompanying the person for whose benefit the certificate was issued during such time as the certificate beneficiary is engaged in the activity which necessitated the parking. 
(3)  The applicability of subsection (b) shall be an affirmative defense in any prosecution brought under subsection (a). 
(Ord. No. 2373, § 1, Ord. No. 2758, § 5, Ord. No. 2790, § 1; Ord. No. 2958, § 2) 
Sec. 20-26. - Courtesy parking permit. 
    The chief of police shall issue courtesy parking permits to out of city visitors living more than twenty (20) miles from the City of Minot and such other visitors as the city council may designate. Any vehicle bearing a courtesy parking permit posted conspicuously upon the rear window shall not be deemed to be in violation of any thirty, sixty, or one hundred twenty-minute parking limitation during the time that the courtesy parking permit is in full force and effect. The courtesy parking permit shall designate thereon the vehicle to which it applies. 
(Ord. No. 2373, § 1) 
Sec. 20-27. - Parking ticket authorized; warning ticket. 
(a)  In lieu of issuing a citation or complaint and summons under N.D.C.C., §§ 29-05-31, 39-07-07, or Rule 4 of the North Dakota Rules of Criminal Procedure, with respect to an offense committed under this division pertaining to parking, the officer, or person designated in writing by the chief of police, making the complaint shall execute a parking ticket in such form as may be prescribed by the chief of police. The parking ticket shall identify the offense claimed to have been committed and shall set forth the manner of disputing whether the offense occurred, or whether the registered owner of the vehicle committed the offense. The ticket shall also set forth the procedure to be followed in order to post bond and to forfeit the bond by way of an admission that the offense was committed by the registered owner of the vehicle involved. The parking ticket shall be conspicuously affixed to the vehicle which is unlawfully parked. 
(b)  The chief of police at his discretion may authorize the use of a warning parking ticket which shall indicate thereon the offense claimed to have been committed, but which ticket shall clearly state that no offense is being formally charged, and that the owner or operator of the vehicle need make no response to the ticket, and the ticket is meant to serve as a warning only. 
(Ord. No. 2373, § 1; Ord. No. 4722, § 1) 
Sec. 20-28. - Parking to terminate with issuance of parking ticket; separate offense. 
    The issuance of a parking ticket with respect to a vehicle shall be deemed to terminate the period of unlawful parking for which the vehicle is being ticketed if the vehicle is being ticketed for violating a limitation on parking with respect to time as opposed to a restriction with respect to the manner of parking or the place of parking. Thereafter, the time limitation in effect shall be deemed to commence running anew for the purpose of charging a second offense with respect to the same time limitation. Restrictions as to the place and manner of parking shall be deemed to be subject to commission only once within any twenty-four-hour period under the same set of facts and circumstances. For example, a vehicle which is ticketed for parking more than twelve (12) inches from the curb can only be ticketed for that offense once within a twenty-four-hour period of time if it is not moved throughout that period of time. Violations of alternate-street parking shall be deemed capable of commission only once within any six-hour period of time. 
(Ord. No. 2373, § 1) 
Sec. 20-29. - Posting bond; disputing charges; admitting charges; amount of bail bond. 
(a)  The owner of any vehicle which is ticketed pursuant to section 20-27 shall post a bond in the amount prescribed in subsection (f) hereof no later than ten (10) days after the date the ticket was issued. 
(b)  If the owner of the vehicle which was ticketed wishes to dispute that the offense was committed or that he was the person who committed the offense, then before the expiration of the period of time for the posting of the bond provided for in subsection (a) he shall arrange with the municipal judge for a hearing on the charge set forth in the parking ticket. Arranging a hearing, however, does not excuse the vehicle owner from posting the required bail bond. 
(c)  If the owner of the ticketed vehicle posts a bond as required in subsection (a), but does not make timely arrangements for a hearing pursuant to subsection (b) or if he willfully fails to appear at the hearing (and nonappearance alone shall give rise to the rebuttable presumption that the nonappearance was willful), he shall be deemed to have admitted the offense, and the bail bond shall be forfeited as the fine imposed for the offense. 
(d)  Under no circumstances shall the fine imposed for committing a parking offense exceed the bail bond provided for in subsection (f) hereof. No imprisonment shall be imposed for a violation of a parking offense. 
(e)  The willful failure by the owner of the ticketed vehicle to post a bail bond required by subsection (a) hereof shall constitute a separate offense punishable as provided in section 1-8 of this Code of Ordinances. 
(f)  The bail bond for parking offenses set forth in division 2 of this article, and for violations of section 20-6(a)(78) and 20-6(a)(79) shall be twenty dollars ($20.00) for each offense.

Editor's note- Ord. No. 4036, § 1, adopted Feb. 5, 2007, amended Div. 3 in its entirety, in effect deleting and reenacting Div. 3 to read as set out herein. Former Div. 3 pertained to similar subject matter and derived from Ord. No. 3596, §§ 1-6. 

Sec. 20-30. - Definitions. 
(a)  Off-highway vehicle means any wheeled motorized vehicle or a snowmobile not designed for use on a highway and capable of cross-country travel on land, snow, ice, marsh, swampland, or other natural terrain. 
(b)  Operate means (1) to ride in or on and (2) to control the operation of an off-highway vehicle. 
(c)  Low speed vehicle means a vehicle for which special motor vehicle registration rules apply by virtue of NDCC Ch. 39-29.1.

(a)  No person shall knowingly operate an off-highway vehicle: 
(1)  On public property without the express consent of the governmental authority owning the property or of the person to whom it has delegated the authority to grant or withhold such consent; 
(2)  On private property without the express consent of the owner thereof or his agent or tenant; 
(3)  Upon any street. 
(b)  The restriction of subsection (a)(3) shall not apply to the operation of a snowmobile for the purpose of leaving the city by the most direct route departing from the residence of the operator, or from the place where the snowmobile is ordinarily kept while not in use, or for the purpose of returning by the same route from outside the city to the point of departure. However, the exception provided by this subsection (b) shall not apply to any portion of the entire public right-of-way of the following streets: Broadway between 37th Avenue SW and 34th Avenue NW; Burdick Expressway from Highway 2 and 52 Bypass west and 27th Street SE; Valley Street west of 13th Street SE; 3rd Avenue NW between Broadway and 10th Street NW; 4th Avenue NW between 10th Street NW and 25th Street NW; streets within the Central Business District; and the driving lane portion of Highway 83 Bypass, Highway 2 and 52 Bypass and Highway 2 Bypass; provided that, however, this prohibition shall not apply to the operator of a snowmobile in the course of accomplishing a right-angle crossing of any of the aforesaid streets. 
(c)  If and to the extent restrictions on the operation of an off-highway vehicle which are imposed by this section conflict with those restrictions which are provided for in NDCC 39-24-09 or NDCC 39-29-09, which sections of the North Dakota Century Code are adopted by reference in section 20-6 hereof, then the provisions of this section shall govern. 
(d)  By public proclamation, the mayor, or in his absence the president of the city council, or in the absence of both the city manager, may suspend the operation of this section if, in the judgment of the person making the proclamation, emergency weather conditions make the use of other means of transportation impractical or hazardous. The proclamation shall be communicated in the manner most practical under the circumstances including broadcasting on television and radio, and shall be for a specified period of time not to exceed seventy-two (72) hours. 
(Ord. No. 4036, § 1) 
Sec. 20-32. - Unattended snowmobile. 
    No person, being in charge of a snowmobile, shall leave the snowmobile upon a street with the motor running or with the keys for starting the snowmobile left in the ignition and remove himself from the immediate vicinity of the snowmobile unless he shall have first turned over the care and custody of the snowmobile to a trustworthy person then present who agrees to assume such responsibility. 
(Ord. No. 4036, § 1) 
Sec. 20-33. - Snowmobile equipment required. 
    No person shall operate a snowmobile unless the snowmobile is equipped with a "dead man's throttle" which is a device which requires the constant deliberate application of pressure from the hand of the operator of the snowmobile in order for the snowmobile to operate, and is also equipped with headlights, taillights, brake light and factory installed exhaust system in good working condition. 
(Ord. No. 4036, § 1) 
Sec. 20-34. - Permitting certain unlawful use of snowmobiles prohibited.

Secs. 20-35-20-50. - Reserved. 
ARTICLE III. - RULES OF CONSTRUCTION, TRIAL PROCEDURE AND EVIDENCE 

Sec. 20-51. - Definitions of terms and rules of construction. 
(a)  Those portions of Title 39 NDCC which are not specifically identified in section 20-6 hereof as being adopted herein by reference thereto, are nevertheless adopted herein by reference to the extent such provisions meet any of the following criteria: 
(1)  The provision specifically or by implication defines or gives a technical meaning to any of the terms or words used within the state statute referred to in section 20-6. An example would be NDCC 39-01-01 setting forth general definitions. 
(2)  The provision sets forth a rule of law or other information which gives meaning to the offense described in any of the sections adopted from state law in section 20-6, or the provision explains how the law may be complied with and the offense avoided. For example, NDCC 39-04-11, which is adopted by reference thereto in section 20-6 hereof, requires the display of license plates while operating a vehicle upon public highways. Other provisions of Chapter 39-04 define a license plate, explain in detail when one is required, set forth the procedure to be followed in obtaining a license, etc. Such other provisions in Chapter 39-04 NDCC and elsewhere in Title 39 are hereby adopted to the extent necessary to avoid a claim that the substantive offenses identified and adopted in section 20-6, standing by themselves and without further explanation or definition, are so vague, indefinite and uncertain as to be void for vagueness. 
(3)  The provision establishes a defense or exception to (i) any rule of law or (ii) provision defining an offense set forth in section 20-6. For example NDCC 39-06-01 (which is adopted by reference in section 20-6) generally requires that the operator of a vehicle on North Dakota highways have in his possession a valid North Dakota drivers license. However NDCC 39-06-02 establishes exceptions to that rule and thus it would be a valid defense to prosecution under 39-06-01 if the defendant could show the courts that he falls within one of the exceptions set forth in 39-06-02. 
(b)  In addition to the definitions set forth in subsection (a) of this section, the following words are given the following additional meanings: 
(1)  "Central Business District" shall mean that portion of the City of Minot bounded on the west by Broadway, on the south by 4th Avenue South, on the east by 3rd Street East, and on the north by the south property line of the Burlington Northern right-of-way. 
(2)  "Chapter" when it appears as part of a section of Title 39 NDCC which is adopted by way of reference into this Chapter 20 of the Code of Ordinances, shall mean either this chapter of the Code of Ordinances or that chapter of Title 39 of the North Dakota Century Code wherein the section of state law is originally found, or both, as the context may require. 
(3)  "Highway" when used in a section of the North Dakota Century Code which is adopted by way of reference into this Chapter 20 of the Code of Ordinances shall mean: 
a.  Any street, alley, avenue, highway, or other public right-of-way, and 
b.  Every way privately maintained within a mobile home park, trailer park, or camp ground containing five (5) or more lots for occupancy by mobile homes, travel trailers, or tents when any part thereof is open for purposes of vehicular travel within the City of Minot. 
(4)  "Parking" is the process or status which commences with a motor vehicle coming to a complete halt and which is deemed to continue until the vehicle is moved from its original resting place a distance greater than its own length. "To park" is to cause such status or process to come about with respect to any motor vehicle. However, "parking" does not include the ordinary stopping of a vehicle within the stream of traffic on the traveled portions of a street which is necessitated by obedience to traffic lights, stop signs, or in response to the movements of other vehicles and pedestrians, and other similar causes. 
(5)  The word "street" when used in this chapter shall be all inclusive of every public throughfare including alleys, avenues, bridges, highways, roadways, etc., unless the context clearly indicates a more restrictive meaning is intended as in section 20-22 pertaining to alternate street parking. 
(6)  The word "traffic-control device" includes stop signs, yield signs, no left turn signs, no U-turn signs, lane markings, pedestrian safety zones, crosswalks, railroad crossing signals, school flasher lights, and other devices so designated in the "Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices." 
(7)  Title 39 of the North Dakota Century Code means Title 39 as amended from time to time by the North Dakota Legislative Assembly. 
(Ord. No. 2373, § 1; Ord. No. 2641, § 5; Ord. No. 3703, § 16) 
Sec. 20-52. - When sign posting required before enforcement permitted. 
    No restriction in this chapter pertaining to speed limits, restrictions on parking, traffic-control devices (other than crosswalks, pedestrian safety zones, and lane markings), weight limitations, or limitations with respect to the types of vehicles permitted upon certain streets, shall be enforced until there shall have been erected the traffic-control device itself or a sign post so designed and located that it gives a warning to the reasonably observant person of common intelligence of the nature of the restriction to be enforced, provided that, however, the restriction on U-turns within the Central Business District shall apply without sign posting or without the erection of a traffic-control device prohibiting U-turns. Likewise, section 20-22 shall be enforced without prior posting of signs. The specific posting provisions of section 20-24.2(b) shall govern over the foregoing more general provisions of this section. 
(Ord. No. 2373, § 1; Ord. No. 2410, § 2; Ord. No. 3169, § 3) 
Sec. 20-53. - Applicability of this chapter to bicycles. 
    In addition to those provisions of this chapter which are made specifically applicable to bicycles or the operators of bicycles by the express terms thereof, a bicycle shall be considered a vehicle when it is used within a public street, except with respect to those provisions pertaining to the equipment of vehicles. Nothing in this section, however, shall be construed as nullifying the adoption by reference of NDCC 39-10.1-07 which is accomplished in section 20-6 hereof. 
    The civil penalty for a violation of this section shall be five dollars ($5.00). 
(Ord. No. 2373, § 1; Ord. No. 3703, § 13; Ord. No. 4296, § 5) 
Sec. 20-54. - General penalty; special penalties; culpability. 
(a)  It is unlawful for any person to do any act forbidden, or fail to perform any act required, in this chapter of the Minot Code of Ordinances, and the penalty for such offense shall be within the range provided for in the general penalty clause of this Code (to wit, section 1-8), unless a specific penalty is associated with a specific offense, in which case that specific penalty shall apply. In either event, the penalty thus provided for shall supersede the particular penalty provisions of those state statutes which are adopted in this chapter by reference thereto. 
(b)  (1)  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in state law, violations of section 20-16 shall be punished as provided in section 20-29. Violations of subsection (32) of section 20-6 (which incorporates by reference NDCC 39-09-02 subsections 1 and 3) shall be punished in accordance with the following schedule of fines, and no imprisonment shall be imposed: 
1-5 mph over the posted speed limit will be $10.00. 
5-10 mph over the posted speed limit will be $10.00 plus $1.00 for each mph over 5 mph over the speed limit. 
11-15 mph over the posted speed limit will be $20.00 plus $1.00 for each mph over 10 mph over the speed limit. 
16-20 mph over the posted speed limit will be $30.00 plus $2.00 for each mph over 15 mph over the speed limit. 
21-25 mph over the posted speed limit will be $50.00 plus $3.00 for each mph over 20 mph over the speed limit. 
26-35 mph over the posted speed limit will be $80.00 plus $3.00 for each mph over 25 mph over the speed limit. 
36-45 mph over the posted speed limit will be $140.00 plus $3.00 for each mph over 35 mph over the speed limit. 
46 or more mph over the posted speed limit will be $200.00 plus $5.00 for each mph over 45 mph over the speed limit. 
(2)  The fine for speeding in a construction zone shall be double the fine provided in subsection (b)(1) above, provided, however, that the increased fine in this subsection (b)(2) does not apply unless individuals engaged in construction are present at the time and place of the violation and the posted speed limit sign states that fines are doubled. 
(c)  The penalty for speeding offenses in which an element of the offense is that the speeding occurred within a given distance of a school shall be as provided for in NDCC 39-06.1-06(12). 
(d)  Except as provided in subsection (e), the fines imposed in subsection (b) shall be mandatory and not subject to reduction, remission, suspension, or abatement. 
(e)  When a defendant does not avail himself of the procedures set forth in NDCC Chapter 39-06.1-02 or 39-06.1-03, when charged with an offense, and thereafter the defendant is properly convicted of committing the offense, or when a particular penalty provision of state law is not mandatory, the municipal court may impose the full range of penalties permitted by section 1-8 of this Code except as provided in subsection (b) hereof and in section 20-29(f). 
(f)  The level of culpability required to sustain a conviction under this chapter of the Code of Ordinances shall be that the defendant acted or failed to act "knowingly" as that term is used in NDCC 12.1-02-02(b), unless the specific provisions defining the elements of the offense set forth a different level of culpability. 
(Ord. No. 2373, § 1; Ord. No. 2442, § 1; Ord. No. 2463, § 1; Ord. No. 3703, § 1, 9-4-01; Ord. No. 3996, § 2) 
Sec. 20-55. - Ownership of vehicle prima facie evidence of operation. 
    In any prosecution for a violation of this chapter, proof that a vehicle was operated or parked in a manner constituting a violation of this chapter shall give rise to the rebuttable presumption that the registered owner of the vehicle was in fact the person who operated the vehicle at the time that the violation occurred. This presumption may be rebutted by the owner of the vehicle if he is charged with the offense or it may be rebutted by evidence to the contrary presented by the prosecution in the course of establishing that the offense was in fact committed, as when, for example, a person other than the registered owner is specifically charged with the offense. 
(Ord. No. 2373, § 1) 
Sec. 20-56. - Defenses. 
(a)  Any defendant charged with an offense under this Chapter 20 of the Code of Ordinances may raise as a defense any exception, exculpatory rule of evidence, or affirmative defense provided in Title 39 or elsewhere in the North Dakota Century Code, to which he would be entitled if the prosecution against him had been brought in state court as opposed to municipal court. Additionally the defendant may avail himself of any like defense set forth in this chapter of the Code of Ordinances. 
(b)  If the defendant raises a defense under subsection (a) hereof, he shall have the initial burden of coming forward with sufficient evidence to establish a prima facie case that the affirmative defense, exception, or exculpatory rule applies. 
(c)  If the defendant complies with subsection (b) hereof, the city prosecutor shall then have the burden of persuasion with respect to the issue of fact raised thereby with such burden being the predominance of the evidence with respect to noncriminal charges and with such burden being evidence beyond a reasonable doubt in criminal charges.

ARTICLE IV. - IMPOUNDMENT OF VEHICLES 

Sec. 20-71. - Definitions; rules of interpretation. 
(a)  When used in this article, the following terms have the meanings given to them in this section (except where the context clearly indicates otherwise): 
(1)  "City" means: 
a.  The officials and employees of the City of Minot; 
b.  Any agent of the city while acting within the scope of its agency; and 
c.  Any independent contractor of the city while discharging its contractual obligations to the city. 
(2)  "Enclosed" means contained within a structure having four walls (or the equivalent) and a roof. 
(3)  "Last known address" means the most recent address for a person which is found: 
a.  In the City of Minot police records; 
b.  In the records of the state department of transportation; or 
c.  In the city directory or an appropriate telephone directory. 
(4)  "Owner" includes: 
a.  Joint owners as well as a sole owner; 
b.  A lessee of personal property or lessee or tenant of real property; and 
c.  Any other person lawfully in possession of or in charge of that which is owned. 
(5)  "Suitably screened" means with respect to a vehicle located on private property that such vehicle (except when it is being actively worked on or cannibalized for parts) is not readily visible from other, nearby private property, or from the nearby public right of way: 
a.  Because of the intervention of shrubbery, or fences, or topography, or some combination or all of these; or 
b.  Because (1) the vehicle is securely covered by an opaque and intact fabric cover which is designed to cover the vehicle to the middle of hubcaps, and (2) the vehicle is situated on the property where it is located as far away from the most traveled public right of way abutting such property as is reasonably feasible. 
(6)  "Vehicle" means any self-propelled vehicle. 
(b)  Nothing in paragraph (3) of subsection (a) shall be construed as requiring an extraordinary search of public records, or a formal investigation, to ascertain an address, as opposed to a routine examination of the general indices maintained to provide access to such information. 
(c)  The city may at its discretion treat consent obtained from one owner of a vehicle or real property, or notice given to one owner of a vehicle or real property, as binding on all other owners of the same vehicle or real property. Thus, for example, notice provided to a car leasing company in respect to one of its leased vehicles will be deemed to be notice to the lessee of the vehicle, which vehicle is identified in the notice, and similarly, an as another example, notice given to, or consent obtained from, a tenant of real property shall be deemed notice to, or consent from, the landlord. 
(d)  When a vehicle which is located upon private property is subject to impoundment under this article, and when after the exercise of reasonable diligence it cannot be ascertained who the owner of the vehicle is, then it shall be presumed that the vehicle is owned the same as the land upon which it is located. 
(e)  When a period of time specified in this article is expressed in terms of a number of days less than eleven (11), such number shall be calculated by excluding the day of the event triggering the running of such time period (such as, for example, the giving of a notice), and by excluding likewise any intervening Saturday, Sunday, state holiday, or federal holiday. Any period of days which ends on a Saturday, Sunday, state holiday, or federal holiday, shall be extended to the next following day which is neither a Saturday, Sunday, state holiday or federal holiday.

Sec. 20-72. - Impoundment without consent and without prior notice. 
(a)  The city may impound a vehicle, without the consent of the owner thereof and without the consent of any person having a legal interest therein (such as a lienholder), if at the time of impoundment: 
(1)  The physical condition of the vehicle, or its location (regardless of whether it is on private property or public property and, if it is on public property, regardless whether it is lawfully parked or stopped thereon), or both, constitute a serious and immediate danger to the health or safety of any member of the public or to the safety of private or public property; or 
(2)  The vehicle is located on a street, highway, or other public property and is not lawfully parked or stopped thereon in accordance with this Code of Ordinances, and its location substantially and seriously interferes with: 
a.  The normal flow or traffic; 
b.  Ongoing street cleaning or snow removal operations, including the use of a snow removal emergency route for the trucking of snow (without regard to where the snow was loaded); 
c.  Any other ongoing operations performed by municipal employees in the course of their duties; or 
(3)  The vehicle is located upon a street, highway or other public property (regardless of whether the vehicle is lawfully parked or stopped in accordance with this Code of Ordinances), and because of extraordinary circumstances not reasonably contemplated by the owner thereof, such as, for example, fire, windstorm or flood, actual or impending, the vehicle, or its contents, or both, are in immediate danger of being damaged, destroyed, or stolen; 
(4)  Prior notice would be otherwise required under this article, but, based upon the facts then known to the city it reasonably appears that such prior notice, if given, would be ineffectual because the owner is incompetent or incapacitated, and after a reasonably diligent search no one can be found who is looking after the interests of the owner; 
(5)  Prior notice would otherwise be required under this article but the identity of the owner, or his last-known address, or both, cannot with reasonable diligence be ascertained; 
(6)  Impoundment of the vehicle without prior notice to the owner thereof is otherwise authorized by law, such as, for example, when the vehicle is known or reasonably believed to be the fruit or instrumentality of a crime and because of other circumstances subject to seizure as such without a warrant; 
(7)  The vehicle is parked in a no-parking immediate tow-away zone, which zone is properly posted with signs as required by section 20-52; 
(8)  The vehicle is parked within a fire lane, whether on private or public property, which has been posted in the manner required by law; or 
(9)  The vehicle is parked at the City of Minot International Airport: 
a.  In such a manner as to block the movement of other parked vehicles; or 
b.  Within a loading zone beyond the time limitation applicable to the loading zone (which loading zones the airport manager is hereby delegated the authority to designate), provided that fair warning signs as to the time limitations have been posted. 
(b)  If a vehicle may be impounded under this section without prior notice to the owner thereof, then it is immaterial that there may also be ground for impounding the vehicle under section 20-73, and this section governs. 
(c)  Whenever under the terms of this section the city may take action in respect to a vehicle without the consent of the owner of the vehicle, then it is not obligated to provide prior notice of its intentions in that regard to the owner of the vehicle, or to any other person having a non-ownership interest therein, such as, for example, a lienholder. Nevertheless, at its discretion the city may endeavor to provide prior notice to such persons, without, however, a failure to accomplish such notice, or a defect in the notice, in any way diminishing or waiving the city's right to proceed without giving prior notice.

Sec. 22-1. - Declaration of nuisances generally. 
(a)  In addition to such other items or conditions which may be declared to be a nuisance under other chapters of this Code of Ordinances, the following items or conditions designated hereafter are declared to be nuisances: 
(1)  Nuisances per se: 
a.  Any accumulation of (i) organic materials or (ii) inorganic materials, or (iii) combination of both, which is located on private property, and which, because of the circumstances in which it is stored or accumulated, presents a hazard to the health or safety of any person or which presents a hazard to any other property, private or public. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, there is included within this category the following substances or items: 
1.  Garbage, as defined in section 14-1 of the Code of Ordinances; 
2.  Refuse, as defined in section 14-1 of the Code of Ordinances; 
3.  Rubbish, as defined in section 14-1 of the Code of Ordinances; 
4.  Dangerous buildings as defined in section 9-11 of the Code of Ordinances; 
5.  Noxious weeds; 
6.  Materials which are subject to special storage requirements under section 13-39 of the Code of Ordinances and which are in fact are not stored substantially as required therein; 
7.  Open pits or excavations not barricaded or fenced in a manner sufficient to protect persons, particularly small children, whether or not such persons are trespassers (but excluding those persons working about the premises who assume the risk), from falling therein and injuring themselves, or which pits or excavations present a significant danger of collapse or cave-in with a reasonable likelihood of damage to property, whether public or private, or injury to persons, resulting therefrom; 
8.  Barbed wire or electric fences within city limits, except this clause shall not apply to strands of barbed wire if the lowest strand is located more than six and one-half (61/2) feet above the adjoining ground level; 
9.  Mining, manufacturing, food processing or other industrial procedures which (i) violate applicable state or federal pollution regulations, or (ii) which are generally offensive (under a reasonable man standard) to three (3) or more people working or living within close proximity to the source; 
10.  All species and varieties of elm trees (trees of genus Ulmus) infected with the fungus known as Dutch Elm Disease (certostomella Ulmi) as determined by a laboratory analysis by the section of applied botany and plant pathology, North Dakota State University, or by laboratories approved by said agency; 
11.  All species and varieties of elm trees that are dead or substantially dead and all dead elm wood to which the bark is still attached, which, because of their condition, serve as a breeding place for the European Elm Bark Beetle (Scolytus multistriatus), and the native Elm Bark Beetle (Hylurgopinus rufipes), or any other carrier of said disease; 
12.  Privies or septic systems not constructed or operating in accordance with section 26-1 of the Code of Ordinances; or 
13.  Nuisance as defined by regulation promulgated by the First District Health Unit pursuant to NDCC 23-05-01 and NDCC 23-14-06 or other equivalent statutes. 
14.  Dog and cat droppings. 
(2)  Visual nuisances: An accumulation or pile of unsightly materials which constitute an eyesore, such as, by way of illustration and not of limitation, the following: 
a.  Junked, abandoned, disassembled, inoperative or unregistered automobiles (excluding, however, automobiles which are currently licensed, registered, and operable; 
b.  Discarded building materials; 
c.  Worn out and cast-off furniture or household items; 
d.  Weeds or grasses in excess of eight (8) inches high; or 
e.  Piles of dead trees. 
provided that, however, such accumulation shall not be considered a visual nuisance if the same is screened from public view and from view from adjoining private property at all times of the year by a fence or vegetation or other suitable means. 
(b)  A condition or object described above may constitute both a nuisance per se and a visual nuisance. Moreover, the fact that a condition or object may be adequately screened so as to prevent the same from being considered a visual nuisance does not mean that the same condition cannot constitute a nuisance per se under subsection (a)(1) of this section. 
(c)  Specifically, in the case of auto wreckers, junk yards, scrap processors, dealers in used auto parts, and auto and machinery repair businesses, all operations including the storage of material to be processed, in process, and already processed must either be conducted within a completely enclosed building, or the screening required in under (a)(2) of this section must consist of a reasonably opaque fence at least eight (8) feet high, kept in good repair, which completely surrounds the area or areas in which processing operations take place. 
(d)  The screening requirements of (a)(2) of this section shall not be deemed to apply to premises where the only visual nuisance is the storage of building materials as long as there is ongoing construction taking place upon such property in accordance with a city building permit and the building materials will be used in such construction. Likewise, (a)(2) shall not apply to a building supply business which operates entirely on premises which are zoned to permit such business. 
(e)  The city building official shall establish and enforce specifications for barricading and fencing of open pits or excavations intended to protect persons from harm and abate nuisances. Barricading or fencing of open pits or excavations is a temporary measure permitted for a period of time not to exceed six (6) months, unless extended by the city building official for a period not to exceed an additional six (6) months.

Sec. 22-2. - Notice to abate nuisance. 
(a)  The city may notify, in writing, the owner of any lot, place or area within the city that within five (5) days after receipt of the notice he must abate the nuisance described in the notice. The notice shall specify the legal description of the premises and shall set forth, if possible, the street address of the premises. It shall include an explanation of the right to a hearing on the necessity for abatement which is provided in section 22-4(a). The notice shall be sent by ordinary mail addressed to the owner at his last known address or shall be personally served on the owner. The person making service shall maintain a permanent record of proof of service. This subsection shall not apply, however, to a claimed nuisance under section 22-1(a)(2)d (relating to weeds or grasses in excess of eight (8) inches high). 
(b)  No prior, individualized notice whatsoever of a claimed nuisance under section 22-1(a)(2)d (relating to weeds or grasses in excess of eight (8) inches high) need be provided to the owner of the land involved in the claim at any time before the city enters upon the land and proceeds to abate the nuisance, however, nothing in this subsection shall be construed as prohibiting the director of public works from informally requesting or directing the landowner or person in charge of the land to take the measures necessary to abate the claimed nuisance. 
(c)  In order to reduce violations of section 22-1(a)(2)d (relating to weeds or grasses in excess of eight (8) inches high), the director of public works shall, from time to time, take such steps as in his discretion seem sufficient and necessary to advise the public and landowners of the restrictions imposed by that provision of the law, and of the consequences which may result from a failure to observe such restrictions. The means of such communication may include, but are not limited to, notices published in the newspaper and public service announcements in the broadcast media. A claimed failure of or insufficiency of notice under this subsection shall not constitute a defense to any monetary imposition which the city may seek to impose under the provisions of this chapter or any other enforcement activity. 
(Ord. No. 2455, § 4; Ord. No. 2786, § 1; Ord. No. 2980, § 11; Ord. No. 3511, § 1) 
Sec. 22-3. - Authority of city to abate nuisance when owner does not do so. 
(a)  Upon the failure, neglect or refusal of any owner notified in accordance with section 22-2(a) to abate the nuisance described in the notice within five (5) days after receipt thereof by, or personal service thereof upon, the owner, the city is authorized to enter upon the premises described in such notice and to take whatever steps as might reasonably be required to abate the nuisance, however, if the notice is returned to the city because of the inability of the U.S. Postal Service to make delivery thereof, the city may proceed immediately to abate the nuisance, provided that the notice was properly addressed to the last known address of the owner. This subsection shall not apply, however, to a claimed nuisance under section 22-1(a)(2)d (relating to weeds or grasses in excess of eight (8) inches high). 
(b)  In the event of a claimed nuisance under section 22-1(a)(2)d (relating to weeds or grasses in excess of eight (8) inches high), the city is authorized without notice to enter upon the premises and to take whatever steps as might reasonably be required to abate the nuisance. 
(c)  Actions taken by the city under and in accordance with subsections (b) and (c), if reasonable in nature and undertaken in good faith, shall not constitute a trespass or conversion. 
(Ord. No. 2455, § 4; Ord. No. 2786, § 2; Ord. No. 3511, § 1) 
Sec. 22-4. - Hearing on necessity of abatement. 
(a)  Any owner who shall receive a notice as specified in section 22-2(a) may, within five (5) days after its receipt or personal service, apply in writing to the city manager for a hearing on the necessity for the abatement of the nuisance described in such notice. Such hearing shall be provided by the city manager or his delegate within five (5) business days of the filing of the application, unless the owner shall agree to a hearing at a later date. The city shall have the burden of proof by the clear weight of evidence that the conditions of which it complains constitute a nuisance as defined in section 22-1. 
(b)  At the hearing provided for in subsection (a), the city manager shall either find for the owner, in which case no further action may be taken by the city without the issuance of another notice pursuant to section 22-2(a), which shall be issued only in the event of a material change in circumstances, or the city manager shall find for the city, in which case the owner shall have an additional five (5) days from the date of service upon him by mail or in person of a copy of the city manager's decision in which he may abate the nuisance. If he fails, neglects or refuses to abate the nuisance within that period of time, then the city may proceed to enter upon the property and to abate the nuisance. Such actions, if reasonable in nature and undertaken in good faith, shall not constitute a trespass or conversion. If the owner is aggrieved by the decision made by the city manager, he may, without further administrative review, resort to his judicial remedies. 
(c)  In the event the city proceeds to abate without notice a claimed nuisance under section 22-1(a)(2)d (relating to weeds or grasses in excess of eight (8) inches high), and the city seeks to special assess the cost of such abatement work against the land where it was performed (as is provided for in section 22-5) then, in addition to, or in lieu of, disputing the amount of special assessments to be levied, the affected landowner may contest (at the hearing provided for in section 22-6) whether in fact at the time of the abatement the land in question harbored weeds or grasses in excess of eight (8) inches high. If the landowner chooses to raise that issue, then the city shall bear both the burden of going forward with the evidence and the burden of persuasion. 
(Ord. No. 2455, § 4; Ord. No. 2786, § 3; Ord. No. 3511, § 1) 
Sec. 22-5. - Costs to be assessed against property. 
    If the city enters upon private property and takes actions: 
(1)  To abate a nuisance thereon pursuant to this chapter; or 
(2)  To remove a vehicle therefrom pursuant to Article IV (Impoundment of Vehicles) of Chapter 20 (Motor Vehicles and Traffic) of the City of Minot Code of Ordinances: 
there shall be assessed against the property the costs of abatement, including a fee fixed by the city manager. The manager shall fix the fee upon any reasonable basis designed to compensate the city for its overhead costs and staff salaries attributable to the nuisance abatement enforcement program of the City, as such costs relate proportionately to the property in question. The fee may be assessed either on a fixed fee basis or a case-by-case basis. 
(Ord. No. 2455, § 4; Ord. No. 3511, § 1; Ord. No. 3687, § 2) 
Sec. 22-6. - Hearing on amount of special assessment for nuisance abatement. 
(a)  No later than September 30 of each year, the city auditor shall prepare a list of assessments made pursuant to this chapter for those premiss on which the city or its agents abated a nuisance during the twelve (12) months prior to July 31. The list shall set forth the owner or owners of such property, the legal description of the property, and, when possible, the street address of the property, and the amount of nuisance abatement costs assessed against the premises. Within a reasonable time after preparation of the list, the city auditor shall give each landowner, at his last known address, written notice that the city proposes to levy as a special assessment against his property the costs set forth in the list. 
(b)  The notice to each landowner shall contain the same information which is pertinent to him as is found in the list of assessments. In addition, with regard to those special assessments which arise from the abatement of a claimed nuisance under section 22-1(a)(2)d (relating to weeds or grasses in excess of eight (8) inches high), the notice shall also inform the landowner of his rights under section 22-4(c). 
(c)  Service of the notice provided for in this section shall be made upon each landowner by certified mail with return receipt requested. The city auditor shall maintain in his files written proof of mailing. Additionally, the special assessment list shall be published once in the official newspaper of the county. 
(d)  The proposed assessment shall be considered as conclusively determined and incontestable upon the expiration of ten (10) days following the date of mailing or the date of publication, whichever occurs later, however, an aggrieved landowner may appeal to the city manager with respect to the correctness of the computation of the nuisance abatement costs pertaining to his land, in which case the certification of such costs as to the premises owned by the aggrieved landowner shall be delayed until such time as the city manager shall decide the appeal. The balance of the special assessment list, consisting of the properties with respect to which there is no appeal, shall be forwarded to the county auditor for certification. 
(e)  The appeal to the city manager shall be initiated by the filing with him of written notice of the appeal, stating therein the grounds upon which the appeal is based. The notice must be filed before the date upon which the determination of costs would otherwise become conclusively determined and incontestable. The hearing on the appeal will be held no later than seven (7) business days following the filing of the same unless the landowner shall consent to a hearing on the appeal at a later date. The determination made by the city auditor as to the amount of the costs levied against the premises in question shall be presumed to be correct, but subject to rebuttal by the landowner, who shall have the burden of proving by clear and convincing evidence: 
(1)  That the city auditor's determination is incorrect; and 
(2)  The amount of the correct charge. The city manager or his delegate shall affirm the proposed charge made by the city auditor or modify the charge in accordance with the evidence produced at the hearing. 
(f)  The city manager's determination of the correct charge upon appeal, either by affirmation or by way of modification, shall be remanded to the city auditor for certification by the city auditor to the county auditor, which certification shall be made no fewer than two (2) business days following the determination of the city manager. The landowner, if still aggrieved, may resort to his judicial remedies without further administrative review. 
(Ord. No. 2455, § 4; Ord. No. 3511, § 1) 
Sec. 22-7. - Abatement without prior notice. 
    In the event a nuisance as defined under section 22-1(a)(1) shall constitute an immediate and serious danger to the health of any person, or shall constitute an immediate and serious danger to private or public property, the city may without prior notice to the owner of the premises immediately enter upon the premises and take whatever steps are required to abate the nuisance. If such actions are reasonable in nature and undertaken in good faith such actions shall not constitute trespass or conversion. Any attempt by the city to give the owner prior notice shall not constitute a waiver of the right under this section to act without prior notice. 
(Ord. No. 2455, § 4) 
Sec. 22-8. - Other remedies; harboring a nuisance; penalty clause. 
    The provisions of this article shall not constitute the exclusive remedy of the City of Minot to abate nuisances. The city reserves the right to proceed in any court of competent jurisdiction to obtain an injunction requiring abatement of the nuisance and such remedy may be asserted without regard to the notice requirements of this article and the provisions for administrative relief set forth herein. Moreover the harboring or maintenance of a nuisance shall constitute an offense punishable under section 1-8 of the Code of Ordinances and each day that such nuisance is harbored or maintained shall constitute a separate offense. 
(Ord. No. 2455, § 4) 
Sec. 22-9. - Geographical application. 
    The provisions of this article shall apply to all land within the corporate city limits and also to all land lying within one-half (1/2) mile of the corporate city limits (with the exception of section 22-1(a)(2) Visual nuisances, subsection d, Weeds or grasses in excess of eight (8) inches high), as is specifically authorized in NDCC 40-06-01(2), and, moreover, to all land within two (2) miles of the city limits to the extent that it is permissible to assert such authority and jurisdiction under the extraterritorial zoning powers granted to the city, under NDCC 40-47-01.1.

Sec. 23-2. - Greater offenses excluded. 
    If there are circumstances surrounding the commission of an act prohibited in this chapter which would permit the actor to be charged with a greater offense in terms of permissible punishment under state law than the charge which could be brought under this chapter of the Code of Ordinances, then this chapter of the Code of Ordinances shall not apply and the Ward County state attorney will be advised of the claimed offense in order that he may prosecute under state law if he deems it advisable. For example, if the victim of a battery prohibited in section 23-11 is a peace officer acting in an official capacity, the offense is a Class C felony under NDCC 12.1-17-01 and this section 23-2 applies.

The name of the person posting the premises must appear on each sign in legible characters. 
(2)  Even if the conduct of the owner, tenant, or individual authorized by the owner varies from the provisions of subdivision (a)(1), an individual may be found guilty of violating subdivision (a)(1) if the owner, tenant, or individual authorized by the owner substantially complied with subdivision (a)(1) and notice against trespass is clear from the circumstances.

Sec. 23-21. - Reserved. 
Editor's note- Ord. No. 5245, § 9, adopted Dec. 4, 2017, repealed former § 23-21 which pertained to obstruction of governmental function, and derived from Ord. No. 3147, § 1. 
Sec. 23-22. - Soliciting and panhandling. 
(a)  This section is adopted in order to protect persons from threatening, intimidating or harassing behavior, and to keep public places safe and attractive for use by all persons. This section is also intended to provide for the free flow of pedestrian and vehicular traffic on streets and sidewalks in the city. The council finds that certain solicitation and aggressive acts associated with solicitation interfere with the free flow of pedestrian and vehicular traffic and intimidate persons in public places, and can lead to disruption and disorder in public places. The council further finds that solicitation in certain public places is inconsistent with the use of those places. 
    The activity of soliciting from occupants of vehicles distracts drivers from their primary duty to watch traffic and pedestrians and be alert for potential hazards, and to observe all traffic control signals, signs or warnings. The practice of soliciting from within a street or parking lot subjects the solicitor, pedestrians and vehicles to an unacceptable level of danger by distracting drivers from their primary duty to watch traffic and results in the delay and obstruction of the free flow of travel, and results in congestion and blockage of the streets, parking lot driveways, and sidewalks when such persons approach the vehicles to negotiate with the occupants. Distracted drivers are more prone to be involved in accidents, and accidents on the streets constitute a substantial traffic safety problem. 
    Solicitation within parking lots presents a potentially threatening environment and provides a greater opportunity for someone desiring to conceal his or her presence. People exiting or entering a vehicle are in a vulnerable position when approached by a solicitor and are exposed to reasonable fear for safety and the possibility of a carjacking, robbery or other person or property crime. Soliciting in a manner that is confrontational and involves conduct that is perceived by the person being solicited as harassing, coercing, or intimidating or which obstructs the free passage of that individual is detrimental to the quality of life and economic vitality of the community. 
    Soliciting at times and places where individuals feel particularly vulnerable, such as when it is dark or in the vicinity of automatic teller machines, causes the person being solicited to feel unsafe, which in turn leads to people who would be engaged in legitimate activities tending to avoid certain areas, resulting in a decline in business and community life and a possible increase in crime. This section is not intended to limit any person from exercising his or her constitutional right to solicit, picket, protest or engage in other constitutionally-protected activity, but rather to protect citizens from the fear and intimidation accompanying certain kinds of solicitations, and to eliminate a source of traffic hazards and delays. 
(b)  Definitions. Whenever the following words and phrases are used in this section, they shall have the following meanings: 
    Aggressive manner shall mean approaching or speaking to a person, or following a person before, during or after soliciting if that conduct is intended or is likely to cause a reasonable person to fear bodily harm to oneself or to another, or damage to or loss of property or otherwise feel threatened; continuing to solicit from a person after the person has given a negative response to such soliciting; intentionally or recklessly touching or causing physical contact with another person without that person(s consent in the course of soliciting; intentionally blocking or interfering with the safe or free passage of a pedestrian or vehicle; using violent or threatening gestures or language in conjunction with the solicitation; or engaging in any conduct intended to or likely to intimidate a person into responding affirmatively to the solicitation.

A solicitation shall be deemed complete when made whether or not an actual employment relationship is created, a transaction is completed, or an exchange of money or other property takes place. Except as otherwise provided in this section, soliciting shall not include passively standing or sitting with a sign or other indications that one is seeking donations without addressing the request to any specific person other than in response to an inquiry by that person. 
    Traffic island shall mean any area in the middle of any street or highway, designed to provide a barrier to keep traffic on one side of the street from going to the other side of the street, or which otherwise separates the traffic in opposite directions, and which may be a raised concrete strip or a grass strip. 
(c)  It shall be unlawful for any person to: 
(1)  Solicit in an aggressive manner in a public area; 
(2)  Solicit after sunset and before sunrise; 
(3)  Solicit in any public transportation vehicle, or within twenty (20) feet of any bus station or stop or taxi stand;

(6)  Solicit on private property if the owner, tenant or lawful occupant has asked the person not to solicit on their property, or has posted a sign clearly indicating that soliciting is not welcome on the property; 
(7)  Solicit any operator of a motor vehicle that is in traffic on a public street or highway, in exchange for cleaning the vehicle's windows, blocking, occupying or reserving a public parking space, directing the occupant to a public parking space, or otherwise; provided, however, that this paragraph shall not apply to services rendered in connection with emergency repairs requested by the operator or passengers of such vehicle; 
(8)  Solicit from a street or highway, traffic island, or the right-of-way at the side of any street or highway (including the shoulder, berm or boulevard); or

(d)  It is unlawful for any person to knowingly make a false or misleading representation in the course of soliciting a donation. It shall be unlawful for any person to solicit a donation stating that the funds are needed for a specific purpose and then spend the funds received for a different purpose. False or misleading representations include, but are not limited to, the following: 
(1)  Stating that the donation is needed to meet a specific need, when the solicitor already has sufficient funds to meet that need and does not disclose that fact; 
(2)  Stating that the donation is needed to meet a need which does not exist; 
(3)  Stating that the person soliciting is from out of town and stranded, or that he or she is homeless, when such is not true;

(5)  Wearing or displaying an indication of physical disability, when the person soliciting does not suffer the disability indicated; or 
(6)  Use of any makeup or device to simulate any deformity. 
(e)  The provisions of this section are severable. The invalidity of any clause, sentence, paragraph, or subdivision, or the invalidity of the application thereof to any person or circumstance shall not affect the validity of the remainder of this section or the validity of its application to other persons or circumstances. 
(f)  Nothing in this section shall limit or preclude the enforcement of other applicable laws.

(j)  The minimum mandatory penalty for a violation of subsection (g) which is the defendant's second offense shall be a fine of seventy-five dollars ($75.00), and, in the event that such violation is an offense subsequent to the second offense, then the minimum mandatory penalty shall be a fine of one hundred dollars ($100.00).

Editor's note- Ord. No. 2630, § 1, enacted Jan. 3, 1984, repealed former Arts. I-VI of Ch. 24, setting forth personnel regulations, and enacted in lieu thereof new Arts. I-VI as herein set out. Section 3 of said Ord. No. 2630 provided: 
"§ 3. To the extent required by principles of constitutional law, and by the established law with respect to implied contracts, the repeal of Articles I to VI of Chapter 24 as it existed prior to the effective date of this ordinance shall not accomplish any abridgement or diminution of the vested rights of employees of the City of Minot which may have accrued to them under the provisions of chapter 24 which are being repealed by this ordinance." 
Former Arts. I-VI were derived from the following legislation: Rev. Gen. Ords. 1962, §§ 13-0101-13-0108, 13-0201-13-0206, 13-0301-13-306, 13-0308-13-0310; Spec. Ords. 1962, Ch. 5, Art.

Secs. 24-32-24-35. - Reserved. 
DIVISION 2. - THE ANNUAL PLAN 

Sec. 24-36. - The annual plan. 
(a)  No later than June 1st of each year, the director shall prepare and submit an annual employees' classification and pay plan to the commission for its review and approval. The commission shall conduct a public meeting on the plan, which may be adjourned from time to time, wherein it shall consider and approve the plan with or without modifications. In addition to the usual notice given of public meetings, the director will provide an additional notice specifically addressed to municipal employees by such means as he shall choose which are reasonably designed to accomplish that purpose. The commission shall take final action with respect to the proposed annual plan within sixty (60) days of its receipt thereof. Thereafter, the plan shall be confirmed as submitted or modified and confirmed by the city council as part of the annual budget process. 
(b)  The annual plan shall consist of two (2) parts. The first being the job classification analysis and the second being the pay plan. 
(c)  The job classification analysis shall be based upon a study of the job descriptions for all employees currently employed by the city and a study of the job descriptions for positions which are currently authorized but vacant. To the maximum extent feasible, the analysis shall treat the work force of the city as a whole and shall disregard departmental boundaries. The purposes of the classification analysis shall be to set forth various categories or classes, each of which will consist of a number of job descriptions which are substantially similar to one another in terms of duties, responsibilities, authority, minimum qualifications, required skills, required knowledge, required character traits, and such other matters as might be deemed relevant. The various categories or classes shall be distinguished from one another to the extent feasible by suitable descriptive titles. Moreover, the various categories or classes shall be arranged in a numerical ranking system which shall take into account and which shall reflect the relative importance, difficulty and exclusivity of each category or classification with respect to all other categories or classifications. The numerical ranking system shall use consecutive numbers to indicate the relative ranking of the various classes or categories commencing with the number 1 for the lowest thereof. Each level of ranking to which a number is assigned is to be considered a "grade" to be known by the number assigned to that grade. 
(d)  The pay plan shall set forth the compensation which shall be paid to the employees of the city during the next ensuing fiscal year, including noncash benefits and severance pay, if any. It shall establish different levels of pay based upon grades and length of service. It shall take into account salaries being paid by competing employers and the city's ability to pay and shall be based upon two (2) general principles: 
(1)  The higher the grade the higher the pay; and 
(2)  The longer the service the more the pay. 
However, the pay plan may provide for one (1) principle being subordinated to the other, so that, for example, one (1) employee with longer service than a second employee may be paid more than the second employee even though the second employee occupies a higher grade than the first. 
(e)  After the annual plan has been confirmed by the city council with or without modification as provided for in subsection (a) hereof, it shall govern and establish the salaries to be paid to city employees during the fiscal year to which it pertains. During that fiscal year, no employee shall be paid in excess of the amount provided therein for the position which he occupies. However, nothing herein is to be construed as prohibiting an increase in pay to an employee resulting from a promotion received by him or attributable to attaining a higher step within a grade, as long as the promotion or step increase occurs in accordance with the provisions of this chapter and the rules and regulations established hereunder. 
(f)  Changes in classification with respect to a particular job description may be initiated by the director as part of the preparation of the annual plan or the process may be initiated at any time by the employee holding the position in question; provided, however, that in the latter case, the reclassification, if any, shall not take effect until approved by the commission, and the city auditor certifies that sufficient unencumbered monies are available in the appropriate accounts in the budget for the fiscal year during which the reclassification occurs to pay for any resulting salary increase. Reclassification may be based upon either one (1) of two (2) grounds: 
(1)  The job description adequately describes the job, but the relative ranking of the job is inappropriate when compared to other job descriptions in the same grade. 
(2)  The job description does not accurately reflect the knowledge and skills being used by the employee in the course of employment, or it does not reflect the duties and responsibility actually being discharged by the employee; and if the job description were rewritten accordingly, the job would be ranked at a different grade or the rewritten description would duplicate an existing description at a different grade. 
(g)  Instead of granting a request for a reclassification of a position currently occupied by an employee, the commission may, instead, if it deems it in the best interest of the service, require of the director that the provisions of this chapter pertaining to promotions, lateral transfers, or demotions be followed instead, including, if necessary, the declaration of a vacancy with respect to a position and the filling of that position by competitive examination, so that the intent and purpose of this chapter may not be frustrated through the device of administratively reassigning duties. In exercising its discretion under this subsection, the commission shall consider whether and to what extent the reclassification request comes about as the result of a gradual, evolutionary, and unanticipated change in the duties of a position. Nothing herein is to be construed as prohibiting the appointing authority from administratively changing the duties attributable to a position or to an employee, but, rather, this subsection addresses solely the consequences resulting from such administrative changes in duties. 
(h)  The city council may amend the annual plan during the course of the year to which it applies, provided that the proposed amendment has been submitted and approved by the commission. 
(Ord. No. 2630, § 1; Ord. No. 2936, § 1) 
Sec. 24-37. - Job descriptions. 
(a)  The director shall maintain detailed narrative job descriptions with respect to each distinct authorized position. The job description shall set forth characteristic duties and responsibilities attributable to a position and the minimum qualifications and desirable skills expected of the holder thereof. 
(b)  New job descriptions and substantial amendments to existing job descriptions must be approved by the city council as part of the annual plan or as an amendment thereto. 
(c)  No person shall be employed by the City of Minot unless he is hired with respect to a specific job description which has been approved by the city council and which has been classified as part of the annual plan or an amendment thereto approved by the city council unless: 
(1)  He is hired as an independent contractor; or 
(2)  He is hired under the authority of section 24-46 for a noncareer position.

ARTICLE V. - RECRUITMENT, PROMOTION, DEMOTION, TRANSFERS, TENURE, DISMISSAL, AND REDUCTION IN FORCE 

Sec. 24-41. - Filling vacancies. 
(a)  All vacancies in the service shall be filled by: 
(1)  The demotion, lateral transfers or promotion of a present employee; 
(2)  The rehiring of a former employee; or 
(3)  By the hiring of a new employee. 
(b)  (1)  A present employee of the city shall have a qualified preference to fill a vacancy before the vacancy is filled through the rehiring of a former employee or the hiring of a new employee. That is, present employees who are interested in the vacant position shall initially compete amongst themselves alone for the vacancy. The commission shall make a determination among such present employees as to who meets the minimum qualifications for the position and pursuant to subsection (c) below the commission shall determine what their comparative rankings are with respect to one another. This process of establishing comparative rankings in some cases may require taking into account that a particular employee is seeking a vacant position by way of a voluntary demotion or voluntary lateral transfer. In this regard see paragraph (2) of this subsection and subsection (c) below. Next the commission shall submit to the appointing authority a list of names of present employees eligible for appointment to the vacancy. In so doing it shall employ the formula set forth in subsection (d) of section 24-42 in order to establish how many names to the list and shall list the names in accordance with their order of comparative ranking, the highest first. The appointing authority may fill the vacancy from the list or it may reject all names thereon. If more than one vacancy is involved, the appointing authority may fill one or more vacancies from the list and yet retain the right to reject the remaining names thereon with respect to the remaining vacancies. If pursuant to this paragraph a present employee who bids for a vacant position is not selected for that position he may nevertheless compete for the same position with the applicants who compete for the position pursuant to section 24-42 (assuming that the position is not filled by another present employee or by the rehiring of a former employee), but in that instance he is entitled to no special preference by virtue of being a present city employee. 
(2)  Paragraph (1) shall not apply to those positions identified by the commission as entrance level positions, nor to department head positions, so that, consequently, city employees and non-employees alike may apply for such positions on an equal footing. 
(3)  To the extent a vacancy is to be filled from among present employees, preference shall be given to demotions over lateral transfers and to lateral transfers over promotions. If the vacancy is to be filed by a demotion, the following descending order of preference shall be observed: Demotions as part of a reduction in force, demotions for the good of the service, demotion of a probationary employee and voluntary demotions. If the vacancy is to be filled by a lateral transfer the following descending order of preference will be observed: Lateral transfer as a part of a reduction in force, lateral transfer for the good of the service, lateral transfer of a probationary employee, voluntary lateral transfer and lateral transfer for disciplinary reasons. 
(4)  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in paragraphs (1) and (2) above, the appointing authority must fill a vacancy by demotion or lateral transfer if that action is required by section 24-50 pertaining to reduction in force or if an applicant seeks a voluntary demotion or voluntary transfer to a position when no one with higher priority under this subsection seeks the same position and all affected department heads consent. 
(c)  The commission shall promulgate suitable regulations, rules and procedures to implement the system of priorities set forth in subsection (b). These regulations shall also set forth a means whereby comparative rankings can be established among employees in the same category who are eligible for a vacant position, such as, for example, when more than one employee is seeking a lateral transfer to a vacancy. The comparative ranking system shall take into account each employee's performance evaluations and length of service, and may take into account the results of tests or criteria similar to those provided for in section 24-42(c). 
(d)  If a vacancy is filled by the rehiring of a former employee or the hiring of a new employee the procedures set forth in sections 24-43 and 24-42 respectively shall be followed. 
(e)  In all cases where a vacancy becomes available for filling the director shall see that suitable public notice of the vacancy is given. The notice will include the title of the position, if any, the job description for the position (which may be summarized), the classification of and the minimum and maximum salary attributable to the position, and appropriate information as to how an interested applicant may obtain further particulars. The public notice shall be made in the manner most reasonable under the circumstances. For example, if it appears to the director that it is very likely that the position will be filled by a present city employee then at least initially the notice need only be posted on city bulletin boards and distributed among city employees without publication of the notice in a newspaper of general circulation. 
(Ord. No. 2630, § 1; Ord. No. 3965, § 1) 
Sec. 24-42. - Hiring new employees. 
(a)  If a vacancy in the service is not filled by a present employee or by the rehiring of an employee who is eligible for rehiring as a matter of right, then the appointing authority may choose an employee from among names of applicants submitted to him by the director in accordance with the following procedures, or he may choose to leave the position vacant. 
(b)  The appointing authority shall indicate to the director whether he wishes to choose an employee from the existing eligibility list established with respect to the position, if any, or whether he wishes the director to create a new eligibility list for that position. 
(c)  An eligibility list shall be established with respect to a position as follows: The commission will establish and approve appropriate tests and criteria to be used to evaluate employment applicants with respect to each position, based upon the contents of the job description pertaining thereto, including specifically the minimum qualifications stated therein. The tests may be written, oral, physical or in the form of a demonstration of skill or any combination of these. The tests and criteria shall be designed to evaluate elements of training, experience, aptitude, knowledge, character, personality, skill, physical fitness or other qualifications. In any event, the tests and criteria to be administered must be reasonably designed to relate positively to actual job performance with respect to the position for which the tests are given and the criteria applied, in order that the tests shall not serve as a means whereby job applicants are unlawfully discriminated against on the grounds of race, color, religion, sex, age or national origin. 
(d)  The commission shall rank applicants one against the other based upon the results of the tests referred to in subsection (c) and the list of the names of the applicants set forth in the order of their respective rankings, with the highest ranked first, shall constitute the eligibility list for the position for which the tests were administered. The appointing authority may consider for appointment three (3) names on the list for the first vacancy to be filled, plus two (2) names for each vacancy thereafter, but the names subject to consideration for appointment must be selected in consecutive numerical order commencing with the first. 
(e)  The commission may provide with respect to certain classes of positions that no tests of the type provided for in subsection (c) be administered, as when, for example, the position requires as a prerequisite that the applicant possess a professional degree or professional credentials. Likewise the commission may provide that certain positions be filled by the appointing authority on the basis of personal interviews only, because the nature of the position does not easily permit the applicant to be evaluated in an objective manner, but rather selection must take into account intangible aspects of character and personality. 
(f)  If in the judgement of the commission it will promote the efficiency of the service to maintain permanent eligibility lists with respect to some positions it may do so, without prejudice, however, to the right of the appointing authority at any time to require that a new eligibility list be established with respect to a position wherein there is a vacancy which the appointing authority wishes to fill. The permanent eligibility list may either be frozen or floating. That is, a frozen list is one to which no new names are added until some predetermined event occurs such as the number of the names on the list dropping to a certain prescribed level or after the passage of a prescribed period of time. A floating list is one in which names are added and ranked from time to time as persons submit applications for employment and take examinations, which procedure the commission may authorize even though no vacancies may exist in the positions for which employment is sought. If the commission does establish a permanent eligibility list it may strike names therefrom at any time upon its determination that good cause exists to do so. The nature of such good cause shall be established by the commission by appropriate rules and regulations but at a minimum these rules and regulations will provide that the name of a person on a permanent eligibility list shall be struck if that person: 
(1)  Obtains city employment, 
(2)  Refuses an offer of city employment, 
(3)  Can no longer be contacted after a reasonably diligent effort to do so, 
(4)  Can no longer meet minimum qualifications for the position to which the list refers, 
(5)  Requests elimination from the list, or 
(g)  The director shall have the authority to prescribe the contents of job application forms. As part of the initial job application process he may make a determination whether the applicant meets certain minimum employment standards which by way of rules and regulations established by the commission shall be imposed upon all job applicants irrespective of the position applied for. The minimum employment standards may include, by way of example, a requirement that the applicant be literate in the English language or that the applicant shall never have been convicted of a felony. However, such standards must be reasonably job related so that they do not serve as a means of unlawful discrimination against job applicants on the grounds of race, color, religion, sex, age or national origin. An applicant who cannot meet all the minimum employment standards shall not be considered further for employment nor shall he be permitted to take employment tests with respect to a position until such time as he can meet the minimum employment standards. 
(h)  Any person, not an employee of the city, may appeal to the commission from a decision made under the authority of this section by the director or by the appointing authority, which decision is adverse to the party making the appeal or which is otherwise claimed to prejudice him. 
(Ord. No. 2630, § 1; Ord. No. 2801, § 1) 
Sec. 24-43. - Reemployment. 
    The director shall maintain a register of employees who are entitled to reemployment as a matter of right, comprised of those persons who were discharged from city employment solely on the basis of a reduction in force. The register shall set forth the position which each employee thereon last held. Thereafter, the director shall recall to employment persons whose names appear on the list as appropriate vacancies occur. The commission shall, by rules and regulations established by it, determine the order in which employees shall be recalled to employment, which rules and regulations may be based upon respective performance evaluations, respective lengths of service, respective dates of discharge, or any combination of these. An employee who is eligible for recall as a matter of right shall not be recalled to fill a vacancy if a present employee of the city who is afforded preference to the position under 24-41 (b) is willing to fill the position. The commission, by rules and regulations, may provide for the removal of names from the reemployment register in the same manner and for the same reasons that names are removed from an eligibility list. 
(Ord. No. 2630, § 1; Ord. No. 3175, § 1) 
Sec. 24-44. - Veterans' preference. 
(a)  Any applicant for a position who is a veteran of the armed forces to the United States who was not dishonorably discharged therefrom, and who served in such forces during a period of war, shall have five (5) points added to his test results provided for in 24-41(c) or 24-42(c), unless he is disabled by a service-connected disability, in which case he shall have ten (10) points added to the test results. 
(b)  "Period of war" means any of those time periods specified in NDCC 37-01-40. 
(Ord. No. 2630, § 1; Ord. No. 3568, § 1) 
Sec. 24-45. - Nondiscrimination. 
    It is the policy of this city not to discriminate unlawfully against any person in regard to employment on the grounds of race, color, religion, sex, age or national origin. 
(Ord. No. 2630, § 1) 
Sec. 24-46. - Special appointments. 
(a)  Not withstanding anything in sections 24-41 through 24-43 to the contrary, the appointing authority exercising his sole authority alone, may hire a person to fill a vacancy in any position as long as he does so subject to the limitations set forth in the following subsections. 
(b)  A person may be hired to fill a vacancy in any position as a provisional employee, that is, for a period of time consisting of not more than ninety (90) consecutive days. No person shall be hired as a provisional employee more than twice with respect to the same position. 
(c)  A person may be hired as a non-career employee to fill a vacancy in a position which is specifically identified and approved by the city council in the budget as being a non-career position. 
(d)  Nothing in this section shall be construed as allowing the appointing authority to disregard the minimum qualifications established for a particular position or to disregard the minimum employment standards established for all positions of city employment. 
(e)  Service with the city as a result of a special appointment pursuant to this section shall not be credited as a period of city employment for purposes of establishing pension rights, seniority rights, longevity pay increases, or any other right or benefit which is dependent in whole or in part upon length of service. Nor shall it be considered as part of a period of probationary employment except as provided in subsection (f). 
(f)  An employee holding a position by virtue of a special appointment under this section shall be treated as a probationary employee for purposes of dismissal, lateral transfer, or demotion. 
(g)  An employee appointed pursuant to this section, is not considered an employee for purposes of sections 24-41, 24-43, 24-62, 24-63, 24-64, 24-65, 24-66, 24-67, 24-68, 24-69, 24-70, Division 2 of Article VI, or section 24-113, except that if required to work on a holiday he shall be paid accordingly. However a person not already an employee who is appointed to a position pursuant to subsection (b) is considered an employee for purposes of the sections just mentioned when and if he secures a permanent appointment to the same position, with benefits to relate back to the date of the provisional appointment. 
(Ord. No. 2630, § 1) 
Sec. 24-47. - Tenure; termination of employment. 
(a)  Employment with the city once initiated will continue until it is terminated pursuant to subsection (b) hereof. 
(b)  Employment with the city shall terminate on any one of the following grounds: 
(1)  The employee reaches mandatory retirement age; 
(2)  Before reaching the mandatory retirement age the employee dies or voluntarily quits city employment in order to retire or to pursue other employment;

(3)  An employee who is a probationary employee as a result of a promotion may be demoted to a grade not less than the one occupied prior to promotion. 
(c)  The appointing authority may take the actions authorized in subsection (b) because in his sole judgment, which is not subject to review, there exists one of the following grounds for so doing: 
(1)  The job performance of the probationary employee is not satisfactory; 
(2)  The action is required as a part of a reduction in force;

(a)  A reduction in force is a decrease in the number of city employees which is accomplished in a manner other than through a combination of natural attrition and limitations on hiring. Reductions in force shall be of two kinds, temporary and permanent. 
(b)  A temporary reduction in force results in the temporary layoffs of employees. That is, a laid-off employee is not dismissed from city employment but rather for a temporary period of time he is not called upon to perform work for the city, during which time he earns no pay. A laid-off employee shall be subject to recall to active employment upon not less than seven (7) days notice. Periods during which an employee is laid off pursuant to this subsection shall not be counted as periods of employment for purposes of determining pension rights and benefits, seniority or any other benefit dependent in whole or in part upon length of service, nor shall the period during which a worker is laid off count as part of a probationary period. 
(c)  A permanent reduction in force results in the permanent dismissal or permanent demotion of employees, or both. It may also involve lateral transfers. 
(d)  The appointing authority may implement a reduction in force whenever: 
(1)  A reduction is required because of fiscal reasons such as, for example, when there is an unanticipated shortfall in projected tax receipts or other revenues, or both, or when the amount budgeted in any one fiscal year for salaries is inadequate to maintain previously existing staff levels and to pay salaries in accordance with the applicable annual plan; or 
(2)  Whenever there is insufficient worthwhile work to keep all members of the city work force fully occupied. 
(e)  Whenever the number of available positions in a table of organization is reduced, or city council approval of a particular job description is withdrawn, in such a manner that one or more employees becomes redundant, the appointing authority shall accomplish an appropriate reduction in force to eliminate the redundancy. 
(f)  The commission shall establish rules, regulations and procedures to govern the order of temporary layoffs. The rules shall address such matters as whether layoffs and recalls shall be made on the basis of comparative lengths of service, or comparative performance evaluations, or both. At a minimum the rule shall provide that with respect to employees sharing the same job description layoffs shall occur in the following order, to wit, employees holding a position by a special appointment under section 24-46, probationary employees, all other employees. 
(g)  The order in which employees are dismissed, demoted, or laterally transferred as part of a permanent reduction in force shall be established by the commission through appropriate rules and regulations. However, at a minimum, the rules and regulations shall observe the following principles: 
(1)  To the extent feasible the reduction in force shall be accomplished by demotions and lateral transfers in preference to dismissals; 
(2)  If the question should arise with respect to two (2) or more employees who share the same job description or the same classification grade as to the order in which they are to be dismissed, demoted, or transferred, the decision shall be based upon the employees' comparative length of service, and if these should prove to be equal, then the decision should be based upon the employee's comparative performance evaluations, except that a permanent employee shall displace a probationary employee in the same job description, notwithstanding the fact that the probationary employee may have superior performance evaluations or greater length of service; 
(3)  Demotions and lateral transfers shall be only of the following types which are listed hereafter in decreasing order of preference: 
a.  A lateral transfer to a preexisting vacancy in a permanent position; 
b.  A lateral transfer to a position in the same department wherein the employee served immediately prior to the transfer, or to a position formerly held by the employee in another department, if the incumbent thereof is subject to displacement by the transferred employee under the principles set forth in subparagraph (2) above; 
c.  A demotion to the highest position within the department in which the demoted employee served immediately prior to his demotion from which the incumbent is subject to displacement by the demoted employee under the principles set forth in subparagraph (2) above, unless the demoted employee would be entitled to a position with a higher classification pursuant to d below, in which case d shall govern; 
d.  A demotion to the highest position formerly held by the demoted employee in a department other than the department wherein the demoted employee served immediately prior to the demotion, from which the incumbent is subject to displacement by the demoted employee under the principles set forth in subparagraph (2) above; 
e.  A demotion or lateral transfer to a special appointment position as described in section 24-46 even though the incumbent thereof is displaced; 
(4)  If in the course of applying the principles set forth in subparagraph (3) above it should appear that two (2) or more employees are eligible for a position by virtue of a lateral transfer or demotion thereto, then the decision as to which of these employees shall obtain the position shall be made on the basis of the principles set forth in subparagraph (2) above; 
(5)  No person shall be demoted or laterally transferred to a position for which he does not meet the minimum requirements set forth in the job description pertaining to that position as of the time of the demotion or transfer. 
(h)  As long as he observes the rules and regulations provided for in subsection (f) and subsection (g), and subject to budgetary constraints, the appointing authority in implementing a permanent or temporary reduction in force shall have the discretion to determine how and to what extent the reduction in force shall be spread across the various departments of city government. However if the city council has as part of a mandated reduction in force prescribed a specific table of organization to be achieved, or if the city council has specifically abolished certain positions by limiting the number thereof or by withdrawing the approval of the job description pertaining thereto, the appointing authority shall implement the action taken by the city council. 
(i)  Nothing in this section shall be construed as prohibiting the city council from directing or the appointing authority from accomplishing on his own authority a decrease in the number of employees through natural attrition combined with restrictions on the hiring of new employees. 
(Ord. No. 2630, § 1) 
Sec. 24-51. - Demotion, lateral transfer or dismissal for the good of the service. 
(a)  An employee may be dismissed, laterally transferred or demoted for the good of the service on any one or more of the following grounds: 
(1)  He suffers from mental or physical disability, or both, to such an extent that he can no longer adequately fulfill the duties of his position; 
(2)  The employee no longer maintains the necessary technical credentials or minimum qualifications required with respect to the position which he holds; or 
(3)  The employee is unable or unwilling to satisfactorily discharge the duties of his position. 
(b)  The appointing authority shall make the initial determination whether a dismissal, lateral transfer, or demotion for the good of the service should be ordered with respect to the particular employee. Before ordering such action he will meet with the employee and explain to him the nature of the action to be taken and the reasons for such action. If requested he shall provide the employee with adequate time in which to prepare an argument or explanation as to why the proposed action is inappropriate, to which statement he will give careful consideration before taking final action. If the appointing authority proceeds with dismissal, demotion, or lateral transfer the affected employee has the right to request that the commission consider the matter anew at a hearing held for that purpose. At such hearing the appointing authority will have the burden with going forward with the evidence and the burden of persuasion with respect to whether there are adequate grounds for dismissal, lateral transfer, or demotion under this section. The commission shall either affirm or reverse the decision of the appointing authority but it may not modify the decision, such as, for example, by ordering demotion in lieu of dismissal. 
(c)  Any demotion ordered by the appointing authority shall only be made if it can be made by filling a pre-existing vacancy and then only if it can be made in conformity with the rules established under the authority of section 24-41(c), or alternatively if it can be made with respect to a position which is occupied by a probationary employee or special appointment employee as described in section 24-46. Otherwise the appointing authority shall order dismissal.

(c)  Nothing herein is to be construed as requiring or permitting the dismissal of an employee by virtue of subsection (a) if the disqualifying relationship first comes about or occurs after the employee is appointed to a position with the city and while he is employed by the city. 
(Ord. No. 2630, § 1) 
Sec. 24-53. - Promotional ladders. 
    Notwithstanding anything in this chapter to the contrary, the commission may approve the interconnection of related job descriptions into a "promotional ladder" whereby an employee in one position in the ladder may progress to a higher position in the ladder without competing against other applicants for that position. An example of such a promotional ladder is the progression from police patrolman to senior police patrolman. The commission shall establish rules and regulations to govern the use of promotional ladders which at a minimum shall provide that progression up the ladder is dependent upon satisfactory job performance as determined by the employee's department head, who shall have the sole discretion to make that determination, and which rules and regulations may provide that the employee pass certain competency tests prescribed by the commission.

    If after completing the procedure for the administrative determination of grievances provided for in section 24-101, the employee having the grievance is still dissatisfied with the administrative action taken, if any, with respect to his grievance, he may present the matter to the commission for its review which shall be final and not subject to further review by any court of law. 
(Ord. No. 2630, § 1) 
Sec. 24-103. - Standard of review. 
    The person or persons hearing and determining a grievance pursuant to the authority of section 24-101, or the commission acting pursuant to the authority of section 24-102, shall have the full power and authority to reverse or to modify, as well as to affirm, a decision giving rise to a grievance if he or it concludes that the decision is based upon a misinterpretation or misunderstanding of applicable constitutional principles, both state and federal, or of North Dakota statutory provisions, or of ordinances, regulations, rules, formal procedures, or formal statements of policy of the City of Minot. However if the decision which gives rise to a grievance is a decision which involves the exercise of a discretionary judgment on the part of the person making the decision, and it fairly appears that the person making the decision has been entrusted with or delegated the power to exercise his discretion in making such a decision, then the decision shall be reversed only in the event there is a demonstrated abuse of discretion, on which issue the grieving employee shall have the burden of persuasion. 
(Ord. No. 2630, § 1) 
Sec. 24-104. - Grievance procedure limited. 
    Notwithstanding anything in this division to the contrary, if this chapter elsewhere provides that a decision affecting an employee is to be reviewed in a certain manner, such as is provided in Article V with respect to the dismissal or demotion of an employee for the good of the service, for example, then such other procedure shall be exclusive so that the grievance procedure of this division is inapplicable.

DIVISION 3. - EMPLOYEE DISCIPLINE 

Sec. 24-111. - Disciplinary regulations. 
    The commission shall establish disciplinary regulations. These regulations will be of two (2) types, the first type being substantive regulations which set forth the type of behavior which is either prohibited or required on the part of an employee, the breach or nonobservance of which by the employee may form the basis for disciplinary action against him. For example, the regulations may prohibit insubordination, chronic tardiness, making false claims or reports, etc. The second type shall constitute procedural rules with respect to the imposition of discipline. At a minimum the procedural rules of discipline shall provide that the employee's constitutional rights of due process are observed, particularly including the principle that no employee shall be subject to punishment for behavior which is not reasonably identified in the substantive rules of discipline as being the sort of behavior which can give rise to disciplinary action. Moreover the rules and regulations shall provide that with respect to all disciplinary actions taken against an employee, there shall be a right of appeal by the employee to the city manager, or alternatively, that before disciplinary punishment is imposed with respect to an employee the city manager must concur that there are adequate grounds therefor and that the punishment to be imposed is appropriate under the circumstances. 
(Ord. No. 2630, § 1) 
Sec. 24-112. - Allowable disciplinary punishments. 
(a)  Employees may be subject to any one or more of the following disciplinary punishments in accordance with the rules and regulations authorized under section 24-111: 
(1)  Dismissal; 
(2)  Lateral transfer; 
(3)  Suspension without pay; 
(4)  A temporary decrease in pay in an amount not to exceed twenty (20) per cent of the amount of gross pay which the employee would be receiving in the absence of disciplinary punishment for a period of time not to exceed one hundred eighty (180) consecutive calendar days; 
(5)  Adjustment in performance evaluations; or 
(6)  A letter of reprimand to be included in the employee's personnel file. 
(b)  A lateral transfer for disciplinary reasons may only be made to a preexisting vacancy and then only in accordance with the rules promulgated under the authority of section 24-41(c). 
(Ord. No. 2630, § 1) 
Sec. 24-113. - Review by the commission. 
(a)  An employee who has been subjected to disciplinary action resulting in the imposition of disciplinary punishment may appeal to the commission. The commission shall have the authority to reverse the determination that there is cause to impose disciplinary punishment, and may remit the punishment, or it may find that there are grounds for imposing disciplinary punishment but that the punishment imposed should be modified, in which case it shall so order. 
(b)  The procedures whereby an employee may appeal to the commission from an adverse decision with respect to whether disciplinary action should be taken against him, which disciplinary action has led to the imposition of disciplinary punishment, shall be identical to the procedures involved in presenting a grievance to the commission, except that in all respects the appointing authority shall have the burden of going forward with evidence and the burden or persuasion with respect to the factual issues which arise, which issues will be determined by the commission de novo. Furthermore, once the commission has arrived at a decision the employee shall be considered to have exhausted his administrative remedies for purposes of applying the legal doctrine which requires the exhaustion of administrative remedies as a prerequisite to judicial review. To the extent permitted under the general law of the state the decisions of the commission under this division shall be subject to judicial review.

DIVISION 3. - ALARMS 

Sec. 27-51. - Legislative intent and purpose. 
    Public safety personnel are required to respond to every alarm signal given by an alarm and received by Minot Central Dispatch. To the extent they are required to respond [to] the false alarms, there results a waste of manpower and resources which could better be directed to other purposes. Consequently, the city council desires to enact a regulatory program concerning the maintenance and use of alarms which directly or indirectly result in a call or signal being received by Minot Central Dispatch, which call or signal is intended to produce a response from public safety personnel. The purposes thought to be accomplished in so doing include the following: 
(a)  To require that certain alarms used in the manner just mentioned be designed, manufactured, maintained and operated in accordance with appropriate specifications. 
(b)  To prohibit devices which unnecessarily tie up Minot Central Dispatch telephone lines. 
(c)  To impose sanctions against persons who, through their negligence, are responsible for the occurrence of an excessive number of false alarms. 
(d)  To require greater assistance from the persons who use such alarms in responding to alarms. 
(Ord. No. 2380, § 1; Ord. No. 3206, § 1; Ord. No. 4129, § 1) 
Sec. 27-52. - Definitions. 
    [The following terms, when used in this division, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this section, except where context clearly indicates a different meaning:] 
(a)  Alarm means a mechanical or electronic device which is designed to detect the occurrence of a given event and to provide notice of such occurrence by means of a signal of some sort (the alarm signal). 
(b)  Automatic dialing alarm means a remote alarm which sends its alarm signal, without any human intervention, through the use of incoming telephone lines at Minot Central Dispatch which are customarily used for voice communication, and the call switching facilities of a local telephone company. 
(c)  Excessive false alarms means more than eleven (11) false alarms given by the same alarm within a calendar year period. For purposes of this division 3 (alarms) ordinance, a calendar year period is defined as commencing on January 1 and continuing through December 31, inclusive, of each applicable yearly period. 
(d)  False alarm means the giving of an alarm signal by an alarm which indicates the occurrence of the event which the alarm is designed to detect and give notice of, when in fact no such event has happened at the time that the alarm signal is given. 
(e)  Local alarm means an alarm which does not operate, even in part, as a remote alarm. 
(f)  Permittee means the person who owns or controls premises protected by a remote alarm for which a permit is required under section 27-53. 
(g)  Remote alarm is an alarm which is an integral part of a prearranged plan whereby an alarm signal originating with the alarm will be communicated forthwith to the city central dispatch, by such means as, for example, a direct connection, an automatic dialing device, or being relayed by a human. 
(Ord. No. 2380, § 1; Ord. No. 3081, §§ 2, 3; Ord. No. 3206, § 1; Ord. No. 4129, § 1; Ord. No. 4634, § 1) 
Sec. 27-53. - Permit required for remote alarm. 
(a)  No person other than an employee or agent of the city shall interconnect a remote alarm to, or set up an arrangement whereby a remote alarm will communicate to, the city central dispatch, without first receiving a written permit from the chief of police. 
(b)  The application for a remote alarm permit shall be on forms provided by the chief of police, which shall require the applicant for the permit to provide the following information: 
(1)  The name and mailing address of the permittee; 
(2)  The street address of the premises being served by the remote alarm; 
(3)  The home and business telephone number for the permittee and other persons who can act on behalf of the permittee to assist the police in responding to alarms originating from the permittee's remote alarm; 
(4)  The name and model of the remote alarm for which the permit is sought, the name and business address of the person who will be installing the alarm and the name and address of the person maintaining the alarm, if different from the installer; and 
(5)  Such other information as the chief of police might reasonably require to further the purposes of this division, including, specifically, information which would permit the chief of police to determine whether it is likely that the permittee will be able to conform to the requirements imposed pursuant to subsection (c) below. 
(c)  The chief of police may grant a permit conditionally, that is, subject to requirements which must be met by the permittee in order for the permit to remain valid. Among the requirements which may be imposed are the following: 
(1)  Specifications as to the design and manufacture of the alarm, either generically or by way of approved brand name; 
(2)  Specifications as to the testing and mechanical maintenance of alarms subsequent to their installation, such as, for example, requirements that certain prescribed preventive maintenance be performed at certain prescribed intervals; 
(3)  Requirements that the applicant's employees be given appropriate training and instruction to the operation of the alarm so as to lessen the incidence of false alarms attributable to human error as opposed to mechanical malfunction; 
(4)  Requirements that the permittee or some other person authorized to act on his behalf be available customarily and promptly to assist the police in responding to alarms, such as, for example, in order that the police may speedily gain access to locked premises without being required to accomplish a forcible entry thereof; and 
(5)  Such other reasonable requirements as may be useful in accomplishing the purposes of this division. 
(d)  A permit once granted shall be in effect for the calendar year in which the permit is granted; provided, however, that the permit may be revoked by the chief of police if: 
(1)  The alarm is permanently disconnected or abandoned, or title thereto is transferred; 
(2)  The permittee does not meet the requirements imposed by the chief of police pursuant to subsection (c) above; 
(3)  The permittee fails to make timely payment of permit charges imposed by subsection (e) below; or 
(4)  The alarm is a source of an excessive number of false alarms. 
(e)  There shall be imposed an initial fee of thirty dollars ($30.00) for the issuance of a remote alarm permit for each calendar year. Moreover, if the alarm for which the permit is issued should originate or should be used for the origination of a false alarm, the permittee shall pay a fee in accordance with the following schedule for the privilege of retaining the permit, unless the permit is being terminated pursuant to [subsection] (d)(4). (The applicable one-year period with respect to any one (1) false alarm to be used in order to compute the fee payable pursuant to the following schedule shall commence from the date one (1) year prior to the occurrence of the false alarm.): 
(1)  For the first false alarm response in a calendar year, no charge shall be imposed; 
(2)  For the second and any subsequent false alarm responses in a calendar year, the sum of fifty dollars ($50.00) per each false alarm occurrence will be imposed. 
(f)  Before terminating a license or imposing a permit fee pursuant to subsection (e) hereof, the chief of police shall ensure that the permittee is given the benefit of appropriate procedural rights inherent in the concept of due process, including, at a minimum, reasonable prior notice of the action to be taken, the alleged basis therefor, and an opportunity for a hearing. 
(g)  The denial or termination of a permit by the chief of police may be appealed first to the city manager and then, if necessary, thereafter to the city council. 
(h)  The chief of police may waive the occurrence of a false alarm if it is demonstrated to his satisfaction that the reason for the false alarm was mechanical in nature, and not operator error; provided that, however, no such waiver may be given without written proof, such as an invoice for repair services and proof of payment, that the mechanical malfunction has been corrected.

Sec. 27-54. - Automatic dialing alarms. 
(a)  No person shall use an automatic dialing alarm unless the alarm is so designed and constructed that it automatically breaks the telephone connection which it establishes with a city incoming telephone line within three (3) minutes of establishing such connection. 
(b)  No person shall program or permit an automatic dialing alarm to be programmed so as to call the "911" emergency telephone number. 
(Ord. No. 2380, § 1; Ord. No. 3081, § 4; Ord. No. 3206, § 1; Ord. No. 4129, § 1) 
Sec. 27-55. - False alarms. 
(a)  No person shall knowingly activate any alarm for the purpose of summoning public emergency response personnel to the premises protected by the alarm unless, under an objective good faith standard, he reasonably believes that under the circumstances then known to him, it is appropriate to summon public emergency response personnel. 
(b)  If a remote alarm has been designated by agreement between the city police force and the remote alarm permittee to be used only to indicate the occurrence of a particular crime or particular type of crime, no person with prior knowledge of the agreement shall knowingly activate the alarm for the purpose of summoning police to the premises protected by the alarm unless, under an objective good faith standard, he reasonably believes the particular crime or type of crime is being committed. For example, a "panic button" intended to signal the on-going commission of an armed robbery shall be not used to signal the commission of an act of shoplifting. 
(c)  No person shall, without a valid alarm permit, have an alarm (except a fire alarm or alarm attached to a vehicle) that summons by activation emergency personnel. The owner of an alarm that does not have a valid alarm permit for each calendar year will be responsible for a fifty dollar ($50.00) fee per each alarm occurrence.

(Rev. Gen. Ords. 1962, § 18-0501; Ord. No. 4852, § 1) 
Sec. 28-2. - Openings into streets and sidewalks not to be kept open or unguarded. 
    It shall be unlawful for any person in the city to leave or keep open, uncovered, or unguarded any cellar door, pit, grating, vault, or subterranean passage opening from, into, or upon any street, alley, sidewalk, or public ground within the city. It shall also be unlawful for any person to suffer any such cellar door or vault, grating, or other opening or place of like nature connected with the premises owned or occupied by him to remain in an insecure or other unsafe condition so that persons may fall into it or be otherwise injured. 
(Rev. Gen. Ords. 1962, § 18-0329) 
Sec. 28-3. - Permanent encroachment in public right-of-way; council approval required; street vacation fee. 
(a)  No person shall construct or maintain any permanent encroachment within the public right-of-way except as specifically allowed by the city council. The city council may grant permission for permanent encroachment by grant of a permanent license or revocable permit and in either instance subject to such terms and conditions, including the imposition of a reasonable fee or rent, as the council chooses to impose. 
(b)  The term "permanent encroachment" as used in this section does not mean those improvements within the public right-of-way which are constructed pursuant to the grant of a franchise by the city council and which are ordinarily located within the public right-of-way as part of the carrying on of the franchised activity, such as, for example, the erection of telegraph lines or poles or the burying of underground cable. Neither does the term apply to the construction of city utility services or the construction of curbs, sidewalks, or the planting of boulevard trees. 
(c)  Subsection (b) is not to be read as repealing other sections of this Code of Ordinances which require permission from city authorities for the conduct of certain activities within the public right-of-way, such as, for example, section 29-4 of the Code of Ordinances which requires a permit from the city forester in order to plant a tree in the boulevard. 
(d)  An applicant for the vacation of a street, alley, or other public way shall pay to the city clerk an administrative fee of one hundred dollars ($100.00) at the time of application. In addition, at his own expense, he shall furnish the city clerk with such title memoranda as the city clerk may require in order to verify the status of persons purporting to be landowners adjoining the area sought to be vacated. The city clerk shall defer processing the application until the requirements of this subsection have been met. 
(e)  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in subsections (a) through (d) of this section, a landowner may, without a permit, construct and maintain an underground watering system within the public right-of-way abutting or crossing over his property. However, no part thereof (other than one supply lateral running from the watermain in the right-of-way to the underground watering system) shall be located in or under the paved portion or traveled portion of the public right-of-way (whichever is the more restrictive). As used herein, the "paved portion" shall not include sidewalks. Further, the landowner's interest in such an underground watering system is hereby declared, as a matter of positive law, to be subordinate to the interest of the public in the right-of-way, with the following consequences: 
(1)  No claim or cause of action shall lie against the City of Minot (including its employees, agents, or contractors), or against any of its franchisees (or their employees, agents, or contractors), for any damage to or loss of the underground watering system (or any part thereof), caused or occasioned by such persons acting within the scope of their duties or authority in respect to the public right of way, saving and excepting only acts done with malice or with extreme recklessness; and 
(2)  The City of Minot and its franchisees shall have the right to make further improvements, or to modify existing improvements, in the public right of way, in such a manner as to displace or to cause the removal of the underground watering system, or parts thereof, without being required to pay compensation to the landowner, even though such forced displacement or forced removal is undertaken merely as a matter of convenience to the city or to its franchisee (as the case may be), and not as a matter of necessity.

(2)  The application shall include those items described in subsection (c) of this section. 
(3)  The application shall state the reason the encroachment is being requested. 
(4)  Before approving an encroachment agreement, a hearing must be held by the city council, after notice of the application and of the hearing is given. The decision of the city council is final for purposes of the legal doctrine which requires exhaustion of administrative remedies as a prerequisite for judicial review. 
(5)  An encroachment agreement with property owners (and lessees, where applicable) may only be executed by the planning director after a hearing on the application and approval by vote of a majority of the members of the review committee in attendance. An application for an encroachment agreement with property owners (and lessees, where applicable) may only be approved if the city council determines that the encroachment can be allowed without detriment to the health, safety and welfare of the general public. In determining what constitutes detriment to the health, safety and welfare of the general public, the following factors, among others not specifically enumerated, shall be considered: 
a.  The location, type and size of the encroachment, including the encroaching structure(s) or merchandise. 
b.  The proximity of the encroaching structure(s) or merchandise to a traveled road, whether public or private. 
c.  Whether the encroaching tables, chairs or other structure(s) will unreasonably interfere with pedestrian or vehicular passage or safety. 
d.  Whether the encroaching tables, chairs, or other structure(s) will interfere with an existing water or wastewater line, storm water facility or other utility. 
(6)  The city council shall set forth the reason for granting or denying an encroachment pursuant to this section. The terms of an encroachment agreement shall include, but not be limited, to the following: 
a.  The agreement shall be subject to termination upon thirty (30) days' notice at such time as the city council may deem the encroachment, including activities associated with the encroachment, to create a safety hazard to pedestrians or vehicular traffic or other safety hazard or a public nuisance or otherwise not be in keeping with the health, safety and welfare of the general public. 
b.  The owner (and lessee, where applicable) obtaining the encroachment agreement shall agree that, upon such termination, if the owner (or lessee, where applicable) shall fail to remove the encroachment within thirty (30) days following the giving of the notice by the city in accordance with subsection (6)a. of this section, the city shall be authorized to remove the encroaching structure(s) and recover all costs associated therewith from the property owner. 
c.  The property owner (and lessee, if applicable) shall agree to indemnify and hold harmless the city from any and all liability that may arise by virtue of the encroachment, including, but not limited to, compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act, the IBC and all other health and safety laws and regulations. The applicant shall provide and maintain a certificate of insurance for comprehensive general liability and products and complete operations coverage in a minimum amount of one million dollars ($1,000,000.00) per occurrence. All certificates shall be issued by an insurance company authorized to do business in North Dakota, shall name the city as additional insured and shall provide that the policy shall not terminate or be canceled prior to the expiration date without thirty (30) days' advance written notice to the city. 
d.  If the property is sold or, where applicable, if the lease is terminated after execution of the encroachment agreement, the encroachment agreement shall be null and void and a new encroachment agreement with the new property owner and, where applicable, with the lessee, shall be required prior to the encroachment being permitted to continue. 
e.  The length of the term of the encroachment agreement, which term may not exceed three (3) years. Upon filing and review of a renewal application, an encroachment agreement may be extended for additional periods of up to three (3) years per extension. 
(7)  No structure may be affixed to the sidewalk, or any street or other public property, without an encroachment agreement approved by the city council. The planning director does not have the authority to approve or enter into encroachment agreements for any such fixture without city council approval.

Any denial premised on this subsection must be accompanied by a written statement by the city engineer specifying his reasons for denying the permit or for restricting the right of ingress and egress.

    The city hereby asserts its home rules power to deviate from the provisions of state law by nullifying the provisions of NDCC 40-29-07 and NDCC 40-31-03 insofar as those sections require the tendering of a certified check or cashier's check in the amount of fifty dollars ($50.00) as part of a responsive bid for the construction of curbs, gutters or sidewalk. In so doing the city does not waive its right under state law to avail itself of Chapter 40-29 and Chapter 40-31 of the North Dakota Century Code, but rather it only modifies the operation of those chapters within its jurisdiction.

(b)  In the event a suit shall be brought against city under circumstances where the obligation to indemnify provided for in subsection (a) applies, the licensee at its sole cost and expense shall defend city in such suit if written notice thereof is promptly given to licensee within a period wherein the licensee is not prejudiced by lack of such notice.

Editor's note- Ord. No. 2394, § 1, enacted Sept. 15, 1980, repealed former Art. VI, relative to parades and open air meetings, and enacted in lieu thereof a new Art. VI as herein set out. Former Art. VI was derived from Rev. Gen. Ords. 1962, §§ 5-0606, 18-0301-18-0304. 

Sec. 28-125. - Definitions. 
(a)  An "open air meeting" means a gathering together, or assembly of ten (10) or more persons upon a public street, alley, sidewalk, highway, throughfare or other public ground. 
(b)  A "procession" means any march or parade consisting of people, animals or vehicles, or a combination thereof, except funeral processions, upon any public street, highway, alley, sidewalk or throughfare, or other public ground, which does not comply with normal and usual traffic regulations or controls. 
(Ord. No. 2394, § 1) 
Sec. 28-126. - Permit required; exception. 
    It shall be unlawful for any person (1) to conduct or sponsor a procession or open air meeting or (2) to engage in any activity deliberately calculated to, or known to be likely to, result in the creation of an open air meeting, such as, for example, the giving of a speech or music concert, unless and until a permit to conduct such procession, open air meeting or activity has been obtained from the chief of police, or as hereafter provided, from the city manager or city council. No permit is required, however, if the open air meeting or procession is conducted in response to or by way of spontaneous reaction to some unanticipated event or unanticipated occurrence which transpired less than forty-eight (48) hours prior to the commencement of the procession or open air meeting. 
(Ord. No. 2394, § 1) 
Sec. 28-127. - Interference with procession or open air meeting. 
(a)  No person shall knowingly join or participate in any permitted procession without the consent and over the objection of the permittee, nor in any manner interfere with its progress or orderly conduct. 
(b)  No person shall interfere with an open air meeting with the intent to disrupt the conduct of the meeting or with the intent to harass those participating in the meeting. 
(Ord. No. 2394, § 1) 
Sec. 28-128. - Application for permit. 
    Any person who wishes to sponsor or conduct a procession or open air meeting shall apply to the chief of police for a permit at least ten (10) days in advance of the date of the proposed procession or open air meeting. The chief of police may in his discretion consider any application for a permit to conduct a procession or open air meeting which is filed less than ten (10) days prior to the date that such procession or open air meeting is to be conducted. The application for such permit shall be made in writing on a form approved by the chief of police. In order that adequate arrangements may be made for the proper policing of the procession or open air meeting, the application shall contain the following information: 
(a)  The name of the applicant, the sponsoring organization, the person in charge of the procession or open air meeting and the addresses and telephone numbers of each; 
(b)  The purpose of the procession or open air meeting, the date when it is proposed to be conducted, the location of the assembly area, and if a procession, the location of the disbanding area, route to be traveled and the approximate time when the procession will assemble, start and terminate; 
(c)  A description of any sound amplification equipment to be used; 
(d)  A good faith estimate of the number of persons who will be drawn to attend or to observe the procession or open air meeting; and 
(e)  Such other information as the chief of police may reasonably require. 
(Ord. No. 2394, § 1) 
Sec. 28-129. - Issuance or denial of a permit. 
    The chief of police shall issue a permit conditioned upon the applicant's written agreement to comply with the terms of such permit unless the chief of police finds that: 
(a)  The time, geographical area involved and number of persons involved in the procession or open air meeting will disrupt to an unreasonable extent the movement of other traffic. 
(b)  The procession or open air meeting is of a size or nature that requires the diversion of so great a number of police officers of the city to properly police the area of assembly and areas contiguous thereto, and the line of movement if a procession, that allowing the procession or open air meeting would deny reasonable police protection to the city. However, in the event that the sponsors of the procession or open air meeting are willing and able to provide supplemental security forces which, in the opinion of the chief of police, are sufficient to provide adequate security when combined with regular available police forces, then the permit shall be issued with the condition contained therein that the permittee provide such supplemental security forces. 
(c)  Such procession or open air meeting will interfere with another procession or open air meeting for which a permit has already been issued. 
(d)  The information contained in the application is found to be false or nonexistent in any material detail. 
(Ord. No. 2394, § 1) 
Sec. 28-130. - Contents of permit. 
    In each permit the chief of police shall specify: 
(a)  With respect to a procession: 
(1)  The assembly area and time of assembly; 
(2)  The starting time; 
(3)  The route of the procession; 
(4)  The disbanding area and disbanding time; 
(5)  The number of persons estimated to take part in the procession and the number of persons required to monitor the procession; 
(6)  Restrictions on the amplification of sound, if any; and 
(7)  Such other requirements as are found by the chief of police to be reasonably necessary for protection of persons or property. 
(b)  With respect to an open air meeting: 
(1)  The place where the meeting is to occur; 
(2)  The starting time; 
(3)  Estimated duration of the meeting; 
(4)  The number of persons estimated to take part in the open air meeting; 
(5)  The measures to be taken to accommodate the normal and customary use of the public areas employed in the open air meeting, such as, for example, a requirement that half the sidewalk be maintained open for pedestrian traffic; and 
(6)  Such other requirements as are found by the chief of police to be reasonably necessary for the protection of persons or property. 
(Ord. No. 2394, § 1) 
Sec. 28-131. - Appeal procedure. 
    Upon the denial by the chief of police of an application made pursuant to section 28-128 of this article, the applicant may appeal immediately from the determination of the chief of police to the city manager in writing or orally. Upon such appeal the city manager shall expeditiously reverse, affirm or modify in any regard the determination of the chief of police. If the applicant is still dissatisfied, appeal may lie to the city council, provided that, however, in the event the regular or special meeting schedule of the city council does not permit an appeal to be heard and determined within a reasonable period of time prior to the date for which a permit is requested, the applicant may pursue his judicial remedies without such an appeal. Under those circumstances the appeal to the city manager will be considered an exhaustion of administrative remedies. 
(Ord. No. 2394, § 1) 
Sec. 28-132. - Revocation of permit. 
    Any permit for a procession or open air meeting issued pursuant to this article may be summarily revoked by the chief of police at any time when by reason of disaster, public calamity, riot or other emergency, the chief of police determines that the safety of the public or property requires such revocation. Notice of such action revoking a permit shall be provided to the permittee in the most effective manner that the circumstances permit. 
(Ord. No. 2394, § 1) 
Sec. 28-133. - Legislative intent. 
    It is the intent of the city council in imposing this permit program to place only reasonable time, place and manner restrictions on the first amendment rights of assembly and speech. Consequently this article is to be construed in favor of the exercise of first amendment rights and with an eye towards imposing only those minimum restrictions which are reasonably necessary to the protection of the public welfare, peace, and good order. Moreover, the permit program is to be administered in a neutral and disinterested fashion without respect to the contents of the beliefs, opinions or views of the persons seeking a permit except insofar as the reaction of the public at large or bystanders to the views, beliefs or opinions being expressed might require additional security forces in order to deter a breach of the peace.

(3)  A tree not lawfully in existence at the effective date of this chapter. 
(4)  A tree which was lawfully in existence at the effective of this chapter, which is of a variety not permitted to be planted or allowed to grow under this chapter, and which, in the discretion of the city forester, is a nuisance, either because of its peculiar circumstances, or because of the inherent nature of its variety. 
(5)  An encroachment by a tree located on private property onto or over a street, which encroachment, in the discretion of the city forester, is incompatible with the public health, safety, or convenience, as when, for example, a stop sign or street light is obstructed. 
(6)  Firewood which has become diseased to the extent that, in the discretion of the city forester, it imperils the health or safety or both of property (including live trees) or people or both.

(1)  The city forester may make a complaint to the municipal prosecutor under section 1-8 and may appear as a witness on behalf of the city in any ensuing court action. 
(2)  The city forester may proceed by way of self-help and without notice if the condition to be remedied is found within a street and it is not necessary to enter upon private property to accomplish the remedial action. 
(3)  The city forester may proceed by way of self-help with the consent of every person having an ownership interest in the object subject to remedial action and in the private property which must be entered upon to gain access to such object. 
(4)  The city forester may declare the object subject to remedial action to be a nuisance and proceed against it under chapter 22. 
(5)  The city forester may issue an administrative order to the person in charge of the object which is subject to remedial action that such person perform in the remedial action prescribed by the city forester in the order. Such order shall not be final until five (5) business days have expired after it has been served in person or by mail on the person to whom it is directed. If service is made by mail, an additional three (3) days shall be allowed. The person to whom the order is directed may appeal the order to the city forester's supervisor. If the appeal is made before the order appealed from has become final, it shall not become final until after the appeal is decided, and then only if the order appealed from its upheld. 
(6)  The city forester may exercise any other remedy available under general law. 
(b)  In choosing a particular remedy or combination of remedies, the city forester may take into account the cost to the city of pursuing one remedy as opposed to another, and any other factors relating to the public interest. Thus, for example, the city forester is not barred from proceeding against a tree as a nuisance simply because he could resort to self-help instead.

The service of the notice may be made by ordinary mail or in person, and at least five (5) business days must intervene between the date of service and the date when action is taken pursuant to the notice. If service is made by mail, an additional three (3) days must be allowed. The notice shall specify the date and time when the right-of-entry will be exercised and shall be accompanied with a copy of this chapter.

(Ord. No. 3115, § 1) 
Sec. 29-11. - Delegation of authority. 
(a)  The city hereby delegates the authority exercised pursuant to this chapter to the city park district.

(2)  For purposes of proceeding against a nuisance under chapter 22, as allowed in section 29-8(a), the director of parks shall substitute for the city manager in the show cause hearing provided for in section 22-4; and 
(3)  The park board may entertain appeals from decisions of subordinate officials made under this chapter and requests for variances, if it so chooses, pursuant to its own rules of procedure for such matters, or it may decide not to allow one (1) or the other or both. 
(c)  For purposes of the legal doctrine which requires the exhaustion of administrative remedies before judicial review is available, the following shall be considered as the available administrative remedies: 
(1)  The taking of an appeal or a request for a variance to the park board, if it provides for such procedures; 
(2)  The taking of an appeal to a staff person of the park district if the park board provides for such an appeal; and 
(3)  The taking of an appeal to the supervisor of the city forester as explicitly provided in this chapter.

Sec. 29-12. - Regulation of arborists. 
(a)  No person may engage in the business or occupation of trimming, pruning, treating, or removing trees without first obtaining a license from the city forester. 
(b)  The city forester may adopt reasonable rules and regulations governing all aspects of doing business pursuant to a license issued under this section. 
(c)  The applicant must have insurance coverage in order to be licensed. The coverage must be by way of a personal liability policy which provides coverage for claims arising from the performance of the activities which require the issuance of a license under subsection (a). The policy must provide coverage for no less than one million dollars ($1,000,000.00) for bodily injury, and no less than one million dollars ($1,000,000.00) for property damage. 
(d)  The park board may adopt such reasonable requirements for a license, in addition to those which are made mandatory under this section, as seems appropriate to the forester to protect the public interest. For example, and without limitation, the city forester may require the applicant to pass a written or oral test of the applicant's knowledge about matters relevant to the activities to be pursued pursuant to the license and the rules and regulations adopted pursuant to subsection (b), or may require the applicant to provide a practical demonstration of appropriate skills and knowledge. 
(e)  The annual fee for a license issued under this section shall be set by the park board. 
(f)  A license issued under this section may be revoked for failure to make timely payment of the annual license fee, failure to keep in effect the insurance coverage required under subsection (c), or failure to obey the rules and regulations adopted pursuant to subsection (b). Before a license may be revoked, the licensee is entitled to prior notice and an opportunity for a hearing before the supervisor of the city forester.

(1)  The location and description of newly annexed property or other property within the city limits, specially benefited by an improvement in existence or under construction at the time of annexation, or at the time of such resolution, which property was not previously assessed for a portion or all of such improvement; 
(2)  The benefit in dollar amount received by each parcel of land located therein and the amount in dollars of the special assessment to be imposed against each parcel to pay for such benefit, provided that, however, the special assessment shall not exceed the amount of the benefit; 
(3)  The appropriate period of years not to exceed ten (10) years and the appropriate interest not to exceed ten (10) per cent which shall be used in computing the installments of such special assessments against each such parcel of land to be certified to the county auditor; 
(4)  An appropriate date and time for the council to meet and conduct the hearing required under subsection (b) of this section. 
    For the purpose of this section of the Code of Ordinances, the resolution passed by the city council shall be called the "special assessment resolution" and the list of properties, benefits, and special assessments provided for in subparagraph (2) shall be called the "special assessment list". 
(b)  The city council shall conduct a hearing at which an affected property owner may appear to present evidence and arguments in support of the claim that: 
(1)  His land is not benefited by the improvement in question and should not be specially assessed for a portion of the costs thereof, or 
(2)  His land should be assessed in a lesser amount than that determined by the city council in the special assessment list. 
The council by way of resolution passed by a majority of all the members thereof may make such amendments, if any, in the special assessment resolution or special assessment list as may seem appropriate to it in view of the evidence and arguments presented. Thereafter, or in the absence of such amendments, the council may by way of a resolution passed in like manner confirm the special assessment list and special assessment resolution as amended or, without an amendment if there be none. 
(c)  Notice of the hearing provided for in subsection (b) along with a copy of the special assessment resolution and the special assessment list and a map intelligibly depicting the lands described in the special assessment resolution, shall be published once each week for two (2) consecutive weeks in a paper of general circulation in the city with the last publication to be at least five (5) calendar days before the date of the hearing (exclusive of the date of publication and the date of hearing). The notice shall specifically advise the public of the rights granted to the landowners in subsection (b) hereof. 
(d)  If a resolution confirming the special assessment list is passed by the council, the city auditor shall compute the installments of special assessments with respect to each parcel of land described therein. He shall certify such installments to the county auditor for collection in the manner and at the same time as with other special assessment districts or projects. 
(e)  The benefits assessed hereunder with respect to any one improvement, shall not exceed the sum of: 
(1)  The portion of the costs of such improvement paid for from ad valorem taxes, plus 
(2)  The installments of special assessments levied against other land which pertain to such improvement, which have not yet been paid as of the date of the confirmation of the special assessment list, plus 
(3)  That portion of the cost of the improvement paid from sources other than ad valorem taxes or special assessment payments. 
(f)  The special assessment levied pursuant to this section shall be credited as received to the special fund maintained by the city for the payment of any outstanding special improvement warrants, refunding improvement bonds, general obligation bonds, or revenue bonds which were issued to finance the improvement for which the assessments were levied, or if no such obligations are outstanding, to such fund as the city council may direct. In connection therewith the city council shall have the power to direct the cancellation of uncollected installments of special assessments previously levied for the same improvement, and the refund of installments prepaid, to the extent determined by it to be necessary to make the original assessment and the subsequent assessment bear as nearly as possible the same relation to the total benefits derived from the improvements by the respective properties assessed. 
(g)  The rights granted to the city in this section shall be deemed to be founded upon its home rule powers as set forth in the state constitution, state statutes and the city charter. Furthermore, such rights shall be deemed to be supplementary to, and not in lieu of, the rights granted under Sections 40-23-17 to 40-23-21, inclusive, of the North Dakota Century Code.

Sec. 31-150. - Establishment of sewer rates. 
(a)  No less frequently than every two (2) years the city council shall by resolution establish sewer rates after conducting a review of the waste water contribution of users (and user classes) and the total cost of operation and maintenance of the treatment works during the time subsequent to the most recent establishment of sewer rates. 
(b)  The sewer rate structure to be established by the council shall incorporate therein the following features: 
(1)  The user charge component thereof (which in some circumstances could be all thereof) shall be based upon actual use (or estimated use) of waste water treatment services whereby each user (or user class), by way of surcharges when necessary, pays its proportionate share of operation and maintenance costs of the waste water treatment works, based upon the user's proportionate contribution to total waste water loading from all users (or user classes), which contribution shall be determined by factors such as strength, volume, and delivery flow rate characteristics of the waste water attributable to each user (or user class). 
(2)  In addition to producing those revenues which the city is obligated to generate by virtue of its revenue bond commitments or other obligations, there shall be also generated sufficient revenue to pay the total operation and maintenance costs necessary to the proper operation and maintenance of the waste water treatment works through user charges. 
(3)  Excess revenues collected from a class of users for the cost of operation and maintenance attributable to that class will be applied no less frequently than once a year to the credit of that class with a corresponding adjustment in the user charges attributable to the class. 
(4)  Each user which discharges any toxic pollutants which cause an increase in cost of managing the effluent or the sludge of the waste water treatment works shall pay for such increased cost. 
(5)  The cost of operation and maintenance for all water flow not directly attributable to users, that is, attributable to introduction of natural waters into the sanitary system by infiltration or inflow, will be distributed among all users in the same manner that the cost of operation and maintenance among users (or user classes) are distributable. 
(6)  A user outside the city shall not be charged a higher user charge than a comparable user within the city, provided that, however, by way of independent contract the city and the user outside the city can enter into an agreement whereby the user makes payment in lieu of taxes attributable to debt retirement and capital improvements with respect to the waste water treatment works, and attributable to costs of administrative overhead relating to the expenses of administering the city as a whole, which costs are not directly reflected in the administrative overhead for the water and sewerage utility. 
(7)  Revenues resulting from the imposition of a flat fee per account or per user which exceed the costs used to justify the imposition of a flat fee (such as meter reading, administrative overhead and debt retirement, etc.), if there be any such excess, shall not be used to pay the costs of operation and maintenance.

b.  A meter serving a multi-family residential building shall be assessed one unit on the first dwelling and one-half unit on each of the other dwellings in the building; 
c.  A meter serving a non-residential use shall be assessed one unit for each seven thousand square feet of land (or fraction thereof) appurtenant to such use; and 
d.  A meter serving more than one of the three prior categories of use (that is, a through c), shall be assessed under the category which produces the greater or greatest fee. 
(2)  The following type of properties shall be exempt from the storm sewer maintenance fee: 
a.  Properties utilized by any governmental entities, including municipal, county, state, federal, park districts, and school districts. 
b.  Vacant property. 
(3)  The administration shall use their best judgment in determining the charge assessed if a property does not fall within the above criteria and to make administrative adjustments as deemed appropriate.

b.  Vacant property. 
(3)  The administration shall use its best judgment in determining the charge assessed if a property does not fall within the above criteria and in making administrative adjustments as deemed appropriate. 
(c)  Use of development fee. The storm sewer development fee shall be used to construct or reconstruct storm sewers. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, for example, it may be used to subsidize the payment of storm sewer special assessments which would other wise be paid by benefiting property owners to the extent of the lesser of- 
(1)  Fifty (50) per cent of the storm sewer special assessment against the benefited property, or 
(2)  Fifteen cents ($0.15) per square foot of the benefited property.

(Ord. No. 4555, § 2) 
Sec. 3. - Location, other regulations. 
    3.1  Location of Facilities. Electric Facilities shall be located, constructed and maintained so as not to interfere with the safety and convenience of ordinary travel along and over Public Ways and so as not to disrupt normal operation of any City Utility System previously installed therein. Electric Facilities shall be located on Public Grounds as determined by the City. Company's construction, reconstruction, operation, repair, maintenance and location of Electric Facilities shall be subject to permits if required by separate ordinance and to other reasonable regulations of the City to the extent not inconsistent with the terms of this franchise agreement. Company may abandon underground Electric Facilities in place, provided, at the City's request, Company will remove abandoned metal or concrete encased conduit interfering with a City improvement project, but only to the extent such conduit is uncovered by excavation as part of the City improvement project. 
    3.2  Street Openings. Company shall not open or disturb any Public Way or Public Ground for any purpose without first having obtained a permit from the City, if required by a separate ordinance, for which the City may impose a reasonable fee. Permit conditions imposed on Company shall not be more burdensome than those imposed on other utilities for similar facilities or work. Company may, however, open and disturb any Public Way or Public Ground without permission from the City where an emergency exists requiring the immediate repair of Electric Facilities. In such event Company shall notify the City by telephone to the office designated by the City as soon as practicable. Not later than the second working day thereafter, Company shall obtain any required permits and pay any required fees. 
    3.3  Restoration. After undertaking any work requiring the opening of any Public Way or Public Ground, Company shall restore the same, including paving and its foundation, to as good a condition as formerly existed, and shall maintain any paved surface in good condition for two years thereafter. The work shall be completed as promptly as weather permits and if Company shall not promptly perform and complete the work, remove all dirt, rubbish, equipment and material, and put the Public Way or Public Ground in the said condition, the City shall have, after demand to Company to cure and the passage of a reasonable period of time following the demand, but not to exceed five days, the right to make the restoration at the expense of Company. Company shall pay to the City the cost of such work done for or performed by the City.

    3.4  Avoid Damage to Electric Facilities. Nothing in this Ordinance relieves any person from liability arising out of the failure to exercise reasonable care to avoid damaging Electric Facilities while performing any activity.

(Ord. No. 4555, § 3) 
Sec. 4. - Relocations. 
    4.1  Relocation of Electric Facilities in Public Ways. If the City determines to vacate a Public Way for a City improvement project, or at City's cost to grade, regrade, or change the line of any Public Way, or construct or reconstruct any City Utility System in any Public Way, it may order Company to relocate its Electric Facilities located therein if relocation is reasonably necessary to accomplish the City's proposed public improvement. Except as provided in Section 4.3 or 4.3.1. Company shall relocate its Electric Facilities at its own expense. The City shall give Company reasonable notice of plans to vacate for a City improvement project, or to grade, regrade, or change the line of any Public Way or to construct or reconstruct any City Utility System. If a relocation is ordered within ten years of a prior relocation of the same Electric Facilities, which was made at Company expense, the City shall reimburse Company for non-betterment costs on a time and material basis, provided that if a subsequent relocation is required because of the extension of a City Utility System to a previously unserved area, Company may be required to make the subsequent relocation at its expense. Nothing in this Ordinance requires Company to relocate, remove, replace or reconstruct at its own expense its Electric Facilities where such relocation, removal, replacement or reconstruction is solely for the convenience of the City and is not reasonably necessary for the construction or reconstruction of a Public Way or City Utility System or other City improvement. 
    4.2  Relocation of Electric Facilities in Public Ground. City may require Company at Company's expense to relocate or remove its Electric Facilities from Public Ground upon a finding by City that the Electric Facilities have become or will become a substantial impairment to the existing or proposed public use of the Public Ground. 
    4.3  Projects with Federal Funding. Relocation, removal, or rearrangement of any Company Electric Facilities made necessary because of the extension into or through City of a federally-aided highway project shall be governed by the provisions of North Dakota Century Code, Chapter 24-01-41, as supplemented or amended. It is understood that the right herein granted to Company is a valuable right. City shall not order Company to remove or relocate its Electric Facilities when a Public Way is vacated, improved or realigned because of a renewal or a redevelopment plan which is financially subsidized in whole or in part by the Federal Government or any agency thereof, unless the reasonable non-betterment costs of such relocation and the loss and expense resulting therefrom are first paid to Company, but the City need not pay those portions of such for which reimbursement to it is not available. It is the intent of this section to provide that except as provided in § 4.1 the City shall not be required to commit local funds to relocation or removal costs of Company's Facilities located on public streets, alleys, or public ways on any improvement project initiated by the City Council. 
    4.3.1  Relocation due to Mouse River Enhanced Flood Protection Project. For utility relocations necessary as a result of the Mouse River Enhanced Flood Protection Project within, the corporate limits of the City, the Souris River Joint Board shall have the ability to direct and approve utility relocations, but only after receiving written approval from the City Engineer or Public Works Director. Any and all expenses relating to relocating utilities pursuant to this subsection shall be paid in accordance with the individual utility company's agreement with the Souris River Joint Board. 
    4.4  No Waiver. The provisions of this franchise apply only to facilities constructed in reliance on a franchise from the City and shall not be construed to waive or modify any rights obtained by Company for installations within a Company right-of-way acquired by easement or prescriptive right before the applicable Public Way or Public Ground was established, or rights obtained by Company under state or county permit. 
(Ord. No. 4555, § 4; Ord. No. 5191, §§ 4, 5) 
Sec. 5. - Tree trimming. 
    Company may trim all trees and shrubs in the Public Ways and Public Grounds of City to the extent Company finds necessary to avoid interference with the proper construction, operation, repair and maintenance of any Electric Facilities installed hereunder, provided that Company shall save the City harmless from any liability arising therefrom, and subject to permit or other reasonable regulation by the City. 
(Ord. No. 4555, § 5) 
Sec. 6. - Indemnification. 
    6.1  Indemnity of City. Company shall indemnify, keep and hold the City free and harmless from any and all liability on account of injury to persons or damage to property occasioned by the construction, maintenance, repair, inspection, the issuance of permits, or the operation of the Electric Facilities located in the Public Ways and Public Grounds. The City shall not be indemnified for losses or claims occasioned through its own negligence except for losses or claims arising out of or alleging the City's negligence as to the issuance of permits for, or inspection of, Company's plans or work. The City shall not be indemnified if the injury or damage results from the performance in a proper manner of acts reasonably deemed hazardous by Company, and such performance is nevertheless ordered or directed by City after notice of Company's determination. 
    6.2  Defense of City. In the event a suit is brought against the City under circumstances where this agreement to indemnify applies, Company at its sole cost and expense shall defend the City in such suit if written notice thereof is promptly given to Company within a period wherein Company is not prejudiced by lack of such notice. If Company is required to indemnify and defend, it will thereafter have control of such litigation, but Company may not settle such litigation without the consent of the City, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld. This section is not, as to third parties, a waiver of any defense or immunity otherwise available to the City; and Company, in defending any action on behalf of the City shall be entitled to assert in any action every defense or immunity that the City could assert in its own behalf. 
(Ord. No. 4555, § 6) 
Sec. 7. - Vacation of public ways. 
    The City shall give Company at least two weeks' prior written notice of a proposed vacation of a Public Way. Except where required for a City improvement project, the vacation of any Public Way, after the installation of Electric Facilities, shall not operate to deprive Company of its rights to operate and maintain such Electric Facilities, until the reasonable cost of relocating the same and the loss and expense resulting from such relocation are first paid to Company. In no case, however, shall City be liable to Company for failure to specifically preserve a right-of-way under North Dakota Century Code, Chapter 40-39-04.

Sec. 8. - Franchise fees or revenue rights reserved. 
    Although no franchise fees or revenue rights of the City are specified or required at this time pursuant to this Ordinance granting a franchise to Northern States Power Company, a Minnesota Corporation, D/B/A Xcel Energy, nothing herein shall be construed as an abandonment by the City of its future right to impose franchise fees or revenue rights on Company under the then applicable law.

    10.1  Severability.

    10.2  Limitation on Applicability. This Ordinance constitutes a franchise agreement between the City and Company as the only parties and no provision of this franchise shall in any way inure to the benefit of any third person (including the public at large) so as to constitute any such person as a third party beneficiary of the agreement or of any one or more of the terms hereof, or otherwise give rise to any cause of action in any person not a party hereto. 
(Ord. No. 4555, § 10) 
Sec. 11. - Amendment procedure. 
    Either party to this franchise agreement may at any time propose that the agreement be amended to address a subject of concern and the other party will consider whether it agrees that the amendment is mutually appropriate.

City hereby grants a franchise to Cooperative, for a period of 20 years from the date passed and approved by the City, the right to transmit and furnish electric energy for light, heat, power and other purposes for public and private use within and through the limits of the City as its boundaries now exist or as they may be extended in the future. For these purposes, Cooperative may construct, operate, repair and maintain Electric Facilities in, on, over, under and across the Public Ways and Public Grounds of City, subject to the provisions of this Ordinance. Cooperative may do all reasonable things necessary or customary to accomplish these purposes, subject, however, to such reasonable regulations as may be imposed by the City pursuant to ordinance and to the further provisions of this franchise agreement. 
    2.2  Service Area. The service area of Cooperative within City shall be in accordance with the Public Service Commission (PSC) regulation and subject to its supervisory jurisdiction thereof. For reference, the service area of Cooperative within City is outside the heavy solid black line, including areas which lie within the heavy dashed black line as depicted in the attached Exhibit A, and including Cooperative's grandfathered accounts. If any part of Cooperative's service area is annexed to the City during the term of the franchise, the annexed area will become part of the franchised service area of the Cooperative.

If a mediator is not used or if the parties are unable to resolve the dispute within 30 days after first meeting with the selected mediator, either party may commence an action in District Court to interpret and enforce this franchise or for such other relief as may be permitted by law or equity for breach of contract, or either party may take any other action permitted by law. 
(Ord. No. 4554, § 2) 
Sec. 3. - Location, other regulations. 
    3.1  Location of Facilities. Electric Facilities shall be located, constructed and maintained so as not to interfere with the safety and convenience of ordinary travel along and over Public Ways and so as not to disrupt normal operation of any City Utility System previously installed therein. Electric Facilities shall be located on Public Grounds as determined by the City. Cooperative's construction, reconstruction, operation, repair, maintenance and location of Electric Facilities shall be subject to permits if required by separate ordinance and to other reasonable regulations of the City to the extent not inconsistent with the terms of this franchise agreement. Cooperative may abandon underground Electric Facilities in place, provided, at the City's request, Cooperative will remove abandoned metal or concrete encased conduit interfering with a City improvement project, but only to the extent such conduit is uncovered by excavation as part of the City improvement project. 
    3.2  Street Openings. Cooperative shall not open or disturb any Public Way or Public Ground for any purpose without first having obtained a permit from the City, if required by a separate ordinance, for which the City may impose a reasonable fee. Permit conditions imposed on Cooperative shall not be more burdensome than those imposed on other utilities for similar facilities or work. Cooperative may, however, open and disturb any Public Way or Public Ground without permission from the City where an emergency exists requiring the immediate repair of Electric Facilities. In such event Cooperative shall notify the City by telephone to the office designated by the City as soon as practicable. Not later than the second working day thereafter, Cooperative shall obtain any required permits and pay any required fees. 
    3.3  Restoration. After undertaking any work requiring the opening of any Public Way or Public Ground, Cooperative shall restore the same, including paving and its foundation, to as good a condition as formerly existed, and shall maintain any paved surface in good condition for two years thereafter. The work shall be completed as promptly as weather permits and if Cooperative shall not promptly perform and complete the work, remove all dirt, rubbish, equipment and material, and put the Public Way or Public Ground in the said condition, the City shall have, after demand to Cooperative to cure and the passage of a reasonable period of time following the demand, but not to exceed five days, the right to make the restoration at the expense of Cooperative. Cooperative shall pay to the City the cost of such work done for or performed by the City. This remedy shall be in addition to any other remedy available to the City for noncompliance with this Section 3.3, but the City hereby waives any requirement for Cooperative to post a construction performance bond, certificate of insurance, letter of credit or any other form of security or assurance that may be required, under a separate existing or future ordinance of the City, of a person or entity obtaining the City's permission to install, replace or maintain facilities in a Public Way. 
    3.4  Avoid Damage to Electric Facilities. Nothing in this Ordinance relieves any person from liability arising out of the failure to exercise reasonable care to avoid damaging Electric Facilities while performing any activity. 
    3.5  Notice of Improvements. The City must give Cooperative reasonable notice of plans for improvements to Public Ways or Public Ground where the City has reason to believe that Electric Facilities may affect or be affected by the improvement. The notice must contain (i) the nature and character of the improvements, (ii) the Public Ways and Public Grounds upon which the improvements are to be made, (iii) the extent of the improvements, (iv) the time when the City will start the work, and (v) if more than one Public Way or Public Ground is involved, the order in which the work is to proceed. The notice must be given to Cooperative a sufficient length of time in advance of the actual commencement of the work to permit Cooperative to make any necessary additions, alterations or repairs to its Electric Facilities. Pursuant to this section, the Cooperative shall provide within a reasonable period of time field locations for all its underground facilities when requested by the City. 
    3.6  Shared Use of Poles. Cooperative shall make space available on its poles or towers for City fire, water utility, police or other City facilities whenever such use will not interfere with the use of such poles or towers by Cooperative, by another electric utility, by a telephone utility, or by any cable television company or other form of communication company. In addition, the City shall pay for any added cost incurred by Cooperative because of such use by City. 
(Ord. No. 4554, § 3) 
Sec. 4. - Relocations. 
    4.1  Relocation of Electric Facilities in Public Ways. If the City determines to vacate a Public Way for a City improvement project, or at City's cost to grade, regrade, or change the line of any Public Way, or construct or reconstruct any City Utility System in any Public Way, it may order Cooperative to relocate its Electric Facilities located therein if relocation is reasonably necessary to accomplish the City's proposed public improvement. Except as provided in Section 4.3 or 4.3.1. Cooperative shall relocate its Electric Facilities at its own expense. The City shall give Cooperative reasonable notice of plans to vacate for a City improvement project, or to grade, regrade, or change the line of any Public Way or to construct or reconstruct any City Utility System. If a relocation is ordered within ten years of a prior relocation of the same Electric Facilities, which was made at Cooperative expense, the City shall reimburse Cooperative for non-betterment costs on a time and material basis, provided that if a subsequent relocation is required because of the extension of a City Utility System to a previously unserved area, Cooperative may be required to make the subsequent relocation at its expense. Nothing in this Ordinance requires Cooperative to relocate, remove, replace or reconstruct at its own expense its Electric Facilities where such relocation, removal, replacement or reconstruction is solely for the convenience of the City and is not reasonably necessary for the construction or reconstruction of a Public Way or City Utility System or other City improvement. 
    4.2  Relocation of Electric Facilities in Public Ground. City may require Cooperative at Cooperative's expense to relocate or remove its Electric Facilities from Public Ground upon a finding by City that the Electric Facilities have become or will become a substantial impairment to the existing or proposed public use of the Public Ground. 
    4.3  Projects with Federal Funding. Relocation, removal, or rearrangement of any Cooperative Electric Facilities made necessary because of the extension into or through City of a federally-aided highway project shall be governed by the provisions of North Dakota Century Code, Chapter 24-01-41, as supplemented or amended. It is understood that the right herein granted to Cooperative is a valuable right. City shall not order Cooperative to remove or relocate its Electric Facilities when a Public Way is vacated, improved or realigned because of a renewal or a redevelopment plan which is financially subsidized in whole or in part by the Federal Government or any agency thereof, unless the reasonable non-betterment costs of such relocation and the loss and expense resulting therefrom are first paid to Cooperative, but the City need not pay those portions of such for which reimbursement to it is not available. It is the intent of this section to provide that except as provided in § 4.1 the City shall not be required to commit local funds to relocation or removal costs of Cooperative's Facilities located on public streets, alleys, or public ways on any improvement project initiated by the City Council. 
    4.3.1  Relocation due to Mouse River Enhanced Flood Protection Project. For utility relocations necessary as a result of the Mouse River Enhanced Flood Protection Project within the corporate limits of the City, the Souris River Joint Board shall have the ability to direct and approve utility relocations, but only after receiving written approval from the City Engineer or Public Works Director. Any and all expenses relating to relocating utilities pursuant to this subsection shall be paid in accordance with the individual utility company's agreement with the Souris River Joint Board. 
    4.4  No Waiver. The provisions of this franchise apply only to facilities constructed in reliance on a franchise from the City and shall not be construed to waive or modify any rights obtained by Cooperative for installations within a Cooperative right-of-way acquired by easement or prescriptive right before the applicable Public Way or Public Ground was established, or rights obtained by Cooperative under state or county permit. 
(Ord. No. 4554, § 4; Ord. No. 5191, §§ 6, 7) 
Sec. 5. - Tree trimming. 
    Cooperative may trim all trees and shrubs in the Public Ways and Public Grounds of City to the extent Cooperative finds necessary to avoid interference with the proper construction, operation, repair and maintenance of any Electric Facilities installed hereunder, provided that Cooperative shall save the City harmless from any liability arising therefrom, and subject to permit or other reasonable regulation by the City. 
(Ord. No. 4554, § 5) 
Sec. 6. - Indemnification. 
    6.1  Indemnity of City. Cooperative shall indemnify, keep and hold the City free and harmless from any and all liability on account of injury to persons or damage to property occasioned by the construction, maintenance, repair, inspection, the issuance of permits, or the operation of the Electric Facilities located in the Public Ways and Public Grounds. The City shall not be indemnified for losses or claims occasioned through its own negligence except for losses or claims arising out of or alleging the City's negligence as to the issuance of permits for, or inspection of, Cooperative's plans or work. The City shall not be indemnified if the injury or damage results from the performance in a proper manner of acts reasonably deemed hazardous by Cooperative, and such performance is nevertheless ordered or directed by City after notice of Cooperative's determination. 
    6.2  Defense of City. In the event a suit is brought against the City under circumstances where this agreement to indemnify applies, Cooperative at its sole cost and expense shall defend the City in such suit if written notice thereof is promptly given to Cooperative within a period wherein Cooperative is not prejudiced by lack of such notice. If Cooperative is required to indemnify and defend, it will thereafter have control of such litigation, but Cooperative may not settle such litigation without the consent of the City, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld. This section is not, as to third parties, a waiver of any defense or immunity otherwise available to the City; and Cooperative, in defending any action on behalf of the City shall be entitled to assert in any action every defense or immunity that the City could assert in its own behalf. 
(Ord. No. 4554, § 6) 
Sec. 7. - Vacation of public ways. 
    The City shall give Cooperative at least two weeks prior written notice of a proposed vacation of a Public Way. Except where required for a City improvement project, the vacation of any Public Way, after the installation of Electric Facilities, shall not operate to deprive Cooperative of its rights to operate and maintain such Electric Facilities, until the reasonable cost of relocating the same and the loss and expense resulting from such relocation are first paid to Cooperative. In no case, however, shall City be liable to Cooperative for failure to specifically preserve a right-of-way under North Dakota Century Code, Chapter 40-39-04. 
(Ord. No. 4554, § 7) 
Sec. 8. - Franchise fees or revenue rights reserved. 
    Although no franchise fees or revenue rights of the City are specified or required at this time pursuant to this Ordinance granting a franchise to Verendrye Electric Cooperative, Inc., nothing herein shall be construed as an abandonment by the City of its future right to impose franchise fees or revenue rights on the Cooperative under the then applicable law. If at a future date during the term of this franchise agreement, the City determines that it desires Cooperative to collect a franchise fee, the City will give Cooperative notice to amend this franchise agreement to authorize collection of a franchise fee by separate ordinance in an amount and upon such terms and conditions as lawfully permitted. Upon receipt of such notice, Cooperative shall negotiate in good faith with the City to amend this franchise agreement with respect to the franchise fees or revenue rights lawfully permitted or authorized. 
(Ord. No. 4554, § 8) 
Sec. 9. - Change in form of government. 
    Any change in the form of government of the City shall not affect the validity of this Ordinance. Any governmental unit succeeding the City shall, without the consent of Cooperative, succeed to all of the rights and obligations of the City provided in this Ordinance. 
(Ord. No. 4554, § 9) 
Sec. 10. - Provisions of ordinance. 
    10.1  Severability. Every section, provision, or part of this Ordinance is declared separate from every other section, provision, or part; and if any section, provision, or part shall be held invalid, it shall not affect any other section, provision, or part. Where a provision of any other City ordinance conflicts with the provisions of this Ordinance, the provisions of this Ordinance shall prevail. 
    10.2  Limitation on Applicability. This Ordinance constitutes a franchise agreement between the City and Cooperative as the only parties and no provision of this franchise shall in any way inure to the benefit of any third person (including the public at large) so as to constitute any such person as a third party beneficiary of the agreement or of any one or more of the terms hereof, or otherwise give rise to any cause of action in any person not a party hereto. 
(Ord. No. 4554, § 10) 
Sec. 11. - Amendment procedure. 
    Either party to this franchise agreement may at any time propose that the agreement be amended to address a subject of concern and the other party will consider whether it agrees that the amendment is mutually appropriate. If an amendment is agreed upon, this Ordinance may be amended at any time by the City passing a subsequent ordinance declaring the provisions of the amendment, which amendatory ordinance shall become effective upon the filing of Cooperative's written consent thereto with the City Clerk within 90 days after the date of final passage by the City of the amendatory ordinance. However, this amendment procedure and mutual acceptance requirement does not apply to Section 8 (Franchise Fees or Revenue Rights Reserved) of this Franchise Ordinance. 
(Ord. No. 4554, § 11) 
Sec. 12. - Previous franchises superseded. 
    This franchise agreement, upon final adoption and timely acceptance by Cooperative, supersedes any previous electric franchise granted to Cooperative or its predecessor.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, company shall have the right, but not the obligation, to extend the cable system into any portion of the service area where another operator is providing cable service, into any annexed area which is not contiguous to the present service area of company, or into any area which is financially or technically infeasible due to extraordinary circumstances, such as a runway or freeway crossing. 
    2.3.2 Subscriber Charges for Extensions. No subscriber shall be refused cable service arbitrarily. However, if an area does not meet the density requirements above, company shall only be required to extend the cable system to subscriber(s) in that area if the subscriber(s) are willing to share the capital costs of extending the cable system. Specifically, company shall contribute a capital amount equal to the construction cost per mile, multiplied by a fraction whose numerator equals the actual number of residences per one thousand three hundred and twenty (1,320) cable-bearing strand feet from the tap or node as designated by the company of its trunk or distribution cable, and whose denominator equals ten (10).

Sec. 7. - Fees and payments. 
    7.1  Franchise Fee . Company shall pay Municipality throughout the term of this Franchise an amount equal to five percent (5%) of Company's Cable Gross Revenues (Franchise Fee). Such payments shall be made monthly, and are due within thirty (30) days after the end of each calendar month. 
    7.1.1 Each Franchise Fee payment shall be accompanied by a written report to Municipality, verified by an officer of Company containing an accurate statement in summarized form of Company's Cable Gross Revenues and the computation of the payment amount. 
    7.1.2 Municipality may audit Company to verify the accuracy of Franchise Fees paid Municipality. Any additional amount due Municipality shall be paid within thirty (30) days of Municipality's submitting an invoice for such sum. 
    7.1.3 If Company collects from Subscribers that portion of the Franchise Fee attributable to non-Subscriber revenues (examples being revenues from advertising or home shopping network commissions) then Company shall annually review the amount of collections from Subscribers during the prior year and promptly correct any material over collection or under collection. Company shall provide documentation of the preceding to Municipality, upon request. 
    7.1.4 The City, upon thirty (30) days' written notice to company, may during the term of a franchise, but not more frequently than once each year, conduct an audit of the books, records, and accounts of company solely for the purpose of determining whether company has paid franchise fees in the amounts prescribed herein. The audit may be conducted by the City or by an independent certified public accounting firm retained by the City and shall be conducted at the sole expense of the City. Company shall make available for inspection by authorized representatives of the City, its books, accounts and all other financial records at reasonable times and upon reasonable advance notice for the purpose of permitting exercise of the authorities conferred by this section. Company shall not be required to maintain any books or records for franchise compliance purposes longer than three (3) years and the period of limitation for recovery of any Franchise Fee payable hereunder shall be three (3) years from the date on which payment by Company is due. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein, company shall not be required to disclose information that it reasonably deems to be proprietary or confidential in nature, nor disclose books and records of any affiliate that is not providing cable service in the authorized area. Subject to the North Dakota Open Records Law, the City agrees to treat any information disclosed by company as confidential and only to disclose it to employees, representatives, and agents thereof that have a need to know, or in order to enforce the provisions hereof. Company shall not be required to provide subscriber information in violation of Section 631 of the Cable Act or any other applicable law regarding subscriber privacy. 
    7.2  Discounted Rates . If Company's Subscribers are offered what is, in effect, a discount if they obtain both Cable Services and some other, non-cable goods or service, then for Cable Gross Revenue computation purposes, the discount shall be applied proportionately to cable and non-cable goods and services, in accordance with the following example: 
    7.2.1 Assume a Subscriber's charge for a given month for Cable Services alone would be $40, for local telephone service alone would be $30, and for cable modem service alone would be $30, for a total of $100. In fact the three services are offered in effect at a combined rate of $80 where the Subscriber receives what amounts to a twenty percent (20%) discount from the rates that would apply to a service if purchased individually. The discount (here, $20) for franchise fee computation purposes would be applied pro rata so that for such purposes Cable Gross Revenues would be deemed to be $32 ($40 less 20% of $40). The result would be the same if the Subscriber received a $20 discount for telephone service on the condition that he or she also Subscribes for Cable Services at standard rates. 
    7.2.2 Assume the same facts as the preceding example, except that the subscriber also purchases a cable service such as HBO at a fixed fee of $15 a month, which is outside the discount (the effective discount effectively does not apply to this service), for a total of $95. Total gross revenues would be $47 ($32 from the prior example plus $15). 
    7.2.3 The existence and amount of a discount shall be determined on the basis of the sum of the lowest generally available stand-alone rates for each of the goods and services which are offered at the combined rate. 
    7.3  Other Payments . The preceding fees and payments are in addition to all sums which may be due Municipality for property taxes (real and personal), income taxes, or other fees, taxes or charges which currently assessed by Municipality. 
    7.3.1 Company shall pay Municipality's cost of newspaper publication associated with adoption of this Franchise. It is agreed such costs hereunder do not constitute a Franchise Fee or any part thereof. 
    7.4  Interest . All sums not paid when due shall bear interest at the rate of eighteen percent (18%) per annum computed monthly or the highest lawful rate, whichever is less, and if so paid with interest within thirty (30) days of due date, shall not constitute an Event of Default. 
    7.5  Prior Fees . Within sixty (60) days of the Effective Date of this Franchise, Company shall pay all Franchise Fees due under any prior franchise between Company and Municipality. 
    7.6  Rates and Charges . The City may regulate rates for the provision of basic cable and equipment as expressly permitted by federal or state law. Not less than 30 days prior to the effective date of any change in rates or charges, Company shall submit a revised schedule or rates and charges to the City and provide notice of the proposed changes to each affected subscriber. 
(Ord. of 7-7-08, § 7) 
Sec. 8. - Term. 
    8.1  Term . The term of this Franchise shall be for a term of fifteen (15) years. 
    8.2  Termination . This Franchise and all rights of Company there under shall automatically terminate on the expiration of the term of this Franchise, unless an extension is granted or company has requested renewal pursuant to applicable federal law. Municipality shall give Company sixty (60) days' written notice prior to taking action to enforce such termination. 
    8.2.1 Should Company propose to cease providing service, it shall take all such actions as are necessary to provide an orderly transition of service to a new provider, without interruption in service to Subscribers. 
    8.3  Franchise Required/Modification . It shall be unlawful for any Person to construct, operate or maintain a Cable System or Multi-channel Video Programming Distribution ("MVPD") facility or to provide Cable Service, Video Programming or other MVPD services, including Open Video Services ("OVS"), in the City without a Franchise authorizing the same, unless applicable federal or State law prohibits the City's enforcement of such a requirement. For purposes of this Franchise, MVPD and OVS shall have the meanings ascribed to them under federal law. 
    The terms and conditions of all new or renewed franchises granted after the date of this Agreement shall be substantially similar in order that one franchise not be granted a competitive advantage over another. Nothing in this provision shall be construed in such a way as to limit the City's authority to enter into other franchises. Any franchise shall have the right to petition the City for modifications to its franchise to ensure competitive equity and, in addition, to provide for any rights it may have to modify its franchise under state or federal law. The City shall work in good faith with a franchise to review and adopt modifications which the franchise deems necessary, and the review and approval by City shall not be unreasonably delayed or denied. A franchise is not a person that provides direct broadcast satellite services for purposes of this section.

Sec. 10. - Defaults. 
    10.1  Events of Default . The occurrence at any time during the term of the Franchise, of any one or more of the following events, shall constitute an Event of Default by Company under this Franchise.

    10.1.4 Company's or a bankruptcy trustee's rejection of this franchise pursuant to the Bankruptcy Code (11 USC § 301 et seq.) 
    10.2  Uncured Events of Default . If company fails to perform in a timely manner any material obligation as determined by the City to be required herein, following notice from the City and an opportunity to cure such non-performance, the City may remedy such violation in accordance with the following procedures: 
    10.2.1 The City will first notify company of the violation in writing by delivery of registered or certified mail, and demand correction within a reasonable time. Company shall have thirty (30) days from receipt of the notice to: (a) respond to the City, contesting the assertion of non-compliance, which shall toll the running of any timeframes hereunder until company is afforded the public hearing required herein and a written determination of the City Council has been issued, or (b) cure such default, or (c) in the event that, by the nature of default, such default cannot be cured within the thirty (30) day period, initiate reasonable steps to remedy such default and notify the City of the steps being taken and the projected date that they will be completed. If company fails to correct the violation within the time prescribed or if company fails to commence corrective action within the time prescribed and diligently remedy such violation thereafter, company will then be given thirty (30) days' prior written notice of a public hearing to be held before the City Council. Said notice will specify the violations alleged to have occurred. 
    10.2.2 At the public hearing, the City Council will hear and consider all relevant evidence, and thereafter render findings and its decision. Such public hearing shall be held at the next regularly scheduled meeting of the City which is scheduled at a time which is no less than five business days therefrom. The City shall notify company in writing of the time and place of such meeting and provide company with an opportunity to be heard. 
    10.2.3 In the event the City Council finds that company has corrected the violation or has diligently commenced correction of such violation after notice thereof from the City and is diligently proceeding to fully remedy such violation, or that no material violation has occurred, the proceedings will terminate and no penalty or other sanction will be imposed. 
    10.2.4 Subject to applicable federal and state law, in the event the City Council finds that a material violation exists and that company has not corrected the same in a satisfactory manner or has not diligently commenced correction of such violation, the City Council may establish a date, no earlier than thirty (30) days following notification, by which company must comply with the obligation or the City may thereafter seek specific performance of any franchise provision, which reasonably lends itself to such remedy. In the case of a substantial default of a material provision of the franchise, the City Council may also implement the franchise termination procedures in accordance with the following: 
    10.2.4.1 The City shall give written notice to company of its intent to revoke the franchise on the basis of a pattern of non-compliance by company, including one or more instances of substantial non-compliance with a material provision of the franchise. The notice shall set forth the exact nature of the non-compliance. Company shall have ninety (90) days from such notice to object in writing and to state its reasons for such objection. In the event the City has not received a satisfactory response from company, it may then seek termination of the franchise at a public meeting. City shall cause to be served upon company, at least ten (10) days prior to such public meeting, a written notice specifying the time and place of such meeting and stating its intent to request such termination. 
    10.2.4.2 At the designated meeting, the City shall give company an opportunity to state its position on the matter, after which it shall determine whether or not a franchise shall be revoked. Company may appeal such determination to an appropriate court. Such appeal to the appropriate court must be taken within sixty (60) days of the issuance of the determination of the City. 
    10.2.4.3 The City may, at its sole discretion, take any lawful action which it deems appropriate to enforce the City's rights under the franchise in lieu of revocation of a franchise. 
    10.2.5 In determining whether a violation is material, the City will take into consideration the reliability of the evidence of the violation, the nature of the violation, and the damage, if any, caused to the City or the City's residents thereby, whether the violation was chronic, and any justifying or mitigating circumstances, and such other matters as the City may deem appropriate. The parties hereby agree that it is not the City's intention to subject company to penalties, fines, forfeitures or revocation of a franchise for so-called "technical" breach(es) or violation(s) of a franchise or local cable ordinance, which shall include, but are not limited to, the following: 
    10.2.5.1 In instances or for matters where a violation or a breach was a good faith error that resulted in no or minimal negative impact on the customers. 
    10.2.5.2 Where there existed circumstances reasonably beyond the control of company and which precipitated a violation by company of the franchise or local cable ordinance, or which were deemed to have prevented company from complying with a term or condition of the franchise or local cable ordinance. 
    10.3  Penalty . In the event, after complying with the due process procedures provided herein, the City finds that a material violation exists and that company has not corrected the same in a satisfactory manner or has not diligently commenced correction of such violation, the City may establish a date, no earlier than thirty (30) days following notification, by which company must comply with the obligation or the City may thereafter impose damages, payable from the security fund. 
    10.4  Revocation . Should the City seek to revoke a franchise after following the procedures set forth above, the City shall give written notice to company of its intent. The notice shall set forth the exact nature of the non-compliance. Company shall have ninety (90) days from such notice to object in writing and to state its reasons for such objection. In the event the City has not received a satisfactory response from company, it may then seek termination of the franchise at a public hearing. The City shall cause to be served upon company, at least thirty (30) days prior to such public hearing, a written notice specifying the time and place of such hearing and stating its intent to revoke the franchise. 
    At the designated hearing, the City shall give company an opportunity to state its position on the matter, after which it shall determine whether or not the franchise shall be revoked. Company may appeal such determination to an appropriate court. Such appeal to the appropriate court must be taken within sixty (60) days of the issuance of the determination of the City. 
    10.5  City's Rights to Enforce . The City may, at its sole discretion, take any lawful action which it deems appropriate to enforce the franchise and the exercise of any of the remedies as set forth herein shall not constitute an election of remedies or otherwise be considered a waiver by the City to take any lawful action or exercise any appropriate remedy it deems appropriate to enforce the terms and conditions of this franchise or ordinance. 
    10.6  Removal or Abandonment of Property . Notwithstanding anything to the contrary of this section, upon termination of a franchise, company or its successors and assigns shall retain ownership of the cable system and shall be entitled at its option and expense to remove the cable system from all rights-of-ways, private property, or to abandon said cable system. Should company elect to remove the cable system, it is obligated to restore all property to its prior condition. If company fails to restore the property satisfactorily within one year, the City may complete the work and company shall reimburse the City within ninety (90) days of receipt of an itemized bill for such work. 
    10.7  Force Majeure . Company shall not be held in default under, or in non-compliance with, the provisions of this franchise or ordinance, nor suffer any enforcement or penalty relating to non-compliance or default, where such non-compliance or alleged defaults occurred or were caused by circumstances reasonably beyond the ability of company to anticipate and control. This provision includes work delays caused by waiting for utility providers to service or monitor their utility poles to which company's cable system is attached, as well as unavailability of materials and/or qualified labor to perform the work necessary. 
    Furthermore, the parties hereby agree that it is not the City's intention to subject company to penalties, fines, forfeitures or revocation of the franchise for violations where the violation was a good faith error that resulted in no or minimal negative impact on the subscribers, or where strict performance would result in practical difficulties and hardship to company which outweigh the benefit to be derived by the City and/or subscribers. 
(Ord. of 7-7-08, § 10) 
Sec. 11. - Provision of information. 
    11.1  Annual Reports Required . Upon request company shall make available to the City the following annual reports not later than ninety (90) days after the request is made. 
    11.1.1 Any publicly available reports or documents which company must file with a government agency that specifically address company's obligation under the franchise, excepting federal and state income tax returns and forms, and such reports not required to be filed based on the federal Securities Act. 
    11.1.2 A copy of the publicly available consolidated report to its stockholders issued at the end of company's fiscal year rendered by company's parent company for all of its operations, if such a report exists. 
    11.1.3 A copy of its annual reports to the FCC as well as a copy of such annual report made to any state agency which in the future may regulate such system, if such a report exists. 
    11.2  Records . 
    11.2.1 The City shall have the right to inspect, upon reasonable notice and during normal business hours, any records maintained by company which relate to cable system operations including specifically company's accounting and financial records; provided, however, company may withhold records it deems to be confidential and proprietary until the parties execute a nondisclosure agreement which will allow the City to lawfully withhold the confidential records consistent with applicable law. Company shall produce such books and records for City's inspection at company's local office or at another mutually agreed upon location. 
    11.2.2 The City acknowledges that some of the records, including maps and facility location information, that may be provided by company may be considered confidential by company and therefore may subject company to competitive disadvantage if made public. The City will maintain the confidentiality of any records provided to it that are identified by company in writing as "confidential" (confidential information). 
    Upon receipt of demand from any third party for disclosure of records pursuant to applicable law, the City shall advise company and provide company with a copy of any written request by the party demanding access to such records, if available, prior to the proposed release. The City agrees that, to the extent permitted by state and federal law, it shall deny access to any of company's books and records marked confidential as set forth above. If the City is compelled to disclose any confidential information pursuant to applicable federal or state laws, rules, regulations, or court orders or subpoenas (each a "Requirement"), the City shall provide the company with prompt notice of any such requirement and shall cooperate with the company, at the company's sole expense, in seeking to obtain any protective order or other arrangement pursuant to which the confidentiality of the company's confidential information is preserved. If such an order or arrangement is not obtained, the City shall disclose only that portion of the company's confidential information as is required pursuant to such requirement. Any such required disclosure shall not, in and of itself, change the status of the disclosed information as the company's confidential information. Subject to the City's compliance with this section, the City shall not be liable to company for any submission or disclosure of such information to a third party as required by applicable law or to a government agency or regulatory body seeking the records and claiming jurisdiction in any of these events. Nothing in this section shall limit the right of company to contest disclosure or submission to a third party as required by law or to a government agency or regulatory body asserting jurisdiction over it or such subject matter before such disclosure shall be effected. Company shall reimburse the City for all reasonable costs and attorney's fees incurred in any legal proceedings pursued under this section. 
    11.3  Lawsuits . Upon request Company shall provide Municipality with copies of all publicly filed pleadings in all lawsuits pertaining to the granting of this Franchise and the operation of the Cable System to which it is a party within thirty (30) days of Company's receipt of same. 
    11.4  Periodic Evaluation . The field of video communications is rapidly changing and may see many regulatory, technical, financial, marketing, and legal changes during the term of this franchise. Therefore, in order to provide for a maximum degree of flexibility and to help achieve continued advanced and modern cable systems serving the City that meet the needs of the City, the following evaluation provisions shall apply: 
    11.4.1 Subject to the provisions of this section and upon thirty (30) days' written notice to company, the City may require an evaluation session. The evaluation session may occur no sooner than the fifth (5th) anniversary date of this franchise. Such evaluation shall determine if it is appropriate to amend this franchise to address developments in the field of video communications that may have taken place over the course of time. Any proposed amendment of the franchise under this section shall be based upon the reasonable cable needs and related needs and interests of the City and subscribers and take into consideration the costs to company of meeting those needs and interests. The City and company shall negotiate amendments to the franchise in good faith. 
    11.4.2 All evaluation sessions shall be open to the public and notice of sessions published in the same way as the City publishes other legal notices. 
    11.4.3 Topics which may be discussed at any evaluation session may include, but are not limited to, application of new technologies, company's performance, programming offered, access channels, facilities and support, municipal uses of cable, customer complaints, amendments to ordinances and this franchise, judicial rulings, FCC rulings, line extension policies, and any other topics City and company deem relevant. 
    11.4.4 Notwithstanding any provisions of this section, the City and company may at any time amend the franchise by mutual consent.

    12.3  Conferences . The parties hereby agree to meet at reasonable times on reasonable notice to discuss any aspect of this Franchise, the provision of Cable Services or the Cable System during the term of this Franchise. 
    12.4  Governing Law . This Franchise shall be construed pursuant to the laws of the State of North Dakota and the United States of America. The company agrees to comply with the terms of any lawfully adopted generally applicable local ordinance, to the extent that the provisions of the ordinance do not have the effect of limiting or impairing the benefits or expanding the obligations of the company that are granted by this franchise. This franchise may only be amended with the mutual written consent of the City and the company. Neither City nor company may unilaterally alter the material rights and obligations set forth in this franchise or an ordinance. Company's rights and duties pursuant to an ordinance and a franchise may only materially altered or impaired with company's prior written consent, which shall not be unreasonably withheld. In the event of a conflict between any other ordinance and this franchise, the franchise shall control, provided however that company agrees that it is subject to the lawful exercise of the police power of the City. 
    12.5  Waiver of Compliance . No failure by either party to insist upon the strict performance of any covenant, agreement, term or condition of this Franchise, or to exercise any right, term or remedy consequent upon a breach thereof shall constitute a waiver of any such breach or such covenant, agreement, term or condition. No waiver of any breach shall affect or alter this Franchise, but each and every covenant, agreement, term or condition of this Franchise shall continue in full force and effect with respect to any other then existing or subsequent breach thereof. 
    12.5.1 Municipality grants this Franchise solely for a Cable System and for transaction of a Cable Television Business. Company may assert claims to the effect that once its facilities have been placed in the streets and Public Ways it will be entitled under Federal law to use them for other purposes without the consent or authorization of Municipality and without necessarily paying compensation therefore. Municipality disputes any such claim. Municipality further asserts that if any such claims by Company were to be sustained there would be, among other things, an unconstitutional taking of Municipality's property in violation of the Fifth Amendment of the United States Constitution. Company disputes this claim. Neither the issuance nor the acceptance of this Franchise constitutes or will be claimed to constitute a waiver or relinquishment of any rights or defenses of either Municipality or Company in connection with these disputed issues. Municipality and Company acknowledge that this section is not intended to be a comprehensive statement of their respective claims and positions and that they intend to defer all disputes that may arise out of or relate to use by Company of its facilities in the streets and Public Ways for purposes other than a Cable System. 
    12.5.2 Company asserts that Municipality's Franchise Fees are limited by Federal statute to five percent (5%) of revenues from "cable services," all as defined in Section 622 of the Communications Act of 1934, 47 U.S.C. Section 542. Municipality asserts that any such limit is unconstitutional, among other things an unconstitutional taking of Municipality's property in violation of the Fifth Amendment of the United States Constitution. Company disputes this claim. Neither the issuance nor the acceptance of this Franchise constitutes or will be claimed to constitute a waiver or relinquishment of any rights or defenses of either Municipality or Company in connection with these disputed issues. Municipality and Company acknowledge that this section is not intended to be a comprehensive statement of their respective claims and positions and that they intend to defer all disputes that may arise out of or relate to statutory limits on Franchise Fees. 
    12.6  Independent Contractor Relationship . The relationship of Company to Municipality is and shall continue to be an independent contractual relationship, and no liability or benefits, such as worker's compensation, pension rights or liabilities, insurance rights or liabilities or other provisions or liabilities, arising out of or related to a contract for hire or employer/employee relationship, shall arise or accrue to either party or either party's agents or employees as a result of the performance of this Franchise, unless expressly stated in this Franchise. 
    12.7  Severability . If any section, paragraph, or provision of this Franchise shall be held to be invalid or unenforceable for any reason, the invalidity or unenforceability of such section, paragraph, or provision shall not affect any of the remaining provisions of this Franchise. 
    12.8  Effective Date . This Franchise shall be effective as of September 1, 2008 (Effective Date). Any prior franchise shall terminate as of midnight of the day immediately preceding the Effective Date of this Franchise, except as provided in Section 13.1. 
    12.9  Captions . All captions are for convenience of use and have no substantive effect, except for those captions in the Definitions section of this Franchise. The failure to capitalize a defined term herein shall not alter its meaning. 
    12.10  Conflicts . In the event of a conflict between this Franchise and the provisions of any prior franchise or any franchise, permit, consent agreement or other agreement with Company, the provisions of this Franchise shall control. 
    12.11  Franchise Accepted . Company further acknowledges by acceptance of this Franchise that it has carefully read the terms and conditions of this Franchise and any applicable cable ordinance of Municipality and accepts the obligations imposed thereby regardless of whether such obligations are contained in the Franchise or such cable ordinance, or both. As of the Effective Date, and without waiving any rights Company may have to challenge the lawfulness or enforceability of this Franchise or municipal ordinances in the future, Company does not contend that any provision of the Franchise is unlawful or unenforceable, nor is it aware of any municipal ordinance which it contends is unlawful or unenforceable. 
    12.12  Non-Waiver, Preemption . Nothing in this Franchise shall be deemed an agreement by Municipality as to any claimed preemptive effect, nor shall it be deemed a waiver of Municipality's right to challenge any claimed preemptive effect, of any subsequent Federal law, regulation, or court ruling alleged to conflict with, alter, limit, or replace terms, requirements or conditions of this Franchise in effect as of the Effective Date. 
    12.13  Reserved Rights . Municipality reserves all rights and powers under its police powers and powers conferred by Federal, State or local law. In particular Municipality reserves the right to alter, amend, or repeal its municipal code and cable ordinance as it determines shall be conducive to the health, safety and welfare of the public, or otherwise in the public interest. Municipality agrees that by accepting this Franchise, Company has not waived its right to object to the application to it of actions by Municipality pursuant to its reserved rights or police powers. 
    12.14  Contingent Provision . In the event that by virtue of Federal or State action, or Court ruling, Municipality is deemed no longer to have the right to require a franchise for the use of its public rights-of-way, the parties agree to modify this agreement to the extent necessary to comply with such Federal or State action, or Court ruling so as to fulfill the intentions of the parties thereto. In said event, to the extent allowed by law, the parties will modify this agreement to provide for a license fee, however, Midcontinent shall not be obligated to pay in gross more than it pays under this agreement, to any combination of the City, State, or federal government, it being the intention of the parties that Midcontinent shall be entitled to credits for all payments made to governmental entities in lieu of a franchise fee and not be placed in a position of paying twice.

Sec. 2. - Franchise required.

(Ord. No. 2503, § 1) 
Sec. 3. - Obtaining franchise.

Upon the latest of (1) the approval by the city attorney of the form of the guaranty, (2) its execution by the guarantor, and (3) the approval by the city council of the substitution of a guaranty for the bond and the identity of the guarantor, the city clerk shall surrender the franchise bond to the franchisee. 
(Ord. No. 2503, § 1; Ord. No. 3409, § 1) 
Sec. 4. - Effect of franchise. 
(a)  The issuance of a franchise to a person shall constitute nonexclusive permission to him to use the streets for the construction and maintenance of a system, subject to the rights of municipal regulation set forth in this division, ordinances supplementary to and amendatory of this division, and regulations established under the authority of this division. 
(b)  The filing of an application for a franchise, along with the filing of a franchise bond and the payment of the franchise fee, shall be considered an offer to enter into a contract, which offer shall be considered accepted, and which contract shall be considered binding, upon the issuance of the franchise by the city clerk at the direction of the city council. There is included within the terms of the contract the provisions of this division, ordinances supplementary hereto and amendatory hereof, and regulations established under the authority of this division. However supplementary ordinances, amendatory ordinances, and regulations established after the issuance of the franchise, shall not be contractually binding upon the franchisee (although they may be otherwise binding upon the franchisee as a lawful exercise of the city's police power), unless the provisions thereof can be fairly considered to be implied terms of the contract at the time that it was first entered into. This section pertaining to the contractual nature of the legal relationship between the city and the franchisee is set forth in order to state and to assert a basis independent of its police power for the city's regulatory powers with respect to the business affairs and operations of the franchisee. 
(Ord. No. 2503, § 1) 
Sec. 5. - Reservation of police power. 
    Nothing herein is to be construed as a waiver or a relinquishment of the city's police power to regulate the business affairs and operations of the franchisee and the city shall remain free to do so by way of supplementary ordinances, amendatory ordinances, and regulations established under the authority of this division, even though the contractual agreements and undertakings between the city and the franchisee are altered thereby, provided that, however, the contractual alteration is of such a nature that it would be permissible under the "impairment of contracts" clause of the U.S. Constitution if accomplished by the city as an exercise of its police power with respect to a contract between the franchisee and some third party. 
(Ord. No. 2503, § 1) 
Sec. 6. - Reservation of taxing power and exercise thereof. 
(a)  Nothing herein is to be construed as waiving or relinquishing the authority of the city to impose taxes or service fees upon the business affairs and operations of the franchisee. 
(b)  To the extent that any financial imposition by the city against the franchisee cannot be supported upon any other theory than as an exercise of the city's authority to impose taxes, it shall be treated as a tax to the maximum extent that is permissible to do so. 
(Ord. No. 2503, § 1) 
Sec. 7. - Regulations established by city council. 
(a)  In addition to the specific provisions of this ordinance which regulate the business affairs and operations of the franchisee, the city council from time to time, after a public hearing upon reasonable notice and the provision of a reasonable opportunity to be heard, may by resolution establish new regulations or amend the existing regulations pertaining to the business affairs and operations of the franchisee. 
(b)  Without limiting the scope of other permissible regulations which can be created under the authority of subsection (a), and because the city council finds that the business of cable casting is a business charged with the public interest, there is specifically reserved the right to regulate the fees or charges imposed by the franchisee upon its customers and the quantity and quality of services which it renders, provided that, however, the rights reserved hereunder shall not be so exercised cumulatively, as opposed to individually, to deny to the franchisee a fair and reasonable return on its investment, under efficient and economical management. 
(Ord. No. 2503, § 1)

The regulations set forth in this chapter are the requirements of the I-1 Light Industrial Park District.
Section 15.2-2. General Purpose and Description:
The Light Industrial Park District includes a broad spectrum of land uses, some of which can be compatible with mixed use development. The Light Industrial Park District is intended to reserve sites appropriate for location of industrial uses with relatively limited environmental impacts. The development concept consists of industry clusters anchored by light manufacturing, with some wholesale and selected retail components as outlined in Section 15.2-3. Outdoor storage in this Zoning District will provide for a limited amount of products, supplies or vehicles, such as those identified in Section 15.2-3, which shall be screened from roadways and adjacent properties. This Zoning District should be located on the periphery of industrial areas along major transportation corridors, and/or in a campus like setting.
The I-1 district is intended to provide space in attractive and appropriate locations for certain types of low-impact business and employment uses in a campus-like setting typical of business and industrial parks. A master planned approach would provide for more creative arrangements of buildings and open space that promote goods and idea exchange, reduce transportation costs and enhance synergies for value chain based cluster development.
Targeted uses include accessory and value-added businesses such as transportation, distribution, manufacturing, and warehousing that support the base agri-business tenants and energy related establishments. Some of the permitted uses in I-1 may also be permitted in other zoning districts such as M1, however, all development standards and regulations pertaining to the I-1 district are found solely in this chapter, unless otherwise referenced.

CHAPTER 15.3 - I-2, HEAVY INDUSTRIAL PARK DISTRICT
Section 15.3-1. Purpose and Intent:
The Heavy Industrial Park District is intended to accommodate a wide variety of heavy industrial uses, some of which may have significant external effects. The heavier industries are permitted, with fewer requirements as to screening, paving of parking areas and enclosure than in M-2 Districts, but with greater emphasis on complementing Light Industrial Park uses.
The I-2 district is intended to provide space in attractive and appropriate locations for certain types of heavy manufacturing and employment uses in a campus-like setting typical of business and industrial parks. A master plan approach would provide for more creative arrangements of buildings and open space that promote goods and idea exchange, reduce transportation costs and enhance synergies for value chain based cluster development.
Targeted uses include accessory and value-added businesses such as transportation, distribution, manufacturing, and warehousing that support the base agri-business tenants and energy related establishments. Some of the permitted uses in I-2 may also be permitted in other zoning districts such as M2, however, all development standards and regulations pertaining to I-2 district zones are found solely in this chapter, unless otherwise referenced. I-2 district zones are designated on the Future Land Use Map of the Comprehensive Development Plan as Industrial.
Section 15.3-2. Uses Permitted:
a)Any permitted use in I-1 Light Industrial Park District except for those uses found inSection 15.2-3 (d) commercial use types.

b)Gross Leasable Area shall mean the total building area designed for tenant occupancyexcluding non-occupied areas including restrooms, underground parking, mechanical rooms,elevators, stairways, storage and or basement areas.
c)Where fractional spaces result, the parking spaces required shall be construed to be thenearest whole number.
d)The parking space requirement for a use not specifically mentioned herein shall be the sameas required for a use of similar nature.
e)Whenever a building or use constructed or established after November 3, 1958, is changedor enlarged in floor area, number of employees, number of dwelling units, seating capacityor otherwise, to create a need for an increase of ten percent (10%) or more in the number ofexisting parking spaces, such spaces shall be provided on the basis of the enlargement orchange. Whenever a building or use existing prior to November 3, 1958, is enlarged to theextent of fifty percent (50%) or more in floor area or in the area used, said building or useshall then and thereafter comply with the parking requirements set forth herein.
f)Unless otherwise specified in the Chapter and in the case of mixed use, the parking spacesrequired shall equal the sum of the requirements of the various uses computed separately.
g)Required parking in residential districts shall not be located within the front yard.
h)Shared Parking: Parking spaces required by this Chapter may be shared by two or morebuildings or uses if it reasonably appears that ordinarily the patrons of one building or usewill not use the spaces at the same time as the patrons of the other buildings or uses involvedin the sharing agreement, as for example, by way of illustration and not by limitation, a retailstore sharing parking spaces with a church or a theater or dance hall sharing parking spaceswith a bank. In order to avail themselves of this exception the parties must enter into a writtenagreement providing for the sharing of parking spaces as herein provided for a period of timeco-extensive with the projected lifetime of the building or uses sharing the parking, whichwritten agreement shall be recorded in the office of the Register of Deeds before a certificateof occupancy is issued. Shared parking allowed by this section shall not be separated from theuses or buildings by any public street or where it is unreasonable to expect people to park inthose areas due to distance or traffic and shall not exceed a distance of three hundred (300)feet from the entrance to the building or use served by the parking lot.
i)Demonstrated parking: The City Council may approve a proof-of-parking plan whichallows for a portion of the required future parking, not to be constructed, but demonstratesthat the minimum number of required parking spaces can be accommodated on the propertyand meet setback requirements. The plan must demonstrate that all other applicableordinances can be met if the full amount of required parking were to be constructed. The areafor future parking must be maintained as green space (sodded with grass or natural plantmaterials). Any changes to use and/or building size could invalidate the approval forDemonstrated Parking. Demonstrated parking may reserve the right to require installationof the additional parking spaces.

Section 23-6. Parking Lot Design Standards:
a) Parking space defined: a parking space is an area, enclosed in the main building or in anaccessory building, or unenclosed, exclusive of driveways, which is used on a regularlyrecurring basis for the parking of a motor vehicle and which is connected to a buildingentrance, either:
1)immediately, or
2)by an access driveway, orc)
3)by a combination of an aisle or aisles and an access drivewaywith a street or alley.
b) Parking lot defined: a parcel of land (or combined parcels of land under commonownership or control) which contains five (5) or more parking spaces, along withany associated access driveway and any associated aisle or aisles.
c) Parking lot design standards are shown in Table 23-5(a) and 23-5(b) for nine (9) foot andten (10) foot parking spaces respectively. Required parking space width will be determinedby the Traffic Engineer according to proposed land use. For example, ten (10) foot widespaces will be required for high parking turnover uses such as retail sales, while nine (9)foot wide spaces will be required for low parking turnover uses such as office or employeeparking lots:

1)When a street or alley separates adjacent zoning districts requiring a buffer yard,the width of the buffer yard may be reduced to ten (10) feet. When an industrialuse is adjacent to a less intensive commercial use, the owner/developer of themore intensive use shall install and maintain a 10 wide landscaped buffer yardon his/her site abutting the entire length of the less intensive common boundary.
2)In either case, given the reduced area, the developer must erect a solid fence orwall on the inside or outside line of the buffer yard, at least six feet (6) in heightfor the entire length of the required buffer yard (unless waived by the PlanningDirector), and plant one hundred percent (100%) evergreen trees of a compact,upright growth habit. The specific species and/or cultivar shall becalled out onthe Landscape Plan for approval by the Planning Department in meeting thesespecial requirements. Required spacing shall be one (1) tree per each ten (10)lineal feet of buffer yard for the entire length of the buffer yard (See Diagram24-10). Chain link fencing with privacy slats shall not be used to meet thefencing requirement.
g)Supplemental Landscaping. In addition to the landscaping requirements set forthin other Sections of this Chapter, Supplemental Landscaping is required as follows:
1) Applicability. Supplemental Landscaping is required for the followinglandscape areas:
a.Foundation perimeter plantings
b.Interior parking lot landscape islands
c.Street yard landscaping strip adjacent to the street(s) for premises with areasused for display of vehicles in conjunction with commercial vehicle sales orrental lots offering; passenger cars and trucks, boats, and recreational
Revised 214 September 2019 CityofMinot
vehicles if up to the fifty percent (50%) maximum reduction in required street trees has been granted. (50% reduction is only available to vehicle display. No other uses are viable. Supplemental landscaping is required here to offset the 50% reduction. Supplemental landscaping in the other two instances, a and b is required with no reduction in tree quantities.
2) Plant Unit Quantities. For the purposes of this Section, the minimum amount ofSupplemental Landscaping expressed as total plants required is calculated bymultiplying the total area of the landscape bed or island in question by thenumber five (5) and dividing this total by the number one hundred (100).
Total s.f. of island, median, or other feature to be landscaped x 5 = Total Plants Required 100
3) Plant Categories. To ensure diversity and promote design flexibility in the finallandscape plants are divided into the following five (5) categories:
a)Large Shrubs. Exceeding six feet in height at maturity. Can be deciduousor evergreen.
b)Shrubs (small to medium) Achieving four (4) to six (6) feet in height. Canbe deciduous or evergreen.
c)Ornamental grasses.
d)Perennial plants.
e)Groundcover plants.
4) Plant Percentages. To insure diversity in plant material a minimum percentageof the total requirement shall apply to each plant category. The percentages areassigned to each plant type in Table 24-2. Once the minimum number of plantsrequired by plant type are determined, the remaining required plants can be ofany of the five types (designers choice).
Table 24-2. Percentage Multipliers.
Plant Type
Percentage Multiplier
Shrub (large)  5 gallon minimum
5 % required
Shrub  2 gallon minimum
10% required
Ornamental Grasses  2 gallon min.
10% required
Perennial plants  1 gallon minimum
25% required
Groundcover  1 gallon minimum
10% required
Example: A landscape strip two hundred (200) lineal feet by ten (10) lineal feet.
Step One. The amount of landscape area in square feet is 200 x 10 = 2,000 S.F. Step Two. The total amount of plants required is 2,000 x 5 = 100 total plants
100
Step Three. Adjust the plant quantities by plant type using the Table 24-2 above. Large shrubs 100 plants x 5 percent = 5 required
Shrubs 100 plants x 10 percent = 10 required
Revised 215 September 2019 CityofMinot
Ornamental grasses 100 plants x 10 percent = 10 required Perennial plants 100 plants x 25 percent = 25 required Groundcover plants 100 plants x 10 percent = 10 required
Total required by type 60
Step Four. Determine remaining plants required. 100 minus 60 = 40 plants that can be any of the five categories.

Subdivisions or resubdivions of propertieswhich are partially or fully developed will only be required to provide for dedication on theundeveloped portion of the property being platted into lot(s). All land that qualifies for thismust be approved in agreement to the Minot Park District and adhere to the following:
b)Application. The provisions of this requirement shall apply to all of residential,commercial, industrial and other subdivisions within these districts. This shall includereplats where land dedication and/or Fee per Unit of dedication have not beenpreviously provided. Where landowners previously have dedicated land in advance ofdevelopment, the city staff in cooperation with the Minot Park District will determineif a dedication will be required and what an equitable amount would be. Prior to thesubmittal of the application the landowner or developer of the land must meet with theMinot Park District to discuss if the park dedication location is within a desired area ofthe park district and if any trail systems maintained by the park district need to be placedwithin the subdivision.

The City will then notify the Park District and provideinformation on the proposed subdivision. The Park District will be given thirty (30) days,concurrent with the review of the subdivision information and provide recommendations,whereupon the application will be considered complete and the City will proceed toCommittee hearings.
Revised 238 CityofMinot September 2019
The Planning Commission will consider the Park District recommendations in addition to public uses and facilities identified within the Comprehensive Plan and other City plans when formulating their recommendation to the City Council. The City Council will have final authority, with the approval of the Park District, to determine whether land dedicationor Fee per Unit of land dedication will be accepted.
d)Agreement. For each subdivision of property, the subdivider will provide an agreementshowing legal description of the land dedication, Fee Per Unit or both prior to any recordingof the plat. This agreement will be approved by the City Attorney and the Park DistrictAttorney and Director. The agreement needs to be approved and signed prior to the Citysrelease of the signed final plat (Mylars) for recording with Ward County RecordersOffice.
e)Types of Dedication. Dedication of land, Fee Per Unit or variation of both will be required forany large subdivision of land of ten (10) lots or three (3) acres of contiguous land or morewithin a development on any land previously divided by plat, metes or bounds or any othermeans, applicants and/or developers shall dedicate a reasonable amount of land for parks,playgrounds, public open spaces or trails. An exception can be made, upon approval by theMinot Park District, to postpone the required land dedication or determination of fee in lieu ifthe proposed subdivision is for purposes of sales transition and not for development purposes.If a dedication determination is postponed it shall be documented as such by the City of Minotand Minot Park District. Such postponement does not exempt the parcel from required futurededication upon future subdivision for development purposes. Meetings with the city staff andMinot Park District are required before any subdivision application will be considered for CityCouncil. There are three different ways of dedicating land listed below.
1)Fee per Unit of Land Dedication. When it is determined by the Park District that parkdedication is not desirable due to location, size or other suitability factors, the City shallrequire, in lieu of land dedication, a cash Fee Per Unit (individual dwelling unit, i.e. Single-family home equals one (1) dwelling unit) dedication. The Fee Per Unit is equal to a rateset by the Minot Park District that will be compiled yearly based on land value, price ofmaterials, and additional costs. For the purposes of this section, Fee per Unit shall bedetermined at the time of final plat approval in accordance with the Park District rates. TheFee per Unit will then be issued when the building permit fee is collected. Fee per Unit willbe adjusted yearly and all developments or property owners will pay the same per unit feebased on their zoning and units.
2)Land Dedication. The amount of land required to be dedicated by the subdivider pursuantto this ordinance, shall be based upon the type of development and the total amount of Feesper Unit that would be generated by the development at full build out. The Minot ParkDistrict will not be forced to take any land that they dont need and/or want for the purposeof dedication. Prior to the submittal of the application the landowner or developer of theland must meet with the Minot Park District to discuss if the park dedication location iswithin a desired area of the park district and if any trail systems maintained by the parkdistrict need to be placed within the subdivision.
The city staff in cooperation with the Minot Park District will determine if a dedication willbe required and what an equitable amount would be based on the Minot Park District Feeper Unit Breakdown. The subdivider and the Minot Park District will then have anagreement that will be submitted to the city stating the legal transfer of land, maintenanceof land, and any additional amenities that would be included. When land dedication isaccepted, the amount of land will be calculated based on the following figures:
Revised 239 CityofMinot September 2019
a.The total amount of Fees per Unit that would be generated by the development atfull build out.
b.Fair market value of land, based on the average cost of land within that zoningdistrict.
For the purposes of this section, these two figures will be a rate set by the Minot Park District in accordance with the City Assessor, that will be compiled yearly based on land value, price of materials, and additional cost. Once these two figures are calculated, the amount of land to be dedicated is determined by how much land it would take to equal the fees generated by the development.
All land dedications shall be conveyed by warranty deed to the Park District.
Where no proposed use is given for lots within the proposed subdivision, the City will base the required dedication on the future land use as shown in the Comprehensive Plan. Industrially zoned properties are exempt.
3)Combined Land and Fee Per Unit Dedication. The City and the Minot Park District mayelect to receive a combination of cash as a Fee Per Unit and land as part of park landdedication requirements. In such cases, the developer or builder would have an agreementthat is approved by the Park District. This would allow the percentage of land dedicated toreduce the amount of Fee Per Unit or waived by an equal amount.
f)Land Sustainability. Land to be dedicated shall be reasonably suitable for its intended use andshall be at a location convenient to the people to be served. In evaluating the adequacy ofproposed land dedications, the City shall consider factors including size, shape, topography,geology, hydrology, tree cover, access and location. Land will not be accepted as meeting therequired dedication if it is encumbered with major utility easements, storm drains or retentionareas, wetlands or other features which make the property difficult to utilize for parks or otherdesired municipal or park facilities. The City may consider land for parks or open space that islocated in the vicinity of areas for storm water retention, major drains, or wetlands or othernatural features provided the dedication will further the interests of the City or Park District, aswell as the Citys Comprehensive Plan. The City Council will have final authority, with theapproval of the Park District, to determine whether land will be accepted for dedication withthe direction of the Park District.
g)Timing and Maintenance. Prior to final plat approval by the City Council, the subdividershall denote on the plat the designated park or open space land, or shall tender a deed of thededicated land to the public entity that is to receive the land. If the plat is not approved, thedeed shall be returned to the subdivider. The transfer of the deed is only final upon finalapproval of plat. The public entity that receives the dedicated land shall be required tomaintain such land.
h)Payment and Timing Procedures. The builder or property owner shall make the payment to
Example of calculation of land amount: If fees generated (# of Units x Value) = $150,000
If fair market value =$25,000 per acre
$150,000/$25,000 = 6 acres to be dedicated
Revised 240 CityofMinot September 2019
the City when fees are collected for the building permit. Funds received by the City shall be placed in the park district foundation for park development and in the discretion of the Park Board be used to benefit the residents of the community. Any public facilities constructed or improved with these funds shall be located in the general neighborhood if benefitting that subdivision, or elsewhere in the community if benefitting the community as a whole following the Park District master plan.
i)Private Open Space/ Parks in Higher Density Districts:
Private Open Space/Parks. Where private open space for park and recreation purposes isprovided in a proposed subdivision, such areas may be used for credit, at the discretion of theCity Council, against the requirement of dedication for park and recreation purposes, providedthe City Council finds it in the public interest to do so. Generally, however, land dedicationsfor private parks will be discouraged.
Homeowners' Association: If a homeowners' association shall be established, Fee perUnit maybe reduced or waived. The Park District will accept a reduced or waived Fee per Unitbased on a proposed park or open space and connection to bike trail system, storm waterelements, drives, utilities, etc. These elements are subject to review and approval from the CityEngineer, City Attorney, and Director of the Park District. The Homeowners Association willbe responsible for all maintenance including but not limited to any landscaping, exteriorbuilding, snow clearing and regular maintenance of private driveways and other areas ownedin common ownership when there is more than one individual property owner having interestwithin the development.
j)Plan to Provide for Public Use:
Wherever a tract to be subdivided includes area for school, or other public use, such as streets,which are indicated on official City plans or any portion thereof, such space may be requiredfor reservation by the Planning Commission (zoning designation to Public Zone). If sorequired, the Planning Commission shall give the public agency involved sixty (60) days toexpress its interest in the proposed subdivision in connection with the use of the public site.Should interest be expressed by the public agency involved, that agency shall have anadditional sixty (60) days within which to arrange for the acquisition of the public site underconsideration. If no interest is shown within the first sixty (60) days, the developer may proceedwith development of the parcel in question.
k)Amenities and Preservation of Natural Features:
1)General. Existing and proposed natural features which would add value to land, enhancetraffic corridors, or benefit the City as a whole, shall be preserved and/or included in thedesign of subdivisions.
2)Boulevard Trees. Boulevard trees shall be planted in accordance with the City of Minotand the City Forester. The installation of the trees provided for within the landscapingplan shall then be installed when the street is developed to urban road standards.
l)Fair Market Value:
If the developer or subdivider doesnt believe in the fair market value that is set by the MinotPark District in accordance with the City Assessor that is compiled yearly may be subjected tothe following:
1)The City and the developer may agree as to the fair market value; or
2)The fair market value may be based upon a current appraisal submitted to the City by thesubdivider at the subdividers expense. The appraisal shall be made by appraisers who arecertified or licensed through the State of North Dakota.
Revised 241 CityofMinot September 2019
3)If the City disputes such appraisal, the City may, at the subdividers expense, obtain anappraisal of the property by a qualified real estate appraiser, in which the appraisal shallbe conclusive evidence of the fair market value of the land.
m)Severability:
If Any Section, sentence, clause or phrase of this ordinance is for any reason held to beinvalid or unconstitutional by a decision of any court of competent jurisdiction, such asdecision shall not affect the validity of the remaining portions of this ordinance.

Section 28.1-26 -- 28.1-40. Reserved.
SUBDIVISION B  PRINCIPLES AND PRACTICES
Section 28.1-41. Storm Water Design Standards Manual:
The storm water design standards manual, as adopted and amended by the City of Minot, is adopted herein by reference thereto. The manual contains the principal standards and design criteria for developing an effective and acceptable storm water management plan. The manual contains:
a)Details about the contents of a storm water management plans which areadditional to those set forth in this Chapter;
b)Criteria for hydrologic evaluations, the design of storm water management systemfacility components, water quality protection standards, instructions for thedevelopment of an erosion and sedimentation control plan, and requirements foreasements and right-of-way.
c)A discussion of operation and maintenance requirements, standard forms to beused, and standard construction details adopted by the City.
d)A storm water management plan checklist that must be submitted to the Cityaspart of a storm water management plan.
Section 28.1-42. Planning Preferences:
The narrative analysis component of the storm water management plan shall discuss whether the plan incorporates the following preferences in storm water management and control, or why such preferences were deemed to be not appropriate.
This narrative shall include:
a)The natural infiltration of precipitation and runoff on-site, if suitable soil andgeological conditions are available, using to that purpose as much natural orvegetated area on the site as possible, while minimizing impervious surfaces, anddirecting runoff to vegetated areas rather than onto adjoining streets, stormsewersand ditches.
b)The use of natural topography and land cover such as wetlands, ponds, naturalswales and depressions as they exist before development to the degree that they canaccommodate the additional water flow without compromising the integrity orquality of these natural features.
c)The use of storm water detention facilities.
d)The use of storm water retention facilities.
Revised 254 CityofMinot September 2019
Section 28.1-43. Capacity Considerations:
The storm water management plan shall:
a)Analyze the hydraulic capacities of downstream natural channels, reaches, storm sewersystems, and streets, in order to determine whether they have sufficient conveyancecapacity to receive and accommodate post-development runoff discharges and volumeswithout causing:
1)Channel erosion;
2)Increased property damage; or
3)Any increase in the established base flood plain elevation.
b)Analyze the adequacy of any outlet used as a discharge point.
c)Satisfy the requirement that in no circumstances shall the developed peak flow exceed theexisting peak flow for the 2-, 5-, 10-, and 100-year, 24-hour storm events and the 100- year,10-day snowmelt event, except where the City has provided sufficient downstream flooddetention facilities for the development or redevelopment areas proposed land use and areaof imperviousness (as determined by the City Engineer). For projects located within thecontributing drainage area to a regional detention facility, this requirement of no increasein peak flow is applicable until regional detention ponds are constructed.
d)Satisfy the requirement that hydrologic analysis performed to calculate peak flow mustutilize the Soil Conservation Service, or SCS, (now Natural Resources ConservationService, or NRCS) methodology, the NRCS Type II storm distribution, and precipitationvalues published in the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)Atlas 14, Volume 8, unless otherwise specified by the City Engineer. Additional detail isprovided in the Storm Water Design Standards Manual.
e)Consider the feasibility of infiltrating or otherwise retaining a volume equivalent to oneinch of runoff from the project impervious area in situations where downstream volumecapacity issues exist (as determined by the City Engineer). If determined to be infeasible,the rationale shall be presented in the narrative.
Section 28.1-44 Water Quality Considerations:
The storm water management plan shall satisfy the following requirements for water quality (additional detail is provided in the Storm Water Design Standards Manual):
a)Pre-treatment of all temporary off-site discharges during construction.
b)Implementation of all applicable erosion and sediment control devices and practices asspecified in Chapter 11 of the Storm Water Design Standards Manual.
c)Treatment of the first one inch of runoff from the projects impervious area for newdevelopment. The City encourages developers to use the following methods to achievewater quality goals, in order of decreasing preference:
1)Infiltration (or other abstraction)
2)Filtration
3)Extended detention
Revised 255 CityofMinot September 2019
Section 28.1-45. Floodplain Considerations:
The storm water management plan must comply with applicable floodplain management criteria, which include:
a)Requirements included in the City Zoning Ordinance for areas shown on:
1)The City flood insurance rate maps (FIRMs), and
2)Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) FIRMs.
b)The requirement of at least one foot of clearance (freeboard) between the lowest floor ofa structure and the 100-year flood elevation of all adjacent storm water managementfacilities, including:
1)Ponds,
2)Wetlands,
3)Streams,
4)Sloughs, and
5)Overland conveyances.
c)Requirements for projects near the following water bodies (or as determined by the CityEngineer):
Mouse (Souris) River
Livingston Coulee
Gassman Coulee
Puppy Dog Coulee
First Larson Coulee
Second Larson Coulee
This includes the requirement that the lowest floor of structures for all new plats must be higher than one (1) foot above the established floodplains.
d)The Ward County Floodplain Zoning Ordinance, if the parcel is within the extraterritorialjurisdiction and/or discharges onto property outside the extraterritorial jurisdiction.
Section 28.1-46. Operation, Maintenance, and Inspection Considerations:
Insofar as a storm water management plan calls for permanent improvements on private property which are part of a storm water management system, due regard shall be paid to:
a)The desirability of a design which minimizes the need for maintenance (designconsiderations are included in the Storm Water Design Standards Manual).
b)The right of the City Engineer to inspect such improvements from time to time and, tothat end, the need of a legal right of access to them, such as by easements or otherproperty interests.
c)The Citys preference for a design which minimizes the extent to which storm watermanagement facilities are located on private lots when regional detention is available.
d)The Citys requirement that developers provide final grading plans to all property ownersfollowing completion of the project.
e)The right of the City Engineer to require a developers agreement for maintenance, basedupon review of the operation and maintenance plan included in the storm watermanagement plan submitted by the developer. The developers agreement specifies theauthority of the City should the developer fail to fulfill the agreed-upon operation,inspection, and maintenance responsibilities.
Revised 256 CityofMinot September 2019
Section 28.1-47. Construction Plans and Specifications:
When the construction of improvements called for in a storm water management plan are of sufficient magnitude and consequence to, in his judgment, so warrant, the City Engineer shall require that such plan include a drawing or drawings delineating the erosion and sedimentation management plan, including details of silt fences, storm drain inlet protection, erosion control facilities and other BMP's. In addition, the construction specifications shall contain technical provision describing erosion, sedimentation, and water control requirements to be utilized during and after construction, as well as define the entities responsible for the installation and maintenance of the BMP's. See Section 28.1-41.
Section 28.1-48. Other Standards:
In the event that other standards, either state or federal, apply to matters within the scope of this subdivision, the more restrictive, or most restrictive, as the case may be, standard shall apply.
Section 28.1-49. Phasing Allowed:
On a case by case basis, and in the interest of economy and practicality, the City Engineer may allow a storm water management plan to be submitted and approved in phases, with such interim storm water alteration activities being performed in the interim between phases as allowed or required in the plan itself.
Section 28.1-50. Plan-Specific Enforcement Mechanisms:
On a case by case basis, the City Engineer may require enforcement mechanisms specific to a particular storm water management plan, which may include without limitation any of the following:
a)The posting of security such as a performance bond, cash bond or letter of credit.
b)The use of the storm water management permit system provided for in Division 3.
c)The filing of a special assessment petition with the City to guarantee constructionof storm water management facilities.
d)The withholding of building permits until the facilities are completed or otherwiseguaranteed.
Section 28.1-51. In Lieu Fee:
The City Engineer, subject to the approval of the City Council, may approve a storm water management plan which provides for the payment of a specified in lieu fee instead of the provision for, and performance of, certain work which otherwise would form part of such plan.
