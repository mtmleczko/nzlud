A. Pursuant to § 27 of the General City Law, there shall be a City Planning
Board, hereinafter called the "Board," appointed by the Mayor, which
Board shall consist of seven members.
B. If a vacancy shall occur other than by expiration of a term, it shall be

C. Any member may be removed by the Mayor for cause and after public
hearing.

decisionmaking by the full membership of the Planning Board to the
maximum extent possible. The Mayor shall appoint two alternate
members to the Board to serve in place and stead of Board members
who are unable to attend a meeting due to recusal or absence. The term
of each alternate member shall be two years commencing on January 1
of the first year of appointment and ending on December 31 of the
second year. One of the initial terms shall be for one year so as to
effectuate a staggered sequencing of member terms. After initial
appointments, one member shall be appointed each year. An alternate
member whose term has expired may serve until replaced. In the event
of any alternate member position vacancy as a result of resignation,
change of residency, or removal, a new alternate member shall be
appointed to serve the remainder of the alternate member term. The
Chairperson of the Planning Board may designate an alternate member
to substitute for any member who is unable to participate due to recusal
or absence. Such designation shall be entered into the minutes of the
initial Board meeting at which the substitution is made. When so
designated, the alternate member(s) shall possess all the powers and
responsibilities of such member of the Board. All provisions of law
relating to Board member training and continuing education, eligibility,
vacancy in office, removal, compatibility of office and service on other
boards shall also apply to alternate members. These provisions are
specifically intended to supersede the provisions of New York General
City Law § 27, Subdivision 16, which limits substitution of alternate
members of city planning boards only to instances of conflict of interest.

revenues, including a per capita share of advertising revenues for
advertising carried on more than one cable system; revenues from home
shopping channels; sales of programming guides; and such other revenue
sources as may now exist or hereafter develop. The definition shall be
interpreted in a manner which permits the City to collect the maximum
franchise fee permitted by law, irrespective of the source of revenue. "Gross
revenues," however, shall not include any bad debt (defined as unpaid
subscriber or advertiser accounts) or any taxes on services imposed directly
upon any subscriber (but not on a franchisee) or user by the state, City,
or other governmental unit and collected by a franchisee on behalf of said
governmental unit. The amount paid as a franchise fee shall not be deducted
from gross revenues unless required to be deducted under federal law.

§ 94-3 SARATOGA SPRINGS CODE § 94-3
C:132
PUBLIC PROPERTY  Any property that is owned or under the control of
the City that is not a public right-of-way, including, for purposes of this
chapter, but not limited to, buildings, parks, poles, structures in the public
rights-of-way such as utility poles and light poles, or similar facilities or
property owned by or leased to the City.

any street, road, highway, freeway, bridge, lane, path, alley, court, sidewalk,
parkway, drive, or right-of-way or easement primarily dedicated to travel,
now or hereafter existing within the City, which may be properly used
for the purpose of installing, maintaining, and operating a cable
communications system, and any other property that a franchisee is entitled
by state or federal law to use by virtue of the grant of a franchise.
SUBSCRIBER  The City or any person who is lawfully receiving, for any
purpose or reason, any cable service via a cable communications system,
whether or not a fee is paid for such service.

§ 94-4. Franchise required.
No person may construct or operate a cable communications system in the
City without first obtaining a City franchise therefor.
§ 94-5. Form of franchise.
Any franchise shall be issued in the form of a contract and must be executed
by both the City and the franchisee to become effective.
§ 94-6. Nature of franchise.
A. Scope. A franchise granted pursuant to this Code shall authorize and
permit a franchisee to construct, operate and repair a cable system or
an OVS (as applicable) to provide cable service in the City and for that
purpose to erect, install, construct, repair, replace, reconstruct,
maintain facilities appurtenant to such cable system in, on, over, under,
upon, across, and along those public rights-of-way that the City may
authorize a franchisee to use.
B. Nothing passes by implication. A franchise shall not convey rights other
than as specified in this chapter or in a franchise agreement; no rights
shall pass by implication.
C. Franchise not in lieu of other authorizations. A franchise shall not
include, or be a substitute for:
(1) Complying with requirements for the privilege of transacting and
carrying on a business within the City, including but not limited to
complying with the conditions the City may establish before
constructing facilities for, or providing, noncable services;
§ 94-3 CHARTER § 94-6
C:133
§ 94-7. Administration of chapter; adoption of regulations.
(2) Any permit, agreement or authorization required in connection
with operations on or in public rights-of-way or public property,
including, by way of example and not limitation, street cut permits;
or
(3) Any permits or agreements for occupying any other property of the
City or private entities to which access is not specifically granted
by the franchise.
D. Franchisee must comply with other laws. A franchise does not relieve a
franchisee of its duty to comply with all City ordinances and
regulations, and every franchisee must comply with the same. Likewise,
the rights granted under a franchise are subject to the exercise of
police and other powers the City now has or may later obtain, including
but not limited to the power of eminent domain. Every franchise shall
be deemed to incorporate all the requirements of the City Code.
E. Franchise not a grant of property rights. A franchise does not convey
title, equitable or legal, in the public rights-of-way. Rights granted may
not be subdivided or subleased.
F. Franchise nonexclusive. No franchise shall be exclusive, prevent the
City from issuing other franchises or authorizations, or prevent the City
from itself constructing, operating, or repairing its own cable
communications system, with or without a franchise.
G. Franchise term. Every franchise shall be for a term of years, which term
shall be eight years, unless a franchise specifies otherwise.
H. Costs borne by franchisee. Unless otherwise specifically stated in a
franchise or required by law, all acts which a franchisee is required to
perform under the franchise or applicable law must be performed at the
franchisee's expense.
I. Failures to perform. If a cable communications system operator fails to
perform work that it is required to perform within the time provided for
performance, the City may perform the work and bill the operator
therefor. The operator shall pay the amounts billed within 30 days.
A. Adoption of regulations. The City may, from time-to-time, adopt
regulations to implement the provisions of this chapter. This chapter,
and any regulations adopted pursuant to this chapter, are not contracts
with any franchisee and may be amended at any time.
B. Delegation. The Mayor or his/her designee (hereafter referred to as the
"Cable Administrator") is hereby authorized to administer the
provisions of this chapter and any franchise issued pursuant thereto
and to provide any notices (including noncompliance notices) and to
take any action on the City's behalf that may be required hereunder or
under applicable law.
§ 94-6 SARATOGA SPRINGS CODE § 94-7
C:134
§ 94-8. Transfers.
§ 94-9. General conditions upon construction, operation and repair.
C. No waiver. The failure of the City, upon one or more occasions, to
exercise a right or to require compliance or performance under a
franchise or any other applicable law shall not be deemed to constitute
a waiver of such right or a waiver of compliance or performance, unless
such right has been specifically waived in writing.
D. Administration of public, educational and government access. The City
may designate one or more entities, including itself, to control and
manage the use of public, educational and governmental access
channels, facilities and equipment.
A. Prior approval required. Every franchise shall be deemed to be held in
trust and to be personal to the franchisee. Any transfer that is made
without the prior approval of the City shall be deemed to impair that
trust. A transfer is any transaction pursuant to which:
(1) A cable communications system or the rights and/or obligations
held by the franchisee under the franchise are transferred, sold,
assigned, or leased, in whole or in part, directly or indirectly, to
another person (except the term does not include sale of portions of
the cable system that are removed); or
(2) There is any change, acquisition, or transfer of control of the
franchisee or its direct or indirect parents, whether by merger,
consolidation, sale of assets or ownership interests, or any other
means. A transfer occurs whenever there is a change in actual
working control, in whatever manner exercised, over the affairs of
a franchisee or its direct or indirect parents. Without limiting the
above, any change in the general partners of a franchisee will be
presumed a change in control.
B. Exception for mortgages. Notwithstanding any other provision of this
chapter, pledges in trust or mortgages of the assets of a cable
communications system to secure the construction, operation, or repair
of the cable system may be made without application and without the
City's prior consent. However, no such arrangement may be made if it
would in any respect under any condition 1) prevent the cable
communications system operator or any successor from complying with
the franchise or applicable law or 2) permit a third party to succeed to
the interest of the franchisee, or to own or control the system, without
the prior consent of the City. Any mortgage, pledge or lease shall be
subject to and subordinate to the rights of the City under any franchise,
this chapter, or other applicable law.
A. Franchisee must follow local rules. The construction, operation, and
repair of cable communications systems shall be performed in
compliance with all laws, ordinances, departmental rules, regulations,
§ 94-7 CHARTER § 94-9
C:135
and practices affecting such cable communications system. By way
of example, and not limitation, this includes zoning and safety codes,
construction standards, regulations for providing notice to persons
that may be affected by system construction, and directives governing
the time, place and manner in which facilities may be installed in
the rights-of-way. Persons engaged in the construction, operation, or
repair of communications facilities shall exercise reasonable care in
the performance of all their activities and shall use commonly accepted
methods and devices for preventing failures and accidents that are
likely to cause damage, injury, or nuisance to the public or to property.
B. No permit without franchise. A franchise is required before a permit
may be issued for work associated with the construction of a cable
communications system. Any permit issued for such work to a person
that does not hold a franchise shall vest no rights in the permittee; the
permit may be revoked at will, and the permittee shall remove all
facilities installed under the permit upon the City's demand.
C. Permits must be obtained. Construction, operation, or repair of a cable
communications system shall not commence until all required permits
have been obtained from the proper City official and all required fees
have been paid. All work performed will be performed in strict
accordance with the conditions of the permit. Upon order of the City,
any work and/or construction undertaken that is not completed in
compliance with the City's requirements, or which is installed without
obtaining necessary permits and approvals, shall be removed.
D. No interference. Interference with the use of the public rights-of-way by
others, including others that may be installing cable communications
systems, must be minimized. The City may require a person using the
public rights-of-way to cooperate with others through joint trenching
and other arrangements to minimize adverse impacts on the rights-ofway.
E. Existing poles to be used. To the extent possible, operators of cable
communications systems shall use existing poles and conduits.
Additional poles may not be installed in the public rights-of-way, nor
may pole capacity be increased by vertical or horizontal extenders,
without the permission of the City.
F. Undergrounding.
(1) Whenever all existing utilities are located underground in an area
in the City, every cable communications system operator in the
same area must locate its cable communications system
underground.
(2) Whenever the owner of a pole locates or relocates underground
within an area of the City, every cable communications system
operator in the same area shall concurrently relocate its facilities
underground.
§ 94-9 SARATOGA SPRINGS CODE § 94-9
C:136
(3) The City may, for good cause shown, exempt a particular system or
facility or group of facilities from the obligation to locate or
relocate facilities underground, where relocation is impractical or
where the interest in protecting against visual blight can be
protected in another manner. Nothing in this section prevents the
City from ordering communications facilities to be located or
relocated underground under other provisions of the general City
law.
G. Prompt repairs. Any and all public rights-of-way, other public property,
or private property that is disturbed or damaged during the
construction, operation or repair of a cable communications system
shall be promptly repaired by the operator. Public property and public
rights-of-way must be restored to the satisfaction of the City or to a
condition as good as or better than before the disturbance or damage
occurred.
H. Movement of facilities for government.
(1) A cable communications system operator shall, by a time specified
by the City, protect, support, temporarily disconnect, relocate, or
remove any of its property when required by the City by reason of
traffic conditions; public safety; public rights-of-way construction
and repair (including regrading, resurfacing or widening); public
rights-of-way vacation; construction, installation or repair of
sewers, drains, water pipes, power lines, signal lines, tracks, or any
other type of government-owned system or utility, public work,
public facility, or improvement; or for any other purpose where the
work involved would be aided by the removal or relocation of the
cable communications system. Collectively, such matters are
referred to below as the "public work."
(2) The City shall provide written notice describing where the public
work is to be performed at least one week prior to the deadline by
which a cable communications system operator must protect,
support, temporarily disconnect, relocate or remove its facilities. In
an emergency, or where a cable communications system creates or
is contributing to an imminent danger to health, safety, or property,
the City may protect, support, temporarily disconnect, remove, or
relocate any or all parts of the cable communications system
without prior notice and charge the cable communications system
operator for costs incurred.
I. Movement for others.
(1) To accommodate the construction, operation, or repair of the
facilities of another person authorized to use the streets or public
property, a franchisee shall, by a time specified by such person,
protect, support, temporarily disconnect, relocate or remove its
facilities. The franchisee must be given written notice describing
where the construction, operation or repair is to be performed at
§ 94-9 CHARTER § 94-9
C:137
least 15 days prior to the time by which its work must be
completed. The City may resolve disputes as to responsibility for
costs associated with removal, relaying, or relocation of facilities
among entities authorized to install facilities in the streets or on
public property if such entities are unable to do so themselves.
(2) A cable communications system operator shall, on the request of
any person holding a valid permit issued by a governmental
authority, temporarily raise or lower its wires by a time specified to
permit the moving of buildings or other objects. A cable
communications system operator shall be given not less than seven
days' advance notice to arrange for such temporary wire changes.
The expense of such temporary removal or raising or lowering of
wires shall be paid by the person requesting the same.
J. Abandonment in place.
(1) A cable communications system operator may abandon any
property in place in the public rights-of-way upon written notice to
the City. However, if, within 90 days of the receipt of written notice
of abandonment, the City determines that the safety, appearance,
functioning or use of the public right-of-way and facilities in the
public rights-of-way will be adversely affected, the property must
be removed by a date specified by the City.
(2) A cable communications system operator that abandons its
property must, upon request from the City Council, transfer
ownership of the properties to the City at no cost and execute
necessary quitclaim deeds and indemnify the City against future
costs associated with mitigating or eliminating any environmental
hazard associated with the abandoned property.
K. System subject to inspection. Every cable communications system
facility shall be subject to inspection and testing by the City. Each
operator must respond to requests for information regarding its system
and plans for the system as the City may from time to time issue,
including requests for information regarding its plans for construction,
operation and repair and the purposes for which the plant is being
constructed, operated, or repaired.
L. Underground services alert. Each operator of a cable communications
system that places facilities underground shall be a member of the
regional notification center for subsurface installations (Underground
Services Alert) and shall field mark the locations of its underground
communications facilities upon request. The operator shall locate its
facilities for the City at no charge.
M. Plan for construction. Each cable communications system operator
shall provide the City a plan for any initial system construction, or for
any substantial rebuild, upgrade or extension of its facility, which shall
show its timetable for construction of each phase of the project and the
areas of the City that will be affected.
§ 94-9 SARATOGA SPRINGS CODE § 94-9
C:138
§ 94-10. Protection of City and residents.
N. Use of facilities by City. The City shall have the right to install and
maintain, free of charge upon any poles or in any conduit owned by a
franchisee, any wire and pole fixtures that do not unreasonably
interfere with the cable service operations of the franchisee.
A. Indemnity required. No franchise shall be valid or effective until and
unless the City obtains an adequate indemnity from the franchisee and
such indemnity is maintained in effect. The indemnity must:
(1) Release the City from and against any and all loss, damage,
expense, cost (including, without limitation, the cost of litigation),
liability and responsibility in or arising out of the construction,
operation or maintenance of the cable communications system or
the City's grant of a franchise to franchisee, or franchisee's
enjoyment of the franchise. Each cable communications system
operator must further agree not to sue or seek any money or
damages from the City in connection with the above-mentioned
matters.
(2) Indemnify and hold harmless the City, its elected and appointed
officers, agents, and employees from and against any and all
claims, demands, or causes of action of any kind or nature and the
resulting losses, costs, expenses, reasonable attorneys' fees,
liabilities, damages, orders, judgments, or decrees sustained by the
City or any third party arising out of, or by reason of, or resulting
from or of the acts, errors, or omissions of the cable
communications system operator, or its agents, independent
contractors or employees, related to or in any way arising out of the
construction, operation, maintenance or repair of the system.
(3) Provide that the covenants and representations relating to the
release, indemnification, and hold harmless provision shall survive
the term of the franchise or other authorization and continue in full
force and effect as to the franchisee's responsibility to indemnify.
B. Insurance required. A franchisee (and/or those acting on its behalf)
shall not commence construction or operation of the cable system
without obtaining insurance in amounts and of a type satisfactory to the
City. The required insurance must be obtained and maintained for the
entire period the franchisee has facilities in the public rights-of-way. If
the franchisee, its contractors, or subcontractors do not maintain the
required insurance, the City may order such entities to cease
operations until such time as the insurance is obtained and approved by
the City.
C. Proof. Certificates of insurance, reflecting evidence of the required
insurance and naming the City as an additional insured, and other
proofs as the City may find necessary, shall be filed with the City. For
persons issued franchises after the effective date of this chapter,
§ 94-9 CHARTER § 94-10
C:139
certificates and other required proofs shall be filed 30 days prior to the
issuance of a franchise, once a year thereafter, and whenever there is
any change in coverage. For entities that have facilities in the public
rights-of-way as of the effective date of this chapter, the certificate shall
be filed within 60 days of the effective date of this chapter, annually
thereafter, and whenever there is any change in coverage, unless a
preexisting franchise provides for the filing of certificates in a different
manner.
D. Certificate contents. Certificates shall contain a provision that
coverages afforded under these policies will not be canceled until at
least 30 days' prior written notice has been given to the City. Policies
shall be issued by companies authorized to do business under the laws
of the State of New York. Financial ratings must be no less than "A" in
the latest edition of "Bests Key Rating Guide," published by A.M. Best
Guide.
E. Insurance amounts. A cable communications system operator and those
acting on its behalf to construct or operate the cable system shall each
maintain the following minimum insurance. The City shall be named as
an additional insured on all such policies by endorsement on the
general liability and excess policies; those insurance policies shall be
primary and contain a cross-liability clause.
(1) Comprehensive general liability insurance to cover liability, bodily
injury and property damage.
(a) Exposures to be covered are premises, operations, products/
completed operations, and certain contracts. Coverage must
be written on an occurrence basis, with the following limits of
liability:
Coverage Limits
Bodily injury
Each occurrence $1,000,000
Annual aggregate $2,000,000
Property damage
Each occurrence $1,000,000
Annual aggregate $2,000,000
Personal injury
Annual aggregate $3,000,000
(b) Completed operations and products liability shall be
maintained after the termination of the franchise or license (in
the case of the cable communications system owner or
operator) or completion of the work for the cable
communications system owner or operator (in the case of a
§ 94-10 SARATOGA SPRINGS CODE § 94-10
C:140
contractor or subcontractor) for the duration of the applicable
statute of limitations.
(c) Property damage liability insurance shall include coverage for
the following hazards: X - explosion, C - Collapse, U -
underground.
(2) Workers' compensation insurance shall be maintained during the
life of this contract to comply with statutory limits for all
employees, and in the case any work is sublet, each cable
communications system operator shall require the subcontractors
similarly to provide workers' compensation insurance for all the
latter's employees unless such employees are covered by the
protection afforded by each cable communications system
operator. Each cable communications system operator and its
contractors and subcontractors shall maintain during the life of this
policy employers' liability insurance. Workers' compensation
insurance shall include a waiver of subrogation clause in favor of
the City. The following minimum limits must be maintained:
(a) Workers' compensation: statutory.
(b) Employers' liability: $500,000 per occurrence.
(3) Comprehensive auto liability. Coverage shall include owned, hired,
and nonowned vehicles.
Coverage Limits
Bodily injury
Each occurrence $1,000,000
Annual aggregate $3,000,000
Property damage
Each occurrence $1,000,000
Annual aggregate $3,000,000
(4) Excess insurance. Annual aggregate: $5,000,000.
F. Performance bond. Every operator of a cable communications system
shall obtain and maintain a performance bond to ensure the faithful
performance of its responsibilities under this chapter and any
franchise. The amount of the performance and payment bonds shall be
set by the City Council and may be set in a franchise contract in light of
the nature of the work to be performed but shall not be less than 10% of
the estimated cost of constructing or (in the case of existing systems)
upgrading the cable system. The bond is not in lieu of any additional
bonds that may be required through the permitting process. The bond
shall be in a form acceptable to the City Attorney. Bonds must be
obtained prior to the effective date of any franchise, transfer or
franchise renewal, unless a franchise specifically provides otherwise.
§ 94-10 CHARTER § 94-10
C:141
§ 94-11. Enforcement; remedies.
G. Security fund. Every cable communications system operator shall
establish and maintain a cash security fund or provide the City an
irrevocable letter of credit in the amount of $100,000 to secure the
payment of fees owed, to secure any other performance promised in a
franchise, and to pay any taxes, fees or liens owed to the City. The letter
of credit shall be in a form and with an institution acceptable to the City
Director of Finance and in a form acceptable to the City Attorney.
Should the City draw upon the cash security fund or letter of credit, the
cable communications system operator shall, within 14 days, restore
the fund or the letter of credit to the full required amount. This security
fund/letter of credit may be waived or reduced by the City for a
franchisee where the City determines in its discretion that a particular
franchisee's operations are sufficiently limited that a security fund/
letter of credit is not necessary to secure the required performance.
The City may from time to time require a franchisee to change the
amount of the required security fund/letter of credit to reflect changed
risks to the City and to the public, including delinquencies in taxes or
other payments to the City. The cash security fund or letter of credit
must be obtained prior to the effective date of any franchise, transfer, or
franchise renewal, unless a franchise specifically provides otherwise.
A. Revocation and termination. The City Council may revoke a franchise or
reduce the term of a franchise if it finds, after public notice and
opportunity for a hearing, that a cable communications system operator
has violated this chapter or its franchise; has defrauded or attempted to
defraud the City or subscribers; or has attempted to evade the
requirements of this chapter or its franchise. The franchise may be
revoked only if the franchisee was given notice of the default and 60
days to cure the default and failed to cure the default or to propose a
schedule for curing the default acceptable to the City where it is
impossible to cure the default in 60 days.
B. Effect of termination or forfeiture. Upon termination or forfeiture of a
franchise, whether by action of the City, as provided above, or by
passage of time, the franchisee must stop using the cable
communications system for the purposes authorized by the franchise.
The City may take possession of some or all of franchisee's facilities or
require the franchisee or its bonding company to remove some or all of
the franchisee's facilities from the City and restore affected property to
its same, or better, condition. This provision does not permit the City to
remove facilities that are used to provide another service for which the
franchisee holds a valid franchise issued by the City or is otherwise
authorized to use the public rights-of-way to provide another service.
C. Remedies cumulative. Remedies provided for under this chapter or
under a franchise shall be cumulative. Recovery by the City of any
amounts under insurance, the performance bond, the security fund or
the letter of credit does not limit a franchisee's duty to indemnify the
§ 94-10 SARATOGA SPRINGS CODE § 94-11
C:142
§ 94-12. Books and records.
§ 94-13. Reports.
City or relieve a franchisee of its franchise obligations or limit the
amounts owed to the City.
A. Generally. Each cable communications system operator shall provide
the City access to books and records related in whole or in part to the
construction, operation, or repair of the cable system, or a group of
systems of which the cable system is a part, so that the City may inspect
and copy these books and records. The records include, but are not
limited to, revenue records and other records related to compliance
with any provision of this chapter or a franchise. A franchisee is
responsible for obtaining or maintaining the necessary possession or
control of all such books and records, so that it can produce the
documents upon request. Books and records must be maintained for a
period of six years, except that a franchise may specify a shorter period
for certain categories of voluminous books and records where the
information contained therein can be derived simply from other
materials. The phrase "books and records" shall be read expansively to
include information in whatever format stored.
B. Production. Books and records requested shall be produced to the City
by a time and at a location in the City designated by the City. However,
if the requested books and records are too voluminous or for security
reasons cannot be copied and moved, then the franchisee may request
that the inspection take place at some other location mutually agreed to
by the City and the franchisee, provided that:
(1) The franchisee must make necessary arrangements for copying
documents selected by the City after its review; and
(2) The franchisee must pay all travel and additional copying expenses
incurred by the City (above those that would have been incurred
had the documents been produced in the City) in inspecting those
documents or having those documents inspected by its designee.
A. Obligation to submit. The City may from time-to-time direct a
franchisee to prepare reports and to submit those reports by a date
certain, in a format prescribed by the City, in addition to those required
by this chapter for the purpose of ensuring compliance with the
provisions of this chapter and the franchise.
B. Quarterly reports. Within 45 days of the end of each calendar quarter, a
franchisee shall submit a report to the Commissioner of Finance for
presentation to the City Council containing the following information:
(1) The number of service calls (calls requiring a truck roll) received
during the prior quarter and the percentage of service calls
compared to the subscriber base; and
§ 94-11 CHARTER § 94-13
C:143
§ 94-14. Maps required.
Each franchisee shall maintain accurate maps and improvement plans
which show the location, size, and a general description of all facilities
(2) The total estimated hours of known outages as a percentage of total
hours of operation. An "outage" is a loss of sound or video on any
signal or a significant deterioration of any signal affecting two or
more subscribers.
C. Annual reports. No later than 90 days after the end of its fiscal year, a
franchisee shall submit to the Commissioner of Finance for
presentation to the City Council the following information:
(1) An audited or certified revenue report from the previous calendar
year for the cable communications system and a certified statement
setting forth the computation of gross revenues used to calculate
the franchise fee for the preceding year and a detailed explanation
of the method of computation showing:
(a) Gross revenues by category (e.g., basic, pay, pay-per-view,
advertising, installation, equipment, late charges,
miscellaneous, other); and
(b) What, if any, deductions were made from gross revenues in
calculating the franchise fee (e.g., bad debt, credits and
refunds), and the amount of each deduction.
(2) A report showing, for each applicable customer service standard,
the franchisee's performance with respect to that standard for each
quarter of the preceding year. In each case where the franchisee
concludes it did not comply fully, the franchisee will describe the
corrective actions it is taking to assure future compliance. In
addition, the report should identify the number and nature of the
customer service complaints received and an explanation of their
dispositions.
(3) An ownership report, indicating all persons who, at the time of
filing, control or own an interest in the franchisee of 10% or more.
D. Contemporaneous reports. Within 10 days of their receipt or (in the
case of documents created by the operator or its affiliate) filing, a
franchisee shall provide the Commissioner of Finance for presentation
to the City Council:
(1) Notices of deficiency or forfeiture related to the operation of the
cable system; and
(2) Any request for protection under bankruptcy laws or any judgment
related to a declaration of bankruptcy by the franchisee or by any
partnership or corporation that owns or controls the franchisee
directly or indirectly.
§ 94-13 SARATOGA SPRINGS CODE § 94-14
C:144
installed in the public rights-of-way and any power supply sources
(including voltages and connections). Maps shall be based upon
postconstruction inspection to verify location. Each franchisee shall provide
a map to the City showing the location of its facilities, in such detail and
scale as may be directed by the City Engineer, and update the map at least
annually and whenever the facility expands or is relocated. Copies of maps
shall be provided on disk, in a commercially available electronic format
specified by the City Commissioner of Public Works.
§ 94-15. Other records required.
Unless the City waives the requirement, a franchisee shall at all times
maintain:
§ 94-16. Extensions.
The City may, in its discretion and for an interim period that it deems
fit, extend the date for a franchisee to comply with the requirements of
§§ 94-12 through 94-15. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any such extension
of the obligations under §§ 94-12 through 94-15 shall not exempt that
franchisee from complying with all relevant and applicable New York State
requirements and rules or extend any New York State required compliance
requirement dates.
§ 94-17. Privacy.
A franchisee shall take all reasonable steps required so that it is able
to provide reports, books and records to the City, including by providing
appropriate subscriber privacy notices. Each franchisee shall be
responsible for redacting data that applicable law prevents it from
providing to the City. Nothing in this section shall be read to require a
franchisee to violate New York State or federal subscriber privacy laws.
A. Complaint records. Records of all complaints received, their nature and
resolution. The term "complaints" refers to complaints about any aspect
of the franchisee's operations.
B. Outage records. Records of outages known to the franchisee and their
cause and duration.
C. Complaint response. Records of service calls for repair and
maintenance indicating the date and time service was requested, the
date of acknowledgment and the date and time service was scheduled
(if it was scheduled), and the date and time service was provided and (if
different) the date and time the problem was solved.
D. Installation records. Records of installation/reconnection and requests
for service extension, indicating the date of request, the date of
acknowledgment, and the date and time service was extended.
E. Customer service. Records sufficient to show whether the franchisee
has complied with each customer service standard that applies to it.
§ 94-14 CHARTER § 94-18
C:145
§ 94-18. Procedure for paying franchise fees and fees in lieu of
franchise fees.
A. Fees paid quarterly. The franchise fee paid pursuant to Article II, or the
fee in lieu of the franchise fee paid pursuant to Article III, shall be paid
quarterly unless otherwise specified in a franchise. Payment for each
quarter shall be made to the City not later than 45 days after the end of
each calendar quarter.
B. Quarterly statement. Unless a franchise provides otherwise, a
franchisee or other entity subject to a fee under Article II or III shall file
with the City within 45 days of the end of each calendar quarter a
statement showing gross revenues during the preceding quarter and
the number of subscribers served.
C. Acceptance of payment not a release. No acceptance by the City of any
payment shall be construed as an accord that the amount paid is in fact
the correct amount, nor shall such acceptance of such payment be
construed as a release of any claim the City may have for additional
sums payable.
D. Fee not in lieu of taxes. Neither the franchise fee under Article II nor
the fee paid in lieu of the franchise fee under Article III is a payment in
lieu of any tax, fee or other assessment of general applicability
(including any such tax, fee or assessment imposed on both utilities and
cable operators or their services, but not including a tax, fee, or
assessment which is unduly discriminatory against cable operators or
cable subscribers).
E. Failure to pay franchise fee. In the event that a fee payment is not
received by the City on or before the due date set forth in this section or
in a franchise, or the fee owed is not fully paid, the person subject to the
fee will be charged interest from the due date at an interest rate equal
to 3% above the rate for three-month federal treasury bills at the most
recent United States Treasury Department sale of such treasury bills
occurring prior to the due date of the franchise fee payment.
F. Final statement of gross revenues. Within 90 days of the date a
franchisee ceases operations under a franchise (whether because of
franchise termination, transfer, or bankruptcy or for any other reason),
the franchisee shall file a final statement of gross revenues covering the
period from the beginning of the calendar year in which the operations
ceased to the date operations ceased. The statement shall contain the
information and be certified as required by § 94-13C(1).

C:146
ARTICLE II
Special Rules Applicable to Cable Systems
§ 94-19. Applications.
§ 94-20. Application for initial franchise or renewal franchise.
A. Application required.
(1) An application must be filed for an initial and renewal cable system
franchise or for approval of a transfer. A request for renewal filed
under 47 U.S.C. § 546(h) need not contain the information required
by § 94-19B(2).
(2) To be accepted for filing, an original and six copies of a complete
application must be submitted. All applications shall include the
names and addresses of persons authorized to act on behalf of the
applicant with respect to the application.
B. Application contents.
(1) The City may specify the information that must be provided in
connection with an application and the form in which the
information is to be provided.
(2) At a minimum, each application must identify the applicant; show
that the applicant is financially, technically and legally qualified to
construct, maintain and operate the cable system; contain a pro
forma showing of capital expenditures and expected income and
expenses for the first five years the applicant is to hold the
franchise; and show that the applicant is willing to comply
unconditionally with its franchise obligations and such other
information required by 16 NYCRR 894.5. Any application for an
initial or renewal franchise must describe in detail the cable system
that the applicant proposes to build, show where it will be located,
set out the system construction schedule, and show that the
applicant will provide adequate channels, facilities and other
support for PEG use (including institutional network use) of the
cable system.
(3) An applicant (and the transferor and transferee, in the case of a
transfer) shall respond to any request for information from the City,
by the time specified by the City.
C. Incomplete applications. An application may be rejected if it is
incomplete or if the response to requests for information is not timely
and complete.
D. The application will be referred to a Cable Television Advisory
Committee designated by the City pursuant to 16 NYCRR 894.1.
§ 94-19 CHARTER § 94-20
C:147
A. Scope. This section establishes additional provisions that apply to an
application for an initial franchise or a renewal franchise application
that is not governed by 47 U.S.C. § 546(a) through (g).
B. Process. Any person may apply for an initial or renewal franchise by
submitting an application therefor on that person's own initiative or in
response to a request for proposals issued by the City. If the City
receives an unsolicited application, it may choose to issue a request for
additional proposals and require the applicant to amend its proposal to
respond thereto. The City shall promptly conduct such investigations as
are necessary to act on an application.
C. Consideration of application. In determining whether to grant a
franchise, the City will consider the final report submitted of the Cable
Television Advisory Committee pursuant to 16 NYCRR 894.2 and may
consider:
(1) The extent to which an applicant for renewal has substantially
complied with the applicable law and the material terms of any
existing cable franchise;
(2) Whether an applicant for renewal's quality of service under its
existing franchise, including signal quality, response to customer
complaints, billing practices, and the like, has been reasonable in
light of the needs of the community;
(3) Where the applicant has not previously held a cable system
franchise in the City, whether the applicant's record in other
communities indicates that it can be relied upon to provide highquality
service throughout any franchise term;
(4) Whether the applicant has the financial, legal, and technical ability
to provide the services, facilities, and equipment set forth in an
application and to satisfy any minimum requirements established
by the City;
(5) Whether the applicant's application is reasonable to meet the
future cable-related needs and interests of the City, taking into
account the cost of meeting such needs and interests;
(6) Whether issuance of a franchise is warranted in the public interest
considering the immediate and future effect on streets, public
property, and private property that will be used by the applicant's
cable system;
(7) Whether issuance of the franchise would reduce competition in the
provision of cable service in the City; and
(8) Such other matters as the City is authorized or required to
consider.
D. Issuance of franchise. If the City determines that issuance of a franchise
would be in the public interest considering the factors above, it may

C:148
§ 94-21. Application for renewal franchise filed pursuant to 47
U.S.C. § 546.
§ 94-22. Application for transfer.
proffer a franchise agreement to the applicant. No franchise shall
become effective until the franchise is unconditionally accepted by the
applicant and the franchise agreement is signed.
A. Scope. This section establishes additional provisions that apply to
applications for renewal governed by 47 U.S.C. § 546(a) through (g).
B. Process. A franchisee which intends to exercise rights under 47 U.S.C.
§ 546(a) through (g) shall submit a notice in writing to the City in a
timely manner clearly stating that it is activating the procedures set
forth in those sections. The City shall thereafter commence any
proceedings that may be required under federal law, and upon
completion of those proceedings, the City may issue a request for
proposals and an application may be submitted for renewal. The City
may preliminarily deny the application by resolution, and if the
application is preliminarily denied, the City may conduct such
proceedings and by resolution establish such procedures and appoint
such individuals as may be necessary to conduct any proceedings to
review the application.
A. Scope. This section establishes additional provisions that apply to
applications for transfer approval.
B. Information. An application for transfer must contain all the
information required by the City by § 94-19 and all information required
by any FCC transfer form.
C. Consideration of application. In determining whether a transfer
application should be granted, denied, or granted subject to conditions,
the City may consider the legal, financial, and technical qualifications of
the transferee to operate the cable system; any potential impact of the
transfer on subscriber rates or services; whether the incumbent cable
operator is in compliance with its franchise; whether the transferee
owns or controls any other cable system in the City, whether operation
by the transferee may eliminate or reduce competition in the delivery of
cable service in the City; and whether operation by the transferee or
approval of the transfer would otherwise adversely affect subscribers,
the public, or the City's interest under this chapter, the franchise, or
other applicable law. The proposed transferee shall pay all reasonable
costs incurred by the City in reviewing and evaluating the applications.
D. Minimum conditions. In order to obtain approval of a transfer, an
applicant must show, at a minimum, that the transferee is qualified; the
transfer will not adversely affect the interests of subscribers, the public,
or the City; and that noncompliance issues have been resolved. No
application shall be granted unless the transferee agrees in writing that
§ 94-20 CHARTER § 94-22
C:149
§ 94-23. Legal qualifications.
it will abide by and accept all terms of this chapter and the franchise
and that it will assume the obligations, liabilities, and responsibility for
all acts and omissions, known and unknown, of the previous franchisee
for all purposes.
A. Standards.
(1) The applicant must be willing to comply with the provisions of this
chapter and applicable laws; and to comply with such requirements
of a franchise as the City may lawfully require.
(2) The applicant must not have had any cable system or OVS franchise
validly revoked (including any appeals) by the City within the three
years preceding the submission of the application.
(3) The applicant may not have had an application to the City for an
initial or renewal cable system franchise denied on the ground that
the applicant failed to propose a cable system meeting the cablerelated
needs and interests of the community, or as to which any
challenges to such franchising decision were finally resolved
(including any appeals) adversely to the applicant, within three
years preceding the submission of the application, and may not
have had an application for an initial or renewal OVS franchise
denied on any ground within three years of the application.
(4) The applicant shall not be issued a franchise if, at any time during
the 10 years preceding the submission of the application, the
applicant was convicted of fraud, racketeering, anticompetitive
actions, unfair trade practices or other conduct of such character
that the applicant cannot be relied upon to deal truthfully with the
City and the subscribers or to substantially comply with its
obligations.
(5) The applicant must have the necessary authority under New York
State and federal law to operate a cable system or show that it is in
a position to obtain that authority.
(6) The applicant shall not be issued a franchise if it files materially
misleading information in its application or intentionally withholds
information that the applicant lawfully is required to provide.
(7) For purposes of § 94-23A(2) through A(4), the term "applicant"
includes any affiliate of the applicant.
B. Exception. Notwithstanding § 94-23A, an applicant shall be provided a
reasonable opportunity to show that a franchise should issue even if the
requirements of § 94-23A(3) through A(4) are not satisfied, by virtue of
the circumstances surrounding the matter and the steps taken by the
applicant to cure all harms flowing therefrom and prevent their
§ 94-22 SARATOGA SPRINGS CODE § 94-23
C:150
§ 94-24. Franchise fee.
§ 94-25. No exclusivity.
A franchisee may not require a subscriber or a building owner or manager
to enter into an exclusive contract as a condition of providing or continuing
service, nor may a franchisee enter into any exclusive arrangement that
would effectively preclude other persons from using the OVS to compete
in the delivery of cable service with a franchisee or its affiliates. However,
nothing herein prevents a franchisee from entering into an otherwise
lawful, mutually desired exclusive arrangement with a building owner or
manager of a multiple-dwelling unit or a commercial subscriber.
recurrence, the lack of involvement of the applicant's principals, or the
remoteness of the matter from the operation of a cable system.
A. Amount of franchise fee. A cable operator shall pay to the City a
franchise fee in an amount equal to 5% of gross revenues or such other
amount as may be specified in the franchise; provided, however, that if
the franchise specifies an amount, that amount shall be subject to
increase should federal limits on fee payments be eliminated or
changed and other cable operators in the City are subject to a higher
fee.
B. Bundled services. In the event that the franchisee shall, during the term
of the franchise, offer bundled, tied, or combined cable services (which
are subject to the franchise fee) with noncable services (which may not
be subject to the franchise fee) to individual subscribers, the combined
revenues from such bundled services shall be allocated consistent with
standard rates or prices for each service in the bundle advertised by the
franchisee through its marketing materials or on its published rate
card. In the event the franchisee does not advertise or publish separate
prices for the combined services, the percentage that the price for the
combined services is discounted from the regular retail rates of the
individual services shall be prorated across all the services; provided,
however, that any mandatory tariff rates imposed by the New York
Public Service Commission (or other governmental entity having such
authority) shall be deducted from the combined revenue to determine
the revenue subject to the franchise fee. As an example, the franchisee
may offer a "bundle" of video, voice and data services for a flat fee of
$75, where the retail rate for services purchased on an individual basis
would equal $100. Assuming that there is no service subject to the
mandated tariff rate, the franchisee would apply a discount of 25% to
each service. Thus, if the retail rate for the cable service in the bundle
were $50, the franchisee would recognize cable service revenue in the
amount of $37.50 and pay a franchise fee on that revenue.
§ 94-23 CHARTER § 94-26
C:151
§ 94-26. Minimum franchise conditions.
In addition to satisfying such additional or stricter conditions as the City
finds necessary based on its investigations, the following elements shall be
required in every franchise.
A. System design. Each franchisee shall provide a cable system which uses
at least 750 MHz equipment of high quality and reliability. Each
franchisee shall install and activate the return portion of the cable
system in the sub-low frequency spectrum of 5 MHz to 30 MHz.
B. Public, educational and government use of the system.
(1) A franchisee shall provide to each subscriber the minimum of PEG
Access required by New York State law.
(2) Each franchisee shall install, maintain, and replace, as necessary, a
dedicated, bidirectional fiber optic link between its headend and a
location designated by the City as the primary access center.
(3) Each franchisee shall install, maintain, and replace activated twoway
cable plant and all headend, cable plant, and node equipment
required to make it operable so that the City, schools, and all
designated PEG access centers and PEG access facilities located
within the franchise area will be able to send and receive signals
(video, audio, and data) using the activated two-way cable plant.
(4) Each franchisee shall ensure that technically adequate signal
quality, routing systems, and switching and/or processing
equipment are initially and continuously provided for all access
interconnections both within the franchisee's cable system and
with other cable systems throughout the duration of its franchise.
(5) In the event a franchisee makes any change in the cable system and
related equipment and facilities or in the franchisee's signal
delivery technology which directly or indirectly substantially
affects the signal quality or transmission of access programming,
the franchisee shall, at its expense, take necessary steps or provide
necessary technical assistance, including the acquisition of all
necessary equipment, to ensure that the capabilities of PEG access
programmers are not diminished or adversely affected by such
change.
(6) A franchisee shall maintain all PEG access channels (both upstream
channels and downstream channels) and all interconnections of
PEG access channels at the same level of technical quality and
reliability as the best commercial channels carried on the system.
C. Service to franchise area. It is the policy of the City to ensure that every
cable communications system provide service in its franchise area upon
request to any person or any government building. Each franchisee
shall extend service upon request within its franchise area, provided
§ 94-26 SARATOGA SPRINGS CODE § 94-26
C:152
§ 94-27. Rate regulation and consumer protection; penalties for
offenses.
that a franchise may permit a franchisee to require a potential
subscriber to contribute a fair share of the capital costs of installation
or extension as a condition of extension or installation in cases where
such extension or installation may be unduly expensive. Service must
be provided within the time limits specified in Subsection D.
D. Time for extension.
(1) Except as a franchise otherwise provides, service must be extended
upon request to any person or to any government building in a
franchisee's franchise area:
(a) Within seven days of the request, where service can be
provided by activating or installing a drop;
(b) Within 90 days of the request where an extension of 1/2 mile or
less is required; or
(c) Within six months where an extension of 1/2 mile or more is
required.
(2) Notwithstanding the foregoing, a franchisee shall not be deemed to
be in violation of this section in the event the franchisee uses
reasonable efforts to complete the extension in a timely manner but
weather or other circumstances beyond the reasonable control of
the franchisee prevent such timely completion.
E. Technical standards. A cable system within the City shall meet or
exceed the technical standards set forth in 47 CFR 76.601 and any
other applicable federal and/or New York State technical standards.
F. Testing. Each cable operator shall perform at its expense such tests as
may be necessary to show whether or not the franchisee is in
compliance with its obligations under applicable FCC standards, this
chapter or a franchise.
G. Interconnection. Upon request of the City, every cable system shall be
required to interconnect with every other cable system within the City,
or adjacent to the City, on fair and reasonable terms for purposes of
providing PEG access and I-Net services.
H. Continuity of service. Each franchisee shall, during the term of the
franchise, ensure that subscribers are able to receive continuous
service. In the event the franchise is revoked or terminated, the
franchisee shall be required to continue to provide service for a
reasonable period to assure an orderly transition of service from the
franchisee to another entity. A franchise may establish more particular
requirements under which these obligations will be satisfied.
§ 94-26 CHARTER § 94-27
C:153
A. All rates subject to regulation. The City may regulate any of the cable
communications system operator's rates and charges to the extent
permitted by law. The City will regulate rates in accordance with FCC
and New York Public Service Commission rules and regulations, where
applicable. Except to the extent FCC or New York Public Service
Commission rules and regulations provide otherwise, all rates and
charges that are subject to regulation, and changes in those rates or
charges, must be approved in advance. The City may take any required
steps to file complaints, toll rates, issue accounting orders or take any
other steps required to comply with FCC or New York Public Service
Commission rules and regulations. The City Council shall be
responsible for issuing rate orders that establish rates or order refunds.
B. No rate discrimination. Except to the extent the City is not permitted by
New York State or federal law to enforce such a requirement, a cable
operator is prohibited from discriminating in its rates or charges or
from granting undue preferences to any subscriber, potential
subscriber, or group of subscribers or potential subscribers; provided,
however, that a franchisee may offer temporary, bona fide promotional
discounts in order to attract or maintain subscribers, so long as such
discounts are offered on a nondiscriminatory basis to similar classes of
subscribers throughout the franchise area, and a franchisee may offer
discounts for the elderly, the disabled, or the economically
disadvantaged and such other discounts as it is expressly entitled to
provide under federal law, if such discounts are applied in a uniform
and consistent manner.
C. Redlining prohibited. A cable operator shall not deny access or charge
different rates to any group of subscribers or potential subscribers
because of the income of the residents of the local area in which such
group resides.
D. Customer service.
(1) Each cable operator must satisfy FCC, New York State and City
cable customer service standards or consumer protection
standards. In the case of a conflict among standards, the stricter
standard shall apply.
(2) For violation of cable customer service standards, penalties will be
imposed as follows:
(a) For each day of each material breach: $200, not to exceed $600
for each occurrence of material breach.
(b) If there is a subsequent material breach of the same provision
within 12 months: $400 for each day of each material breach,
not to exceed $1,200 for each occurrence of the material
breach.
(c) If there is a third or additional material breach of the same
provision within 12 months of the first: $1,000 for each day of
§ 94-27 SARATOGA SPRINGS CODE § 94-27
C:154
each material breach, not to exceed $3,000 for each
occurrence of the material breach.
(3) Any penalty assessed under this section will be reduced dollar for
dollar to the extent any liquidated damage provision of a franchise
imposes a monetary obligation on a franchisee for the same
customer service failures, and no other monetary damages may be
assessed.

ARTICLE III
Open Video Systems
§ 94-28. Additional definitions.
As used in this article, the following terms shall have the meanings
indicated:
OVS AGREEMENT  A contract entered into in accordance with the
provisions of this chapter between the City and an OVS franchisee setting
forth the terms and conditions under which the franchise will be exercised.
§ 94-29. Applications for grant or renewal of franchises.
A. Initial and renewal franchise; application.
(1) A written application shall be filed with the City for grant of an
initial or renewal franchise.
(2) To be acceptable for filing, a signed original of the application shall
be submitted together with six copies. The application must
conform to any applicable request for proposals, and contain all
information required under § 94-29B. All applications shall include
the names and addresses of persons authorized to act on behalf of
the applicant with respect to the application.
B. Contents of applications. The City may specify the information that
must be provided in connection with a request for proposals or an
application for an initial or renewal franchise. At a minimum, each
application must identify the applicant, where it plans to construct its
system, and the system construction schedule; show that the applicant
will provide adequate channels, facilities and other support for PEG use
(including institutional network use) of the OVS; and show that the
applicant is financially, technically and legally qualified to construct and
operate the OVS.
C. Procedure for applying for grant of franchise.
(1) A person may apply for an initial or renewal franchise on its own
initiative or in response to a request for proposals. Upon receipt of
an application, the City shall promptly proffer the applicant a
proposed OVS agreement, which shall be mailed to the person
requesting its issuance and made available to any other interested
party. The City may request such additional information as it deems
appropriate.
(2) An applicant shall respond to requests for information completely,
and within the time directed by the City, and must strictly comply
with procedures, instructions, and requirements the City may
establish.
(3) An application may be rejected if it is incomplete or the applicant
fails to follow procedures or respond fully to information requests.
§ 94-28 CHARTER § 94-29
C:157
D. Evaluation. In evaluating a franchise application, the City may consider
the following:
(1) The extent to which the applicant has substantially complied with
the applicable law and the material terms of any existing City OVS
franchise;
(2) Whether the applicant has the financial, technical, and legal
qualifications to hold an OVS franchise;
(3) Whether the application satisfies any minimum requirements
established by the City for, or will otherwise provide, adequate PEG
use capacity, facilities, or financial support (including with respect
to institutional networks);
(4) Whether issuance of a franchise would require replacement of
property or involve disruption of property, public services, or use of
the public rights-of-way; and
(5) Whether the approval of the application may eliminate or reduce
competition in the delivery of cable service in the City.
E. Issuance. If the City finds that it is in the public interest to issue a
franchise, considering the factors above and such other matters as it is
required or entitled to consider, and subject to the applicant's entry into
an appropriate OVS agreement, it shall issue a franchise. Prior to
deciding whether or not to issue a franchise, the City may hold one or
more public hearings or implement other procedures under which
comments from the public on an application may be received. No
franchise shall become effective until the franchise is unconditionally
accepted by the applicant and the franchise agreement is signed.
F. Legal qualifications. In order to be legally qualified:
(1) The applicant must be willing to comply with the provisions of this
chapter and applicable laws and to comply with such requirements
of an OVS agreement as the City may lawfully require.
(2) The applicant must not hold a cable system franchise or have
pending an application for a cable system franchise.
(3) The applicant must not have had any cable system or OVS franchise
validly revoked (including any appeals) by the City within three
years preceding the submission of the application.
(4) The applicant may not have had an application for an initial or
renewal cable system franchise to the City denied on the ground
that the applicant failed to propose a cable system meeting the
cable-related needs and interests of the community, or as to which
any challenges to such franchising decision were finally resolved
(including any appeals) adversely to the applicant, within three
years preceding the submission of the application.
§ 94-29 SARATOGA SPRINGS CODE § 94-29
C:158
§ 94-30. Transfers.
(5) The applicant may not have had an application for an initial or
renewal OVS franchise denied on any grounds within three years of
the application.
(6) The applicant shall not be issued a franchise if, at any time during
the 10 years preceding the submission of the application, the
applicant was convicted of fraud, racketeering, anticompetitive
actions, unfair trade practices or other conduct of such character
that the applicant cannot be relied upon to deal truthfully with the
City and the subscribers or to substantially comply with its
obligations.
(7) The applicant must have the necessary authority under New York
State and federal law to operate an OVS and must be certified by
the FCC under Section 653 of the Cable Act.
(8) The applicant shall not be issued a franchise if it files materially
misleading information in its application or intentionally withholds
information that the applicant lawfully is required to provide.
(9) For purposes of § 94-29F(2) through (5) the term "applicant"
includes any affiliate of the applicant.
G. Exception. Notwithstanding § 94-29F, an applicant shall be provided a
reasonable opportunity to show that a franchise should issue even if the
requirements of § 94-29F(3) through (5) are not satisfied, by virtue of
the circumstances surrounding the matter and the steps taken by the
applicant to cure all harms flowing therefrom and prevent their
recurrence, the lack of involvement of the applicant's principals, or the
remoteness of the matter from the operation of a cable system.
A. City approval required. No transfer shall occur without prior written
notice to and approval of the City Council.
B. Application.
(1) A franchisee shall promptly notify the City of any proposed transfer
and submit an application for its approval.
(2) The City may specify information that must be provided in
connection with a transfer application. At a minimum, an
application must describe the entities involved in the transaction
and the entity that will hold the franchise; describe the chain of
ownership before and after the proposed transaction; show that the
entity that will hold the franchise will be legally, financially, and
technically qualified to do so; attach complete information on the
proposed transaction, including the contracts or other documents

schedules, exhibits, or the like referred to therein; and attach any
§ 94-29 CHARTER § 94-30
C:159
§ 94-31. Minimum requirements.
shareholder reports or filings with the Securities and Exchange
Commission that discuss the transaction.
(3) For the purposes of determining whether it shall consent to a
transfer, the City may inquire into all qualifications of the
prospective transferee and such other matters as the City may
deem necessary to determine whether the transfer is in the public
interest and should be approved, denied, or conditioned. If the
transferee or franchisee refuse to provide information, or provide
incomplete information, the request for transfer may be denied.
C. Consideration of application. In deciding whether a transfer application
should be granted, denied or granted subject to conditions, the City
may consider the legal, financial, and technical qualifications of the
transferee to operate the OVS; whether the incumbent OVS operator is
in compliance with its OVS agreement and this chapter and, if not, the
proposed transferee's commitment to cure such noncompliance;
whether the transferee owns or controls any other OVS or cable system
in the City and whether operation by the transferee may eliminate or
reduce competition in the delivery of cable service in the City; and
whether operation by the transferee or approval of the transfer would
adversely affect subscribers, the public, or the City's interest under this
chapter, the OVS agreement, or other applicable law. The proposed
transferee shall pay all reasonable costs incurred by the City in
reviewing and evaluating the applications.
D. Minimum conditions. In order to obtain approval of a transfer, an
applicant must show, at a minimum, that the transferee is qualified; the
transfer will not adversely affect the interests of subscribers, the public,
or the City; and that noncompliance issues have been resolved. No
application shall be granted unless the transferee agrees in writing that
it will abide by and accept all terms of this chapter and the franchise
and that it will assume the obligations, liabilities, and responsibility for
all acts and omissions, known and unknown, of the previous franchisee
for all purposes.
A. PEG access. No OVS operator shall be issued a franchise, or may
commence construction of an OVS system, until it:
(1) Agrees to match in all respects the highest PEG obligations borne
by any cable operator in the City; or
(2) Agrees to PEG obligations acceptable to the City.
B. Institutional network. Any OVS operator that constructs an I-Net must
match in all respects the highest I-Net obligations borne by any cable
operator in the City, unless it agrees to alternative I-Net obligations
acceptable to the City.
§ 94-30 SARATOGA SPRINGS CODE § 94-31
C:160
§ 94-32. Special termination rules.
If a franchisee's FCC certification is revoked or otherwise terminates as a
result of the passage of time or as a matter of law, the City may revoke
the OVS franchise after a hearing. The OVS franchise may also be revoked
if federal regulations or statutory provisions governing OVS are declared
invalid or unenforceable, or are repealed.
§ 94-33. Rate regulation.
The City may regulate a franchisee's rates and charges to the extent
permitted by law and may do so by amendment to this chapter, by separate
ordinance, by amendment to an OVS Agreement, or in any other lawful
manner.
§ 94-34. Fee in lieu of franchise fee.
C. Construction provisions. Every OVS agreement shall specify the
construction schedule that will apply to any required construction,
upgrade, or rebuild of the OVS. The schedule shall provide for prompt
completion of the project, considering the amount and type of
construction required.
D. Testing. Each OVS operator shall perform, at its expense, such tests as
may be necessary to show whether or not the franchisee is in
compliance with its obligations under this chapter or a franchise.
E. Consumer protection provisions. Every franchisee must satisfy
customer service consumer protection requirements established from
time-to-time under state or local law and applicable to OVS operators.
A. OVS operators. In lieu of the franchise fee required by Article II, an OVS
franchisee shall pay a fee of 5% of the gross revenues of the franchisee,
its affiliates or any OVS operator of an OVS in the City.
B. Persons leasing OVS capacity.
(1) A person leasing capacity from an OVS operator, other than a
person whose revenues are included in the payment made under
Subsection A, shall pay the City a fee in lieu of the franchise fee
required by Article II of 5% of the gross revenues of such person.
(2) Notwithstanding the foregoing, where an OVS operator charges a
person, other than an affiliate, to use its OVS (the "use payments")
and that person recovers those use payments through charges to
its subscribers that are included in that person's gross revenues
and that person fully recovers the use payments through the
charges to its subscribers and pays a fee on those charges pursuant
to Subsection B(1), then the franchisee may deduct from its gross
revenues the use payments it receives from that person.
§ 94-31 CHARTER § 94-35
C:161
§ 94-35. Exclusive contracts.
A franchisee may not require a subscriber or a building owner or manager
to enter into an exclusive contract as a condition of providing or continuing
service, nor may a franchisee enter into any arrangement that would
effectively prevent other persons from using the OVS to compete in the
delivery of cable services with a franchisee or its affiliates. However,
nothing herein prevents a franchisee from entering into an otherwise
lawful, mutually desired exclusive arrangement with a building owner or
manager of a multiple-dwelling unit or a commercial subscriber.

applicable law so that the provision which had been held invalid is no longer
invalid, said provision shall thereupon return to full force and effect without
further action by the City and shall thereafter be binding on the franchisee
and the City.

operator require a person or the City to waive such rights as a condition
of taking service.

operator shall not refuse to employ, discharge from employment, or
discriminate against any person in compensation or in terms,
conditions, or privileges of employment because of race, color, creed,

with all federal, state, and local laws and regulations governing equal
employment opportunities and hiring practices, as the same may be
amended from time-to-time.
A. Persons holding franchises. Any person holding an existing franchise
for a cable communications system may continue to operate under the
existing franchise to the conclusion of its present term (but not any
renewal or extension thereof) with respect to those activities expressly
authorized by that existing franchise, provided, further, that such
person shall be subject to the other provisions of this chapter to the
extent permitted by law.

Chapter 95
COMMUNITY CHOICE AGGREGATION PROGRAM
§ 95-1. Purpose and intent.
It is the intent of the City of Saratoga Springs to establish a community
choice aggregation (CCA) program to aggregate the energy supply needs of
residents and small commercial customers and to negotiate and enter into,
or authorize its agent to negotiate and enter into, energy supply agreements
(ESAs) with energy service companies (ESCOs) on behalf of eligible citizens
to obtain stable, lower-cost energy prices, as well as environmental benefits
and/or a community-based solution to meeting our collective energy needs.
The purpose of this chapter is two-fold: to establish a CCA program in the
City of Saratoga Springs and to adopt certain provisions relating to the
creation and implementation of the CCA program.
§ 95-2. Findings.
A. New York State's energy industry is in the midst of a significant
transition; a shift away from the old top-down, utility-centered model
toward a cleaner, more affordable, more resilient system in which
consumers and communities will have a substantial role to play. The
state's ongoing Reforming the Energy Vision (REV) initiative
emphasizes the importance of reliability and grid resilience, distributed
energy resources, increased renewable generation, and greater
opportunity for citizens to take an active role in helping the state reach
its energy goals and in making more informed energy choices in their
homes, businesses and communities.
B. As part of this REV initiative, the New York State Public Service
Commission (NYPSC), on April 21, 2016, adopted an order authorizing
cities, towns and villages within the state to create community choice
aggregation programs, by themselves or in concert with other
municipalities (hereinafter "NYPSC Order Authorizing CCAs"), and/or
to retain a CCA Administrator to implement the program and negotiate
ESAs.
C. CCA programs allow communities to take control of their energy supply
through an open, transparent and competitive electric and/or gas
supply procurement process driven by the consumers themselves.
D. A successful CCA program offers citizens cost savings, more stable
energy prices, deterrence of deceptive marketing practices by
unscrupulous ESCOs, fair contracts negotiated directly with energy
suppliers, and/or the opportunity to pursue goals and initiatives
important to the community, such as reliability, grid resiliency,
supporting renewable energy generation, cutting greenhouse gas
emissions, protecting the state's natural resources, and improving
energy efficiency.
§ 94-41 CHARTER § 95-2
C:165
§ 95-3. Legislative authority.
The NYPSC Order Authorizing CCAs expressly empowers cities, towns,
and villages in this state to create CCA programs. Further, the New York
Municipal Home Rule Law, Article 2, § 10, authorizes a municipality to adopt
general laws relating to its property, affairs and government, the protection
and enhancement of its physical and visual environment, the protection
and well-being of persons within the municipality, and for other authorized
purposes.
§ 95-4. Definitions.
As used in this chapter, the following terms shall have the meanings
indicated:
AUTOMATICALLY ELIGIBLE CUSTOMERS  Customers' accounts in those
utility service classes eligible for inclusion in the CCA program on an optout
basis, as set forth in the NYPSC Order Authorizing CCAs, Appendix
C, or as otherwise specified by the Commission. Generally, these classes
of customers include those receiving residential or gas supply service,
including those in multifamily housing, certain types of institutions, and
some small commercial customers covered by "small general service" class
designations. Automatically eligible customers shall not include customers'
accounts that have already been enrolled in service through an ESCO,
enrolled in utility programs which require them to take supply service from
their current utility, or that have a block on their utility account at the
time of CCA formation (except Assistance Program participants, customers
enrolled in utility low-income assistance programs who may have blocks on
their accounts with their existing utility, but who may still be eligible to
participate); those customers' accounts shall be eligible to participate on an
opt-in basis, if they so desire.
CCA ADMINISTRATOR  An agent of the municipality charged with
overseeing creation, implementation and operation of a CCA program, as
well as competitively procuring and negotiating energy supply agreements
with ESCOs. The CCA Administrator shall be retained by the municipality
via a separate CCA administration agreement, adopted by resolution of the
municipality's governing board.
COMMUNITY CHOICE AGGREGATION (CCA)/CCA PROGRAM  A
program authorized by the New York State Public Service Commission
E. The City of Saratoga Springs has explored the CCA policy and
background, and believes it would provide numerous benefits in this
community, enhancing the public welfare and making energy more
affordable and costs more predictable for our residents.
F. Therefore, the City of Saratoga Springs authorizes the creation of an
opt-out CCA program pursuant to rules of the NYPSC in this community
for the provision of electric and/or natural gas supply service, as well as
other high-priority energy-related value-added services as may be
determined to meet the community's goals.
§ 95-2 SARATOGA SPRINGS CODE § 95-4
C:166
(NYSPSC) to aggregate residential and commercial electric and/or natural
gas supply and/or energy-related value-added products and services within
a given municipality, and/or among multiple municipalities, in order to
leverage that energy demand to negotiate favorable energy supply
agreements directly with ESCOs. Customers within a CCA program would
no longer purchase their energy supply directly from their utility. However,
the utility would continue to deliver energy to these customers, to charge
for that delivery, and will retain its transmission and distribution network.
The energy supply portion of a customer's energy service is provided by
an ESCO or ESCOs, pursuant to an energy supply agreement competitively
procured and negotiated for the CCA program at large, then delivered to
customers via the local utility.
ELIGIBLE CUSTOMERS  All automatically eligible customers plus those
utility customers eligible for inclusion in the CCA program on an opt-in
basis, as set forth in the NYPSC Order Authorizing CCAs or otherwise
authorized by the Commission. Those customers eligible to participate in
the CCA program on an opt-in basis currently include: those customers
already enrolled in service through an ESCO at the time of CCA formation,
customers in large commercial, institutional, or industrial utility service
classes that cannot be automatically enrolled in the CCA on an opt-out basis,
and all other customers not considered "automatically eligible customers."
References to the broader class of "eligible customers" shall signify the
entire pool of customers participating in the aggregation, either because
they have been automatically enrolled on an opt-out basis, or because they
have affirmatively opted in.
ENERGY SERVICES COMPANY (ESCO)  A third-party energy supplier
eligible to sell electricity, natural gas and/or energy-related value-added
services to customers in New York State, utilizing the transmission and
distribution systems of existing utilities. ESCOs are regulated by the New
York State Department of Public Service and the New York State Public
Service Commission, and must comply with the New York State Public
Service Law.
ENERGY SUPPLY AGREEMENT (ESA)  An agreement between an energy
customer and an energy services company (ESCO) to provide electricity or
gas service to the customer for a fixed or variable price. For purposes of this
chapter, the CCA Administrator would conduct a competitive procurement
on behalf of all eligible customers, and would enter into an energy service
agreement(s) with an ESCO to provide power to all such customers in the
community.
MUNICIPALITY  Reference to these terms throughout this chapter
indicate the City of Saratoga Springs, unless otherwise noted.
UTILITY  This term refers to traditional electric and/or natural gas
utilities regulated by the New York State Department of Public Service and
the New York State Public Service Commission and permitted to provide
electric and/or gas supply, transmission and distribution services to all
customers within their designated service territory. For purposes of this
chapter, the term "utility" will refer to "National Grid."
§ 95-4 CHARTER § 95-5
C:167
§ 95-5. Establishing community choice aggregation.
The City of Saratoga Springs hereby establishes a CCA program for
aggregation of electric and/or natural gas supply to serve all eligible
customers in its jurisdiction. All automatically eligible customers shall be
included in the CCA program on an opt-out basis, and shall be afforded the
opportunity to opt out of the CCA program, within a specified period, at no
cost. All customers who are not automatically eligible to be included in the
CCA program on an opt-out basis shall be permitted to affirmatively opt into
the program in accordance with the terms of the ESA and/or the NYPSC
Order Authorizing CCAs.
§ 95-6. Provisions for implementing CCA program.
A. Part A. Implementation plan.
(1) The City of Saratoga Springs, with support from its CCA
Administrator, will create and follow a CCA implementation plan
which shall outline the details of how the CCA program will be
created and operated, including how public outreach and education
will occur, what rules will apply to the program, how the
procurement process will be implemented, how energy contracts
will be selected, and how responsibilities will be divided amongst
CCA Administrator, municipality, and eligible customers.
(2) In accordance with the NYPSC Order Authorizing CCAs, the CCA
implementation plan will be reviewed and approved by the Public
Service Commission. Such review may involve NYSPSC approval of
a generic CCA implementation plan, with the understanding that
community-specific appendices would be submitted later and
would outline appropriately tailored local education and outreach
efforts.
(3) Where a generic CCA implementation plan will be used, the City of
Saratoga Springs and the CCA Administrator will make communityspecific
revisions to ensure the plan is properly tailored to the
needs of the City of Saratoga Springs' residents. Therefore, prior to
or in conjunction with the enactment of this chapter, and thereafter
from time to time, the City of Saratoga Springs, with support from
the CCA Administrator, will create and update a CCA program optout
letter, as well as an education and outreach plan, as provided in
the implementation plan appendix for this community.
(4) The City of Saratoga Springs opt-out letter and education and
outreach plan shall conform to those requirements for public
outreach, education, and opt-out procedures set forth in the
NYSPSC Order Authorizing CCAs, and in any other applicable laws
or regulations, and shall ensure that the City of Saratoga Springs
and its CCA Administrator engage in a robust effort to educate and
inform the community about the CCA program and their options for
participating or opting out.
§ 95-5 SARATOGA SPRINGS CODE § 95-6
C:168
(5) Opt-out letters will be provided to all automatically eligible
customers no less than 30 days prior to the time at which those
customers would be automatically enrolled in the CCA program.
The letters will be printed on the City of Saratoga Springs
letterhead, in official City of Saratoga Springs envelopes. The logo
of the CCA Administrator and selected ESCO may also be included
on these letters, so long as it is clear that the letter is official
correspondence from the City of Saratoga Springs.
B. Part B. Public outreach and education.
(1) The City of Saratoga Springs, together with its CCA Administrator,
will provide public notices, presentations, information sheets, and
other forms of outreach, as outlined in the appendix of the
implementation plan, to ensure residents are informed about the
CCA program and their options for participating or opting out.
(2) Once the CCA program is operating, the City of Saratoga Springs
and its CCA Administrator will continue to engage in public
outreach to keep CCA customers informed about any changes to
the CCA program; opportunities for new products or services
available through the CCA program, such as renewable energy
buying options; important terms and durations of ESAs;
information about the selected ESCOs; and any other matters
related to the CCA program.
C. Part C. Customers moving into or out of the community after CCA
adoption. Residents and small commercial customers who establish
utility accounts in this community after the effective date of this
chapter shall be afforded the opportunity to join the CCA program
within a reasonable time after their account is established, in
accordance with contractual agreements between the CCA
Administrator and any ESCO(s) providing service to the program.
D. Part D. Customer data protection.
(1) The City of Saratoga Springs, or its CCA Administrator, will create
and follow a customer data protection plan which ensures that any
confidential or sensitive personal customer information provided
by the utility to the City of Saratoga Springs, its CCA Administrator,
and/or the selected ESCO(s), will be given all privacy protections
required by law and regulation, and protected from unauthorized
release or use to the greatest extent possible. This customer data
protection plan will ensure that the CCA program and any selected
ESCO(s) handle all confidential or sensitive customer data in
keeping those customer data protections already afforded by the
utility prior to the enactment of this chapter.
(2) This plan will also ensure that CCA customer data, such as contact
information, is not used for inappropriate purposes, such as
solicitation of business unrelated to the CCA program, its goals and
objectives.
§ 95-6 CHARTER § 95-7
C:169
§ 95-7. CCA Administrator.
§ 95-8. Compliance with Public Service Law and regulations.
In accordance with the NYSPSC Order Authorizing CCAs, it shall be the
responsibility of the City of Saratoga Springs, supported by any CCA
Administrator that may be under contract, to ensure the CCA program
is operated in compliance with all applicable provisions of the New York
State Public Service Law, regulations of the New York State Public Service
Commission, and/or the New York state Department of Public Service, the
Uniform Business Practices (to the extent applicable), the NYPSC Order
Authorizing CCAs, and any other relevant laws or regulations. This
provision applies regardless of whether a CCA Administrator is retained
to organize and implement the City of Saratoga Springs' CCA program.
This shall include, but not be limited to, compliance with any reporting
requirements related to the CCA program.
§ 95-9. Review and/or dissolution of CCA program.
A. Part A. CCA administration agreement. The City of Saratoga Springs
will enter into a CCA administration agreement with its CCA
Administrator. Such agreement will set forth the various rights and
responsibilities of the parties and will govern the manner in which the
CCA program is run. This agreement shall also authorize the CCA
Administrator to act as the City of Saratoga Springs' agent for the
purpose of procuring energy supply or other energy-related valueadded
services for CCA program eligible customers.
B. Part B. Customer service, complaints. The CCA Administrator will
provide the City of Saratoga Springs with clear, up-to-date information
for customer questions, concerns or complaints. The CCA Administrator
shall, from time to time, and/or at the request of the Saratoga Springs
City Council, report to the City of Saratoga Springs regarding customer
service matters.
A. The City of Saratoga Springs will, from time to time, review the CCA
program and its progress to determine how the program is faring,
confirm it is affording benefits to the community, and provide
information to the public thereon.
B. As the expiration of its ESA(s) approaches, or in the event an ESCO
provides notice of its intention to terminate an ESA (where authorized
by the terms of that ESA), the City of Saratoga Springs may consider
whether it wishes to discontinue the CCA program. Dissolution of the
CCA program will require:
(1) Enactment of a local law amending or repealing this chapter;
(2) Lawful termination of ESAs in accordance with their terms;
(3) Lawful termination of the CCA administration agreement, in
accordance with its terms; and
§ 95-7 SARATOGA SPRINGS CODE § 95-9
C:170
§ 95-10. Conflicts.
In the event the New York State Public Service Commission, the State
Legislature, or other state agency, enacts laws or regulations regarding
the operation of CCAs which are in conflict with this chapter, the state
provisions shall govern.
§ 95-11. Liability.
Nothing in this chapter shall be read to create liability on the part of the
City related to the provision of electric and/or gas service to customers.
The ESCO selected to provide such service will be ultimately responsible
for compliance with all applicable laws, rules and regulations governing
retail energy services, and will assume any liability stemming from the
provision of such service to retail customers, including any potential liability
associated with the service itself, customer data and information, and any
other matters which would traditionally fall under the purview of a
merchant utility providing the same service to customers prior to the
formation of the CCA. This chapter is meant merely to facilitate the creation
of an aggregation program in this community. The City will not assume the
role of ESCO or utility in the sale or delivery of energy services.
§ 95-12. Severability.
Each provision of this chapter is severable from the others, so that if any
provision is held to be illegal or invalid for any reason whatsoever, such
illegal or invalid provision shall be severed from this chapter, which shall
nonetheless remain in full force and effect.
§ 95-13. When effective.
This chapter shall take effect immediately upon filing in the office of the
Secretary of State of the State of New York, in accordance with § 27 of the
Municipal Home Rule Law.

A. It is the policy of both the municipality and the state of New York (the
"state") to achieve energy efficiency and renewable energy

allow the energy improvement corporation (as defined below, "EIC"), a
local development corporation, acting on behalf of the municipality
pursuant to the municipal agreement (the "Municipal Agreement") to
be entered into between the municipality and EIC, to make funds
available to qualified property owners that will be repaid through
charges on the real properties benefited by such funds, thereby
fulfilling the purposes of this article and accomplishing an important
public purpose. This article provides a method of implementing the

C:217
§ 108-13. Procedures for eligibility.
§ 108-14. Application criteria.
Upon the submission of an application, EIC, acting on behalf of the
municipality, shall make a positive or negative determination on such
application based upon the following criteria for the making of a financing:
EIC and by the financing party under the finance agreement. EIC,
on behalf of the municipality, and with the consent of the benefited
property owner, will record a benefit assessment lien on the benefited
property in the secured amount (the "benefit assessment lien") on the
land records for the municipality. Such recording shall be exempt from
any charge, mortgage recording tax or other fee in the same manner as
if recorded by the municipality.
B. Before a qualified property owner and a financing party enter into a
finance agreement which results in a loan to finance a qualified project,
repayment of which is secured by a benefit assessment lien, a written
consent from each existing mortgage holder of the qualified property
shall be obtained, permitting the benefit assessment lien and each
annual installment lien to take priority over all existing mortgages.
A. Any property owner in the municipality may submit an application to
EIC on such forms as have been prepared by EIC and made available to
property owners on the website of EIC and at the municipality's offices.
B. Every application submitted by a property owner shall be reviewed by
EIC, acting on behalf of the municipality, which shall make a positive or
negative determination on such application based upon the criteria
enumerated in the Enabling Act and § 108-14 of this article. EIC may
also request further information from the property owner where
necessary to aid in its determination.
C. If a positive determination on an application is made by EIC, acting on
behalf of the municipality, the property owner shall be deemed a
qualified property owner and shall be eligible to participate in the
program in accordance with § 108-15 of this article.
A. The property owner may not be in bankruptcy and the property may not
constitute property subject to any pending bankruptcy proceeding;
B. The amount financed under the Program shall be repaid over a term not

financing to the property owner;
D. The property owner is current in payments on any existing mortgage on

§ 108-12 SARATOGA SPRINGS CODE § 108-14
C:218
§ 108-15. Energize NY Finance Agreement.
§ 108-16. Terms and conditions of repayment.
The finance agreement shall set forth the terms and conditions of
repayment in accordance with the following:
E. The property owner is current in payments on any real property taxes
on the qualified property; and
F. Such additional criteria, not inconsistent with the criteria set forth
above, as the state, the municipality, or EIC acting on its behalf, or
other financing parties may set from time to time.
A. A qualified property owner may participate in the program through the
execution of a finance agreement made by and between the qualified
property owner and a financing party, to which EIC, on behalf of the
municipality, shall be a third-party beneficiary (the "finance
agreement"). Upon execution and delivery of the finance agreement,
the property that is the subject of the finance agreement shall be
deemed a "benefited property").
B. Upon execution and delivery of the finance agreement, the benefited
property owner shall be eligible to receive funds from the financing
party for the acquisition, construction, and installation of a qualified
project, together with eligible costs and financing charges approved by
EIC and by the financing party, provided the requirements of the
Enabling Act, the Municipal Agreement and this article have been met.
C. The finance agreement shall include the terms and conditions of
repayment of the secured amount and the annual installment amounts.
D. EIC may charge fees to offset the costs of administering the Program
and such fees, if not paid by the financing party, shall be added to the
secured amount.
A. The principal amount of the funds loaned to the benefited property
owner for the qualified project, together with eligible costs and
financing charges approved by EIC and by the financing party, shall be
specially assessed against the benefited property and will be evidenced
by a benefit assessment lien recorded against the benefited property on
the land records on which liens are recorded for properties within the
municipality. The special benefit assessment shall constitute a "charge"
within the meaning of the Enabling Act and shall be collected in annual
installments in the amounts certified by the financing party in a
schedule provided at closing and made part of the benefit assessment
lien. Said amount shall be annually levied, billed and collected by EIC,
on behalf of the municipality, and shall be paid to the financing party as
provided in the finance agreement.
B. The term of such repayment shall be determined at the time the finance
agreement is executed by the benefited property owner and the

financing party, not to exceed the weighted average of the useful life of
the systems and improvements as determined by EIC, acting on behalf
of the municipality.
C. The rate of interest for the secured amount shall be fixed by the
financing party in conjunction with EIC, acting on behalf of the
municipality, as provided in the finance agreement.
A. Upon the making of the loan pursuant to the finance agreement, the
secured amount shall become a special benefit assessment lien on the
benefited property in favor of the municipality. The amount of the
benefit assessment lien shall be the secured amount. Evidence of the
benefit assessment lien shall be recorded by EIC, on behalf of the
municipality, in the land records for properties in the municipality. Such
recording shall be exempt from any charge, mortgage recording tax or
other fee in the same manner as if recorded by the municipality. The
benefit assessment lien shall not be foreclosed upon by or otherwise
enforced by the municipality.
B. The finance agreement shall provide for the repayment of the secured
amount in installments made at least annually, as provided in a
schedule attached to the benefit assessment lien (the "annual
installment amount"). The annual installment amount shall be levied by
EIC, on behalf of the municipality, on the benefited property in the same
manner as levies for municipal charges, shall become a lien on the
benefited property as of the first day of January of the fiscal year for
which levied (the "annual installment lien") and shall remain a lien until
paid. The creation or any recording of the annual installment lien shall
be exempt from any charge, mortgage recording tax or other fee in the
same manner as if recorded by the municipality. Payment to the
financing party shall be considered payment for this purpose. Such
payment shall partly or wholly discharge the annual installment lien.
Delinquent annual installment amounts may accrue financing charges
as may be provided in the finance agreement. Any additional financing
charges imposed by the financing party pursuant to the finance
agreement shall increase the annual installment amount and the annual
installment lien for the year in which such overdue payments were first
due.
C. The benefit assessment lien shall be reduced annually by the amount of
each annual installment lien when each annual installment lien
becomes a lien. Each annual installment lien shall be subordinate to all
municipal liens, whether created by Section 902 of the RPTL or by any
other state or local law. No portion of a secured amount shall be
recovered by the municipality, EIC, or an assignee upon foreclosure,
sale or other disposition of the benefited property unless and until all
municipal liens are fully discharged. Each annual installment lien,

C:220
§ 108-18. Verification and report.
EIC, on behalf of the municipality, shall verify and report on the installation
and performance of Renewable Energy Systems and Energy Efficiency
Improvements financed by the program in such form and manner as the
authority may establish.
§ 108-19. Separability.
If any clause, sentence, paragraph, section, or part of this article shall
be adjudged by any court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, such
judgment shall not affect, impair or invalidate the remainder thereof, but
shall be confined in its operation to the clause, sentence, paragraph,
however, shall have priority over all nonmunicipal liens, irrespective of
when created, except as otherwise required by law.
D. Neither the benefit assessment lien nor any annual installment lien
shall be extinguished or accelerated in the event of a default or
bankruptcy of the benefited property owner. Each annual installment
amount shall be considered a charge upon the benefited property and
shall be collected by EIC, on behalf of the municipality, at the same time
and in the same manner as real property taxes or municipal charges.
Each annual installment lien shall remain a lien until paid. Amounts
collected in respect of an annual installment lien shall be remitted to
EIC, on behalf of the municipality, or the financing party, as may be
provided in the finance agreement.
E. EIC shall act as the municipality's agent in collection of the annual
installment amounts. If any benefited property owner fails to pay an
annual installment amount, the financing party may redeem the
benefited property by paying the amount of all unpaid municipal liens
thereon, and thereafter shall have the right to collect any amounts in
respect of an annual installment lien by foreclosure or any other
remedy available at law. Any foreclosure shall not affect any subsequent
annual installment liens.
F. EIC, on behalf of the municipality, may sell or assign for consideration
any and all benefit assessment liens and annual installment liens to
financing parties that provide financing to Qualified Properties
pursuant to finance agreements. The financing parties may sell or
assign for consideration any and all benefit assessment liens and annual
installment liens received from EIC, on behalf of the municipality,
subject to certain conditions provided in the administration agreement
between EIC and the financing party. The assignee or assignees of such
benefit assessment liens and annual installment liens shall have and
possess the same powers and rights at law or in equity as the
municipality would have had if the benefit assessment lien and the
annual installment liens had not been assigned with regard to the
precedence and priority of such lien, the accrual of interest and the fees
and expenses of collection.

The City Council of the City of Saratoga Springs, pursuant to New York
State General Municipal Law, Article 2, General Municipal Finances, hereby
establishes a program for the purpose of protecting, preserving, enhancing,
and improving environmentally sensitive, recreational and scenic land, as
such are regulated by various sections of New York State law pursuant to
the approval of the electors of the City in a public referendum held pursuant
to all applicable statutes of the laws of the State of New York.
§ 110-2. Legislative intent.
Continuing development within the City has demonstrated a compelling
need to acquire, improve, preserve, protect, maintain the availability of,
and improve the City's remaining natural areas, wetlands, trails, watershed
protection land, farm land, stream and other green-way corridors, historical
and archaeological sites and areas, significant habitats and ecologically
important areas, geological landmarks, public access areas and other
similar such open land for active and passive park and recreational
facilities, and preserve open areas, to enhance the general quality of life
and the environment of the City, and thereby benefit the residents and
taxpayers of the City. In order to achieve these goals, the City requires
a mechanism to purchase land, easements or other real property rights
and interests quickly and efficiently, and make original improvements and
embellishments thereto, as the need arises and opportunities are identified.
Appropriate fiscal planning is an essential component of fulfilling this goal.

open areas and the need to preserve such land, and empower municipalities
with authority to acquire real property to preserve as open areas, to more
effectively implement the powers and authorities granted to cities by
various sections of General City Law of the State of New York, which

nonresidential floodproofed structure will meet the floodproofing
criteria in § 120-18, Nonresidential structures.
E. A description of the extent to which any watercourse will be altered or
relocated as a result of proposed development. Computations by a
licensed professional engineer must be submitted that demonstrate
that the altered or relocated segment will provide equal or greater
conveyance than the original stream segment. The applicant must
submit any maps, computations or other material required by the
Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to revise the
documents enumerated in § 120-6, when notified by the local
administrator, and must pay any fees or other costs assessed by FEMA
for this purpose. The applicant must also provide assurances that the
conveyance capacity of the altered or relocated stream segment will be
maintained.
F. A technical analysis, by a licensed professional engineer, if required by
the local administrator, which shows whether proposed development to
be located in an area of special flood hazard may result in physical
damage to any other property.
G. In Zone A, when no base flood elevation data is available from other
sources, base flood elevation data shall be provided by the permit
applicant for subdivision proposals and other proposed developments
(including proposals for manufactured home and recreational vehicle
parks and subdivisions) that are greater than either 50 lots or five
acres.

Variance Procedure
§ 120-20. Appeals Board.
A. The Planning Board of the City of Saratoga Springs, New York, as
established by the City Council, shall hear and decide appeals and
requests for variances from the requirements of this chapter.
B. The Planning Board shall hear and decide appeals when it is alleged
there is an error in any requirement, decision or determination made by
the local administrator in the enforcement or administration of this
chapter.
C. Those aggrieved by the decision of the Building Inspector may appeal
such decision to the Supreme Court pursuant to Article 78 of the Civil
Practice Law and Rules.
D. In passing upon such applications, the Planning Board shall consider all
technical evaluations, all relevant factors, standards specified in other
sections of this chapter and:
(1) The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the
injury of others.
(2) The danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion damage.
(3) The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood
damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner.
(4) The importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to
the community.
(5) The necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where
applicable.
(6) The availability of alternative locations for the proposed use which
are not subject to flooding or erosion damage.
(7) The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated
development.
(8) The relationship of the proposed use to the Comprehensive Plan
and floodplain management program of that area.
(9) The safety of access to the property in times of flood for ordinary
and emergency vehicles.
(10) The costs to local governments and the dangers associated with
conducting search and rescue operations during periods of
flooding.
§ 120-20 CHARTER § 120-20
C:297
§ 120-21. Conditions for variances.
(11) The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise and sediment
transport of the floodwaters and the effects of wave action, if
applicable, expected at the site.
(12) The costs of providing governmental services during and after
flood conditions, including search and rescue operations,
maintenance and repair of public utilities and facilities such as
sewer, gas, electrical and water systems and streets and bridges.
E. Upon consideration of the factors of Subsection D and the purposes of
this chapter, the Planning Board may attach such conditions to granting
of variances as it deems necessary to further the purpose of this
chapter.
F. The local administrator shall maintain the records of all appeal actions,
including technical information, and report any variances to the Federal
Emergency Management Agency upon request.
A. Generally, variances may be issued for new construction and
substantial improvements to be erected on a lot of 1/2 acre or less in
size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures
constructed below the base flood level, provided that the provisions in
§ 120-20D(1) through (12) have been fully considered. As the lot size
increases beyond the 1/2 acre, the technical justification required for
issuing the variance increases.
B. Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic
structures upon determination that:
(1) The proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the
structure's continued designation as an historic structure.
(2) The variance is the minimum necessary to preserve the historic
character and design of the structure.
C. Variances may be issued by a community for new construction and
substantial improvements and for other development necessary for the
conduct of a functionally dependent use, provided that:
(1) The criteria of Subsections A, D, E and F of this section are met.
(2) The structure or other development is protected by methods that
minimize flood damages during the base flood and create no
additional threat to public safety.
D. Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any
increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.
E. Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is
the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief.
§ 120-20 SARATOGA SPRINGS CODE § 120-21
C:298
F. Variances shall only be issued upon receiving written justification of:
(1) A showing of good and sufficient cause.
(2) A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in
exceptional hardship to the applicant.
(3) A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in
increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety or
extraordinary public expense, create nuisances, cause fraud on or
victimization of the public or conflict with existing local laws or
ordinances.
G. Any applicant to whom a variance is granted for a building with the
lowest floor below the base flood elevation shall be given written notice
over the signature of a community official that the cost of flood
insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from
lowest floor elevation.

C:337
such invalidity shall not affect the other provisions or application of this
chapter.
§ 138-6. Discharge prohibitions; exceptions.
A. Prohibition of illegal discharges. No person shall discharge or cause to
be discharged into the MS4 any materials other than stormwater except
as provided in Subsection A(1). The commencement, conduct or
continuance of any illegal discharge to the MS4 is prohibited except as
described as follows:
(1) The following discharges are exempt from discharge prohibitions
established by this chapter, unless the Department or the
municipality has determined them to be substantial contributors of
pollutants: water line flushing or other potable water sources,
landscape irrigation or lawn watering, existing diverted stream
flows, rising groundwater, uncontaminated groundwater
infiltration to storm drains, uncontaminated pumped groundwater,
foundation or footing drains, crawl space or basement sump
pumps, air-conditioning condensate, irrigation water, springs,
water from individual residential car washing, natural riparian
habitat or wetland flows, dechlorinated swimming pool discharges,

property from imminent harm or damage, provided that such
approval shall not be construed to constitute compliance with other
applicable laws and requirements, and further provided that such
discharges may be permitted for a specified time period and under
such conditions as the SMO may deem appropriate to protect such
life and property while reasonably maintaining the purpose and
intent of this chapter.
(3) Dye testing in compliance with applicable state and local laws is an
allowable discharge, but requires a verbal notification to the SMO
prior to the time of the test.
(4) The prohibition shall not apply to any discharge permitted under an
SPDES permit, waiver, or waste discharge order issued to the
discharger and administered under the authority of the
Department, provided that the discharger is in full compliance with
all requirements of the permit, waiver, or order and other
applicable laws and regulations, and provided that written
approval has been granted for any discharge to the MS4.
B. Prohibition of illicit connections.
§ 138-5 SARATOGA SPRINGS CODE § 138-6
C:338
§ 138-7. Activities contaminating stormwater prohibited.
§ 138-8. Prevention, control, and reduction of stormwater
pollutants by use of best management practices.
(1) The construction, use, maintenance or continued existence of illicit
connections to the MS4 is prohibited.
(2) This prohibition expressly includes, without limitation, illicit
connections made in the past, regardless of whether the connection
was permissible under law or practices applicable or prevailing at
the time of connection.
(3) A person is considered to be in violation of this chapter if the
person connects a line conveying sewage to the municipality's MS4
or allows such a connection to continue.
A. Activities that are subject to the requirements of this section are those
types of activities that:
(1) Cause or contribute to a violation of the municipality's MS4 SPDES
permit.
(2) Cause or contribute to the municipality being subject to the special
conditions as defined in § 138-2, Definitions, of this chapter.
B. Upon notification to a person that he or she is engaged in activities that
cause or contribute to violations of the municipality's MS4 SPDES
permit authorization, that person shall take all reasonable actions to
correct such activities such that he or she no longer causes or
contributes to violations of the municipality's MS4 SPDES permit
authorization.
A. Best management practices. Where the SMO has identified illicit
discharges as defined in § 138-2 or activities contaminating stormwater
as defined in § 138-8, the municipality may require implementation of
best management practices (BMPs) to control those illicit discharges
and activities.
(1) The owner or operator of a commercial or industrial establishment
shall provide, at his or her own expense, reasonable protection
from accidental discharge of prohibited materials or other wastes
into the MS4 through the use of structural and nonstructural
BMPs.
(2) Any person responsible for a property or premise, which is, or may
be, the source of an illicit discharge as defined in § 138-2 or an
activity contaminating stormwater as defined in § 138-8, may be
required to implement, at said person's expense, additional
structural and nonstructural BMPs to reduce or eliminate the
source of pollutant(s) to the MS4.
§ 138-6 CHARTER § 138-8
C:339
§ 138-9. Suspension of access to MS4.
§ 138-10. Industrial or construction activity discharges.
Any person subject to an industrial or construction activity SPDES
stormwater discharge permit shall comply with all provisions of such
permit. Proof of compliance with said permit may be required in a form
acceptable to the municipality prior to the allowing of discharges to the
MS4.
§ 138-11. Applicability; access to facilities; monitoring of
discharges.
(3) Compliance with all terms and conditions of a valid SPDES permit
authorizing the discharge of stormwater associated with industrial
activity, to the extent practicable, shall be deemed in compliance
with the provisions of this section.
A. Illicit discharges in emergency situations. The SMO may, without prior
notice, suspend MS4 discharge access to a person when such
suspension is necessary to stop an actual or threatened discharge
which presents or may present imminent and substantial danger to the
environment, to the health or welfare of persons, or to the MS4. The
SMO shall notify the person of such suspension within a reasonable
time thereafter in writing of the reasons for the suspension. If the
violator fails to comply with a suspension order issued in an emergency,
the SMO may take such steps as deemed necessary to prevent or
minimize damage to the MS4 or to minimize danger to persons.
B. Suspension due to the detection of illicit discharge. Any person
discharging to the municipality's MS4 in violation of this chapter may
have his or her MS4 access terminated if such termination would abate
or reduce an illicit discharge. The SMO will notify a violator in writing
of the proposed termination of its MS4 access and the reasons therefor.
The violator may petition the SMO for a reconsideration and hearing.
Access may be granted by the SMO if he/she finds that the illicit
discharge has ceased and the discharger has taken steps to prevent its
recurrence. Access may be denied if the SMO determines in writing
that the illicit discharge has not ceased or is likely to recur. A person
commits an offense if the person reinstates MS4 access to premises
terminated pursuant to this section without the prior approval of the
SMO.
A. Applicability. This section applies to all facilities that the SMO must
inspect to enforce any provision of this chapter, or whenever the
authorized enforcement agency has cause to believe that there exists,
or potentially exists, in or upon any premises any condition which
constitutes a violation of this chapter.
B. Access to facilities.
§ 138-8 SARATOGA SPRINGS CODE § 138-11
C:340
§ 138-12. Notification of spills.
Notwithstanding other requirements of law, as soon as any person
responsible for a facility or operation, or responsible for emergency
response for a facility or operation has information of any known or
suspected release of materials which are resulting or may result in illegal
discharges or pollutants discharging into the MS4, said person shall take all
necessary steps to ensure the discovery, containment, and cleanup of such
release. In the event of such a release of hazardous materials, said person
shall immediately notify emergency response agencies of the occurrence
(1) The SMO shall be permitted to enter and inspect facilities subject
to regulation under this chapter as often as may be necessary to
determine compliance with this chapter. If a discharger has
security measures in force which require proper identification and
clearance before entry into its premises, the discharger shall make
the necessary arrangements to allow access to the SMO.
(2) Facility operators shall allow the SMO ready access to all parts of
the premises for the purposes of inspection, sampling, examination
and copying of records as may be required to implement this
chapter.
(3) The municipality shall have the right to set up on any facility
subject to this chapter such devices as are necessary in the opinion
of the SMO to conduct monitoring and/or sampling of the facility's
stormwater discharge.
(4) The municipality has the right to require the facilities subject to
this chapter to install monitoring equipment as is reasonably
necessary to determine compliance with this chapter. The facility's
sampling and monitoring equipment shall be maintained at all
times in a safe and proper operating condition by the discharger at
his or her own expense. All devices used to measure stormwater
flow and quality shall be calibrated to ensure their accuracy.
(5) Unreasonable delays in allowing the municipality access to a
facility subject to this chapter is a violation of this chapter. A person
who is the operator of a facility subject to this chapter commits an
offense if the person denies the municipality reasonable access to
the facility for the purpose of conducting any activity authorized or
required by this chapter.
(6) If the SMO has been refused access to any part of the premises
from which stormwater is discharged, and he/she is able to
demonstrate probable cause to believe that there may be a
violation of this chapter, or that there is a need to inspect and/or
sample as part of a routine inspection and sampling program
designed to verify compliance with this chapter or any order issued
hereunder, then the SMO may seek issuance of a search warrant
from any court of competent jurisdiction.
§ 138-11 CHARTER § 138-12
C:341
via emergency dispatch services. In the event of a release of nonhazardous
materials, said person shall notify the municipality in person or by
telephone or facsimile no later than the next business day. Notifications
in person or by telephone shall be confirmed by written notice addressed
and mailed to the municipality within three business days of the telephone
notice. If the discharge of prohibited materials emanates from a commercial
or industrial establishment, the owner or operator of such establishment
shall also retain an on-site written record of the discharge and the actions
taken to prevent its recurrence. Such records shall be retained for at least
three years.
§ 138-13. Enforcement; penalties for offenses.
A. Notice of violation.
(1) When the municipality's SMO finds that a person has violated a
prohibition or failed to meet a requirement of this chapter, he/she
may order compliance by written notice of violation to the
responsible person. Such notice may require, without limitation:
(a) The elimination of illicit connections or discharges;
(b) That violating discharges, practices, or operations shall cease
and desist;
(c) The abatement or remediation of stormwater pollution or
contamination hazards and the restoration of any affected
property;
(d) The performance of monitoring, analyses, and reporting;
(e) Payment of a fine; and
(f) The implementation of source control or treatment BMPs.
(2) If abatement of a violation and/or restoration of affected property is
required, the notice shall set forth a deadline within which such
remediation or restoration must be completed. Said notice shall
further advise that, should the violator fail to remediate or restore
within the established deadline, the work will be done by a
designated governmental agency or a contractor and the expense
thereof shall be charged to the violator.
B. Penalties. In addition to or as an alternative to any penalty provided
herein or by law, any person who violates the provisions of this chapter
shall be guilty of a violation punishable by a fine not exceeding $350 or
imprisonment for a period not to exceed six months, or both for
conviction of a first offense; for conviction of a second offense, both of
which were committed within a period of five years, punishable by a
fine not less than $350 nor more than $700 or imprisonment for a
period not to exceed six months, or both; and upon conviction for a third
or subsequent offense, all of which were committed within a period of
§ 138-12 SARATOGA SPRINGS CODE § 138-13
C:342
§ 138-14. Appeal of notice of violation.
Any person receiving a notice of violation may appeal the determination of
the SMO to the City of Saratoga Springs within 15 days of its issuance,
which shall hear the appeal within 30 days after the filing of the appeal,
and within five days of making its decision, file its decision in the office of
the municipal Clerk and mail a copy of its decision by certified mail to the
discharger.
§ 138-15. Corrective measures after appeal.
§ 138-16. Injunctive relief.
It shall be unlawful for any person to violate any provision or fail to comply
with any of the requirements of this chapter. If a person has violated or
continues to violate the provisions of this chapter, the SMO may petition for
a preliminary or permanent injunction restraining the person from activities
which would create further violations or compelling the person to perform
abatement or remediation of the violation.
§ 138-17. Alternative remedies.
five years, punishable by a fine not less than $700 nor more than
$1,000 or imprisonment for a period not to exceed six months, or both.
However, for the purposes of conferring jurisdiction upon courts and
judicial officers generally, violations of this chapter shall be deemed
misdemeanors and for such purpose only all provisions of law relating
to misdemeanors shall apply to such violations. Each week's continued
violation shall constitute a separate additional violation.
A. If the violation has not been corrected pursuant to the requirements set
forth in the notice of violation, or, in the event of an appeal, within five
business days of the decision of the municipal authority upholding the
decision of the SMO, then the SMO shall request the owner's
permission for access to the subject private property to take any and all
measures reasonably necessary to abate the violation and/or restore
the property.
B. If refused access to the subject private property, the SMO may seek a
warrant in a court of competent jurisdiction to be authorized to enter
upon the property to determine whether a violation has occurred. Upon
determination that a violation has occurred, the SMO may seek a court
order to take any and all measures reasonably necessary to abate the
violation and/or restore the property. The cost of implementing and
maintaining such measures shall be the sole responsibility of the
discharger.
A. Where a person has violated a provision of this chapter, he/she may be
eligible for alternative remedies in lieu of a civil penalty, upon
recommendation of the Municipal Attorney and concurrence of the
Municipal Code Enforcement Officer, where:
§ 138-13 CHARTER § 138-17
C:343
§ 138-18. Violations deemed a public nuisance.
In addition to the enforcement processes and penalties provided, any
condition caused or permitted to exist in violation of any of the provisions
of this chapter is a threat to public health, safety, and welfare, and is
declared and deemed a nuisance, and may be summarily abated or restored

§ 175-1. Purpose.
The failure of property owners to address violations of the City Code,
the Uniform Fire Prevention and Building Codes, and other City, state
and federal laws and regulations in a timely and effective manner is an
immediate and serious threat to the public health, safety and welfare. For
a municipality, the expenditure of public funds and resources to correct
violations is a major impediment to effective enforcement. In instances
where a property owner is difficult or impossible to locate, or is
unresponsive to communications from City officials, the recovery of the
costs to the public of correcting the violation is often difficult and timeconsuming.
This chapter provides procedures by which City Code
Enforcement Officers may, upon due process and notice, recover the costs
of summary abatement of code violations.
§ 175-2. Effect on other regulations.
The provisions of this chapter shall supplement local laws, codes or
regulations existing in the City of Saratoga Springs and the other statutes
and regulations of municipal authorities having jurisdiction applicable
thereto. Where a provision of this chapter is found to be in conflict with
any provision of a local law, ordinance, code or regulation, the provision
or requirement which is more restrictive or which establishes the higher
standard shall prevail.
§ 175-3. Recovery of costs.
A. Every Code Enforcement Officer in the City of Saratoga Springs is
hereby authorized and empowered to pay for the summary correction of
any violation that is within his or her lawful authority to correct, to pay
for such correction with City funds, and to enter the cost of the
correction as a lien and privilege on the property, subject to the
approval of the City Council of the City of Saratoga Springs as herein
provided.
B. The Code Enforcement Officer shall apply in writing to the City Council
member in charge of the Code Enforcement Officer's department for
§ 171-17 SARATOGA SPRINGS CODE § 175-3
C:404
authorization to proceed with recovery of costs. Along with the
application, the Code Enforcement Officer shall submit a report
showing his or her efforts to contact the owner of the property on which
the violation exists, the efforts made to correct the violation, and efforts
made to obtain payment for the costs of correction from the owner.
C. Upon review of the Code Enforcement Officer's report, the City Council
member may approve recovery of costs upon a finding that further
efforts by the Code Enforcement Officer to obtain payment from the
owner are unlikely to succeed, and/or will likely result in an
unreasonable and disproportionate expenditure of time and resources.
The City Council member shall then submit the matter to the City
Council for its final approval to recover costs.
D. Upon receiving City Council approval to recover costs, the Code
Enforcement Officer shall issue a notice of recovery of costs to the
owner of record. Ownership of record may be determined by a search of
reasonably available public information. Such notice shall be served
either personally upon the owner or by posting it conspicuously upon
the affected premises. If a notice is posted upon the premises, a copy
thereof shall be mailed to the owner of record by registered or certified
mail, return receipt requested. The notice shall state the owner's name,
the address of the property, and the violation or violations thereon. It
shall state, in boldface type as large or larger than the type used
elsewhere in the notice, that recovery of costs has been approved, the
amount of the costs, and that the costs shall thereafter constitute a lien
on the property.
E. When the Code Enforcement Officer has served the notice of recovery
of costs, the actual cost thereof, plus the accrued legal rate of interest
per annum from the date of the completion of the work, shall be
charged to such owner by the City, and such charge shall become
immediately due and payable by said owner.
F. Where the full amount due the City is not paid by such owner within 30
days after the service of the notice of recovery of costs, then and in that
case the Code Enforcement Officer shall cause to be filed in the office of
the City Clerk a sworn statement showing the cost and expense
incurred for the work, the date the work was completed and the
location of the property by section, lot and block on which said work
was done and the name of the owner of record. The filing of such sworn
statement shall constitute a lien and privilege on the property and shall
remain in full force and effect for the amount due in principal and
interest, plus the cost of court fees and expenses, if any, for collection,
until final payment has been made. Said costs and expenses shall be
collected in the manner provided by law for the collection of taxes by
the City, and further, shall be subject to a delinquent penalty at the legal
rate of interest in the event that the same is not paid in full on or before
the date the tax bill upon which such charge appears becomes
delinquent. Sworn statements filed in accordance with the provisions
hereof shall be prima facie evidence that all legal formalities have been

complied with and that the work has been properly and successfully
done and shall be full notice to every person concerned that the amount
of the statement, plus interest, constitutes a charge against the
property designated and described in the statement and that the same

together to promote safe, efficient and progressive development. The
City Council finds that a flourishing downtown business district is an
indispensable part of our past, present and future. It is of paramount

§ 199-14. Title.

§ 199-16. Background; findings of fact.
A. Background.
§ 199-14 CHARTER § 199-16
C:439
§ 199-17. Purpose.
The purpose of creating the District is to preserve and protect the health,
safety, comfort and general welfare of the residents in the District. The
project will be undertaken to provide properties within the District with
City water. The cost of the project shall be assessed upon those properties
benefited within the District.
§ 199-18. Creation.
The City, as authorized under the provisions of the General City Law, the
Municipal Home Rule Law and this article, hereby creates the District.
(1) The City Council of the City of Saratoga Springs (the "City") is
concerned about the quality and safety of drinking water available
to the residents of the Knoll Spring Park and Wood Ridge at Knoll
Spring Park (collectively, the "parks"). Many residents within the
parks have well water that is turbid and discolored. The poor
quality of the drinking water in the parks has caused many
difficulties to the residents. Attempts by the residents to treat their
water with filtration and other treatment systems have not been
successful.
(2) A mail survey conducted by the City's Department of Public Works
of the residents in the parks indicated that a substantial percentage
of the residents want the City to extend the City's water system to
the parks. Furthermore, the residents have indicated a willingness
to pay the cost of the improvements required to extend the City's
water system by assessing such costs on those residents of the
District benefiting from the improvements.
(3) The City has provided written notice to the residents of the District
of the boundaries of the District, a description of the project and a
summary of the costs of the project.
B. Findings of fact.
(1) The City Council of the City does hereby find that appropriate
measures must be taken to protect the health, safety, comfort and
general welfare of the residents in the parks. Accordingly, the City
Council of the City recognizes the necessity for the undertaking by
the City of the project. In order to finance the cost of the project,
the City Council will create the District. The District is created
pursuant to this article for purposes of assessing the cost of the
project to the residents located within the District.
(2) The adjacent properties and the properties within the District will
be benefitted by the project facility as the project facility will add to
the value of the property within the District and the adjacent
properties and will improve water supply and quality and fire
protection within the District.
§ 199-16 SARATOGA SPRINGS CODE § 199-19
C:440
§ 199-19. Boundaries.
The properties to be included in the District must be accurately described

the project facility to be acquired, constructed and installed within the
District. The City will establish, from time to time, the manner in which
the cost of the project facility will be assessed against properties within
the District. Properties included within the District will be assessed,
according to formulas established from time to time by the City Council
in its sole judgment, to reflect the benefits accruing to such properties
within the District by reason of the project facility.
B. Notwithstanding anything else to the contrary contained in this article
or in any other law, resolution, regulation or rule of the City and in
addition to all other costs or fees provided for by law, resolution,
regulation and rule of the City, a tapping fee of no less than $3,000 each
shall be paid by all adjacent properties and all undeveloped properties
existing within the District on the date of the enactment hereof.
C. The City shall establish a reserve fund in connection with the financing
of the project. All tapping fees, described in Subsection B above, shall
be forthwith deposited in such reserve fund and shall be used by the
City to pay principal and/or interest on any bonds or notes issued to
finance the project.
D. Any operation and maintenance expenses of the District will be treated
as expenses of the Citywide water system and paid out of the City's

payments for such assessments for the project facility be collected over a
period of years longer than the period of probable usefulness of the project
facility as set forth in the Local Finance Law.

The City retains all rights and powers which it now has or may have in
the future. The creation of the District is not to be interpreted to be an
abrogation or diminution of any rights and powers of the City. This article
in no way prevents the City at any time subsequent to the creation of the
District from changing the description of the District or the assessment
formulas for properties to be assessed within the District or from exercising
the other powers granted by this article or other applicable statutes of the
State of New York.
§ 199-24. Budget and assessment rolls.
A. The City shall prepare a budget describing revenues and expenses
relating to the project in connection with the preparation of the City's

in preparing assessment rolls of benefitted, assessable properties
within the District. Such procedures shall include the provision of
notice of the completion of the assessment roll and the scheduling of a
public hearing to consider the assessment roll. The procedures must be
consistent with the powers granted by this article and in all other
respects with the Charter and other ordinances of the City and other
applicable statutes of the State of New York.

and such records shall be preserved for a period of three years, except that
the Commissioner of Finance may consent to their destruction within that
period or may require that they be kept longer.

the case may be, of such utility for the preceding calendar month and shall
contain any other data, information or matter which the Commissioner of
Finance may require to be included therein. The Commissioner of Finance

§ 212-2 SARATOGA SPRINGS CODE § 212-4
C:556
officer of the corporation, if such business is conducted by a corporation, to

§ 212-5. Tax payable with return.
At the time of filing a return as required by this article, each utility shall
pay to the Commissioner of Finance the tax imposed by this article for the

§ 212-6. Insufficient returns.
In case any return filed pursuant to this article shall be insufficient or
unsatisfactory to the Commissioner of Finance and if a corrected or
sufficient return is not filed within 20 days after the same is required
by notice from the Commissioner of Finance or if no return is made for
any period, the Commissioner of Finance shall determine the amount of
tax due from such information as she is able to obtain and, if necessary,
may estimate the tax on the basis of external indexes or otherwise. The
Commissioner of Finance shall give notice of such determination to the
person liable for such tax. Such determination shall finally and irrevocably
fix such tax, unless the person against whom it is assessed shall, within
30 days after the giving of notice of such determination, apply to the
Commissioner of Finance for a hearing or unless the Commissioner of
Finance, of her own motion, shall reduce the same. After such hearing, the
Commissioner of Finance shall give notice of her decision to the person
liable for the tax. The decision of the Commissioner of Finance may be
reviewed by certiorari if application therefor is made within 30 days after
the giving of notice of such decision. An order of certiorari shall not be
granted unless the amount of any tax sought to be reviewed, with the
penalties thereon, if any, shall be first deposited with the Commissioner of
Finance and an undertaking filed with her, in such amount and with such
sureties as a Justice of the Supreme Court shall approve, to the effect that,
if such order is dismissed or the tax confirmed, the applicant for the order
will pay all costs and charges which may accrue in the prosecution of the
certiorari proceeding or, at the option of the applicant, such undertaking
may be in a sum sufficient to cover the tax, penalties, costs and charges
aforesaid, in which event the applicant shall not be required to pay such tax
and penalties as a condition precedent to the granting of such order.
§ 212-7. Notice.
Any notice authorized or required under the provisions of this article may
be given by mailing the same to the person for whom it is intended, in a
postpaid envelope, addressed to such person at the address given by him
in the last return filed by him under this article or, if no return has been
filed, then to such address as may be obtainable. The mailing of such notice
shall be presumptive evidence of the receipt of the same by the person to
whom addressed. Any period of time which is determined according to the
§ 212-4 CHARTER § 212-7
C:557
provisions of this article by the giving of notice shall commence to run from
the date of mailing of such notice.
§ 212-8. Penalties for offenses.
Any person failing to file a return or corrected return or to pay any tax
or any portion thereof within the time required by this article shall be
subject to a penalty of 5% of the amount of tax due, plus 1% of such
tax for each month of delay or fraction thereof, excepting the first month,
after such return was required to be filed or such tax became due; but the
Commissioner of Finance, if satisfied that the delay was excusable, may
remit all or any portion of such penalty.
§ 212-9. Refunds.
If, within one year from the payment of any tax or penalty, the payer
thereof shall make application for a refund thereof and the Commissioner
of Finance or the Court shall determine that such tax or penalty or any
portion thereof was erroneously or illegally collected, the Commissioner
of Finance shall refund the amount so determined. For like cause and
within the same period, a refund may be so made on the initiative of the
Commissioner of Finance. However, no refund shall be made of a tax or
penalty paid pursuant to a determination of the Commissioner of Finance as
hereinbefore provided unless the Commissioner of Finance, after a hearing
as hereinbefore provided or of her own motion, shall have reduced the
tax or penalty or it shall have been established as a certiorari proceeding
that such determination was erroneous or illegal. All refunds shall be made
out of moneys collected under this article. An application for a refund,
made as hereinbefore provided, shall be deemed an application for the
revision of any tax or penalty complained of, and the Commissioner of
Finance may receive additional evidence with respect thereto. After making
her determination, the Commissioner of Finance shall give notice thereof
to the person interested, and he shall be entitled to a certiorari order to
review such determination, subject to the provisions hereinbefore contained
relating to the granting of such an order.
§ 212-10. Tax as part of operating costs.
The tax imposed by this article shall be charged against and be paid by the
utility and shall not be added as a separate item to bills rendered by the
utility to customers or others but shall constitute a part of the operating
costs of such utility.
§ 212-11. Enforcement.
Whenever any person shall fail to pay any tax or penalty imposed by this
article, the City Attorney shall, upon the request of the Commissioner of
Finance, bring an action to enforce payment of the same. The proceeds of
any judgment obtained in any such action shall be paid to the Commissioner
of Finance. Each such tax and penalty shall be a lien upon the property of
§ 212-7 SARATOGA SPRINGS CODE § 212-11
C:558
the person liable to pay the same, in the same manner and to the same
extent that the tax and penalty imposed by § 186-a of the Tax Law is made a
lien.
§ 212-12. Additional rules and regulations.
In the administration of this article, the Commissioner of Finance shall have
power to make such reasonable rules and regulations not inconsistent with
law as may be necessary for the exercise of her powers and the performance
of her duties and to prescribe the form of blanks, reports and other records
relating to the administration and enforcement of the tax, to take testimony
and proofs, under oath, with reference to any matter within the line of her
official duty under this article and to subpoena and require the attendance
of witnesses and the production of books, papers and documents.

provided by law, it shall be unlawful for the Commissioner of Finance or
any agent, Clerk or employee of the City of Saratoga Springs to divulge

operating income or any particulars set forth or disclosed in any return

shall not be required to produce any of them or evidence of anything
contained in them in any action or proceeding in any court except on
behalf of the City of Saratoga Springs in an action or proceeding under
the provisions of this article or on behalf of the State Tax Commission in
an action or proceeding under the provisions of the Tax Law of the State
of New York or on behalf of any party to any action or proceeding under
the provisions of this article when the returns or facts shown thereby
are directly involved in such action or proceeding, in either of which
events the court may require the production of and may admit in
evidence so much of said returns or of the facts shown thereby as are
pertinent to the action or proceeding and no more. Nothing herein shall
be construed to prohibit the delivery to a person or his duly authorized
representative of a copy of any return filed by him nor to prohibit the
publication of statistics so classified as to prevent the identification of
particular returns and the items thereof or the publication of delinquent
lists showing the names of persons who have failed to pay their taxes at
the time and in the manner provided for by this article, together with
any relevant information which, in the opinion of the Commissioner of
Finance, may assist in the collection of such delinquent taxes or in the
inspection by the City Attorney or other legal representatives of the
City of Saratoga Springs of the return of any person who shall bring
action to set aside or review the tax based thereon or against whom an
action has been instituted in accordance with the provisions of this

Finance may exchange with the chief fiscal officer of any other City in
the State of New York information contained in returns filed under this
article, provided that such other City grants similar privileges to the
City of Saratoga Springs, and provided that such information is to be
used for tax purposes only, and the Commissioner of Finance shall,
upon request, furnish the State Tax Commission with any information
contained in such returns.

§ 212-29. Purpose. [Amended 4-4-1994 by L.L. No. 1-1994]
The purpose of this article shall be to provide for the preservation of the
veterans exemption in connection with taxation on real property in respect
to the ratios thereof in the event of the change in the manner of assessing
in accordance with § 458, Subdivision 5(a), of the New York State Real
Property Tax Law.
§ 212-30. Intent.
Pursuant to the provisions of § 458 of the New York State Real Property
Tax Law as heretofore adopted and amended by the Legislature of the
State of New York, including the amendment by reason of the adoption of
Chapter 134 of the Laws of 1979, effective May 24, 1979, the purpose of this
article is to preserve the ratio which each veteran's exemption from taxation
on real property bears to the total assessed value of real property for
which such exemption has been granted whenever such total assessed value
increases or decreases due only to a change in the manner of assessing.
§ 212-31. Word usage. [Amended 4-4-1994 by L.L. No. 1-1994]
The meanings of words and expressions as used in this article shall be

If the ratio between the exemption granted under § 458, Subdivision 1,
of the Real Property Tax Law of the State of New York and the total
value of assessed property for which such exemption has been granted
increases or decreases due only to change in the manner of assessing in
the City of Saratoga Springs, the amount of the exemption heretofore or
hereafter granted shall be increased or decreased in such subsequent year
in the same proportion as the total assessed value has been increased or
decreased. Such adjustment shall be made by the Assessor in a manner
provided in Subdivision 1(3) of § 458 of the Real Property Tax Law of the
State of New York, and no application therefor need be filed by or on behalf
of any owner of any eligible property.
§ 212-33. Effect on other provisions.
Insofar as the provisions of this article are inconsistent with the provisions
of any other local law or act, the provisions of this article shall be
controlling.

§ 212-40 CHARTER § 212-43

consent to their destruction within that period or may require that they be
kept longer.
§ 212-45. Returns.
§ 212-46. Payment of tax.

pay to the County Treasurer the taxes imposed by this article upon the
rents required to be included in such return, as well as all other moneys

of this article, even though it be judicially determined that the tax collected
is invalidly required to be filed, that shall be due from the operator and

business in this state and approved by the Superintendent of Insurance of
this state as to solvency and responsibility, in such amount as the County
Treasurer may fix to secure the payment of any tax and/or penalties and
interest due or which may become due from such operator. In the event
that the County Treasurer determines that an operator is to file such bond,
he shall give notice to such operator to that effect, specifying the amount
of the bond required. The operator shall file such bond within five days
after the giving of such notice unless, within such five days, the operator
shall request, in writing, a hearing before the County Treasurer at which
the necessity, propriety and amount of the bond shall be determined by the
County Treasurer. Such determination shall be final and shall be complied
with within 15 days after the giving of notices thereof. In lieu of such bond,
securities approved by the County Treasurer or cash in such amount as he
may prescribe may be deposited, which shall be kept in the custody of the
County Treasurer, who may at any time, without notice of the depositor,
apply them to any tax and/or interest or penalties due, and for that purpose,
the securities may be sold by him at public or private sale without notice to
the depositors thereof.

type of accommodations and service, number of employees and/or other
factors. Notice of such determination shall be given to the person liable for
the collection and/or payment of the tax. Such determination shall finally
and irrevocably fix the tax unless the person against whom it is assessed,
within 30 days after giving notice of such determination, shall apply to
the County Treasurer for a hearing or unless the County Treasurer, of his
own motion, shall redetermine the same. After such hearing, the County
Treasurer shall give notice of his determination to the person against whom
the tax is assessed. The determination of the County Treasurer shall be
reviewable for error, illegality or unconstitutionality or any other reason
whatsoever by proceeding under Article 78 of the Civil Practice Law and
Rules if application therefor is made to the Supreme Court within 30
days after the giving of the notice of such determination. A proceeding
under Article 78 of the Civil Practice Law and Rules shall not be instituted
unless the amount of any tax sought to be reviewed, with penalties and
interest thereon, if any, shall be first deposited with the County Treasurer
and there shall be filed with the County Treasurer an undertaking issued
by a surety company authorized to transact business in this state and
approved by the Superintendent of Insurance of this state as to solvency
and responsibility, in such amount as a Justice of the Supreme Court shall
approve, to the effect that if such proceedings are dismissed or the tax
confirmed, the petitioner will pay all costs and charges which may accrue
in the prosecution of the proceeding or, at the option of the applicant, such

cover the taxes, penalties and interest thereon stated in such determination,
plus the costs and charges which may accrue against it in the prosecution
of the proceedings, in which event the applicant shall not be required to
deposit such taxes, penalties and interest as a condition precedent to the
application.

All revenues resulting from the imposition of the tax under this article
shall be paid into the Treasury of the county and shall be credited to and
deposited in the general fund of the county. The net collections derived from
the tax shall be allocated by the Board of Supervisors of Saratoga County
only for the promotion of tourism and conventions; provided, however,
that the net collections pursuant to § 212-38A above shall be paid to the
general fund of the City of Saratoga Springs, the net collections pursuant
to § 212-38B above shall be paid to the Saratoga Convention and Tourism
Bureau for use in marketing the City of Saratoga Springs as a destination
for conventions and group tours, and the net collections pursuant to
§ 212-38C above shall be placed in an interest-bearing capital reserve
account to fund the expansion and renovation of the City Center until such
time as the expansion and renovation has been completed, and thereafter
shall be placed in a special account which may be drawn upon to offset any
operating deficit maintained by the City Center. The Board of Supervisors of
Saratoga County shall appoint an advisory committee of nine persons, four
of whom shall be members of the Board of Supervisors and five of whom
shall be owners, managers or, if such facility is owned by a corporation or
partnership, partners or officers of facilities paying such tax. The advisory
committee shall advise and recommend to said Board of Supervisors
relative to the purpose of this section.

refund or credit, without interest, any tax, penalty or interest
erroneously, illegally or unconditionally collected or paid if application
to the County Treasurer for such refund shall be made within one year
from the payment thereof. Such application shall be in such form as the
County Treasurer shall prescribe. Such application may be made by the
occupant, operator or other person who has actually paid the tax. Such
application may also be made by an operator who has collected and
paid over such tax to the County Treasurer, provided that the
application is made within one year of the payment by the occupant to
the operator, but no actual refund of moneys shall be made to such
operator until he shall first establish to the satisfaction of the County
Treasurer, under such regulations as the County Treasurer may
prescribe, that he has repaid to the occupant the amount for which the
application for refund is made. The County Treasurer may, in lieu of any
refund required to be made, allow credit therefor on payments due from
the applicant. [Amended 10-2-2012 by L.L. No. 4-2012]

deemed an application for a revision of any tax, penalty or interest
complained of, and the County Treasurer may receive evidence with
respect thereto. After making his determination, the County Treasurer
shall give notice thereof to the applicant who shall be entitled to review
such determination by a proceeding pursuant to Article 78 of the Civil
Practice Law and Rules, provided that such proceeding is instituted
within 30 days after the giving of the notice of such determination, and
provided that a final determination of tax due was not previously made.
Such a proceeding shall not be instituted unless an undertaking is filed
with the County Treasurer in such amount and with such sureties as a
Justice of the Supreme Court shall approve, to the effect that if such
proceedings be dismissed or the tax confirmed, the petitioner will pay
all costs and charges which may accrue in the prosecution of such
proceeding.

article of a tax, interest or penalty which had been determined to be due
pursuant to the provisions of this section where he has a hearing or an
opportunity for a hearing, as provided in said section, or has failed to
avail himself of the remedies therein provided. No refund or credit shall
be made of a tax, interest or penalty paid after a determination by the
County Treasurer made pursuant to § 212-47 of this article unless it is
found that such determination was erroneous, illegal or
unconstitutional or otherwise improper by the County Treasurer after a
hearing or of his own motion or in a proceeding under Article 78 of the
Civil Practice Law and Rules, pursuant to the provisions of said section,
in which event a refund or credit without interest shall be made of the
tax, interest or penalty found to have been overpaid.
D. Subject to the conditions and limitations provided in this section, a
room remarketer shall be allowed a refund or credit against the amount
of tax collected and required to be remitted under this article in the
amount of the tax it paid to an operator of a hotel under this article.

this subsection for any occupancy tax quarterly period, the room

purposes under § 212-42; (B) collect the taxes imposed by § 212-38; and
(C) furnish the certificate of authority number of the operator to whom
the applicant paid the tax in its application for refund or credit if
required on that form or upon request. Provided, that if the room
remarketer requests the operator's certificate of authority number and
is not provided with that number, the room remarketer may satisfy this
requirement by providing the operator's name, business address,
telephone number, and the address of the hotel where the occupancy
took place. An application for refund or credit under this subsection
must be filed with the County Treasurer within the time provided in
Subsection A of this section. Where an application for credit has been
filed, the applicant may immediately take the credit on the return that is
due coincident with or immediately subsequent to the time that the

instituted a proceeding under Article 78 of the Civil Practice Law and Rules
to review a determination adverse to him on his application for refund, the
County Treasurer shall set up appropriate reserves to meet any decision
adverse to the county.
§ 212-51. Remedies exclusive.
The remedies provided by §§ 212-47 and 212-49 shall be exclusive remedies
available to any person for the review of tax liability imposed by this article,
and no determination or proposed determination of tax or determination on
any application for refund shall be enjoined or reviewed by an action for
declaratory judgment, an action for money had and received or by an action
or proceeding other than a proceeding in a nature of a certiorari proceeding
under Article 78 of the Civil Practice Law and Rules; provided, however,
that a taxpayer may proceed by declaratory judgment if he institutes suit
within 30 days after a deficiency assessment is made and pays the amount
of the deficiency assessment to the County Treasurer prior to the institution
of such suit and posts a bond for costs as provided in § 212-47.

credit on the return is deemed to be part of the application for credit.
The procedure for granting or denying the application for refund or
credit and review of these determinations shall be as provided in this
section. An operator, including a room remarketer, who is paid tax by
a room remarketer must upon request provide the remarketer with its
certificate of authority number, provided that the operator's failure to
do so does not change the requirement set forth herein. [Amended
10-2-2012 by L.L. No. 4-2012]
A. Whenever any operator or any officer of a corporate operator or any
occupant or other person shall fail to collect and pay over any tax and/
or to pay any taxi penalty or interest imposed by this article as therein
provided, the County Attorney shall, upon the request of the County
Treasurer, bring or cause to be brought an action to enforce the
payment of the same on behalf of the County of Saratoga and/or City of
Saratoga Springs in any court of the State of New York or of any other
state or of the United States. If, however, the County Treasurer, in his
discretion, believes that any such operator, officer, occupant or other
person is about to cease business, leave the state or remove or dissipate
the assets out of which the tax or penalties might be satisfied and that
any such tax or penalty will not be paid when due, he may declare such
tax or penalty to be immediately due and payable and may issue a
warrant immediately.
§ 212-49 CHARTER § 212-52
C:581
B. As an additional or alternate remedy, the County Treasurer may issue a
warrant directed to the Sheriff commanding him to levy upon and sell
the real and personal property of the operator or officer of a corporate
operator or other person liable for the tax, which may be found within
the county for the payment of the amount thereof; with any penalties
and interest and the cost of executing the warrant, and to return such
warrant to the County Treasurer and to pay to him the money collected
by virtue thereof within 60 days after the receipt of such warrant. The
Sheriff shall, within five days after the receipt of the warrant, file with
the County Clerk a copy thereof; and thereupon such Clerk shall enter
in the judgment docket the name of the person mentioned in the
warrant and the amount of the tax, penalties and interest for which the
warrant is issued and the date when such copy is filed. Thereupon, the
amount of such warrant so docketed shall become a lien upon the real
and personal property of the person against whom the warrant is
issued. The Sheriff shall then proceed upon the warrant in the same
manner and with like effect as that provided by law in respect to
executions issued against property and upon judgments of a court of
record, and, for services in executing the warrant, he shall be entitled
to the same fees, which he may collect in the same manner. In the
discretion of the County Treasurer, a warrant of like terms, force and
effect may be issued and directed to any officer or employee of the
County Treasurer, and in the execution thereof; such officer or
employee shall have all the powers conferred by law upon Sheriffs but
shall be entitled to no fee or compensation in excess of the actual
expenses paid in the performance of such duty. If a warrant is returned
not satisfied in full, the County Treasurer may from time to time issue
new warrants and shall also have the same remedies to enforce the
amount due thereunder as if the county had recovered judgment
therefor and execution thereon has been returned unsatisfied.
C. Whenever an operator shall make a sale, transfer or assignment in bulk
of any part or the whole of his tourist home, inn, hotel or motel or his
lease, license or other agreement or right to possess or operate such
facility or of the equipment, furnishings, fixtures, supplies or stock of
merchandise of said premises or lease, license or other agreement or
right to possess or operate such tourist home, inn, hotel or motel and
the equipment, furnishings, fixtures, supplies and stock or merchandise
pertaining to the conduct or operation of said tourist home, inn, hotel or
motel otherwise than in the ordinary and regular prosecution of
business, the purchaser, transferee or assignee shall, at least 10 days
before taking possession of the subject of said sale, transfer or
assignment or paying therefor, notify the County Treasurer by
registered mail of the proposed sale and of the price, terms and
conditions thereof, whether or not the seller, transferor or assignor has
represented to or informed the purchaser, transferee or assignee that it
owes any tax pursuant to this article and whether or not the purchaser,
transferee or assignee has knowledge that such taxes are owing and
whether any such taxes are in fact owing. Whenever the purchaser,
transferee or assignee shall fail to give notice to the County Treasurer

VACANT BUILDINGS
§ 222-1. Finding and purpose.
The Saratoga Springs City Council finds that buildings that are left to
remain vacant are likely to become both unsightly and unsafe. They quickly
cause a negative effect on their surrounding neighborhoods as well as on
the entire City. This is especially true for buildings identified as an historic
building or located within historic districts, as those buildings serve as the
foundation of the City's cultural heritage. This chapter establishes a method
for identifying and registering vacant buildings and imposes reasonable
responsibilities for property owners.
§ 222-2. Definitions.
The following terms are hereby defined:
CODE ADMINISTRATOR  That public official defined in § 8-3 of the City
Code.
HISTORIC BUILDING  A building or structure located within an historic
district, identified as a City landmark, or listed on the New York State or
National Register of Historic Places or which are eligible for such listing as
determined by the State Historic Preservation Office.
HISTORIC DISTRICTS  Those districts identified in § 7.4.18 of the City
Zoning Ordinance.
OWNER  Any person or legal entity identified as the property's owner
of record in the records of the City Assessor's Office, or a mortgagee or
mortgagor in possession of the property, or an assignee of rents, a receiver,
an executor, a trustee, a lessee, or any other person or legal entity in control
of the premises. Any such person shall be jointly and severally obliged to
comply with the provisions of this chapter.
SECURED BY OTHER THAN NORMAL MEANS  Secured by means other
than those used in the design of the building.
UNOCCUPIED BUILDING  A building or portion thereof which lacks the
habitual presence of human beings who have a legal right to be on the
premises, including buildings ordered vacated by the Code Administrator
and his or her designees. In determining whether a building is unoccupied,
the Code Administrator and his or her designees may consider, but are not
limited to, these factors:
A. Whether a lawful residential or business activity has ceased.
The percentage of the overall square footage of the occupied space to
the unoccupied space, or the number of occupied units to unoccupied
units.
B.
Whether the building is substantially devoid of contents or whether the
value of fixtures or personal property in the building is minimal.
C.

process or processes employed in the pretreatment and control, if required,
of such wastewater shall in each case be satisfactory to and shall have the
approval by permit of the Department of Public Works or its duly authorized
A. If any waters or wastes are discharged or are proposed to be
discharged to the sewerage system or sewers tributary thereto, which
waters or wastes in the judgment of the Department of Public Works or
its duly authorized agent, may have a deleterious effect upon said
system or sewers, processes, equipment or receiving waters, or may
otherwise create a hazard to life or constitute a public nuisance, or may
exceed the concentration limits prescribed for normal sewage, the
Department of Public Works or its duly authorized agent may:
(1) Reject the waters or wastes;
(2) Require pretreatment to an acceptable condition for discharge to
the sewers;
(3) Require control over the quantities and rates of discharge; and/or
(4) Require payment to cover the added cost of handling and treating
the waters or wastes not covered by existing charges or sewer
rents;
(5) Certified tests of industrial wastewater may be required
periodically by the Department of Public Works or its duly
authorized agent.
B. The discharge of waters or wastes requiring pretreatment, flow control
or additional treatment will not be permitted into the sewerage system
or sewers tributary thereto without previous approval by permit as
prescribed under Article IB.
§ 231-46.1 CHARTER § 231-46.2
C:761
agent as set forth under Article IB. No permit required pursuant to this
section shall be arbitrarily denied.
§ 231-46.3. Prohibited materials, substances, water and wastes.
No person shall discharge or cause to be discharged into the sewerage
system or sewers tributary thereto, any of the following materials,
substances or wastes:
A. Any liquids, solids or gases which by reason of their nature or quantity
are or may be sufficient, either alone or by interaction with other
substances, to cause fire or explosion or be injurious in any other way to
the POTW or to the operation of the POTW. At no time shall two
successive readings on an explosion hazard meter, at the point of
discharge into the system (or at any point in the system), be more than
5% nor any single reading over 10% of the lower explosive limit (LEL) of
the meter. Prohibited material include, but are not limited to, gasoline,
kerosene, naphtha, benzene, toluene, xylene, ethers, alcohols, ketones,
aldehydes, peroxides, chlorates, perchlorates, bromates, carbides,
hydrides and sulfides and any other substances which are a fire hazard
or a hazard to the system.
B. Any wastewater having a pH less than 5.0 or greater than 12.0, unless
the POTW is specifically designed to accommodate such wastewater, or
wastewater having any other corrosive property capable of causing
damage or hazard to sewers, structures, equipment or personnel.
C. Solid or viscous substances, in quantities or of such size or state, which
may impair the hydraulic capacity, may cause maintenance difficulties,
or may interfere with the proper operation of the sewerage system and
sewers tributary hereto, such as, but not limited to, ashes, cinders,
sand, mud, straw, shavings, metal, glass, rags, tar, plastics, wood, whole
blood, paunch manure, feathers, hair and fleshings, entrails, paper
dishes, cups, milk containers, etc., either whole or macerated.
D. Any liquid or vapor having a temperature higher than 150° F. (65° C.) or
in such quantities that the temperature at the treatment works influent
exceed 104° F. (40° C.). If, in the opinion of the Department of Public
Works or its duly authorized agent, lower temperatures of such wastes
could harm either the sewers, sewage treatment process, or equipment,
have an adverse effect on the receiving stream, or could otherwise
endanger life, health or property, or constitute or contribute to a
nuisance, the Department of Public Works or its duly authorized agent
may prohibit such discharges.
E. Waters or wastes containing substances which are not amenable to
treatment or reduction by the POTW processes employed, or are
amenable to treatment only to such a degree that the POTW effluent
cannot meet the requirements of regulatory agencies having
jurisdiction over discharge to the receiving waters.

to exceed the limitation set forth in a categorical pretreatment
standard.
G. Any substance which may cause the POTW's effluent or any other
product of the POTW, such as residues, sludges, or sums, to be
unsuitable for reclamation and reuse or to interfere with the
reclamation process. In no case, shall a substance discharged to the
POTW cause the POTW to be in noncompliance with sludge use or
disposal criteria, guidelines or regulations developed under Section
405 of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act; any criteria, guidelines,
or regulations affecting sludge use or disposal developed pursuant to
the Solid Waste Disposal Act, or state criteria applicable to the sludge
management method being used.
A. No person shall discharge or cause to be discharged in to the sewerage
system or sewers tributary thereto, the following described materials,
substances, waters, or wastes if it appears likely in the judgment of the
Department of Public Works or its duly authorized agent that such
wastes may have a deleterious effect upon the sewer system or sewers
tributary thereto, sewage treatment or other processes, equipment, or
receiving waters, or may otherwise endanger life, limb, property, or
constitute a public nuisance.
B. In forming this opinion as to the acceptability of these quantities of
subject wastes in relation to flows and velocities in the sewers,
materials of construction, POTW processes and capacity, degree of
treatability, and other pertinent factors shall be considered.

person or legal entity shall be responsible for the payment of all water
rents and related payments, fees, and charges as the City Council may
establish from time to time, and shall also state the location of the
connection, the time the work will be started and completed and the
category of the service. The application must be signed by a licensed
plumber who will perform the work involved.
B. (Reserved)
C. Any person or legal entity making any application under this section
shall obtain approval of that application from the Department of Public
Works prior to submitting any other application in which a new service
connection is required or sought to any City official, board or office,
including but not limited to the Zoning and Building Inspector or the
Planning Board.
A. Upon receipt of a permit from the City, the owner may have the service
connection installed by the plumber whose name appears on the
application. Should the owner desire to use a different plumber to make
such connection for any reason whatsoever, he must reapply for a
permit. All other permits as may be necessary for the particular
situation must be obtained prior to excavation.
B. There will be no additional water service connections made beyond that
stated in the application without first obtaining a permit to construct
such additional services.
§ 231-48 CHARTER § 231-50
C:781
§ 231-51. Performance of system.
The City undertakes to use reasonable care and diligence to provide a
constant supply of water at reasonable pressure to the users. However, the
City reserves the right at any time, without notice, to shut off the water in
its mains for the purpose of making repairs, taps and extensions, and the
City will not be held liable for deficiency or failure in the supply of water
or in the pressure for any cause whatsoever. The City will, however, give
notice, where practical, of such shutoffs. The City water system furnishes
water and not pressure and does not guarantee a continuous supply. No
responsibility will be assumed by the City for any damages to any apparatus
in any house or building due to the shutting off or turning on of water with
or without notice.
§ 231-52. Extensions of system.
§ 231-53. Payment of water rents.
C. The entire service lateral from the main in the street to the owner's
premises is the property of the owner, and any and all repairs shall be
the responsibility of said owner. There shall be a separate service
lateral for each principal structure from the main in the street to said
principal structure. Common water and sewer services are not
permitted. [Added 2-16-1988]
A. In the case where a new or existing main is connected to the City water
system and such has been constructed by an entity other than the
Utilities Department, all applicable standards and regulations must be
met prior to acceptance. Acceptance of the line or lines shall be
conditional for a period of one year, and all breaks, leaks or other
damage which occur in or due to the lines shall be the responsibility of
the former owner to repair. When such damage is detected within that
period, the Utilities Department shall notify the former owner and
request that prompt action be taken to repair such damage, whether it
is damage to the line itself or damage caused by a result of the leak.
Where the Utilities Department deems that the previous owner has not
taken prompt action to repair the damage and it feels that the resulting
conditions degrade the public safety, it may elect to do such repair itself
or to contract such work through some other source and to charge the
previous owner for all of the costs incurred. [Amended 4-4-1994 by
L.L. No. 1-1994]
B. Before such extensions will be accepted, the owner shall deposit with
the Department of Finance a bond equal to 5% of the normal
construction cost of such extension, including service connections,
which shall be in effect for the period of conditional acceptance.
C. The Commissioner of Public Works reserves the right to waive or amend
the standards for acceptance, to reduce or increase the period of
conditional acceptance and to waive the bonding requirement.
§ 231-50 SARATOGA SPRINGS CODE § 231-53
C:782
A. All water and sewage dispensed through the City water and sewer
system shall be classified under one of the following categories:
ordinary usage, special permit or outside of service area. The
determination of the category shall be made by the Utilities Department
at the time of the issuance of the permit. [Amended 3-15-1982;
4-4-1994 by L.L. No. 1-1994]
B. All bills for water and sewer rates and services, based on the water and
sewer rate schedules in effect at that time, will be mailed to the owners
of the real property served, and the owners shall be liable for the same.
Payment shall be made directly to the Department of Finance. The
payment of a bill and penalties for nonpayment shall be as specified in
the City Charter, Title IX, § C81, and Title X, § C91. The charges for
water and sewer rates shall be set in accordance with the rates
established by the City Council and in accordance with the laws of the
State of New York and the provisions in the City Charter. [Amended
3-15-1982]
C. In the event that the owner questions the accuracy of his water meter,
such will be tested in his presence upon his request.
D. All meters are to be safely tied with wire and sealed at the register and
case connections. Seals shall not be broken without permission from
the Utilities Department. [Amended 4-4-1994 by L.L. No. 1-1994]
E. All accounts shall be metered before supplying any part of the property
being served. Where, for any reason, the user is not metered, he will be
billed as noted in the rate schedule for water use as estimated by the
Utilities Department. In addition, a penalty will be assessed as noted in
the rate schedule. For the intent of this article, a dead meter shall be
the same as if there were no meter at that location. [Amended
4-4-1994 by L.L. No. 1-1994]
F. Each dwelling house, trailer or building shall have a separate meter,
and under no circumstances shall one property be serviced through
another of unrelated occupancy.
G. Where leaks occur on private property upstream of the point where the
quantity of flow is metered, the Utilities Department may estimate the
total amount of water which has been expended through the leak
beginning from the time the user has been notified of the leak to the
time when such leak has been stopped. Such volume of water shall be
classified as special use and will be included in the subsequent bill.
[Amended 4-4-1994 by L.L. No. 1-1994]
H. It shall be the responsibility of the property owner to provide a place for
the City to install the water meter or meters. Such place or places shall
be in a location that is easy of access and in accordance with the
requirements as prescribed by the Utilities Department. The place
provided shall be heated at all times to prevent the meter from freezing.
No unauthorized person shall in any way damage, disfigure or interfere
§ 231-53 CHARTER § 231-53
C:783
§ 231-54. Change of ownership of building or property. [Amended
4-4-1994 by L.L. No. 1-1994]
§ 231-55. Discontinuance of service. [Amended 3-15-1982]
with any water meter. The only authorized persons referred to herein
are those that are authorized by the Utilities Department. In the event
that any meter is damaged because of a freeze-up or because of some
interference to the water meter or by an unauthorized person as
referred to herein, then the property owner and/or the user shall be
responsible for any and all repairs, costs, damages and replacements
occurred as a result of the same. Not only shall the owner and/or
the user be personally responsible for this cost, but the same may
become a lien upon the property serviced by the meter and foreclosed
in the manner provided for unpaid water charges. [Added 3-15-1982;
amended 4-4-1994 by L.L. No. 1-1994]
A. When a building or property, or part thereof, serviced by a City water
meter undergoes a change of ownership, a request may be made by the
seller or by an representative of a seller for a current reading of the
meter. The person making such request to the Utilities Department
shall be responsible for providing the meter reader with access to the
water meter. Persons requesting meter reading under this subsection
shall pay a fee of $50 for each meter reading request. Persons
requesting meter readings on multiple metered accounts under this
subsection shall pay a fee of $50 for the initial meter reading requested;
additional meter readings at each building location will be charged at
$20 each. Said fee(s) shall be a charge on the next water bill for the
property on which the meter is located. [Amended 6-21-2005]
B. In the case of abandonment of the property, the Utilities Department
may continue to serve water to the property and to bill for the same
until it is notified, in writing, of such abandonment.
C. In the case where the property is to be razed, the property owner or his
agent shall notify the Utilities Department so that the service line may
be disconnected from the City main and that the meter may be read and
removed. Where such notice is not given and damage results, the
property owner shall be responsible to pay any and all such damages. It
is the responsibility of the property owner to disconnect the abandoned
service lateral at the corporation stop.
A. Water and sewer services may be discontinued after reasonable notice
is given the owner and user for any of the following reasons:
(1) For use of water other than for the purpose represented in the
application.
(2) For willful waste of water through improper or imperfect pipes.
§ 231-53 SARATOGA SPRINGS CODE § 231-55
C:784
§ 231-56. Restrictions on use of water.
§ 231-57. Equipment using City water. [Amended 4-4-1994 by L.L.
No. 1-1994]
Any equipment, such as refrigeration or air-conditioning, operated by the
user, which equipment discharges into a sewer system, shall have a freeair-
gap section at the entry into the sewage system. All such equipment,
(3) For molesting any service pipe, seal, meter, curb stop or any other
appurtenance of the water and sewer systems.
(4) For nonpayment of bills for water and sewer rates or for services or
penalties rendered by the Utilities Department. [Amended
4-4-1994 by L.L. No. 1-1994]
(5) For cross-connecting the City service pipe with any other source of
supply or with any apparatus which may endanger the quality of
the City water supply.
(6) For refusal of reasonable access to the property for the purpose of
inspecting or repairing, replacing or reading of the water meter.
(7) For violation by the user of any regulation of the New York State
Health Department and of the unified codes of the City.
B. Where two or more consumers are now supplied with water and sewer
through one service connection under the control of one corporation
stop, if any of the parties so supplied shall violate any of the rules of this
article, the City reserves the right to shut off the joint service line,
except that such action shall not be taken until the innocent consumer
who is not in violation of the City rules has been given a reasonable
opportunity to attach his pipe to a separately controlled service
connection. Such connection is to be made at the owner's expense.
C. In cases where, in the opinion of the Utilities Department, the public
safety is endangered because water and sewage is leaking through a
faulty connection and the leak lies on private property, the Utilities
Department shall inform the user and owner and request the owner to
repair or replace the faulty connection and thereupon shall shut off the
water to this user. [Amended 4-4-1994 by L.L. No. 1-1994]
A. The Utilities Department reserves the right to restrict or to stop any
and all uses of water outside of the building to which the service is
connected. Such uses include the sprinkling of lawns; the washing of
automobiles, houses or walks; or any other use deemed by the Utilities
Department to be within the intent of the section. [Amended 4-4-1994
by L.L. No. 1-1994]
B. The City shall give notice of such restricted water use in the official
newspaper of the City at least one day prior to the enforcement of this

4-4-1994 by L.L. No. 1-1994]
§ 231-60. Excavations. [Amended 4-4-1994 by L.L. No. 1-1994]
No excavation on a City right-of-way and/or on City property shall be
made without first obtaining all necessary permits. Furthermore, proper
consideration of surrounding conditions and due regard for safety of the
public shall be maintained at all times. Where practical, excavations shall be
backfilled at the end of each working day; however, at the discretion of the
Utilities Department and where the magnitude of the work prevents such
backfilling, excavations shall be guarded and lighted in a manner detailed
by the Utilities Department. While open, all excavations shall be clearly
A. No person shall excavate within a public right-of-way with the purpose
to connect a water service to the City water system without first

such cover is not possible. Where the service line must cross an existing
sewer, it must pass at least 18 inches above the sewer, and the sewer
must be encased in concrete with at least six inches of cover on all sides
for a distance of three feet on either side of the service line. The
Utilities Department reserves the right to effect more stringent sanitary
precautions where it deems necessary or where the connection is made
to a place of public use.

and no person is to tamper with or touch the corporation stop in any
manner.

present a PUD application to the City Council, the Council shall vote on the Petition
within ninety (90) days after it is filed with the Secretary of the City Council.

then refer the complete application to the Planning Board for review and
recommendation.

refer the application to the Planning Board and no further action on the
application shall be taken.

v1.0 3.0: Overlay Zoning Districts  Page 1
3.0 OVERLAY ZONING DISTRICTS
This Article establishes a series of overlay districts where certain uses and
requirements exist in addition to those otherwise within the underlying zoning district.
3.1 TRANSECT ZONE DESIGN
3.1.1 INTENT AND APPLICABILITY
In addition to, and not in limitation of, other requirements of this Chapter, this Section
provides guidance on streetscape, site and architectural design elements to fulfill the
intent of the mixed-use, form-based Transect Zones.
In contrast to traditional zoning districts that regulate one use from another, Transect
Zones are designed to be more flexible with a focus on sound architectural and site
design elements to encourage creative and sustainable new and in-fill development.
The intent of the Transect Zones is to encourage a diversity of complementary uses,
promote successful urban form, extend traditional circulation systems with
interconnecting streets, reinforce a strong pedestrian emphasis, and provide for civic
space.
In case of any conflict between the provisions of this Section and other sections of the
Ordinance, this Section shall control.
3.1.2 ALL TRANSECT ZONES
A. URBAN FORM
1. Street networks should create blocks with a maximum perimeter of 1,200 feet in
the T-6 Zone and 1,400 feet in the T-4 and T-5 Zones. Limiting a maximum of
one curb cut per block face is strongly encouraged. These block perimeters may
be exceeded to accommodate an internal parking lot or structure that is screened
from public view along all street frontages.
2. All streets should connect to other streets to form a circulation network. Cul-desacs
may be allowed only when there is no acceptable alternative due to site
conditions such as waterways, wetlands, or steep slopes.
3. Shallow build-to-line and minimum frontage build-out requirements are intended
to support pedestrian-friendly streets.
4. All lots should have street frontage. Lots served by an alley may also have
frontage on a passage.
5. Building façades within a streetscape should align with adjacent buildings within
the required build-to area of the property. Buildings should be compatible with
neighboring buildings and general site context.
6. Development plans containing 20,000 square feet or more of residential space
should provide for civic space.
B. STREETSCAPE DESIGN
1. Streetscape elements should include on-street parking, curbs, street trees,
sidewalks and streetlights.
2. Street trees should be spaced on average 40 feet on center, depending on site
conditions. At the time of planting, street trees should measure 15 to 20 feet tall,
have a minimum caliper of four inches measured at a point 12 inches above the
CITY OF SARATOGA SPRINGS ZONING ORDINANCE
v1.0 3.0: Overlay Zoning Districts  Page 2
root ball, and have a minimum branching height of eight feet.
3. Historic or Decorative streetlights, as detailed in The City of Saratoga Springs
Standard Construction Details, should be provided along all frontages and in offstreet
parking areas. Streetlight spacing should be 75 to 100 feet on center,
depending on site conditions.
C. ACCESS AND PARKING CONSIDERATIONS
1. Shared parking or the use of public parking lots is encouraged.
2. On-street parking along the adjacent frontage may be counted toward any
parking requirements.
3. Surface parking areas should be screened by a suitable streetwall or continuous
hedge between 3.5 and 4.5 feet in height and located at the middle or rear of a
property. Streetwall materials should be compatible with the adjacent building
façade. Openings in such streetwalls and hedges should be no larger than
necessary to allow automobile and pedestrian access.
4. Vehicle access to parking and service areas should be from an alley wherever
feasible. Corner lots with alley access should only access parking through the
alley. The Planning Board may require granting of cross access easements or
dedication of right-of-way to assure appropriate block size and alley access to
future development sites.
5. Off-street loading, service or storage areas should be located behind buildings or
parking structures, enclosed within the principal building envelope, or screened
from view from the street right-of-way. Screening or landscaping should be
compatible with adjacent structures and existing building materials.
6. Overhead garage doors should not be located on the front of buildings, but
should face the side or rear of the property. If placement at the property front is
unavoidable, such doors should be positioned at least 20 feet behind the plane of
the principal building façade, and should not exceed 2 cars per garage, or 10 feet
per garage space in width.
7. Where otherwise not required, the provision of bicycle parking shall be
considered.
D. PARKING STRUCTURES
1. Parking structures should be set back a minimum of 50 feet from the property
lines of all adjacent streets to reserve room for liner buildings. If no liner building
is constructed in conjunction with construction of the parking structure, the yard
should provide publicly accessible civic space.
2. Parking structures without liner buildings should have a façade complementary
with adjacent buildings. Façade openings should not exceed 60% of these
façades.
3. The first level of all parking structures should be visually screened from the street
right-of-way.
4. Parking structures should provide retail uses at grade if located in a mandatory
retail frontage area designated in 3.1.4.A.1 or 3.1.5.A.2
CITY OF SARATOGA SPRINGS ZONING ORDINANCE
v1.0 3.0: Overlay Zoning Districts  Page 3
E. ARCHITECTURAL DESIGN - ROOFS
1. Roof forms may include a symmetrical pitched roof or a flat roof with a cornice.
Slopes of pitched roofs should be not less than 5:12, except that porch roofs may
be sheds with pitches not less than 3:12. All gables should be parallel or
perpendicular to the street.
2. Recommended roof materials include black or single tone asphalt shingles,
standing seam roof or natural slate. Imitation slate and wood shingles should be
avoided. Parapet caps may be stone, concrete, or limestone.
3. Rooftop mechanical systems may exceed the maximum building height provided
they do not exceed 25% in aggregate coverage of the roof area and are
adequately screened and set back from the building facade.
F. ARCHITECTURAL DESIGN- FACADES
1. The scale and proportion of building facades, design and materials used in new
construction should complement that used in neighboring buildings.
2. Buildings situated at corners should wrap the corner by continuing façade
elements such as the cornice or other horizontal features on all street elevations.
3. Main building entrances should face the street, and should be easily identifiable
and scaled to the size of the street they front.
4. New facades should include base, middle and top levels and coordinate the
relative height of these façade elements (datum lines) with those of adjacent
and nearby buildings.
5. Recommended façade materials include common red brick (bare or painted),
special masonry units (textured, colored, or painted), natural stone, or wood
clapboard. The following should be avoided: beige, multi-tone, or imitation brick
siding; bare masonry units; metal, asphalt or vinyl siding; and imitation stone or
exterior insulation finish systems (E.I.F.S.).
6. Recommended trim materials include finish grade, painted, or stained wood.
Bare lumber grade wood or plywood should be avoided.
G. ARCHITECTURAL DESIGN-WINDOWS, DOORS, PORCHES, BALCONIES
1. The rhythm and proportions of architectural openings should complement that of
adjacent buildings, and concentrate windows and openings at the street level.
Facade design should incorporate a primary material and an easily recognizable
pattern (with sub-patterns or subtle variations for larger scale buildings). Breaks
or fluctuations in pattern or materials may be used to draw attention to entrances
or special façade elements.
2. All architectural openings, including windows, doorways, arches and porch
framing, should be constructed with their height equal to or greater than their
width and framed by appropriately-scaled lintel or arch at the top and sill at the
bottom.
3. Balconies and porches visible from the street right-of-way should be built of
wood, metal, or concrete. Pressure-treated lumber may be utilized for concealed
structural members, and structures not visible from the street right-of-way. All
exposed surfaces visible from the street right-of-way, including floor decks, stairs,
railings, columns, brackets and any other structural and/or decorative roof
CITY OF SARATOGA SPRINGS ZONING ORDINANCE
v1.0 3.0: Overlay Zoning Districts  Page 4
support members, should be built with paint grade finish lumber or metal and
painted in appropriate colors. Porch stairs should have solid risers and sides
enclosed with either solid wood construction or open lattice panels with maximum
openings of 4 square inches.
4. Recommended window materials include anodized aluminum or vinyl clad frame
(black, brown or approved color) or painted or stained wood. Recommended
lintel and sill materials include brick, stone, wood or colored concrete. Bare
aluminum frames should be avoided. Clear, frosted or stained glass is
recommended; tinted or mirrored glass should be avoided.
5. Window shutters, if used, should be used throughout the façade and should be
proportioned to cover the window opening when closed.
6. Sliding doors and windows should be discouraged along primary facades except
to access porches serving residential or lodging uses on the second or higher
story.
7. Canvas awnings incorporating a maximum of three approved colors may be
used. Plastic awnings should be avoided.
H. SITE DETAILS
1. Front yard fences should not exceed 42 inches in height.
2. Recommended hard surface materials include brick, paving stone, porous
pavement, and patterned concrete. Asphalt use should be limited to parking and
loading areas.
3.1.3 TRANSECT-4 URBAN NEIGHBORHOOD
A. URBAN FORM
Transect-4 Urban neighborhoods are intended primarily for the development of new
residential areas incorporating a mix of residential unit types within a block grid typical
of existing urban areas in Saratoga Springs.
1. Residential lots should be served by alleys to preserve the pedestrian character
of the streets. Neighborhoods should relate to nearby natural areas and
neighborhood centers.
2. Although predominantly residential in character, small-scale commercial uses,
office, eating and drinking, service, and retail are allowed in appropriate
locations. Such uses with upper floor residential use are most appropriate at
intersections.
3. Buildings should consist of primarily detached and side-yard building types, and
are required to have a minimum of 2 stories.
CITY OF SARATOGA SPRINGS ZONING ORDINANCE
v1.0 3.0: Overlay Zoning Districts  Page 5
T-4 Urban Neighborhoods have a primarily residential character with both
attached and detached low-rise buildings.
B. SITE DESIGN
1. Visual buffers should be provided in the following areas to protect existing
residential areas:
a. Along the south side of Route 50 from the Excelsior Avenue turn around to
I-87,
b. Along I-87, and
c. Along the east boundary of the T-4 zone east of Weibel Avenue and
adjacent to existing residential areas.
C. ARCHITECTURAL DESIGN
1. Open porches, stoops, balconies, awnings and bay windows may encroach up to
50% of the depth of any setback.
CITY OF SARATOGA SPRINGS ZONING ORDINANCE
v1.0 3.0: Overlay Zoning Districts  Page 6
3.1.4 TRANSECT-5 NEIGHBORHOOD CENTER
A. URBAN FORM
Transect-5 Neighborhood Centers are intended to accommodate a variety and mixture
of residential and non-residential uses, building types, and lot sizes. Neighborhood
centers must incorporate residential use, create a public realm conducive to pedestrian
activity, and provide linkages to adjacent neighborhoods. Neighborhood centers may
vary, however, in the balance of neighborhood- and regional-scale non-residential uses
based on their proximity to residential areas and major thoroughfares. Civic uses and
spaces are also important elements of neighborhood centers.
1. Ground floor non-residential uses such as eating and drinking, retail, service, and
offices with walk-in clientele, are required along the following key frontages:
? Excelsior Avenue from Warren Street to Marion Avenue
? East Avenue within 250 feet of the centerline of Excelsior Avenue
? Lincoln Avenue from Hamilton Street to Whitney Place
? South Broadway within 300 feet of the centerline of Lincoln Avenue
? Washington Street within 250 feet of the centerline of West Avenue
? West Avenue within 350 feet of the centerline of Washington Street
? Weibel Avenue 950 to 1,300 feet south of the centerline of Louden Road
CITY OF SARATOGA SPRINGS ZONING ORDINANCE
v1.0 3.0: Overlay Zoning Districts  Page 7
2. Block or lot interior may provide parking or civic and private open space.
Neighborhood Centers (T-5) have a wide mix of uses, building types, and frontage
types and corresponding reliance on a consistent streetscape and quality civic
spaces to enhance the pedestrian character of the center.
B. ARCHITECTURAL DESIGN
1. The first floors of buildings for residential use should be raised above sidewalk
grade a minimum of 2 feet.
3.1.5 TRANSECT-6 URBAN CORE
A. URBAN FORM
The Transect-6 Urban Core is the densest business, cultural and entertainment
concentration within the City. The purpose of this district is to regulate site and
architectural design and promote the creation of a consistently high quality pedestrianoriented
public realm in character with the historic forms, materials and colors of
Downtown Saratoga Springs without unduly restricting re-use of historic structures or
architectural diversity.
1. Retail, eating and drinking, office, residential, and civic uses should be integrated
at the building, lot and block level.
2. First floor uses including eating and drinking, retail, service, civic space, and
CITY OF SARATOGA SPRINGS ZONING ORDINANCE
v1.0 3.0: Overlay Zoning Districts  Page 8
offices with walk-in clientele is required on Broadway from Church Street to Phila
Street.
3. 2- to 7-story buildings are permitted, as appropriate to site context.
T-6 Urban Center consists of the downtown area of the City with
shallow build-to-lines, smaller blocks, and the widest range of
building scale. Interior-block, shared public and private parking,
accessed by alleys, is also a defining feature.
B. STREETSCAPE DESIGN
1. In addition to streetscape elements common to all Transect Zones, the Urban
Core streetscape should include pedestrian amenities such as benches, trash
cans, and informational kiosks.
C. ARCHITECTURAL DESIGN
1. Flat roof and parapet construction is preferred; sloping roof structures should use
dormers and gables to give the façade more visual character. Sloping roofs shall
ensure the fall of snow, ice or rain does not create a hazard for pedestrians.
2. Building materials and colors should be historically appropriate.
CITY OF SARATOGA SPRINGS ZONING ORDINANCE
v1.0 3.0: Overlay Zoning Districts  Page 9
3.2 GATEWAY DESIGN DISTRICT 1: ROUTE 50, ROUTE 9
3.2.1 INTENT
The intent of the Gateway Design District-1 is to establish a series of site and
construction standards and guidelines to encourage appropriate development while
preserving and maintaining a rural Country character in this gateway area to
complement the natural conditions of the neighboring Saratoga Spa State Park. These
site and construction provisions shall guide the location and character of site
development, buildings, roads, parking, signage, and vegetation.
3.2.2 DISTRICT LOCATION
The Gateway Design District-1 includes designated parcels along southern Ballston
Avenue (NYS Route 50), and along South Broadway (NYS Route 9), a map of which
can be found at: www.saratoga-springs.org. This Gateway Design District-1 is
comprised of two sub-zones as follows:
A. ZONE A
Zone A recognizes the prevalent commercial nature of this area and is intended to
encourage similar uses in a more intensive, clustered manner.
B. ZONE B
Zone B also encompasses commercial areas but is intended to encourage low-density
development with an emphasis on rural character.
These standards and guidelines are to be used during the subdivision, site plan,
building permit and architectural review approval process.
3.2.3 APPLICABILITY
A. These Gateway Design District-1 provisions include recommended design
guidelines that may be waived if circumstances warrant and provided the intent of this
Section is achieved, as well as mandatory standards as noted in this Section.
B. Graphics, where provided, are for illustrative purposes and do not represent the
only way to meet the intent of the standards and guidelines in this Section.
3.2.4 LANDFORM
All Development within Gateway Design District-1 should be sympathetic to and reflect
the sites natural land form using complementary design characteristics.
A. Building location, type, and mass shall reinforce the sites natural landform. Uses
with large footprints are appropriate to sites with flat or gently sloping landform; uses
with smaller footprints can better fit rolling landforms.
B. The location of building and site elements should minimize reshaping of natural
contours. Large-scale cut and fill of terrain should be avoided to minimize clearing and
disturbance to the existing landform.
CITY OF SARATOGA SPRINGS ZONING ORDINANCE
v1.0 3.0: Overlay Zoning Districts  Page 10
1. In Zone A, a more traditionally commercial land use pattern is permitted.
Changes in grade with structured, straight edge cut and fill slopes and/or
retaining walls may be allowed to facilitate the clustering of uses and structures.
2. In Zone B, land use patterns should reflect a more rural character and the
creation of geometric landforms should be avoided. In Zone B, cut and fill slopes
should be graded to mimic existing slopes and blend smoothly into the
surrounding landform. Rural cut/fill slopes should be a maximum of 1:5 and
gradually blend into surrounding slopes.
3.2.5 VEHICLE/PEDESTRIAN CIRCULATION AND PARKING
A. Alignment
1. Within Zone A, more rigid, angular circulation systems are recommended to
increase density, land use efficiency, and enhance the contrast between the
character of the commercial node and its surrounding land.
2. Rural circulation systems are inherently curvilinear and historically follow the line
of least topographic resistance such as valleys and stream corridors. Therefore,
in Zone B, circulation systems should be curvilinear to reflect the natural
landform.

contains summaries of impact studies from the cities of Islip, New York; Los
Angeles, CA; Indianapolis, IN; Whittier, CA; Austin, TX; Phoenix, Arizona;
Manatee County, Florida; New Hanover County, North Carolina and the State of
Minnesota; and

under certain circumstances and in close proximity of one another, thereby having a
deleterious effect upon the adjacent area. Special regulations of such uses is necessary
to insure that these adverse effects will not contribute to the blighting or downgrading of

thereof, in which any violation of this Section is committed or continued shall constitute
a separate offense. In addition to these penalties, the City may institute any appropriate
action or proceedings to enjoin the establishment or continuance of such use in violation
of the provisions hereof, or take such other legal or administrative action deemed
necessary or desirable to correct or abate such violation.

of land, for this purpose. Such a finding shall include an evaluation of the present and
anticipated future need for park and recreational facilities based on projected population
growth to which the particular site plan will contribute.
A. Class A Type Usable Land
1. Class A Type usable land refers to developable land generally devoid of
wetlands, drainage courses, steep slopes, and the like. The owner shall offer to
the City Class A Type Usable Land equal in size to at least 10% of the subject
parcel(s) for use as parkland. The Planning Board may specify which lands
within the site plan shall be dedicated for parkland and may seek
recommendations from the City Recreation Commission on such offers. The
CITY OF SARATOGA SPRINGS ZONING ORDINANCE
v1 .0 7.0: Permits and Approvals Page 14
Board may require that the owner suitably grade the offered land.
2. Class B Type Usable Land
Class B Type usable land refers to land not suitable generally for development
except for passive open space. Unique and scenic areas and those areas
bordering streams, lakes or other watercourses may be given special
consideration by the Planning Board and, should they be deemed essential or
desirable for public open spaces, the Board may instead request that the owner
offer Class B Type Usable Land to the City to be defined and preserved as
passive open space.
B. Payment of fee in lieu of Usable Land
In the event the authorized board makes a finding that the proposed site plan presents a
proper case for requiring a park or parks suitably located for playgrounds or other
recreational purposes, but that a suitable park or parks of adequate size to meet the
requirement cannot be properly located on such site plan, the authorized board may
require a sum of money in lieu thereof to be established by the legislative body. The fee
shall be required for each new residential unit created by the site plan and shall be used
by the City exclusively for neighborhood park, playground or recreation purposes
including the acquisition and improvement of property.
C. Combination of land and in lieu of fee
If the Planning Board determines that only a portion of the 10% area offered by the
owner is acceptable for public use, then the owner shall dedicate the acceptable land
and pay a fee equal to the difference in the percentage of land offered and the 10%
required.
D. Prior land set aside for subdivision
If the land included in a site plan is a portion of a previously approved subdivision, the
Planning Board shall credit the applicant for any land set aside or money donated in lieu
thereof under such subdivision plat approval. In the event of re-subdivision of such plat,
nothing shall preclude the additional reservation of parkland or money donated in lieu
thereof.

7.4.6 HISTORIC REVIEW STANDARDS
In pursuit of this Articles objectives, the Design Review Commission shall employ the
following standards:
A. Preserve rather than remove
Distinguishing original features of a structure or site are essential to the historic quality
and character of that site. Distinguishing original qualities or character of a structure,
site and/or its environment shall be preserved and protected to the maximum extent
possible. Destruction or alteration of any historic material or distinctive architectural
feature should be avoided.
B. Repair rather than replace
Distinctive architectural features that characterize a structure or site shall be repaired
rather than replaced whenever possible. If replacement is necessary, the replacement
materials should match the original in composition, design, color, texture and other
visual qualities.
C. Promote historical accuracy
Repair or replacement of architectural features should be based on historical evidence
rather than on conjectural designs or the incorporation of elements from other
structures.
D. Recognize the significance of historical time periods
Structures and sites should be recognized and preserved as products of specific
historical period(s). Changes that occurred over time are evidence of the history and
development of a structure or site and may have acquired historical significance in their
own right.
E. Compatible contemporary design may be encouraged
CITY OF SARATOGA SPRINGS ZONING ORDINANCE
v1.0 7.0: Permits and Approvals
Page 22
Contemporary design for alterations and additions to existing properties may be
encouraged provided it does not destroy significant historical, architectural, or cultural
material and is compatible with the size, scale, color, material, and character of the site
or surrounding neighborhood. Incompatible alterations shall be discouraged.
F. Structures and sites are to be treated with sensitivity
Archaeological resources affected by any project shall be protected and preserved to
the maximum extent possible. Activities that will damage historic building materials or
site features shall be discouraged. Historic structures are to be cleaned with the gentlest
means possible.

7.4.9 DESIGN CONSIDERATIONS
For actions subject to review, the Commission shall evaluate whether the proposed
alteration or construction is compatible with the subject structure, site and neighboring
properties in the Historic District with regard to:
A. Height
The Commission shall consider whether the height of the proposed structure is
compatible with the historic form and context of the site and neighboring properties and
with any specific zoning district intent.
B. Scale
The Commission shall consider whether the scale of the proposed structure is
compatible with the relationship of the building and its architectural elements to
neighboring structures, and character of historic setting.
C. Mass and Open Space
The Commission shall consider whether the relationship of the dimension and mass of a
building to the open space between it and adjoining buildings is compatible with the
character of the neighboring area and with any specific zoning district intent.
D. Proportion
The Commission shall consider whether the proposed structure and its architectural
elements, including front façades, windows, doors and bays, are consistent with the
dominant proportion of neighboring structures and site.
E. Directional Expression
The Commission shall consider whether the directional expression of a building and its
architectural elements are compatible with the dominant horizontal or vertical
expression of the neighboring buildings.
F. Architectural Rhythm
The Commission shall consider whether the architectural, rhythmic pattern resulting
from repeated elements such as window and door openings, columns, arches, and
CITY OF SARATOGA SPRINGS ZONING ORDINANCE
v1.0 7.0: Permits and Approvals
Page 24
other facade elements is consistent within the subject structure and consistent with
neighboring structures.
G. Front Setback
The front yard setback for the building line of all new construction shall be compatible
with neighboring buildings and any specific zoning district intent.
H. New Construction and Additions
New construction and additions should be undertaken such that their removal will not
impair the original historic form and integrity of the structure and site.
I. Treatment of Major Building Elements
1. Doors. Existing historic doors and door openings shall be retained and
rehabilitated whenever possible. Restoration of historic openings is encouraged
where previously altered. Where doorways must be altered to meet current
building code and safety requirements, doors and entrance ways shall be
designed to respect the exterior architectural character of the building.
2. Windows. Existing historic windows and window openings shall be retained and
rehabilitated whenever possible. Restoration of historic openings is encouraged
where previously altered.
3. Roofs. Features that give a roof its essential historic and architectural character
shall be retained and rehabilitated whenever possible. Roof designs for new
structures shall be compatible with neighboring buildings. Exterior mechanical
equipment shall be minimized and screened from view.
J. Materials
Materials used in new construction shall be compatible with those traditionally used in
the neighboring area. Contemporary materials are acceptable provided that the overall
texture, color and details of the building are compatible with neighboring buildings.
K. Colors
Architectural features of historic buildings shall be restored with colors and finishes
appropriate to the nature of the materials and to the historic character of the building.
Where historically documented colors are not used, colors shall be appropriate to the
building's predominant architectural style(s). Colors used in new construction shall be
compatible with neighboring buildings.
7.4.10 MAINTENANCE AND REPAIR
No owner or person with an interest in real property designated as a City Landmark or
included within a Historic District shall permit the property to fall into a serious state of
disrepair so as to result in the deterioration of any exterior architectural feature which
would, in the judgment of the Commission, produce a detrimental effect upon the
character of the Historic District as a whole or the life and character of the property
itself. Examples of such deterioration include:
1. Deterioration of exterior walls or other vertical supports
2. Deterioration of roofs or other horizontal members

to the claim that demolition is necessary for the public safety
7.4.11 DEMOLITION
The Commission shall determine whether the proposed structure has architectural or
historic significance. Significance includes having particular important associations
within the context of the architecture, history or culture of Saratoga Springs or region
and may include listing as contributing on the State and National Registers of Historic
Places.
A. Structures with no architectural or historic significance
The Commission may approve an application for demolition if it finds that the demolition
is consistent with the intent and objectives of this Article and that the structure proposed
to be demolished has no historic or architectural significance.
B. Structures with architectural or historic significance
For the proposed demolition of a structure with architectural or historical significance,
the applicant must demonstrate good cause as to why such structure cannot be
preserved.
1. The applicant shall document good faith efforts in seeking an alternative that
will result in the preservation of the structure including consultation with the
Commission and the Saratoga Springs Preservation Foundation. The relocation
of structures may be permitted as an alternative to demolition;
2. The applicant shall document efforts to find a purchaser interested in acquiring
and preserving the structure;
3. The applicant shall demonstrate that the structure cannot be adapted for any
other permitted use, whether by the current owner or by a purchaser, which
would result in a reasonable return; and
4. The applicant shall submit evidence that the property is not capable of earning a
reasonable return regardless of whether that return represents the most
profitable return possible. "Dollars and cents proof" shall be required to
demonstrate such hardship.
5. Application for demolition of a structure with historic or architectural significance
shall include acceptable post-demolition plans for the site. Such plans shall
include an acceptable timetable and guarantees which may include performance
bonds/letters of credit for demolition and completion of the project. The
Commission may condition the issuance of a demolition approval on the
applicants receipt of all other necessary approvals and permits for the postdemolition
plan.

occurred.
C. Determination of Jeopardy to Health, Safety and Welfare of Community
In cases where an applicant has sought demolition approval on the basis that a
structure represents an imminent danger to the health, safety and welfare of the
community, the Commission shall refer the application to the Building Inspector for
review and report pursuant to City Code Section 118 Unsafe Structures. The Building
Inspector's report shall be advisory to the Commission. The Commission shall review
the Building Inspector's report and make a determination that the structure can or
cannot reasonably be repaired in such a way as to remove the imminent danger.
D. Demolition of Historic Structures by City
The City, through its Code Enforcement Officers or other appropriate municipal officials,
may seek demolition of a structure listed individually or as a contributing structure in an
historic district on the National Register of Historic Places in New York Supreme Court
under N.Y. Executive Law 382. Prior to filing such an application, the matter shall be
referred to the Commission for an advisory opinion as to whether the structure can or
cannot be reasonably repaired in such a way as to remove the cause for demolition.
The Commission shall have 30 days to render a written advisory opinion unless
extended by mutual consent. The City may also seek advisory recommendations from

3. Preliminary approval
Prior to the granting of final approval by the Commission, an applicant may seek
preliminary approval for the general mass and scale of a proposed structure.
This preliminary approval is subject to a SEQRA determination and constitutes
approval of the footprint and proportions of the proposed structure, including any
proposed rooftop structures, and its compatibility with the surrounding
neighborhood. Such preliminary approval does not constitute approval of
elevations and other façade and roofline details. Unless so noted within the
preliminary approval, an applicant must obtain final approval by the Commission
prior to issuance of a building permit.
4. Disapprove
The Commission may disapprove an application provided the Commission finds
that such construction, alteration or demolition would be in opposition to the
intent and objectives of this Article, and that this finding is not based on personal

7.5 ARCHITECTURAL REVIEW
7.5.1 INTENT
The City finds that appropriate architectural design and the consistent quality of building
exteriors directly contribute to the positive value of real property, the enhancement of
community character, and the health, safety and general welfare of the Citys residents.
Therefore, the intent of this Article is to provide architectural standards for the
construction, maintenance and enhancement of structures within designated areas of
the City as identified in Section 7.5.12.
7.5.2 DELEGATION TO DESIGN REVIEW COMMISSION
The Design Review Commission is hereby charged with the responsibilities of
administering and carrying out the intent, process and actions established in this Article
and Article 7.4 Historic Review.
7.5.3 ACTIONS SUBJECT TO REVIEW
The following actions shall be subject to architectural review by the Commission when
occurring within designated areas of the City as identified in this Article:
A. Construction, renovation, alteration or exterior change to a structure that requires
the issuance of a building or demolition permit.
B. Installation of an awning, sign or sign structure that requires a building or sign
permit, or such modification with respect to size, materials, illumination, method of
attachment and color.
C. Change of the exterior color of any structure within a non-residential Zoning
District.
D. Installation of telecommunications facilities per Article 6.3.2.
7.5.4 ACTIONS EXEMPT FROM REVIEW
The following actions are exempt from architectural review:
1. Ordinary maintenance or repair of any exterior feature that does not involve a
change in design, material, or outer appearance.
2. Any action having received historic review approval.
7.5.5 DESIGN CONSIDERATIONS
For actions subject to review, the Commission shall evaluate whether the proposed
alteration or construction is compatible with the subject structure, site and neighboring
properties in the architectural review district with regard to:
A. Height
The Commission shall consider whether the height of the proposed structure is
compatible with the historic form and context of the site and neighboring properties and
with any specific zoning district intent.
CITY OF SARATOGA SPRINGS ZONING ORDINANCE
v1.0 7.0: Permits and Approvals
Page 38
B. Scale
The Commission shall consider whether the scale of the proposed structure is
compatible with the relationship of the building and its architectural elements to
neighboring structures and community character.
C. Mass and Open Space
The Commission shall consider whether the relationship of the dimension and mass of a
building to the open space between it and adjoining buildings is compatible with the
character of the neighboring area and with any specific zoning district intent.
D. Proportion
The Commission shall consider whether the proposed structure and its architectural
elements, including front façades, windows, doors and bays, are consistent with the
dominant proportion of neighboring structures and site.
E. Directional Expression
The Commission shall consider whether the directional expression of a building and its
architectural elements are compatible with the dominant horizontal or vertical
expression of the neighboring buildings.
F. Architectural Rhythm
The Commission shall consider whether the architectural, rhythmic pattern resulting
from repeated elements such as window and door openings, columns, arches, and
other facade elements is consistent within the subject structure and consistent with
neighboring structures.
G. Front Setback
The front yard setback for the building line of all new construction shall be compatible
with neighboring buildings and any specific zoning district intent.
H. New Construction and Additions
New construction and additions should be undertaken such that their removal will not
impair the original historic form and integrity of the structure and site.
I. Treatment of Major Building Elements
1. Doors. Existing historic doors and door openings shall be retained and
rehabilitated whenever possible. Restoration of historic openings is encouraged
where previously altered. Where doorways must be altered to meet current
building code and safety requirements, doors and entrance ways shall be
designed to respect the exterior architectural character of the building.
2. Windows. Existing historic windows and window openings shall be retained and
rehabilitated whenever possible. Restoration of historic openings is encouraged
where previously altered.
3. Roofs. Features that give a roof its essential historic and architectural character
shall be retained and rehabilitated whenever possible. Roof designs for new
CITY OF SARATOGA SPRINGS ZONING ORDINANCE
v1.0 7.0: Permits and Approvals
Page 39
structures shall be compatible with neighboring buildings. Exterior mechanical
equipment shall be minimized and screened from view.
J. Materials
Materials used in new construction shall be compatible with those traditionally used in
the neighboring area. Contemporary materials are acceptable provided that the overall
texture, color and details of the building are compatible with neighboring buildings.
K. Colors
Colors used in new construction shall be compatible with neighboring buildings.
Architectural features of historic buildings shall be restored with colors and finishes
appropriate to the nature of the materials and to the historic character of the building.
Where historically documented colors are not used, colors shall be appropriate to the
building's predominant architectural style(s).
7.5.6 DEMOLITION
The Commission shall determine whether the proposed structure has architectural or
historic significance. Significance includes having particular important associations
within the context of the architecture, history or culture of Saratoga Springs or region
and may include listing as contributing on the State and National Registers of Historic
Places.
A. Structures with no architectural or historic significance
The Commission may approve an application for demolition if it finds that the demolition
is consistent with the intent and objectives of this Article and that the structure proposed
to be demolished has no historic or architectural significance.
B. Structures with architectural or historic significance
For the proposed demolition of a structure with architectural or historical significance,
the applicant must demonstrate good cause as to why such structure cannot be
preserved.
1. The applicant shall document good faith efforts in seeking an alternative that
will result in the preservation of the structure including consultation with the
Commission and the Saratoga Springs Preservation Foundation. The relocation
of structures may be permitted as an alternative to demolition;
2. The applicant shall document efforts to find a purchaser interested in acquiring
and preserving the structure;
3. The applicant shall demonstrate that the structure cannot be adapted for any
other permitted use, whether by the current owner or by a purchaser, which
would result in a reasonable return; and
4. The applicant shall submit evidence that the property is not capable of earning a
reasonable return regardless of whether that return represents the most
profitable return possible. "Dollars and cents proof" shall be required to
demonstrate such hardship.
5. Application for demolition of a structure with historic or architectural significance
shall include acceptable post-demolition plans of the site. Such plans shall
CITY OF SARATOGA SPRINGS ZONING ORDINANCE
v1.0 7.0: Permits and Approvals
Page 40
include an acceptable timetable and guarantees which may include performance
bonds/letters of credit for demolition and completion of the project. The
Commission may condition the issuance of a demolition approval on the
applicants receipt of all other necessary approvals and permits for the postdemolition
plan.
6. The Commission shall schedule a public hearing on an application for demolition
of a structure with historic or architectural significance and shall provide notice as
follows.
a. Public Hearing Notice
The Commission shall advertise the hearing in a Saratoga Springs
newspaper of general circulation at least five days prior to the date
thereof. The applicant shall be responsible for payment for this notice.
Prior to the hearing, the applicant shall be responsible for filing with the
Commission an affidavit from the newspaper confirming such publication

notification notice and shall send only this notice to the identified
property owners by first class mail. This notice shall be postmarked
no less than 7 but no more than 20 calendar days prior to the
scheduled hearing.
iii. Prior to the public hearing, the applicant shall submit to the
Commission confirmation of the property owner notification by
obtaining a certificate of mailing provided by the U.S. Postal
Service.
iv. Failure to provide notice in exact conformance with these
provisions shall not invalidate a Commission determination
provided the Commission finds that substantial compliance has
occurred.
C. Determination of Jeopardy to Health, Safety and Welfare of Community
In cases where an applicant has sought demolition approval on the basis that a
structure represents an imminent danger to the health, safety and welfare of the
community, the Commission shall refer the application to the Building Inspector for
review and report pursuant to City Code Section 118 Unsafe Structures. The Building
Inspector's report shall be advisory to the Commission. The Commission shall review
the Building Inspector's report and make a determination that the structure can or
cannot reasonably be repaired in such a way as to remove the imminent danger.
D. Court action
The Commission shall have no authority to act otherwise in cases where an appropriate
legal action or procedure has resulted in a judgment or order by a Court of competent
CITY OF SARATOGA SPRINGS ZONING ORDINANCE
v1.0 7.0: Permits and Approvals
Page 41
jurisdiction that a structure endangers the health, safety and welfare of the public and
shall be demolished.
7.5.7 ARCHITECTURAL REVIEW APPLICATION
A. It shall be the duty of the Zoning Officer to refer to the Commission all actions
identified in this Article that require architectural review approval.

review.
7.5.9 ARCHITECTURAL REVIEW DECISIONS
A. In rendering its decision on any application, the Commission shall comply with all
applicable provisions of the State Environmental Quality Review Act (SEQRA) under
Article 8 of the Environmental Conservation Law and its implementing regulations.
B. Within 62 days of the determination by the Commission that the application is
complete, or the close of the public hearing, a written decision will be issued. This time
frame may be extended by mutual consent of the applicant and the Commission.
C. Four affirmative votes are required to pass a motion regarding an application
before the Commission. If four affirmative votes cannot be attained on a motion within
this 62-day period, unless extended by mutual consent of the applicant and the
Commission, the application shall be denied by default.
D. The Commission may issue any of the following decisions:
1. Approve as submitted

CITY OF SARATOGA SPRINGS ZONING ORDINANCE
v1.0 7.0: Permits and Approvals
Page 42
3. Preliminary approval
Prior to the granting of final approval by the Commission, an applicant may seek
preliminary approval for the general mass and scale of a proposed structure.
This preliminary approval is subject to a SEQRA determination and constitutes
approval of the footprint and proportions of the proposed structure, including any
proposed rooftop structures, and its compatibility with the surrounding
neighborhood. Such preliminary approval does not constitute approval of
elevations and other façade and roofline details. Unless so noted within the
preliminary approval, an applicant must obtain final approval by the Commission
prior to issuance of a building permit.
4. Disapprove
The Commission may disapprove an application provided the Commission finds
that such construction, alteration or demolition would be in opposition to the
intent and objectives of this Article, and that this finding is not based on personal
preference as to taste or choice of architectural style.
E. Every Commission decision shall be signed and dated by the Chairperson and
shall document the circumstances of the case and the findings on which the decision is
based.
F. Every Commission decision shall be filed in the Office of the City Clerk within five
business days thereof and a copy provided to the applicant and to the Building
Department.
G. Administrative Approval
The Chairperson shall have the authority to approve minor modifications to existing
Commission approvals if the Chairperson deems the changes are not material,
substantial or substantive in nature and are not contrary to the intent of the original
decision. The Chairperson shall issue all administrative approvals in writing and report
them to the Commission.
H. Building Permits, Inspections and Certificates of Occupancy
1. Upon receipt of Architectural Review approval and confirmation of compliance
with any required conditions, the Building Department may issue building, sign or
demolition permits associated with the Architectural Review application. No
building, sign or demolition permit shall be issued in the event of Architectural
Review disapproval.
2 For actions subject to Architectural Review but not requiring a building, sign or
demolition permit, the Building Department shall perform inspections as may be
necessary to confirm compliance with Commission approval and any required
conditions.
3. Upon confirmation of the completion of an approved action requiring Architectural
Review, and any required conditions, the Building Department may issue a
certificate of occupancy.

complied with any required conditions and started actual construction, or otherwise
implemented this approval. Actual construction is defined as the fastening or placing of
construction materials in a permanent manner, the excavation of a basement, or the
demolition or removal of any existing structure if no new construction is approved.

The Commission may grant up to two 18 month extensions for architectural review
approval provided that the application for extension was properly submitted prior to the
expiration date of either the original architectural review approval or the first extension.
When requesting an extension, it shall be the applicants responsibility to demonstrate
that there have been no significant changes to the site or neighborhood, and that the

v1.0 8.0: Variance and Interpretation Appeals  Page 1
8.0 VARIANCE AND INTERPRETATION APPEALS
8.1 INTENT
The intent of this Article is to provide for appeals from decisions made by an
administrative official charged with the enforcement of the Zoning Ordinance.
8.2 DELEGATION TO ZONING BOARD OF APPEALS
The Zoning Board of Appeals (ZBA) is hereby charged with the responsibilities of
administering and carrying out the intent established in Section 8.l above.
8.3 APPELLATE AUTHORITY
The jurisdiction of the ZBA shall be appellate only and shall be limited to hearing and
deciding appeals from any person aggrieved by any decision made by the
administrative official charged with the enforcement of the Zoning Ordinance.
8.3.1 AREA VARIANCE
An area variance provides relief from the dimensional or physical requirements imposed
by the applicable zoning regulations. An area variance does not authorize any change
in the type of use of the property.
A. Evaluation Criteria
In making its determination whether to grant an area variance, the ZBA shall take into
consideration the benefit to the applicant if the variance is granted, as weighed against
the detriment to the health, safety and welfare of the neighborhood or community by
such grant. In making such determination, the ZBA shall also consider:
1. Whether an undesirable change will be produced in the character of the
neighborhood or a detriment to nearby properties will be created by the granting
of the area variance;
2. Whether the benefit sought by the applicant can be achieved by some method
feasible for the applicant to pursue, other than an area variance;
3. Whether the requested area variance is substantial;
4. Whether the proposed variance will have an adverse effect or impact on the
physical or environmental conditions in the neighborhood or district; and
5. Whether the alleged difficulty was self-created, which consideration shall be
relevant to the decision of the ZBA, but shall not necessarily preclude the
granting of an area variance.
8.3.2 USE VARIANCE
A use variance provides relief to allow the use of land for a purpose that is otherwise not
allowed or is prohibited by the applicable zoning regulations.
A. Evaluation Criteria
The ZBA shall not grant a use variance unless the applicant has demonstrated that
applicable zoning regulations and restrictions have caused unnecessary hardship. In
order to prove unnecessary hardship, the applicant must demonstrate that for each and
every permitted use for the particular district where the property is located:
CITY OF SARATOGA SPRINGS ZONING ORDINANCE
v1.0 8.0: Variance and Interpretation Appeals  Page 2
1. The applicant cannot realize a reasonable return, provided that lack of return is
substantial as demonstrated by competent financial evidence;
2. The alleged hardship relating to the property in question is unique and does not
apply to a substantial portion of the district or neighborhood;
3. The requested use variance, if granted, will not alter the essential character of
the neighborhood;
4. The alleged hardship has not been self-created.
8.3.3 MINIMUM VARIANCE
The ZBA, in granting a use or area variance, shall grant the minimum variance that it
shall deem necessary and adequate while, at the same time, preserving and protecting
the character of the neighborhood and the health, safety and welfare of the community.
8.3.4 CONDITIONS OF APPROVAL
The ZBA, in granting a use or area variance, shall have the authority to impose such
reasonable conditions and restrictions as are directly related, and incidental, to the
proposed use of the property. Such conditions shall be consistent with the spirit and
intent of this Chapter and shall be imposed for the purpose of minimizing any adverse
impact such variance may have on the neighborhood or community.
8.3.5 INTERPRETATION APPEALS
An interpretation is an appeal by an aggrieved party seeking to overturn a determination
made by the administrative official charged with the enforcement of the Zoning
Ordinance.
8.3.6 COMPLIANCE
The granting of any appeal from a specific requirement of this ordinance shall not
obviate the necessity of complying with all other applicable provisions of this ordinance
in every other respect.
8.4 VARIANCE AND INTERPRETATION APPEALS PROCEDURE
8.4.1 ADMINISTRATIVE DECISION
A. Each decision of the administrative official charged with the enforcement of this
Zoning Ordinance shall be filed in the office of such official within five (5) business days
from the day it is rendered and shall be a public record.
B. An application for appeal shall be submitted by an aggrieved person within sixty
(60) days of the filing of any such decision.
8.4.2 APPLICATION FOR APPEAL
A. The ZBA shall not accept any application for appeal that includes a parcel for
which there is an outstanding, unresolved written violation from the Zoning Officer that
is not the subject of the appeal.
B. Applications for appeals shall be on forms prescribed by the ZBA and shall be
accompanied by a fee as established by the City Council. Every appeal shall specify
the grounds for appeal and the requested relief or interpretation sought.
CITY OF SARATOGA SPRINGS ZONING ORDINANCE
v1.0 8.0: Variance and Interpretation Appeals  Page 3
C. An appeal shall stay all enforcement proceedings relating to any violation under
appeal unless the administrative official charged with the enforcement of the Zoning
Ordinance finds that such stay would cause imminent peril to life or property.
8.4.3 MEETINGS
Meetings shall be held at the call of the Chairman or as the ZBA may determine. A
quorum shall consist of 4 members. The ZBA shall keep minutes of its proceedings
showing the vote of each member upon every action and shall keep records of its
deliberations and decisions.
8.4.4 PUBLIC HEARING NOTICE
A. The ZBA shall schedule a public hearing on an application for an appeal and
shall provide notice as follows.
B. The ZBA shall advertise the hearing in a Saratoga Springs newspaper of general
circulation at least five days prior to the date thereof. The applicant shall be responsible
for payment for this notice. Prior to the hearing, the applicant shall be responsible for
filing with the ZBA an affidavit from the newspaper confirming such publication and
payment.
8.4.5 PROPERTY OWNER NOTIFICATION
The applicant shall provide notice of an appeal to neighboring property owners in the

to the scheduled hearing.
C. Prior to the public hearing, the applicant shall submit to the ZBA, confirmation of
the property owner notification by obtaining a certificate of mailing provided by the
U.S. Postal Service.
D. Failure to provide notice in exact conformance with these provisions shall not
invalidate a ZBA determination provided the ZBA finds that substantial compliance has
occurred and that the public has been fairly apprised of the fundamental character of
the proposed request.
CITY OF SARATOGA SPRINGS ZONING ORDINANCE
v1.0 8.0: Variance and Interpretation Appeals  Page 4
8.4.6 PLANNING BOARD RECOMMENDATION
Pursuant to General City Law Section 33.6, if a proposed subdivision plat contains one
or more lots that do not comply with this Chapter and, therefore, require an area

Appendix C:
4. Waters Edge/Woodlands on Saratoga Lake Planned Unit Development
(formerly 241.4)
AN ORDINANCE PROVIDING FOR THE ESTABLISHMENT OF A PLANNED UNIT
DEVELOPMENT DISTRICT TO BE KNOWN AS THE WATER'S EDGE/WOODLANDS
PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENT DISTRICT
BE IT ORDAINED, by the City Council of the City of Saratoga Springs, New York,
following a public hearing as follows:
SECTION 1  TITLE:
This Ordinance shall be known as "The Water's Edge/Woodlands on Saratoga Lake
Planned Unit Development," and amends Chapter 241.4 of the Code of the City of
Saratoga Springs, New York entitled "Zoning" and supersedes the Ordinance adopted
thereunder on January 21, 1992, known as "The Water's Edge on Saratoga Lake
Planned Unit Development."
SECTION 2  ZONING AND DEVELOPMENT HISTORY:
The Zoning Ordinance of the City of Saratoga Springs and the zoning map of the City of
Saratoga Springs as set forth herein be and the same are hereby amended by changing
from the existing Water's Edge on Saratoga Lake Planned Unit Development zoning
district, and creating within the boundaries of said district a planned unit development
district to be known and described as "The Water's Edge on Saratoga Lake Planned
Unit Development."
The original Planned Unit Development for the land in the project now known as The
Water's Edge/Woodlands on Saratoga Lake was first established on April 30, 1987, by
the adoption of an ordinance by the City Council of the City of Saratoga Springs
establishing a Planned Unit Development to be known as, "The Water's Edge on
Saratoga Lake Planned Unit Development." On January 21, 1992, a third ordinance for
the Planned Unit Development was adopted by the City Council of the City of Saratoga
Springs, also naming the district, "The Water's Edge on Saratoga Lake Planned Unit
Development." Collectively, these three previous ordinances will be referred to as the,
"Past PUD Legislation."
Past PUD Legislation contemplated that the are of planned unit development would
consist of approximately 143 acres and that the said land could be developed with a
maximum of 349 units (consisting of a maximum of 244 townhouses and 105 single
family homes) in five phases. To date, the Planning Board has granted PUD site plan
approval pursuant to past PUD Legislation for 117 townhouses and 64 single family
homes.

a phase(s) pursuant to subsections 1 and 2 of this section, in the event of site plan
approval expiration pursuant to subsection 5 of this section.
5. PUD site plan approval for a phase shall expire if the applicant has not obtained at
least one
building pet mit for a dwelling unit(s) to be constructed within that particular phase
within one
year of the date of PUD site plan approval for such phase. In the event PUD site
plan approval for a phase(s) expires pursuant to this section, the developer may
reapply for PUD site plan approval only if in compliance with the conditions and
deadline dates set forth in Section X, "Phasing", subsections 1 and 2. On good

Springs on December 31, 2002, or at the time of site plan approval for the first building in
Zone B, whichever is sooner, and shall be used only for the actual construction of the
looped line or any portion not built at that time.
J. Upon completion of any component building in Zone B, as described in Section VII
above, a sanitary sewer transmission system shall be incorporated within this design and shall
bring all effluent to a pump station located on Weibel Avenue which has been designed to meet
the Ten State Standards and New York State Department of Environmental Conservation
standards. The station shall be a pre-cast submersible pump station with a separate wet well and
valve pit. The pump station shall connect to a manhole located on Excelsior Avenue by means of
a force main, which shall run through the City of Saratoga Springs easement extending in a
westerly direction from the site beneath the Adirondack Northway, or along another route and
termination point acceptable to the City, if the construction costs are equal or less. A connection to
one or more points in the Town of Wilton shall be deemed acceptable to the City
of Saratoga Springs.

building in Zone B.
K. The developer, or its successor, shall agree to a traffic monitoring plan if any PUD site approval for
any building within the project site is granted on or after July 1, 2004. In this event, new traffic
counts must be taken and traffic studies completed to verify the level of traffic service then existing
on all segments and intersections identified in the Sketch Plan's traffic impact study report.
After reviewing such new traffic study, the City of Saratoga Springs has the right to restrict
further development of the Planned Unit Development until the necessary off-site highway
improvements are made. In the event that the traffic monitoring plan indicates that "Weibel
Plaza PUD" has caused or contributed to a level of traffic service which necessitates off-site
highway improvements, the City of Saratoga Springs will require the developer to contribute to
the cost of any such off-site highway improvements deemed necessary in proportion to the
degree for which "Weibel Plaza PUD" has caused or contributed thereto.

specifically enumerated in Phase 1 d and with the structures to be located on the southeast
corner of Broadway and Congress Street, except a drive-thru facility cannot be associated
with a restaurant. A Special Use Permit is required for an outdoor performance facility.
Permitted uses also shall include all Accessory Permitted Uses and Special Permitted
Uses as designated for the uses within the Commercial-1 Downtown Business (C-1) Zone in
the City of Saratoga Springs at the time this Ordinance is enacted and as those uses may
increase, but not as they may decrease, as a result of future amendments to the Zoning
Ordinance of the City of Saratoga Springs.
In the construction and leasing of the structures involved within this project, flexibility
in use is desired, as a result, all permitted uses may be interchanged, i.e., restaurant for retail.
The parking criterion for each use as established in Section IX is intended to accommodate
those shifts and changes within the maximum gross square feet permitted for each phase
and subphase of the project.
The development of the site will be staged over four primary phases each of which
may have one or more building projects. All phases may be undertaken as tenants are
identified for use of an individual building or a significant portion of an individual building.
Because this site is already improved with occupied commercial space and ground
level parking, as individual building construction is undertaken certain portions of the existing
structures will be demolished and the parking field will be reconfigured. New structures will be
completed and granted a Certificate of Occupancy before existing structures are demolished,
so long as adequate parking is provided.

The maximum height of any building within the PUCD shall be 75 feet. So as to allow
flexibility in design and architecture, the appurtenance to any structure may include, but not
be limited to, clocks, clock towers, non-occupied mechanical rooms, tower and flag poles
which may extend above the herein specified maximum height limitation but not to exceed
110 feet.
The real property owner is permitted to increase the Gross Leasable square footage
within the entire PUCD by fifteen (15%) percent without the requirement of an amendment
to this ordinance.
The Gross Leasable Area is as follows:
Gross Leasable Square Feet = 178,700 sq. ft. +
Total permitted gross leasable square feet = 205,505 sq. ft. + with addition of 15 percent.
Because traffic control ingress and egress from the PUCD is of significant importance
and based on the assumption that the site when fully built out will generate 682 vehicle trips
per peak hour, the real property owner agrees that at the time of any PUCD site plan
approval, if the, trip generation figures for the peak hour exceed 807 vehicle trips per peak
hour, the City has the right to ask that real property owner to conduct another traffic impact
analysis and the applicant will negotiate with the City any additional improvements required
as a result of that analysis.
Section VII DENSITY:
For the purpose of determining building, pavement and parking lot coverage maximums,
the entire project shall be treated as if it is being constructed in the Commercial-1 Downtown
Business (C-1) Zone as that zone is defined in the Zoning Ordinance of the City of Saratoga
Springs and shall be controlled by the "District Regulations: Area and Bulk Schedule for
CITY OF SARATOGA SPRINGS ZONING ORDINANCE
v1.0 Appendix C: 7.Congress Park Center Planned Unit Development  Page 98
Commercial District City of Saratoga Springs" of the Zoning Ordinance of the City of Saratoga
Springs for the Commercial-1 Downtown Business Zone as that schedule is written at the
time of the passage of this Ordinance.
Section VIII ISSUANCE OF BUILDING PERMIT:
Prior to the issuance of a Building Permit to develop any or all of the structures within
the PUCD, except as exempted in Article 204.5 of the Zoning Ordinance of the City of
Saratoga Springs, the Applicant shall receive final PUD Site Plan approval for the
structure(s) to be constructed from the City of Saratoga Springs Planning Board.
It is anticipated that there will be multiple applications for PUD Site Plan approval and
each application shall show the relationship between the building to be developed and the
vacant areas within the PUCD. Each final PUD Site Plan shall respond to the requirements
set forth in Section 240-5.4 of the Zoning Code Ordinance of the City of Saratoga Springs.
Section IX PARKING/LOADING DOCKS:
The interactive nature of the uses proposed in the project allows for a parking scheme
which incorporates the "shared parking concept" so as to best utilize existing parking and
parking to be constructed as a portion of this project.
So as to accommodate the various order in which construction of new structures and
the demolition of existing structures within the PUCD will take place, as portions of the PUCD
are presented for PUD Site Plan Approval, parking shall be supplied in the below
specified ratios. Parking may be supplied on-site, within a parking structure, or by means
of a long term (5 year) lease of under utilized parking on properties within 500 feet of the
project site.
Parking requirements shall be based on gross leasable square feet ("GLSF") to be
occupied within the site as follows:
a. Retail: 4 parking spaces for each 1,000 GLSF.
b. Mixed Use as specified in Exhibit "C": Take the GLSF, multiply that figure
by one-tenth (0.1), subtract that number from the Mixed Use Gross Leasable
Square Feet and divide that number by Three Hundred square feet to
determine the number of parking spaces required.
c. Residential: 1.2 parking spaces per residential unit.
d. Cinemas: If 100,000 or more GLSF exist within the PUCD, then a 450 seat
credit shall be granted. Thereafter, three parking spaces for each 100
additional theater seats. If 100,000 GLSF do not exist within the PUCD, then
three parking spaces shall be required for each 100 theater seats.
The surface parking areas subsequent to reconstruction shall have eight percent
green space within or contiguous to the parking fields. There shall be no green
space requirement associated with a parking structure.
CITY OF SARATOGA SPRINGS ZONING ORDINANCE

maximize parking and on-site traffic flow, loading docks, access from the
public right-of-way shall be established as follows:
a. Federal Street to access the structure in Phase l a.
b. Federal Street to access the structure to be located at the intersection of
Federal Street and Washington Street.
During the construction of a structure in the Phase 4 location in the PUCD, the
introduction of a loading dock off of Washington Street shall be subject to review and
approval of the Planning Board of the City of Saratoga Springs at the time of the PUD Site
Plan review for that aspect of the project.
The site shall have entrance and exit location(s): two on Washington Street with one to
be used in conjunction with the structure to be located at the intersection of Federal Street
and Washington Street, two on Federal Street with one entering and exiting the garage
structure and also permitting the one-way vehicular access to the drive-thru window
associated with the structure located at the intersection of Federal Street and Washington
Street and two on Congress Street as specified herein. No direct vehicular access point shall
be permitted onto or off of Broadway.
As a portion of Phase l b or 2, a drive-thru exit onto Congress Street shall be
permitted. This exit shall be designed and signed for right turn only so as to allow exiting
traffic to flow only in a westerly direction on Congress Street. Also, a drive-thru window may be
constructed in conjunction with the Phase lb or 2 structure to be located at the intersection of
Broadway and Congress Street.
The total number of parking spaces required during any Phase of this project may
be decreased but not increased by the Planning Board of the City of Saratoga Springs at
the time of PUD Site Plan approval.

Section IV: OBJECTIVE:
It is the objective of the Ordinance to bring about a creative land use allowing the
buildout of the site to be achieved in an integrated fashion. The mixed-use concept that is
proposed will allow the development of a significant interactive indoor/outdoor
recreational facility on the interior of the site with the construction and development of
office, retail, commercial and/or residential uses along the West Avenue corridor. The
PUD will be constructed in a way that takes into consideration the "West Avenue 
Southern Area" Special Development Area recommendations as set out in the Saratoga
Springs Comprehensive Plan to include the construction of multi-story buildings,
diminished setbacks for structures along West Avenue, shared driveways and parking lots
and pedestrian access to the PUD Site.
Section V: SKETCH PLAN:
A "Sketch Plan" of a build out scenario of this site showing the development of
the entire site is attached hereto as Exhibit "B. It is anticipated that beyond the
construction of the YMCA the site may evolve and over the decades re-evolve. As a
result, the attached Sketch Plan may change, be altered, or amended pursuant to Section
240-3.6 of the Zoning Ordinance.
Section VI: USES AND CHARACTERISTICS:
The PUD shall be divided into two zones with Zone A being the first to be
developed as a YMCA facility, to include the public bike and pedestrian path. A second
area designated as Zone B shall be primarily located along the West Avenue corridor and
shall offer the opportunity for structures to be constructed along the West Avenue
frontage of a more commercial/office/retail related nature. These structures may be
CITY OF SARATOGA SPRINGS ZONING ORDINANCE
v1.0 Appendix C: YMCA Planned Unit Development 
constructed on property through a long term lease from the PUD real property owner,
constructed by the PUD real property owner or may be located on a subdivided parcel.
In the long te __ in construction, leasing and possible subdivision of this site,
flexibility in use is desired. As a result uses peimitted in Zone A may shift to Zone B and
uses in Zone B may shift into Zone A upon the granting of a special use permit by the
Planning Board of the City of Saratoga Springs. A plan showing the areas of Zone A and
Zone B is attached as "Exhibit C".
The structures to be constructed in Zone A may have a gross usable square
footage of up to 130,000 square feet. Attached as Exhibit D and made a part hereof are
the uses that are permitted within Zone A of the PUD site.
The structures to be constructed in Zone B may have a gross leasable square
footage of up to 100,000 square feet. Attached as Exhibit E and made a part hereof is the
uses that are permitted in Zone B.
Area and Bulk Standards for Buildings within Zone A shall be as follows:
1. Principal Structures:
a) Gross leasable square footage - maximum 130,000 square feet.
b) Building height excluding appurtenances  60 ft. maximum.
c) Building height - 18 feet minimum.
d) Street frontage - no requirement for street frontage other than for
driveway access to West Avenue and New Street/or Congress
Avenue.
e) Front/side/rear yard setbacks - minimum of 24 feet to property
boundary or Zone boundary.
f) Permeable area to include permeable area within the deeded
pedestrian/bike path  minimum 40%.
g) Parking - there will be no setback for parking spaces for principal
uses where Zone A and Zone B abut, along the pedestrian/bike
path or along a public road extended through the PUD site. Parking
shall be setback a minimum 24 feet from all other PUD site
boundaries.
2. Accessory Structures:
a) Building height - 30 feet maximum.
b) Front/side/rear yard setbacks - 10 feet minimum to property
boundary or Zone A boundary.
Area and Bulk Standards for Buildings within Zone B shall be as follows:
CITY OF SARATOGA SPRINGS ZONING ORDINANCE
v1.0 Appendix C: YMCA Planned Unit Development 
1. Principal Structures:
a) Gross leasable square footage  maximum 100,000 square feet.
b) Building height - two story minimum, 40 feet maximum excluding
appurtenances
c) Build-to-line  minimum 5 feet and maximum 10 feet from West
Avenue property line.
d) Build-out - 50% minimum of the leased or subdivided real
property that has frontage on West Avenue

interior public roadway, or driveway; except where building lot
abuts residential property where the setback shall be a minimum of
12 feet.
f) Rear yard setback - minimum 12 feet from leasehold or
subdivision line.
g) Permeable Area within leasehold or subdivided property 
minimum 10%.

b) Rear yard setbacks  minimum 5 feet.
c) Front yard setback  minimum 10 feet.
Section VII: ISSUANCE OF BUILDING PERMIT:
Prior to the issuance of a building permit to develop any or all structures within
the PUD, except as exempted in Article 240.5 of the Zoning Ordinance of the City of
Saratoga Springs, the applicant shall receive final PUD site plan approval for the
structure(s) to be constructed from the City of Saratoga Springs Planning Board. All
building permits or sign permits within this PUD shall require architectural review
approval from the Design Review Commission of the City of Saratoga Springs pursuant
to the provisions as set forth in Article 240.8 of the Zoning Ordinance.
It is anticipated that there will be multiple applications for PUD site plan approval
and each application shall show the relationship between the building(s) to be developed,
the vacant areas within the PUD and any improvements from a prior PUD site plan
approval. Each final PUD site plan shall respond to the requirements set forth in Section
240-5.4 of the Zoning Code of the City of Saratoga Springs.
CITY OF SARATOGA SPRINGS ZONING ORDINANCE
v1.0 Appendix C: YMCA Planned Unit Development 
P 147
Section VIII: PARKING/LOADING DOCKS:
The interactive nature of the uses proposed in the PUD allows for a parking plan
which incorporates the "shared parking concept" so as to best utilize the parking to be
constructed within the zones of this site. As a result, upon reasonable proof being
supplied at PUD site plan review the Planning Board may reduce the amount of required
on-site parking up to thirty percent (30%) of the total parking demand.
Because of the intermittent demand for parking within the structures to be
constructed in Zone A, thirty percent (30%) of the parking required or requested may be
constructed on permeable grass surfaces.
The required on-site parking for any use in Zone A or Zone B does not have to be
located on the same owned or leased parcel. The required on-site parking must, unless
waived by the Planning Board during PUD site plan approval, be located on a parcel
within the PUD with appropriate easements.
Parking requirements shall be the same as those set forth in Article 240-11 of the
Zoning Ordinance except as noted below:
Parking Zone A: Health Club Establishment  1 parking space for
every 250 gross square feet of indoor facility and 1
parking space for every 5 participants that the
outdoor facilities are designed to accommodate
when used to the maximum capacity.
The parking area within Zone A shall have a minimum of ten percent (10%) green
space within the parking area or adjacent to the parking fields, unless waived by the
Planning Board during PUD site plan approval. The Zone B parking fields shall have a
green space requirement of five percent (5%) green space within the parking area or
adjacent to the parking field, unless waived by the Planning Board during PUD site plan
approval.
The delivery area for all Zone B structures shall be situated to the side or rear of
the structure fronting on West Avenue. The delivery parking/loading area for structures
in Zone A shall be determined at the time of PUD site plan approval.
The PUD at build out shall at a minimum have two (2) entrance/exit locations on
West Avenue and one (1) on either New Street or Congress Street. The vehicular ingress
and egress for the structures constructed in Zone B will be at a minimum by the three (3)
common entrance/exit locations specified above. The tenants and/or owners of the
structures in Zone B shall be given cross lot easements through Zone A for the purpose of
ingress and egress to their individual site from the public roadways. Zone B building,
unless subdivided with proof of on-site parking in compliance with this legislation shall

Prior to the time of the first PUD site plan approval for the PUD, the Applicant
shall grant to the public by means of offering and if accepted, conveying to the City of
Saratoga Springs, New York a strip of land being approximately fifty (50') feet in width
west of the PUD site's easterly boundary. The Applicant shall retain the right to cross
CITY OF SARATOGA SPRINGS ZONING ORDINANCE
v1.0 Appendix C: YMCA Planned Unit Development 
P 149
said strip of land, at a location or locations to be determined at any PUD site plan
approval for the purpose of extending driveways/roadways, sidewalks, utility and storm
water drainage easements through said pedestrian/bike path. These crossings shall be
created so as to allow vehicle, pedestrian, utility and storm water easements to extend
into and out of the PUD site to and from the real property and public roadway which
exists to the east of the PUD site. If the strip of land, which is conveyed, primary use as a
path open to the general public is discontinued, or if the land is transferred without
restrictions that it be primarily used as a path and trail open to the general public, then
title to the real property shall revert to the Applicant or its successors or assigns. The
Applicant shall not be responsible for the construction, care, maintenance, improvements,
reconstruction, security, or landscaping of the pedestrian/bike path and shall seek to be
held harmless for all injuries, damages, judgments, fees and provided a legal defense
from all claims and actions, arising from incidents on the pedestrian/bike path not caused
by the direct action of the applicant or its successors. The Applicant and its successors
shall be responsible for the reasonable restoration of the pedestrian/bike path arising from
the introduction, construction, maintenance and reconstruction of driveways/roadways,
sidewalks and utilities across said pedestrian/bike path.
During PUD site plan approval for the first building within the PUD provision
will be made for the accommodation of a future public road extending from the easterly
boundary of the PUD site south of the main parking area, to the easterly boundary of
West Avenue. This portion of the roadway/driveways shall be built to City of Saratoga
Springs specifications for a public street and shall be dedicated to the City of Saratoga
Springs upon written demand from the City of Saratoga Springs upon the construction of
a public road from New York State Route 50, through the lands presently owned by the
Espey Manufacturing Co. to the easterly boundary of the PUD site. The City of Saratoga
Springs will be responsible for the construction of the connection of the road from the
easterly edge of the PUD site to the roadway/driveway constructed on the PUD site.
Section XI: OFF-SITE IMPROVEMENTS:
The Planning Board of the City of Saratoga Springs may require a traffic analysis
and traffic mitigation improvements related to the structure to be constructed during PUD
site plan approval for structures in Zone A or Zone B.
As a portion of the PUD approval for the first structure in Zone A a public
sidewalk and curb if not already in existence or a requirement of an approved plan will be
extended south on the east side of West Avenue to the northwest corner of the site. Also a
sidewalk and curb shall be constructed along the New Street frontage. A pedestrian
walking system shall be constructed within the PUD so as to gain access to the buildings

APPENDIX 240-11.0 (c) (ii) of the City Of Saratoga Springs Zoning
Ordinance
Pitney Meadows Community Farm
AMENDMENT CHAPTER 240 ZONING
ORDINANCE OF THE CITY OF
SARATOGA SPRINGS
AMENDMENT TO THE ZONING ORDINANCE OF
THE CITY OF SARATOGA SPRINGS TO ESTABLISH
THE PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENT DISTRICT
KNOWN AS PITNEY MEADOWS
COMMUNITY FARM
BE IT ORDAINED by the City Council of the City of Saratoga Springs,
following a public hearing as follows:
 Section I: NAME:
The ordinance shall be known as the Pitney Meadows Community Farm and
amends Chapter 240 of the Zoning Ordinance of the City of Saratoga Springs, New York.
The Pitney Meadows Community Farm Planned Unit Development (PUD) project is also
referred to herein as PUD.
Section II: AMENDMENTS:
The Zoning Ordinance of the City of Saratoga Springs, New York, (the Code)
and the Zoning Map of the City of Saratoga Springs as set forth therein shall be and the
same hereby are amended by changing the permitted uses for a delineated segment of the
land owned by Pitney Meadows Community Farm, Inc. (Applicant) designated as tax
parcels 178.-1-49.1on the Outside Tax District Tax Map for the City of Saratoga Springs,
which property is presently located in the Urban Residential (UR-2) Zoning District for
purpose of zoning classification under the Code, that being immediately adjacent to West
Avenue and the Delaware and Hudson Railroad right-of-way (ROW) as specified herein
and St. Peters Cemetery to the north.
Section III: BOUNDARY:
The area of the Pitney Meadows Community Farm Planned Unit Development
consists of 11.69+ acres and is comprised of a portion of the Tax Parcel No. 178.-1-49.1
on the Outside Tax District Tax Map for the City of Saratoga Springs. Said 11.69+ acre
portion of the site is described in Exhibit A attached hereto and is here and after
referred to as the property. 
2
 Section IV: OBJECTIVE:
 It is the objective of the Ordinance to bring about a creative land use allowing the
buildout of the site to be achieved in an integrated fashion. The mixed-use concept that is
proposed will allow the development of an Agricultural Resources Center comprised of
integrated and complementary agriculturally-themed uses with associated and incidental
accessory uses on West Avenue corridor. As such the PUD will assist with the
implementation of three key initiatives for improving the quality of life for City residents:
A) The PUD will aid in achieving key actions of the recommended actions from
the Citys Comprehensive Plan as they relate to the preservation and
enhancement of agriculture for the betterment of the City;
B) The PUD aids in achieving the stated purpose of Chapter 110 Environmental,
Parks and Open Space Areas Protection Program. In recognition of the
importance of the land on which the PUD project elements will be
constructed. The City is a funding partner in acquisition of the said lands. The
PUD is the next logical step in the provision of facilities that will be utilized
to further educate residents of all ages as to the importance of agriculture to
the City as a community.
C) The PUD will be in compliance with and directed by the Deed of
Conservation Easement (Easement) executed by the City, Pitney Meadows
Community Farm and Agriculture Stewardship Association, Inc. on December
15, 2016 and filed with the Office of the County Clerk, Saratoga County, New
York.
Fulfillment of the Citys Comprehensive Plan: The PUD will be constructed in a way that
implements the recommended actions of the Citys 2015 Comprehensive Plan as they
relate to the promotion of agriculture as a primary means to expand the local economy.
The PUD will include development of an Agricultural Resource Center that will provide
advancement of agriculture and agri-tourism through hands-on education and practice of
agriculture; agriculturally-related activities, events and classes; and an outlet for the retail
sale of agricultural products to the benefit of the Pitney Meadows Community Farm and
local farmers around the City of Saratoga Springs.
The City of Saratoga Springs adopted the Comprehensive Plan in June of 2015 which
recommends, the preservation, protection, and enhancement of open spaceallowing all
residents, regardless of income level, to live and recreate in an area that is beautiful,
healthy vital and safe Specifically, the Comprehensive Plan lists recommended actions
which include:
? Develop a strategic plan to promote a diverse local economy including
agriculture;
? Maintain a diverse tax base and accommodate a broad range of land uses
while minimizing conflicts;
? Encourage development that diversifies the Citys economic base, promotes
year-round economic benefits and activity, and brings new resources and
people to Saratoga Springs 
3
? Consider allowing commercial agriculture uses within the City to further
support agriculture as an economic driver in the community
? Encourage active and passive agricultural activities and agri-tourism
? Encourage the establishment of community gardens throughout the City
? Promote opportunities to expand Community Supported Agriculture (CSA)
with local farmers
The PUD encompasses a series of the elements that will directly implement each of these
action steps.
Fulfillment of the Objectives as Listed in Chapter 110 of the City Code: The PUD fulfills
the stated purpose and legislative intent of the Environmental, Parks and Open Areas
Protection Program Chapter of the City Code through provision of facilities that will
allow for direct resident education and interaction with agriculture methods that will
further the knowledge base relating to best practices to produce healthy and nutritional
foods in a sustainable manner while reinforcing the importance of locally grown
agricultural products to the local economy.
Fulfillment of the Land Uses as defined and required by the Deed of Conservation
Easement: The PUD enables Pitney Meadows Community Farm, Inc. to own and operate
the Pitney Farm in compliance with the Easement and to fulfill the objectives and stated
purpose of the Easement and is in compliance with said Easement. The Easement is a
contract between the City and Pitney Meadows Community Farm that assures that the
prescribed uses, agricultural and rural character will be honored and preserved in
perpetuity.
 Section V: SKETCH PLAN:
 A The Sketch Plan of a build out scenario and graphic illustrations of this site
which comprise the Agricultural Resource Center as defined in the Conservation
Easement for this parcel (tax map no. 178.-1-49.1) and showing the development of the
entire site is attached hereto as Exhibit B. It is anticipated that the completion of each
element of the Pitney Meadows Community Farm PUD may evolve and over the decades
re-evolve. As a result, the attached Sketch Plan and associated graphic illustrations may
change, be altered, or amended pursuant to Section 240-10.2.10 of the Zoning Ordinance.
 Section VI: USES; AREA AND BULK STANDARDS AND
CHARACTERISTICS:
 The basis for the uses allowed in the PUD is the allowed uses as outlined in the
Conservation Easement. The Conservation Easement envisions the establishment of an
Agricultural Resource Center on the property and sets forth basic parameters for use of
the property. This PUD ordinance sets forth a regulatory framework with specific
standards for uses, location of uses, dimensions, and review procedures through the
Zoning Chapter of the City Code. 
4
Therefore, the PUD shall be divided into three (3) zones with Zone A being the
first to be developed as the primary community farm component of the overall PUD and
located along West Avenue. Zone B will adjoin Zone A to west and Zone C will adjoin
Zone B at the western edge of the project Area (see the Development Zones Map in
Exhibit C).
Zone A and Zone B will be inclusive of integrated agricultural and ag-related
uses as the principal uses within these zones and further supplemented by complementary
and accessory uses in support of the principal uses of the zone. The principal use in Zone
C will consist of residential-style housing facility with accessory parking, community and
childrens gardens and the raising of crops. The purpose of the residential facility will be
to provide housing for project-affiliated students and staff and/or short-term lodging for
visitors to farm (see the tables in Exhibit D, Exhibit E, and Exhibit F for a listing of
permitted uses in each of the development zones).
The area and bulk standards for the PUD are listed by principal and accessory buildings
and structures for each of the three development zones (see the table in Exhibit G).
 Section VII: EXEMPTIONS:
An action otherwise requiring site plan review may be exempt if the following two (2)
conditions are met:
A) The action does not result in an increase in the required number of parking
spaces as set forth in Section IX; and
B) The action does not alter, either individually or in combination, the
impermeable or building coverage by more than 2% or 1200 s.f., whichever is
less, from the most recent, approved site plan.
Neither of these exemptions shall permit the alteration of any specific conditions of prior
site plan approvals without Planning Board approval.
 Section VIII: ISSUANCE OF BUILDING PERMIT:
 Prior to the issuance of a Building Permit to develop any or all
buildings/structures within the PUD, the Applicant shall receive all required approvals for
the building(s)/structure(s) to be constructed from the City of Saratoga Springs Planning
Board and the Design Review Commission of the City of Saratoga Springs.
 It is anticipated that there will be multiple applications for PUD Site Plan
approval and each application shall show the relationship between the building/structure
to be developed and the vacant areas within the PUD.
 Section IX: PARKING/ACCESS/DELIVERY:
 As a general consideration the integrated nature of the mix of land uses proposed
in the PUD requires an approach to parking which incorporates the shared parking 
5
concept among the land use zones of the PUD so available space is used in an efficient
manner with the least amount of impervious area as possible. On this basis the following
regulations shall be used to determine the number of parking spaces required:
A) General parking and access for all zones:
Parking:
1) All parking for the PUD shall be off street, on-street parking is prohibited;
2) For uses proposed and not listed on the existing parking schedule of the

This Ordinance amends the City of Saratoga Springs Zoning Map by rezoning the
properties described in Appendix A and shown on a map attached hereto and made a part
hereof and entitled Sketch Plan for Saratoga Hospital Medical/Professional PUD, prepared
by C.T. Male and dated May 23, 2003, revised January 26, 2009, October 27, 2009, January
10, 2011, and March 25, 2013 from their current zoning designation of Office/Medical Business
District to Saratoga Hospital Medical/Professional Planned Unit Development District.
This Ordinance also amends Chapter 241.3 of the City of Saratoga Springs by identifying
certain uses which may be established within the amended boundary of the Saratoga Hospital
Medical/Professional PUD and describing the review processes necessary to establish said uses.
III. BOUNDARY
The total area of the Saratoga Hospital Medical/Professional PUD, as amended by this
ordinance, will consist of 28. 69 ± acres as bounded and described in Appendix B attached

3. Map 165.41, Block 1, Lot 28
The Saratoga Hospital has consolidated its lots identified in the 2011 Ordinance and in
Appendix A to create fewer individual tax parcels for the lots owned by Saratoga Hospital and
contained in this Planned Unit Development. The above tax parcels reflect the campus as it was
configured in the 2013 Ordinance.
If the planned unit development zoning approval for this site expires or is abandoned, or
the PUD boundary is otherwise altered, the City Council shall establish the zoning district that will
be assigned to any such impacted parcel at that time
IV. SKETCH PLAN

compliance with a sketch plan filed in the Offices of the Planning Board of the City of Saratoga
Springs, New York, and attached hereto and made a part hereof as Appendix C. The plan
shall be used by the City and the Hospital as a guide for overall development. The sketch plan
may be changed, altered or amended, pursuant to Section 240-3.6 of the City of Saratoga Springs
Zoning Ordinance.
V. PURPOSE

ARTICLE IV
Conservation Subdivision Regulations
§ 241-12. General regulations.
A. Purpose and applicability.
(1) The purpose of this article is to achieve a balance between well
designed residential development, meaningful open space
conservation, and natural resource protection in the countryside by
requiring conservation subdivisions instead of conventional
subdivisions.
(2) This chapter applies to all properties within the RR and SR-1
Districts, which encompass most of the area described in the
Saratoga Springs Comprehensive Plan as the "Country Overlay
Area." The use of conservation subdivisions is intended to preserve
tracts of environmentally and scenically significant undeveloped
land in the "country" part of Saratoga Springs, including road
corridors and buffers, in order to maintain the historic settlement
pattern and implement the Comprehensive Plan's vision of a "City
in the country." Conservation subdivisions result in the
preservation of contiguous open space and important scenic and
environmental resources, while allowing compact development,
more walkable neighborhoods, and more design flexibility than
conventional subdivisions. Conservation subdivisions must satisfy
the standards in § 241-12 B, C, and D. The procedure for approving
conservation subdivisions is described in Article II, § 241-6.
Graphics in this chapter are included for illustrative purposes.
B. Standards for conservation subdivisions.
(1) Density calculation. The maximum density allowed for residential
units is calculated by a formula based upon the acreage of
unconstrained land on the property.
(a) To determine unconstrained acreage, subtract from the total or
gross acreage of the proposed development parcel, the
acreage of constrained land.
(b) To determine the number of allowable residential units or
"base density" on the site, divide the unconstrained acreage by
the allowable number of acres per unit required within the
zoning district. Round down fractional units of 0.5 or less and
round up fractional units greater than 0.5. Figure IV, 1a
through Figure IV, 1c illustrates a density calculation on a site
in a hypothetical conservation subdivision in an RR District.

Figure IV, 1c Density Calculation for RR-2 District
Total site acreage: 41.0 acres
Constrained acreage:
Floodplain: 8.0 acres
Wetlands: 2.5 acres (1.0 acre overlaps with
floodplain)
Steep slopes: 1.0 acre - 10.5 acres
Unconstrained acreage: 30.5 acres
Base units allowable: 30.5 ÷ 2 = 15.25
(c) The base density in Subsection B(1)(b) may be increased by up
to 20% at the sole discretion of the Board if permanent public
access will be granted to the protected open space land and
any associated improvements as described in Article IV,
§ 241-12C.
(d) The density permitted by this section shall not be reduced as a
result of the conservation analysis required in Article IV,
§ 241-12B(2) below, or as a result of the reservation of
parkland during the subdivision process.
(2) Conservation analysis.
§ 241-12 CHARTER § 241-12
C:827
(a) As part of a preliminary subdivision plat application procedure
(see Article II, § 241-12C), an applicant shall prepare a
conservation analysis, consisting of inventory maps,
description of the land, and an analysis of the conservation
value of various site features. See Conservation Analysis
Checklist in Appendix F.59 The conservation analysis shall show
lands with conservation value, including but not limited to the
following:
[1] Constrained land;
[2] Open space and recreational resources described in the
City's Open Space Plan;
[3] Buffers to provide an area for installation of screening to
obscure and enhance the view of new development from
adjoining parcels;
[4] Land exhibiting present or potential recreational, historic,
ecological, agricultural, water resource, scenic or other
natural resource value.
(b) The conservation analysis shall describe the importance and
the current and potential conservation value of all land on the
site. In the course of its initial preliminary subdivision plat
review, the Board shall indicate to the applicant which of the
lands identified as being of conservation value are most
important to preserve.

also Figure 4.1b)
Figure IV, 2b Conservation Analysis: Sample
Preliminary Plan
§ 241-12 CHARTER § 241-12
C:829
(c) The outcome of the conservation analysis and the Board's
determination shall be incorporated into the approved
preliminary subdivision plat [see Article II, § 241-8A(3)]
showing land to be permanently preserved by a conservation
easement. The preliminary subdivision plat shall also show
preferred locations for intensive development as well as
acceptable locations for less dense development.
(d) The Board shall make the final determination as to which land
has the most conservation value and should be protected from
development by conservation easement. Whenever the Board
approves a plan with protected open space, it shall make
written findings identifying the specific conservation values
protected and the reasons for protecting such land (the
"conservation findings"). The Board shall deny an application
that does not include a complete conservation analysis
sufficient for the Board to make its conservation findings.
(e) The preliminary subdivision plat shall show the following as
land to be preserved by conservation easement:
[1] An amount of land no smaller than the total amount of
constrained land identified in the analysis in Article IV,
§ 241-12B(2); and
[2] In the RR District, at least 50% of the land not preserved in
Article IV, § 241-12B(2). In the SR-1 District at least 35%
of the land not preserved in Article IV, § 241-12B(2).
(f) If, based upon the conservation analysis, the Board determines
in its conservation findings that there is no reasonable basis for
requiring a conservation subdivision; the Board may approve a
conventional development of the site. In order for the Board to
make such a determination, the applicant must demonstrate at
least one of the following:
[1] The land contains no substantial resources with
conservation value; or
[2] The acreage is too small to preserve a substantial amount
of land with conservation value (this criterion shall not be
evaded by piecemeal subdivision of larger tracts); or
[3] The lot configuration is unique and precludes preservation
of a substantial amount of land with conservation value; or
[4] That there are extraordinary circumstances unique to the
parcel that demonstrates that conventional subdivision is
in the best interest of the adjacent neighborhoods.
(g) In order to make the required showing under Subsection
B(2)(b) or (c) above, the applicant must also demonstrate that
§ 241-12 SARATOGA SPRINGS CODE § 241-12
C:830
the parcel does not adjoin other land that, when combined with
open space on the parcel, would result in the preservation of a
substantial amount of land with conservation value (including
any portion of a designated trail corridor), regardless of
whether or not the adjoining parcels have been protected as
open space.
(h) An approval of a conventional subdivision shall refer to the
conservation findings and may be conditioned upon the
protection by conservation easement of portions of the site
identified in the conservation analysis and findings as having
conservation value.
(3) Types of development in a conservation subdivision. The allowable
residential units may be developed as single- family or two-family
residences. Within a conservation subdivision, a maximum of 25%
of the units may be placed in structures containing two units.
(4) Lot sizes in conservation subdivisions. There shall be no minimum
lot size in a conservation subdivision. The Board shall determine
appropriate lot sizes in the course of its review of a conservation
subdivision based upon the purposes and design criteria
established in this article. In order to permit a clustered lot
configuration, wells and septic systems may be located in areas of
protected open space, provided that necessary easements are
provided for maintenance of these facilities.
(5) Other area and dimensional requirements.
(a) There shall be no required area, bulk, or dimensional
standards in a conservation subdivision, except that where
such subdivision abuts an existing residence in a residentially
zoned area, a suitable buffer area with suitable screening shall
be required by the Board. This buffer shall be at least the same
distance as the minimum rear or side yard setback in the
district in which the abutting land is located.
(b) The applicant shall specify dimensional requirements for a
proposed conservation subdivision by identifying setbacks and
other lot dimensions to be incorporated into the final
subdivision plat.
(6) Conservation subdivision of a portion of larger tract. The Board
may entertain an application to develop a portion of a parcel if a
conservation analysis is provided for the entire parcel and the
approval to develop a portion of the parcel is not a basis for the
applicant or successor in interest to subsequently request an
exception under Article IV, § 241-12B(2) for the remainder of the
parcel.
(7) Conservation subdivision design guidelines. Lots shall be arranged
in a manner that protects land of conservation value and facilitates
§ 241-12 CHARTER § 241-12
C:831
pedestrian and bicycle circulation. The lot layout shall to the extent
feasible comply with the design guidelines in Article IV, § 241-12D.
Permitted building locations or areas ("building envelopes") shall
be shown on the final subdivision plat.
C. Permanent open space. Open space set aside in a conservation
subdivision shall be permanently preserved as required by this section.
Any development permitted on land located in a conservation
subdivision that is not protected as open space shall not compromise
the conservation value of such open space land.
(1) Conservation value of open space. The open space protected
pursuant to this section must have "conservation value," which
shall be determined in the course of the conservation analysis in
Article IV, § 241-12B(2).
(2) Permanent preservation by conservation easement.
(a) A perpetual conservation easement restricting development of
the open space land and allowing use only for agriculture,
forestry, passive recreation, protection of natural resources, or
similar conservation purposes, pursuant to § 247 of the
General Municipal Law and/or §§ 49-0301 through 49-0311 of
the Environmental Conservation Law, shall be granted to the
City, with the approval of the City Council, and/or to a qualified
not-for-profit conservation organization acceptable to the
Board. Such conservation easement shall be approved by the
Board and shall be required as a condition of final subdivision
plat approval. The Board shall require that the conservation
easement be enforceable by the City if the City is not the
holder of the conservation easement. The conservation
easement shall be recorded in the County Clerk's Office prior
to or simultaneously with the ling of the final subdivision plat in
the County Clerk's Office.
(b) The conservation easement shall prohibit residential,
industrial, or commercial use of open space land (except in
connection with agriculture, forestry, and passive recreation),
and shall not be amendable to permit such use. Access roads,
driveways, wells, underground sewage disposal facilities, local
utility distribution lines, stormwater management facilities,
trails, temporary structures for passive outdoor recreation,
and agricultural structures shall be permitted on preserved
open space land with Board approval, provided that they do not
impair the conservation value of the land. Forestry shall be
conducted in conformity with applicable best management
practices.
(c) A land management plan, approved by the Board, shall be
included in the conservation easement. The conservation
easement shall provide that if the City Council finds that the
§ 241-12 SARATOGA SPRINGS CODE § 241-12
C:832
management plan has been violated in a manner that renders
the condition of the land a public nuisance, the City may, upon
30 days' written notice to the owner, enter the premises for
necessary maintenance, and that the cost of such maintenance
by the City shall be assessed against the landowner or, in
the case of an homeowner's association (HOA), the owners
of properties within the development, and shall, if unpaid,
become a tax lien on such property or properties.
(d) Preserved open space may be included as a portion of one or
more large lots, or may be contained in a separate open space
lot. The conservation easement may allow dwellings to be
constructed on portions of lots that include preserved open
space land, provided that the total number of dwellings
permitted by the conservation easement in the entire
subdivision is consistent with applicable density limitations of
this article.
Figure IV, 3 Conservation Easement Alternative
Configurations
(3) Notations on final subdivision plat. Preserved open space land shall
be clearly delineated and labeled on the subdivision final plat as to
its use, ownership, management, method of preservation, and the
rights, if any, of the owners of lots in the subdivision and the public
to the open space land. The final plat shall clearly show that the
open space land is permanently preserved for conservation
purposes by a conservation easement required by this section, and
shall include deed recording information in the County Clerk's
office for the conservation easement.
(4) Ownership of open space land.
§ 241-12 CHARTER § 241-12
C:833
(a) Open space land shall under all circumstances be protected by
a perpetual conservation easement, but may be owned in
common by an HOA, offered for dedication to City, county, or
state governments, transferred to a nonprofit organization
acceptable to the Board, held in private ownership, or held in
such other form of ownership as the Board finds appropriate to
properly manage the open space land and to protect its
conservation value.
(b) If the land is owned in common by an HOA, such HOA shall be
established in accordance with the following:
[1] The HOA must be established before the approved
subdivision final plat is signed, and must comply with all
applicable provisions of the General Business Law.
[2] Membership must be mandatory for each lot owner, who
must be required by recorded covenants and restrictions
to pay fees to the HOA for taxes, insurance, and
maintenance of common open space, private roads, and
other common facilities.
[3] The HOA must be responsible for liability insurance,
property taxes, and the maintenance of recreational and
other facilities and private roads.
[4] Property owners must pay their pro rate share of the costs
in Article IV, Section 1, Paragraph C. 4., and the
assessment levied by the HOA must be able to become a
lien on the property.
[5] The HOA must be able to adjust the assessment to meet
changed needs.
[6] The applicant shall make a conditional offer of dedication
to the City, binding upon the HOA, for all open space to be
conveyed to the HOA. Such offer may be accepted by the
City, at the discretion of the City Council, upon the failure
of the HOA to take title to the open space from the
applicant or other current owner, upon dissolution of the
association at any future time, or upon failure of the HOA
to fulfill its maintenance obligations hereunder or to pay
its real property taxes.
[7] Ownership shall be structured in such a manner that real
property taxing authorities can satisfy property tax claims
against the open space lands by proceeding against
individual owners in the HOA and the dwelling units they
each own.
[8] The City Attorney's Office shall find that the HOA
documents presented satisfy the conditions in Subsections
§ 241-12 SARATOGA SPRINGS CODE § 241-12
C:834
B(2)(a) through (g) above, and such other conditions as the
Board shall deem necessary.
D. Rural design and siting standards. The following guidelines should be
considered in the process of designing and siting uses in the Rural
Residential and Suburban Residential-1 Districts. When locating new
uses on the land there are many options in the siting, configuration, size
and arrangement of elements in the landscape. These choices define
the character of the developed landscape environment. These
guidelines are examples of the preferred way to design and site uses
but they should not be considered the only acceptable solution.
(1) Four basic elements establish the character of a development.
These basic elements are:
(a) Landform. Landform encompasses gradient, slope form and
orientation of development in relationship to the shape of the
land. Landform is the signature element that is essential for
achieving an environment that has its own identity or "sense of
place."
[1] In the RR and SR-1 Districts, locally distinct natural
landform features should generally be left in a natural
state.
[2] Natural rural landforms are typically soft and roll due to
the rounding effect of wind and water over time.
Geometric landforms may also be present in areas of
shallow bedrock or seasonal flooding. The character and
diversity of the natural landform should be reflected in
grading to accommodate development.
[3] Minimize cuts and fills. When grading is necessary, slopes
should be graded to mimic existing slopes and blend
smoothly into the surrounding landform. Graded slopes
should be a maximum of 1:5 and gradually blend into
surrounding slopes.
§ 241-12 CHARTER § 241-12
C:835
Figure IV, 4 Landform Character
Figure VI, 5 Blending Grading Into Existing
Landform
[4] New development should not erase landforms that are
indigenous to the area. Instead solutions should reflect
and reinforce the area's own topographic features.
§ 241-12 SARATOGA SPRINGS CODE § 241-12
C:836
Figure IV, 6 Landform Preservation
(b) Vegetation. Vegetation encompasses review of varying plant
forms and their relationship to development and its mass on
the landscape. In addition to the benefits plants offer the
ecological system (soil stabilization, clean air, wildlife habitat)
their presence or absence, how they are configured or
arranged, and their species has a significant influence on
development character. Every effort should be made to:
[1] Preserve existing vegetation patterns and species mix and
density.
[2] Select and place new vegetation in ways that enhance the
rural indigenous vegetation characteristics.
[3] Vegetation in undeveloped rural areas is typically
clustered. Rural vegetation should not be in geometric
patterns that are associated with the urban environment.
§ 241-12 CHARTER § 241-12
C:837
Figure IV, 7 Vegetation Types and Patterns
[4] In the rural environment vegetation, not structures, is the
primary determinant of how far we can see and where we
look.
[5] Use existing vegetation and topography to screen new
buildings if possible.
§ 241-12 SARATOGA SPRINGS CODE § 241-12
C:838
Figure IV, 8 Framing Views
(c) Structures. The height, placement, forms and patterns of
building envelopes can establish an urban or rural character to
any development. The intent of this section is to identify
building envelopes, forms and patterns that are
complementary to and reflective of rural characteristics.
[1] Building envelopes in rural areas should be designed to
maximize the preservation of the site's natural features
(e.g., landform, vegetation), whereas, in more urban
environments, sites are more often modified to
accommodate the building.
§ 241-12 CHARTER § 241-12
C:839
Figure IV, 9 Siting of Structures
[2] The placement of building envelopes in relationship to
streets and highways critically affects the character of a
community. Varied setbacks provide a different experience
than a street where buildings are placed uniformly along a
street. Rural placement is historically deeper and more
varied than in urban environments and therefore
recommended.
§ 241-12 SARATOGA SPRINGS CODE § 241-12
C:840
Figure IV, 10 Rural Road with Varied Setbacks
[3] When building envelopes must be placed in open fields
they should be oriented to and reflect the alignment and
orientation of the site's natural features.
Figure IV, 11 Orient Structures to Align with
Topographic Character of Land
[4] Site building envelops so that treetops and crest lines of
hills as seen from public places and roads will screen
future buildings. Use vegetation as a backdrop to reduce
the prominence of the structure. Wherever possible, open
up views by selective cutting of small trees and pruning
lower branches of large trees, rather than by clearing
large areas or removing mature trees.
§ 241-12 CHARTER § 241-12
C:841
[5] Group building envelopes in clusters or tuck them behind
tree lines or knolls rather than spreading them out across
the landscape in a "sprawl" pattern.
Figure IV, 12a Neighborhood Cluster
§ 241-12 SARATOGA SPRINGS CODE § 241-12
C:842
Figure IV, 12b Hamlet Cluster
[6] The dominant visual context from the rural roads should
be of natural and agricultural features, with structures
visually subservient. Typically development should be
interior lot development with 70% of the immediate
highway view shed preserved.
[7] The following structural guidelines apply only to
structures in conservation subdivisions, which are also
located in architectural review districts. The intent in
these areas is to have the mass and roof forms of
structures contribute to the rural character of the
development. These guidelines are examples of the
preferred way to design and site uses but they should not
considered the only acceptable solution.
[a] Massing of structures or structural elements
influences rural character. Historically, rural buildings
were often an assemblage of additions. These
additions over time created a complexity of roof forms
that have become icons associated with our rural
agrarian environments.
§ 241-12 CHARTER § 241-12
C:843
[b] Rural roof form options include, but are not limited to,
symmetrically pitched or hip roofs with or without
gables and horse barn-type roof ends.
Figure IV, 13 Roof Forms
(d) Circulation systems. Circulation systems are comprised of both
vehicular and pedestrian systems. In general, rural vehicular
and pedestrian systems are curvilinear in alignment, a pattern
that evolved out of historic systems following the lines of least
resistance (e.g., stream corridors) following natural landforms.
It is only in more urbanized conditions that roads and streets
should take on geometric forms reflecting the built
environments they move through.
Figure IV, 14 Curvilinear road alignments are created
by following the line of least topographic resistance
[1] Whenever possible, roads (and the resultant lot layout)
should be planned and designed so the site's cultural and
environmental features are preserved and enhanced.
[2] Vehicular and pedestrian circulation systems should retain
and reuse historic farm roads and lanes. This guideline
§ 241-12 SARATOGA SPRINGS CODE § 241-12
C:844
allows a development to build upon the site's historic
context while minimizing clearing and disruption of the
landscape. Care should be taken to apply this guideline
only where its implementation would not destroy the
historic lanes, hedgerows and stonewalls it was meant to
preserve.
[3] Otherwise, vehicular and pedestrian circulation systems
should be arranged to reflect the patterns of the site
landform, vegetation, water bodies and vegetation
massing.
Figure IV, 15a Subdivision Roads: Form responds to
and enhances natural rural character. Features
such as streams, vegetation and landform are
incorporated into the design.
Figure IV, 15b Subdivision Roads: Design using
arbitrary geometric forms that require the removal
of existing vegetation and dramatic alteration of
site character and/or topography.
[4] Minimize clearing of vegetation at the edge of the road,
clearing only as much as is necessary to create a driveway
§ 241-12 CHARTER § 241-12
C:845
§ 241-13. Cluster development.
entrance with adequate sight distance. Use curves in the
driveway to increase the screening of buildings.
[5] Rural road edges are historically unprotected (e.g., no
curbs or gutters, with only a shoulder for user safety).
[6] Trail systems connecting destination areas should be
comprised of flexible materials (e.g., asphalt, stone dust,
bark) and connect areas of concentrated development.
[7] Trails should be informal in nature and occur in rear yards.
[8] Sidewalks should only be used to connect facilities within
areas of concentrated development.
A. Applicability. Clustering provisions are limited to the UR-1 and SR-2
Zoning.
B. Intent.
(1) The intent of this article is to permit variation in conjunction with a
proposed subdivision plat in lot size and housing type in suitable
areas in order to encourage flexibility of design, to enable land to
be developed in such a manner as to promote its most appropriate
use, to facilitate the adequate and economical provision of streets
and utilities and to preserve the natural and scenic qualities of
open space, in accordance with § 37 of the General City Law. This
purpose is achieved by permitting a reduction in lot sizes required
for the zoning district within which such development occurs while
maintaining the imposed density limitations through the provision
of open space. This chapter applies to all properties within.
(2) It is the intent of this article to promote energy conservation,
harmonious architectural design, better use of existing topography
and natural features, conservation of open spaces, recreational
development, solar access and design, and to provide for
economies inherent with cluster-type development and
conservation subdivisions.
C. Delegation to the Board. The power to approve, approve with
modifications or disapprove cluster zoning in accordance with the
intent established in Article II above, is granted to the Board in
accordance with Article 3, § 37 of the General City Law.
D. Purposes.
(1) Residential amenity.
(a) High-quality site design resulting from flexible site and lot
standards.
§ 241-12 SARATOGA SPRINGS CODE § 241-13
C:846
(b) Creation of open space usable for recreation, either active or
passive.
(2) Conservation.
(a) Preservation of significant natural and man-made
characteristics of the site.
(b) Preservation of floodplains slopes subject to erosion, and other
environmentally sensitive areas.
(3) Efficient and economic use of land resources.
(4) Comprehensive land use planning.
(a) Coordination with City of Saratoga Springs Comprehensive
Plan and other applicable County, state, federal and regional
plans and programs.
(b) Maintenance of the residential character of Saratoga Springs,
while increasing the variety of housing opportunities available.
(c) Development or redevelopment of land in a manner
appropriate to the special characteristics of each site and
present and future needs of the City.
E. General conditions. [Amended 8-3-1999]
(1) Clustering shall apply only to single-family detached residential
developments within the UR-1 or SR-2 residential zoning district
where single-family detached units are permitted. In no case will
other housing types be permitted.
(2) In determining the allowed density of a conservation subdivision,
the Board shall require the submission of a conventional
subdivision plan showing the maximum number of lots that could
reasonably be approved in conformance with the zoning and
subdivision regulations for the district the project is proposed, and
taking into account natural resource constraints such as slopes and
wetlands. The number of lots that can be developed in accordance
with such a plan shall be known as and constitute the base density
for the subdivision.
(3) Density of residential units shall not exceed the base density as
calculated in Article IV, § 241-12(B)1, except that the Board may
allow up to 20% greater density where it finds that:
(a) The project provides exceptional open space or public
recreation benefits. Examples of such benefits include the
provision of a new recreational opportunity available to the
public in an area where there has not been such an
opportunity; the provision of public access to an important
§ 241-13 CHARTER § 241-13
C:847
natural or park area; and the permanent protection of an
important environmental resource.
(b) The project provides a desirable mix of affordable housing.
Examples of such a mix include the provision of at least 20% of
the housing mix below the median housing price. Such houses
or lots shall be set aside for purchase by low and moderateincome
households, as those terms are currently defined by the
City's Community Development Office. The Board may
establish such other conditions with respect to the purchase
and occupancy of affordable housing, as it deems appropriate.
(c) The decision to allow such bonus shall be at the sole discretion
of the Board.
(4) Clustering may be applied to subdivisions of any size.
F. Application procedures [Amended 8-3-1999]
(1) A subdivider may request the use of this section at any time during
the subdivision review process. The process and procedures shall
be identical to those found in the current edition of the Subdivision
Regulations of the City of Saratoga Springs. The Board shall review
modifications in dimensional requirements of the City zoning
requirements according to the provisions of § 37 of the General
City Law.
G. Standards governing clustering. Any average-density development
considered shall conform to the following standards which are to be
regarded as minimum requirements: [Amended 8-3-1999]
(1) The Board shall determine that a cluster development or
conservation subdivision will not be detrimental to the health,
safety or general welfare of persons residing in the vicinity, or
injurious to property or improvements in close proximity, and that
the proposed development is in conformity with the objectives of
the City's Comprehensive Plan, and that the gross density will be
no greater than if the tract were developed in accordance with the
existing zoning requirements.
(2) When such development is proposed adjacent to any existing
residence or residential area, a suitable buffer area, as the Board
determines, but at least the same distance as the minimum rear or
side yard setback in the district in which the project is located,
shall be left between the closest lot line of any lot in an existing
residential development area or a conventionally platted
residential map that has been filed with the Saratoga County Clerk,
and the closest structure in the residential cluster development
contained on a clustered lot.
(3) There shall be no other setback requirements except as specified in
§ 240-4.12B. Zero lot lines are allowed.
§ 241-13 SARATOGA SPRINGS CODE § 241-13
C:848
(4) The development shall have dedicated, as a minimum, for open
space purposes the same percentage of the entire tract as that by
which the lots have on the average been reduced. The area
dedicated for open space purposes, including playgrounds and
parks, shall be in a location and shape approved by the Board
during subdivision review and in addition, the Board, as a condition
of approval, may establish such conditions on the ownership, use
and maintenance of such open space lands as it deems necessary to
assure the preservation of such lands for their intended purpose.
(5) Lots in a conservation subdivision may be of any size.
(6) All the land not contained in the lots or the road right-of-way, if
provided, shall be contiguous and of such size and shape as to be
usable for recreation, either passive or active.
(a) Such land may:
[1] Be dedicated to the City, provided the City is willing to
accept such dedication;
[2] Be transferred to a not-for-profit corporation approved by
the Attorney General's Office, pursuant to § 352(e) of the
General Business Law, comprised of owners of lots within
the development; or
[3] Be transferred to a bona fide charitable not-for-profit
corporation whose purposes include the acceptance of
land for open space, conservation, protection of
environmentally sensitive areas, or the like.
(b) The applicant shall notify the Board of its intention prior to the
grant of final subdivision approval, and shall supply the Board
with such reasonable documentation that it may request
evidencing its intentions and indicating the ability and/or
willingness on the part of the proposed recipient to receive
such lands for such purpose.
(c) The applicant may be required by the Board to incorporate into
the deeds of all property within the development a clause
giving to the owners an easement or other interest in such
open land which shall be used for recreation or other like
purposes and, further, provide the City of Saratoga Springs
with an easement providing for the same, which may be
enforced by the City to insure the continued use of the
property as common area. No structure save those incidental
to the recreational functions shall be permitted thereon.
(d) Common open space shall, unless otherwise waived by the
Board, be directly accessible to each residential unit.
§ 241-13 CHARTER § 241-13
C:849
(e) The open space lands shall be subject to taxation, unless
deeded to the City or to a qualified charitable corporation.
(7) In the event that the organization established to own and maintain
common property, or any successor organization, shall fail to
maintain the common property in reasonable order and condition
in accordance with the plan, the City may assume responsibility for
such maintenance and assess the cost equally against the
properties within the development.
(8) The developer shall be responsible for maintaining open space until
such time as it is legally accepted by the City, HOA or other
designated entity.

Administrative Procedures
§ 241-14. Administration.
A. These provisions provide regulations relating to procedures that can be
accomplished by the staff of the City Planning Office and the
Chairperson of the Board. The Chairperson and City Planning staff shall
determine the applicability, if any, of these administrative provisions.
B. Minor amendments to approved and filed subdivision plats or legally
existing lots. Minor amendments to approved and filed subdivision plats
or legally existing lots shall require review by the City Planning Office
and the Board Chairperson. Minor amendments may include lot line
adjustments, and nonsubstantive changes to an existing approved
subdivision and must be reviewed and approved by the Board
Chairperson. The adjustment cannot result in a configuration that
violates any provision of the City Zoning Ordinance60 or any zoning
variance granted by the Zoning Board of Appeals. Any amendment
deemed substantive by the Board Chairperson in consultation with the
City Planning Office will require review and determination for action
from the Planning Board.
C. The Chairperson shall provide a written account of administrative
determinations actions taken at the next regular meeting of the Board
subsequent to the date of the determination and/or action. This report

ARTICLE VI
Variances, modifications and review
§ 241-15. Consideration of variances.
A. Where the Board finds that because of unusual circumstances of shape,
topography or other physical features of the proposed subdivision or
because of the nature of adjacent developments, extraordinary
hardship may result from strict compliance with this chapter, it may
waive certain requirements of this chapter so that substantial justice
may be done and the public interest secured, provided that no such
waiver shall be granted which will have the effect of nullifying the
intent and purpose of the Official Map, Zoning Ordinance,61 this
chapter, or ordinances of the City.
B. In granting changes and modifications, the Board may require such
conditions as will, in its judgment, secure substantially the objectives of
the standards or requirements so changed or modified.
C. Any officer, Department or Board of the City, with specific approval of
the City Council, or any person or persons, jointly or severally
aggrieved by any decision of the Board concerning a plat decision, may
bring a proceeding to review such decision in the manner provided by
Article 78 of the Civil Practice Law and Rules in a Court of Record on
the ground that such decision is illegal or improper in whole or in part.
Such proceeding must be commenced within 30 days after the signing
of the subdivision plat plan.

ARTICLE VII
Waiver
§ 241-16. Granting of waiver.
The Board may waive, subject to appropriate conditions or guarantees,
for such period as it may determine, the provision of any or all such
improvements as in its judgment of the special circumstances of a particular
plat or plats are not requisite in the interests of the public health, safety
and general welfare. The Board may not waive improvements which the
public interest requires. The Planning Board shall not approve exceptions
or waivers of conditions unless it shall make the findings based upon the
evidence presented to the Board that in each specific case:
A. The granting of the exception or the waiver will not be detrimental to
the public safety, health, or welfare or injurious to other property.
B. The conditions upon which the request is based are unique to the
property for which the relief is sought and are not applicable, generally,
to the other property.
C. Because of the particular physical surroundings, shape, or
topographical condition of the property involved, a particular difficulty
for the owner would result, as distinguished from a mere
inconvenience, if a strict interpretation of this chapter were carried out.
D. The relief sought will not, in any manner, vary the provisions of the City
of Saratoga Springs Zoning Ordinance,62 Comprehensive Plan or
Official Map, except that those documents may be amended in the
manner prescribed by law.

§ 242-1. Findings of fact.
It is hereby determined that:
A. Land disturbance activities and associated increases in site impervious
cover often alter the hydrologic response of local watersheds and
increase stormwater runoff rates and volumes, flooding, stream
channel erosion, or sediment transport and deposition;
B. This stormwater runoff contributes to increased quantities of
waterborne pollutants, including siltation of aquatic habitat for fish and
other desirable species;
C. Clearing and grading during construction tends to increase soil erosion
and add to the loss of native vegetation necessary for terrestrial and
aquatic habitat;
D. Improper design and construction of stormwater management
practices can increase the velocity of stormwater runoff thereby
increasing stream bank erosion and sedimentation;
E. Impervious surfaces allow less water to percolate into the soil, thereby
decreasing groundwater recharge and stream base flow;
F. Substantial economic losses can result from these adverse impacts on
the waters of the municipality;
G. Stormwater runoff, soil erosion and non-point source pollution can be
controlled and minimized through the regulation of stormwater runoff
from land disturbance activities;
H. The regulation of stormwater runoff discharges from land disturbance
activities in order to control and minimize increases in stormwater
runoff rates and volumes, soil erosion, stream channel erosion, and nonpoint
source pollution associated with stormwater runoff is in the public
interest and will minimize threats to public health and safety;
I. Regulation of land disturbance activities by means of performance
standards governing stormwater management and site design will
produce development compatible with the natural functions of a

B. Require land disturbance activities to conform to the substantive
requirements of the New York State Department of Environmental
Conservation State Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (SPDES)
General Permit for Construction Activities GP-0-10-001 or as amended
or revised;
C. Minimize increases in stormwater runoff from land disturbance
activities in order to reduce flooding, siltation, increases in stream
temperature, and streambank erosion and maintain the integrity of
stream channels;
D. Minimize increases in pollution caused by stormwater runoff from land
disturbance activities which would otherwise degrade local water
quality;
E. Minimize the total annual volume of stormwater runoff which flows
from any specific site during and following development to the
maximum extent practicable; and

D. Maintenance agreements. The City of Saratoga Springs shall approve a
formal maintenance agreement for stormwater management facilities
binding on all subsequent landowners and recorded in the office of the
County Clerk as a deed restriction on the property prior to final plan
approval. The maintenance agreement shall be consistent with the
terms and conditions of Schedule A of this chapter entitled Sample
Stormwater Control Facility Maintenance Agreement. The City of
Saratoga Springs, in lieu of a maintenance agreement, at its sole
discretion may accept dedication of any existing or future stormwater
management facility, provided such facility meets all the requirements
of this chapter and includes adequate and perpetual access and
sufficient area, by easement or otherwise, for inspection and regular
maintenance.
A. Construction inspection.
(1) Erosion and sediment control inspection.
(a) The City of Saratoga Springs Stormwater Management Officer
may conduct such inspections as necessary to determine
compliance with this chapter and may either approve that
portion of the work completed or notify the applicant wherein
the work fails to comply with the requirements of this chapter
and the stormwater pollution prevention plan (SWPPP) as
approved. To schedule inspections, the applicant must notify
the Stormwater Management Officer at least 48 hours in
advance before any of the following as required by the
Stormwater Management Officer:
[1] Start of construction.
[2] Installation of sediment and erosion control measures.
[3] Completion of site clearing.
[4] Completion of rough grading.
[5] Completion of final grading.
[6] Close of the construction season.
[7] Completion of final landscaping.
[8] Successful establishment of landscaping in public areas.
(b) If any violations are found, the applicant and developer shall be
notified in writing of the nature of the violation and the
§ 242-9 CHARTER § 242-10
C:865
required corrective actions. No further work shall be
conducted except for site stabilization until any violations are
corrected and all work previously completed has received
approval by the Stormwater Management Officer.
(2) Stormwater management practice inspections. The City of
Saratoga Springs Stormwater Management Officer is responsible
for conducting inspections of stormwater management practices
(SMPs) after final construction is completed. All applicants are
required to submit "as built" plans for any stormwater management
practices located on site. The plan must show the final design
specifications for all stormwater management facilities and must
be certified by a professional engineer verifying all practices have
been constructed in conformance with the SWPPP and are
operational.
(3) Inspection of stormwater facilities after project completion.
Inspection programs shall be established on any reasonable basis,
including but not limited to: routine inspections; random
inspections; inspections based upon complaints or other notice of
possible violations; inspection of drainage basins or areas
identified as higher than typical sources of sediment or other
contaminants or pollutants; inspections of businesses or industries
of a type associated with higher than usual discharges of
contaminants or pollutants or with discharges of a type which are
more likely than the typical discharge to cause violations of state or
federal water or sediment quality standards or the SPDES
stormwater permit; and joint inspections with other agencies
inspecting under environmental or safety laws. Inspections may
include, but are not limited to: reviewing maintenance and repair
records; sampling discharges, surface water, groundwater, and
material or water in drainage control facilities; and evaluating the
condition of drainage control facilities and other stormwater
management practices.
(4) Submission of reports. The City of Saratoga Springs Stormwater
Management Officer may require monitoring and reporting from
entities subject to this chapter as are necessary to determine
compliance with this chapter.
(5) Right-of-entry for inspection. When any new stormwater
management facility is installed on private property or when any
new connection is made between private property and the public
stormwater system, the landowner shall grant to the City of
Saratoga Springs the right to enter the property at reasonable
times and in a reasonable manner for the purpose of inspection as
specified in Subsection A(3).
B. Performance guarantee.
§ 242-10 SARATOGA SPRINGS CODE § 242-10
C:866
(1) Construction completion guarantee. In order to ensure the full and
faithful completion of all land disturbance activities related to
compliance with all conditions set forth by the City of Saratoga
Springs in its approval of the stormwater pollution prevention plan,
the City of Saratoga Springs may require the applicant or
developer to provide, prior to construction, cash escrow, or
irrevocable letter of credit from an appropriate financial or surety
institution which guarantees satisfactory completion of the project
and names the City of Saratoga Springs as the beneficiary. The
security shall be in an amount to be determined by City of Saratoga
Springs based on submission of final design plans, with reference
to actual construction and landscaping costs. The performance
guarantee shall remain in force until the surety is released from
liability by the City of Saratoga Springs, provided that such period
shall not be less than one year from the date of final acceptance or
such other certification that the facility(ies) have been constructed
in accordance with the approved plans and specifications and that
a one-year inspection has been conducted and the facilities have
been found to be acceptable to the City of Saratoga Springs. Perannum
interest on cash escrow deposits shall be reinvested in the
account until the surety is released from liability.
(2) Maintenance guarantee. Where stormwater management and
erosion and sediment control facilities are to be operated and
maintained by the developer or by a corporation that owns or
manages a commercial or industrial facility, the developer, prior to
construction, may be required to provide the City of Saratoga
Springs with an irrevocable letter of credit from an approved
financial institution or surety to ensure proper operation and
maintenance of all stormwater management and erosion control
facilities both during and after construction, and until the facilities
are removed from operation. If the developer or landowner fails to
properly operate and maintain stormwater management and
erosion and sediment control facilities, the City of Saratoga Springs
may draw upon the account to cover the costs of proper operation
and maintenance, including engineering and inspection costs.
(3) Recordkeeping. The City of Saratoga Springs may require entities
subject to this chapter to maintain records demonstrating
compliance with this chapter.
C. Enforcement and penalties.
(1) Notice of violation. When the City of Saratoga Springs determines
that a land disturbance activity is not being carried out in
accordance with the requirements of this chapter, it may issue a
written notice of violation to the landowner. The notice of violation
shall contain:
(a) The name and address of the landowner, developer or

appealed to the municipality by filing a written notice of appeal
within 15 days of service of notice of violation.
(2) Stop-work orders. The City of Saratoga Springs may issue a stopwork
order for violations of this chapter. Persons receiving a stopwork
order shall be required to halt all land disturbance activities,
except those activities that address the violations leading to the
stop-work order. The stop-work order shall be in effect until the
City of Saratoga Springs confirms that the land disturbance activity
is in compliance and the violation has been satisfactorily
addressed. Failure to address a stop-work order in a timely manner
may result in civil, criminal, or monetary penalties in accordance
with the enforcement measures authorized in this chapter.
(3) Violations. Any land disturbance activity that is commenced or is
conducted contrary to this chapter may be restrained by injunction
or otherwise abated in a manner provided by law.
(4) Penalties for offenses.
(a) In addition to or as an alternative to any penalty provided
herein or by law, any person who violates the provisions of this
chapter shall be guilty of a violation punishable by a fine not
exceeding $350 or imprisonment for a period not to exceed six
months, or both for conviction of a first offense; for conviction
of a second offense both of which were committed within a
period of five years, punishable by a fine not less than $350 nor

months, or both; and upon conviction for a third or subsequent
offense all of which were committed within a period of five
years, punishable by a fine not less than $700 nor more than
$1000 or imprisonment for a period not to exceed six months,

courts and judicial officers generally, violations of this chapter
shall be deemed misdemeanors and for such purpose only all
provisions of law relating to misdemeanors shall apply to such
