PREFACE 
    This Code constitutes a recodification of the general and permanent ordinances of the Borough of Audubon, New Jersey. 
    Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the 1992 Code and ordinances adopted by the board of commissioners. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this Code, the reader can locate any section of the 1992 Code and any ordinance included herein. 
    The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order, and the various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Notes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state law have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this Code. 
Chapter and Section Numbering System 
    The chapter and section numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and local government codes. Each section number consists of two parts separated by a dash. The figure before the dash refers to the chapter number, and the figure after the dash refers to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the second section of chapter 1 is numbered 1-2, and the first section of chapter 6 is 6-1. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter, and at the same time new sections can be inserted in their proper place by using the decimal system for amendments. For example, if new material consisting of one section that would logically come between sections 6-1 and 6-2 is desired to be added, such new section would be numbered 6-1.5. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject. The next successive number shall be assigned to the new article or division. New chapters may be included by using one of the reserved chapter numbers. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. 
Page Numbering System 
    The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the volume. The number to the right of the colon represents the number of the page in that portion. In the case of a chapter of the Code, the number to the left of the colon indicates the number of the chapter. In the case of an appendix to the Code, the letter immediately to the left of the colon indicates the letter of the appendix. The following are typical parts of codes of ordinances, which may or may not appear in this Code at this time, and their corresponding prefixes: 
CODE CD1:1 CODE APPENDIX CDA:1 CODE COMPARATIVE TABLES CCT:1 STATE LAW REFERENCE TABLE SLT:1 CODE INDEX CDi:1  
Index 
    The index has been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the index itself that stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which the user is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
    A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up to date. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited, and the affected page or pages will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
    Keeping this publication up to date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. As revised pages are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
Acknowledgments 
    This publication was under the direct supervision of Roger D. Merriam, Senior Code Attorney, and Howard George, Editor, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida. Credit is gratefully given to the other members of the publisher's staff for their sincere interest and able assistance throughout the project. 
    The publisher is most grateful to Mr. Salvatore J. Siciliano, Borough Solicitor, Mr. Dave Taraschi, Borough Administrator, and the entire borough staff for cooperation and assistance during the progress of the work on this publication. It is hoped that their efforts and those of the publisher have resulted in a Code of Ordinances which will make the active law of the borough readily accessible to all citizens and which will be a valuable tool in the day-to-day administration of the borough's affairs.

Sec. 58-1. - Exemption of improvements for older housing. 
(a)  Purpose. The Five-Year Exemption and Abatement Law (N.J.S.A. 40A:21-1 et seq.) enables municipalities to exempt from taxation an improvement project from ten thousand dollars ($10,000.00) to twenty-five thousand dollars ($25,000.00) of assessed value for a single-family dwelling residential housing twenty (20) years old or older for a period of five (5) years; and the Borough of Audubon has determined that this tax incentive should be utilized in order to counteract trends toward deterioration in residential neighborhoods. 
(b)  Exemption allowed. The tax assessor is hereby directed to allow tax exemptions throughout the entire Borough, in accordance with the Five-Year Exemption and Abatement Law (N.J.S.A. 40A:21-1 et seq.) for qualified residential single-family housing. 
(c)  Determining the value of real property. In determining the value of real property for the purpose of taxation, an assessed improvement of least ten thousand dollars ($10,000.00) up to twenty-five thousand dollars ($25,000.00) of the assessor's full and true value of home improvement, for each single-family dwelling unit more than twenty (20) years old, primarily and directly affected by the home improvement, shall be regarded as not increasing the value of such property for a period of five (5) years, notwithstanding that the value of the dwelling to which such improvements are made is increased thereby. 
(d)  Assessment not to be less than pervious assessment. In no event, however, shall the assessment during that period be less than the assessment thereon existing immediately prior to such home improvements unless there shall be damage through action of the elements sufficient to warrant a reduction. 
(e)  Assessment true value of improvement. The above assessed amount, determined by the tax assessor on October 1 of any year following the completion of the improvements, shall be the true value of the improvement and shall continue to be so treated for each of the five (5) years subsequent to the original determination by the tax assessor. 
(f)  Tax period of exemption. No exemption shall be granted until such time as the value of an improvement exceeds ten thousand dollars ($10,000.00) of additional assessed value. Additional improvements, completed during a period in which the improved property is subject to a previously granted exemption privilege, shall not be qualified for additional deduction privileges under terms and conditions therein specified, during the five-year tax period. 
(g)  Filing of written application for exemption. A claimant desiring to seek the exemption to the above shall file a written application with the tax assessor of the borough pursuant to N.J.S.A. 40A:21-16, within thirty (30) days of completion of the improvement, conversion, alternation or construction.

(1)  The property is in need of rehabilitation in the reasonable judgment of the mayor and no rehabilitation has taken place during that same six-month period; or

a.  The property has been found to be unfit for human habitation, occupancy or use pursuant to N.J.S.A. 40:48-2.3; 
b.  The condition and vacancy of the property materially increases the risk of fire to the property and adjacent properties; 
c.  The property is subject to unauthorized entry leading to potential health and safety hazards; the owner has failed to take reasonable and necessary measures to secure the property; or the municipality has secured the property in order to prevent such hazards after the owner has failed to do so; 
d.  The presence of vermin or the accumulation of debris, uncut vegetation or physical deterioration of the structure or grounds have created potential health and safety hazards and the owner has failed to take reasonable and necessary measures to remove the hazards; or 
e.  The dilapidated appearance or other condition of the property materially affects the welfare, including the economic welfare, of the residents of the area in close proximity to the property, and the owner has failed to take reasonable and necessary measures to remedy the conditions.

(Ord. No. 2013:02, 7-16-2013) 
Sec. 105-132. - Establishment of abandoned property list. 
(a)  The mayor shall identify abandoned property within the Borough of Audubon for the purpose of establishing an abandoned property list. The abandoned property list shall include, for each abandoned property identified, the tax block and lot number, the name of the owner of record, if known, and the street address of the lot. The mayor may add properties to the abandoned property list at any time, and may delete properties at any time when he or she finds that the property no longer meets the definition of an abandoned property. 
(b)  An abandoned property shall not be included on the abandoned property list if rehabilitation is being performed in a timely manner, as evidenced by building permits issued and diligent pursuit of rehabilitation work authorized by those permits. A property on which an entity other than the Borough of Audubon has purchased or taken assignment from the borough of a tax sale certificate which has been placed on the abandoned property list may be removed if the owner of the certificate pays all municipal taxes and liens due on the property within thirty (30) days after the property is placed on the list; provided, however, that if the owner of the certificate fails to initiate foreclosure proceedings within six (6) months after the property was first placed on the list, the property shall be restored to the abandoned property list in accordance with the provisions of N.J.S.A. .55:19-103. 
(c)  The mayor shall establish the abandoned property list and any additions or deletions thereto by authorizing the publication of the list in the official newspaper of the Borough of Audubon, which publication shall constitute public notice, and, within ten (10) days after publication, shall send a notice, by certified mail, return receipt requested, and by regular mail, to the owner of record of every property included on the list. The published and mailed notices shall identify property determined to be abandoned setting forth the owner of record, if known, the tax lot and block number and street address. The mayor, in consultation with the tax collector, shall also send out a notice by regular mail to any mortgagee, servicing organization, or property tax processing organization that receives a duplicate copy of the tax bill pursuant to N.J.S.A. 54:4-64(d). When the owner of record is not known for a particular property and cannot be ascertained by the exercise of reasonable diligence by the tax collector, notice shall not be mailed but instead shall be posted on the property in the manner as provided in N.J.S.A. 40:48-2.7. The mailed notice shall indicate the factual basis for the mayor's finding that the property is abandoned property as that term is defined herein and in N.J.S.A. 55:19-54, and shall specify the information relied upon in making such finding. In all cases a copy of the mailed or posted notice shall also be filed by the mayor in the office of the Camden County Clerk. This filing shall have the same force and effect as a formal notice under N.J.S.A. 2A:15-6. The notice shall be captioned with the name of the Borough of Audubon as "plaintiff' and the name of the property owner as "defendant," as though an action had been commenced by the borough against the owner. 
(d)  An owner or lien holder may challenge the inclusion of his property on the abandoned property list by appealing that determination to the mayor within thirty (30) days of the owner's receipt of the certified notice or forty (40) days from the date upon which the notice was sent. An owner whose identity was not known to the mayor shall have forty (40) days from the date upon which notice was published or posted, whichever is later, to challenge the inclusion of a property on the abandoned property list. For good cause shown, the mayor shall accept a late filing of an appeal. Within thirty (30) days of receipt of a request for an appeal of the findings contained in the notice, the mayor shall schedule a hearing for redetermination of the matter. Any property included on the list shall be presumed to be abandoned property unless the owner, through the submission of an affidavit or certification asserting that the property, can demonstrate that the property was erroneously included on the list. The affidavit or certification shall be accompanied by supporting documentation such as, but not limited to, photographs, repair invoices, bills and construction contracts. The sole ground for appeal shall be that the property in question is not abandoned property as that term is defined herein and in N.J.S.A. 55:19-54. The mayor shall decide any timely filed appeal within ten (10) days of the hearing on the appeal and shall promptly, by certified mail, return receipt requested, and by regular mail, notify the property owner of the decision and the reasons therefore. 
(e)  The property owner may challenge an adverse determination of an appeal with the mayor pursuant to subsection (d) of this section, by instituting, in accordance with the New Jersey Court Rules, a summary trial proceeding in the Superior Court, Camden County. Such action shall be instituted within twenty (20) days of the date of the notice of decision mailed by the mayor. The sole ground for appeal and new hearing before the superior court shall be that the property in question is not an abandoned property as that term is defined in N.J.S.A. 55:19-54. The failure to institute an action of appeal on a timely basis shall constitute a jurisdictional bar to challenging the adverse determination, except that, for good cause shown, the court may extend the deadline for instituting the action. 
(f)  The mayor shall promptly remove any property from the abandoned property list that has been determined by him or on appeal not to be abandoned and may, in his discretion, remove properties from said list whenever he deems such removal appropriate under the circumstances. 
(g)  The abandoned property list shall become effective, and the Borough of Audubon shall have the right to pursue any legal remedy with respect to properties on the list, at any time after at least one (1) property has been placed on the list and following the expiration of the period for appeal with respect to that first property or upon the denial of an appeal brought by the property owner of that first property.

Sec. 105-133. - Interested parties may request additions to the abandoned property list. 
(a)  Any interested party may submit a written request to the mayor asserting that any property within the Borough of Audubon should be included on the abandoned property list. The written request must specify the street address and block and lot number of the property to be included, and the grounds for its inclusion. Within thirty (30) days of receipt of any such request, the mayor shall provide a written response to the party, either indicating that the property will be added to the list or, if not, the reasons for not adding the property. For the purposes of this section, the term "interested parties" shall include any resident of the Borough of Audubon, any owner or operator of a business within the Borough of Audubon or any organization representing the interests of residents, business owners or otherwise engaged in furthering the revitalization and improvement of the neighborhood in which the property is located. 
(b)  Any interested party may participate in a redetermination hearing regarding the inclusion of a property on the abandoned property list. Upon written request by any interested party, the mayor shall provide that party with at least twenty (20) days notice of any such hearing. The party shall provide the mayor with notice at least ten (10) days before the hearing of its intention to participate, and the nature of the testimony or other information that is proposes to submit at the hearing.

(d)  Violations of this article shall be punishable, upon conviction, by one (1) or more of the following in the discretion of the court: a fine of not to exceed one thousand dollars ($1,000.00); imprisonment for a period of not to exceed ninety (90) days; a period of community service of not to exceed ninety (90) days.

(1)  By posting cash or a bond equal to the cost of remediating all conditions because of which the property has been determined to be abandoned pursuant to N.J.S.A. 55:19-55 and by posting cash or a bond to cover the cost of any environmental cleanup required on the property, evidenced by a certification by a licensed engineer retained by the owner and reviewed and approved by the mayor, stating that the cash or bond adequately covers the cost of the cleanup; or 
(2)  By demonstrating to the satisfaction of both the mayor and borough commissioners that the conditions rendering the property abandoned have been remediated in full; provided, however, that where the mayor finds that the owner is actively engaged in remediating the conditions because of which the property was determined to be abandoned, as evidenced by significant rehabilitation activity on the property, the mayor may grant an extension of time of not more than one hundred twenty (120) days for the owner to complete all work, during which time no further proceedings will be taken against the owner or the property. 
(b)  If the owner has posted cash or a bond in order to have a property removed from the abandoned property list and the conditions because of which the property was determined to be abandoned have not been fully remediated within one (1) year of the date of posting the cash or bond, or, in the case of a property which requires a remediation of any known, suspected or threatened release of contaminants, if the owner has failed to enter into a memorandum of agreement with the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection or an administrative consent order, as the case may be, or if an agreement or order is in effect but the owner has failed to perform the remediation in conformance with the agreement or order, then the cash or bond shall be forfeited to the borough which shall use the cash or bond and any interest which has accrued thereon for the purpose of demolishing or rehabilitating the property or performing the environmental remediation. Any funds remaining after the property has been demolished, rehabilitated or cleaned up shall be returned to the owner. 
(Ord. No. 2013:02, 7-16-2013) 
Sec. 105-136. - Sale of restricted tax liens. 
(a)  Notwithstanding the provisions of N.J.S.A. 54:5-19, or the provisions of any other law to the contrary, if a property is included on the abandoned property list and the property taxes or other borough liens due on the property are delinquent for six (6) or more quarters as of the date of expiration of the right to appeal the property's inclusion on the list, or, if an appeal has been filed, as of the date that all opportunities for appeal of inclusion on the list have been exhausted, then the tax lien on the property may be sold in accordance with the procedures of the "Tax Sale Law," N.J.S.A. 54:5-1 et seq., on or after the ninetieth day following the expiration of that time of appeal or final determination on an appeal. 
(b)  The Borough of Audubon may, at its option, require that the sale of the tax sale certificate or any subsequent assignment or transfer of a tax sale certificate held by the borough be subject to the express condition that the purchaser or assignee shall be obliged to perform and conclude any rehabilitation or repairs necessary to remove the property from the abandoned property list pursuant to N.J.S.A. 55:19-55 and to post a bond in favor of the borough to guarantee the rehabilitation or repair of the property. The mayor may waive a requirement to post a bond imposed by the borough for any purchaser, assignee or transferee of a tax sale certificate that provides documentation acceptable to the mayor that the purchaser, assignee or transferee is a qualified rehabilitation entity as defined in N.J.S.A. 55:19-80. The cost of rehabilitation and repairs and the cost of the bond shall be added to the amount required to be paid by the owner for redemption of the property. The purchaser, assignee or transferee of the tax sale certificate who is required to rehabilitate and repair the property shall be required to file the appropriate affidavits with the tax collector, pursuant to N.J.S.A. 54:5-62, representing the amounts of monies expended periodically toward the rehabilitation or repair of the property. A purchaser, assignee or transferee shall be entitled to interest on the amounts expended, as set forth in the affidavits, at the delinquent rate of interest for delinquencies in excess of one thousand five hundred dollars ($1,500.00) in effect for the time period when the amounts were expended, pursuant to N.J.S.A. 54:4-67. The tax sale certificate purchaser, assignee or transferee, with the authority of the Borough of Audubon, shall be permitted to enter in and upon the property for the purposes of appraising the costs of rehabilitation and repair and to perform all other acts required to guarantee the completion of the rehabilitation or repair of the property. No rehabilitation or repair work shall be commenced, however, until proof of adequate liability insurance and an indemnification agreement, holding the Borough of Audubon harmless, has been filed with the mayor. 
(c)  If the Borough of Audubon acquires the tax sale certificate for a property on the abandoned property list, then, upon ten (10) days' written notice to the property owner and any mortgagee as of the date of the filing of the notice pursuant to N.J.S.A. 55:19-55, the borough shall be permitted to enter upon the property and remediate any conditions that caused the property to be included on the abandoned property list. No remediation shall be commenced, however, if within that ten-day period the owner or mortgagee shall have notified the borough in writing that the owner or mortgagee has elected to perform the remediation itself. When the owner or mortgagee elects to perform the remediation itself, it shall be required to post bond in favor of the Borough of Audubon in order to ensure performance. The amount and conditions of the bond shall be determined by the mayor. 
(d)  The cost of remediation incurred by the Borough of Audubon, as so certified by the entity incurring the cost upon completion of the remediation, shall constitute a lien upon the property first in time and right to any other lien, whether the other lien was filed prior to, or after the filing of any lien by the borough, except for borough taxes, liens and assessments and any lien imposed pursuant to the "Spill Compensation and Control Act," N.J.S.A. 58:10-23.11 et seq., together with any interest thereon. The certification of cost shall be filed and recorded as a lien by the entity incurring the cost with the Camden County Clerk. 
(e)  The clearance, development, redevelopment, or repair of property being maintained as an abandoned property pursuant to this article shall be considered a public purpose and public use, for which the power of eminent domain may be lawfully exercised.

Sec. 105-137. - Special tax sale and criteria for bidders. 
(a)  The Borough of Audubon may hold special tax sales with respect to those properties eligible for tax sale pursuant to N.J.S.A. 54:5-19 which are also on the abandoned property list. 
(b)  The mayor, with the advice and consent of the borough commissioners, shall establish criteria for eligibility to bid on properties at the sale, which may include, but need not be limited to: 
(1)  Documentation of the bidder's ability to rehabilitate or otherwise reuse the property consistent with borough's plans and regulations; commitments by the bidder to rehabilitate or otherwise reuse the property, consistent with borough's plans and regulations; 
(2)  Commitments by the bidder to take action to foreclose on the tax lien by a date certain; and 
(3)  Such other criteria as the mayor, with the advice and consent of the borough commissioners, may determine are necessary to ensure that the properties to be sold will be rehabilitated or otherwise reused in a manner consistent with the public interest. 
(c)  The mayor, with the advice and consent of the borough commissioners, may establish minimum bid requirements for a special tax sale that are less than the full amount of the taxes, interest and penalties due, to help ensure that the properties will be rehabilitated or otherwise utilized in a manner consistent with the public interest. 
(d)  The mayor, with the advice and consent of the borough commissioners, may combine properties in said special tax sale into bid packages, and require that bidders place a single bid on each package, rejecting any and all bids on individual properties that are submitted. 
(e)  The mayor, with the advice and consent of the borough commissioners, may sell said properties subject to provision that, if the purchaser fails to carry out any commitment that has been set forth as a condition of sale or misrepresents any material qualification that has been established as a condition of eligibility to bid pursuant thereto, then the properties and any interest thereto acquired by the purchaser shall revert to the borough, and any amount paid by the purchaser at the special tax sale shall be forfeit to the borough. 
(f)  In the event there are two (2) or more qualified bidders for any property or bid package in a special tax sale, the borough may designate the unsuccessful qualified bidder whose bid was closest to the successful bid, as an eligible purchaser. In the event that the selected purchaser of that property or bid package fails to meet any of the conditions of sale established by the borough pursuant and their interest in the property or properties reverts to the borough, the borough may subsequently designate the entity previously designated as an eligible purchaser as the winning bidder for the property or properties, and assign the tax sale certificates to that entity on the basis of that entity's bid at the special tax sale, subject to the terms and conditions of the special tax sale. 
(g)  The Borough of Audubon shall provide notice of a special tax sale pursuant to N.J.S.A. 54:5-26. The notice shall include any special terms of sale established by the borough pursuant to this section. Nothing shall prohibit the borough from holding a special tax sale on the same day as a standard or accelerated tax sale. 
(Ord. No. 2013:02, 7-16-2013) 
Sec. 105-138. - Expedited action to foreclose right of redemption. 
(a)  When a person or entity other than the Borough of Audubon acquires a tax sale certificate for a property on the abandoned property list at tax sale, the purchaser may institute an action to foreclose the right of redemption at any time after the expiration of just six (6) months following the date of the sale of the tax sale certificate. 
(b)  When the Borough of Audubon is the purchaser at tax sale of any property on the abandoned property list pursuant to N.J.S.A. 54:5-34, an action to foreclose the right of redemption may be instituted in accordance with the provisions of subsection b of N.J.S.A. 54:5-77. 
(c)  After the foreclosure action is instituted, the right to redeem shall exist and continue to exist until barred by the judgment of the superior court; provided, however, that no redemption shall be permitted except where the owner: 
(1)  Posts cash or a bond equal to the cost of remediating the conditions because of which the property was determined to be abandoned pursuant to N.J.S.A. 55:19-56, as determined by the court; or 
(2)  Demonstrates to the court that the conditions because of which the property was determined to be abandoned have been remedied in full. 
(Ord. No. 2013:02, 7-16-2013) 
Sec. 105-139. - Abandoned property status during expedited foreclosure. 
(a)  If an entity other than the Borough of Audubon has purchased or taken assignment from the borough of a tax sale certificate on a property that has not been legally occupied for a period of six (6) months, that property shall not be added to the abandoned property list under the following limited circumstances: 
(1)  The owner of the certificate has continued to pay all borough taxes and liens on the property in the tax year when due; and 
(2)  The owner of the certificate takes action to initiate foreclosure proceedings within six (6) months after the property is eligible for foreclosure pursuant to either subsection a or subsection b of N.J.S.A. 54:5-86, as appropriate, and diligently pursues foreclosure proceedings in a timely fashion thereafter. 
(b)  A property used on a seasonal basis shall be deemed abandoned only if it meets any two (2) of the additional criteria set forth in N.J.S.A. 55:19-81. 
(c)  A determination that a property is abandoned property under the provisions of this article and N.J.S.A. 55:19-78 et seq. shall not constitute a finding that the use of the property has been abandoned for purposes of municipal zoning or land use regulation. 
(d)  Upon the request of a purchaser or assignee of a tax sale certificate seeking to bar the right of redemption on an abandoned property pursuant to subsection b of N.J.S.A. 54:5-86, the mayor or the tax collector shall, in a timely fashion, provide the requester with a certification that the property fulfills the definition of an "abandoned property" according to the criteria established in N.J.S.A. 55:19-81 and N.J.S.A. 55:19-82.

(Ord. No. 2014-12, § 1, 10-21-2014) 
Sec. 105-140. - Summary action for control and possession of abandoned property. 
(a)  A summary action or other action to transfer possession and control of abandoned property in need of rehabilitation to the Borough of Audubon may be brought by the borough in the Superior Court, Camden County. If the court shall find that the property is abandoned and that the owner or party in interest has failed to submit and initiate a rehabilitation plan, then the court may authorize the borough to take possession and control of the property and to develop its own rehabilitation plan for the property. 
(b)  Where the borough has been granted possession and control, the borough may commence and maintain those further proceedings for the conservation, protection or disposal of the property, or any part thereof, that are required to rehabilitate the property, recoup the cost and expenses of rehabilitation, and for the sale of the property; provided, however, that the court shall not direct the sale of the property if the owner applies to the court for reinstatement of control and possession of the property as permitted by N.J.S.A. 55:19-92. 
(c)  Failure by the owner, mortgage holder or lien holder to submit a plan for rehabilitation to the borough, obtain appropriate construction permits or, in the alternative, submit formal applications for funding the cost of rehabilitation to local, state or federal agencies providing such funding within the initial six-month period, shall be deemed clear evidence that the owner has failed to take any action to further the rehabilitation of the property. 
(d)  An owner may defend against a complaint filed pursuant to N.J.S.A. 55:19-84 by submitting a plan for the rehabilitation and reuse of the property, which is the subject of the complaint and by posting a bond equal to one hundred twenty-five (125) percent of the amount determined by the mayor or the court to be the projected cost of rehabilitation. 
(e)  Any plan submitted by an owner to defend against a complaint shall be submitted within sixty (60) days after the complaint has been filed, unless the court provides the owner with an extension of time for good cause shown. A plan submitted by an owner pursuant to this section shall include, but not be limited to: 
(1)  A detailed financial feasibility analysis, including documentation of the economic feasibility of the proposed reuse, including operating budgets or resale prices, or both, as appropriate; 
(2)  A budget for the rehabilitation of the property, including sources and uses of funds, based on the terms and conditions of realistically available financing, including grants and loans; 
(3)  A timetable for the completion of rehabilitation and reuse of the property, including milestones for performance of major steps leading to and encompassing the rehabilitation and reuse of the property; and 
(4)  Documentation of the qualifications of the individuals and firms that will be engaged to carry out the planning, design, financial packaging, construction, and marketing or rental of the property. 
(f)  Where the court approves the rehabilitation plan of the owner or other party in interest, then it may appoint the mayor to act as monitor of compliance and progress. If the owner fails to carry out any step in the approved plan, then the borough may apply to the court to have the posted bond forfeited, to transfer possession of the building to the borough to complete the rehabilitation plan, and to grant authorization to use the bond proceeds for the rehabilitation. The owner or other party in interest shall provide bi-monthly reports to the mayor on its activities and progress toward rehabilitation and reuse of the property. 
(g)  If an owner is unsuccessful in defending against a complaint filed pursuant to N.J.S.A. 55:19-84, the mortgage holder or lien holder may seek to be designated in possession of the property by submitting a plan and posting a bond meeting the same conditions as set forth in N.J.S.A. 55:19-87. Their plan must be submitted within sixty (60) days following the court's rejection of the owner's plan, unless the court provides the mortgage holder or lien holder with an extension of time for good cause shown. If the court approves any such mortgage holder or lien holder's plan, it shall designate that party to be in possession of the property for purposes of ensuring its rehabilitation. 
(h)  The mortgage holder or lien holder, as the case may be, shall provide bi-monthly reports to the court and the mayor on its activities and progress toward rehabilitation and reuse of the property. If the mortgage holder or lien holder fails to carry out any material step in the approved plan, then the mayor shall notify the court, which may order the posted bond forfeit, grant the borough possession of the property, and authorize the borough to use the proceeds of the bond for rehabilitation of the property. 
(i)  Any sums incurred or advanced for the purpose of rehabilitating the property by a mortgage holder or lien holder granted possession of a property, including court costs and reasonable attorney's fees, may be added to the unpaid balance due to that mortgage holder or lien holder, with interest calculated at the same rate set forth in the note or security agreement; or, in the case of a tax lien holder, at the statutory interest rate for subsequent liens. 
(j)  If no mortgage holder or lien holder meets the conditions of N.J.S.A. 55:19-88, then the Borough may submit a plan to the court which conforms with the provisions of N.J.S.A. 55:19-87. Such plan shall designate whether the borough or a qualified rehabilitation entity shall undertake the rehabilitation plan in accordance with the provisions of N.J.S.A. 55:19-90.

Sec. 105-141. - Borough rehabilitation or designation of qualified rehabilitation entity. 
(a)  The mayor, with the advice and consent of the borough commissioners, may designate a qualified rehabilitation entity for the purpose of exercising the borough's rights, where that designation will further the rehabilitation and reuse of the property consistent with borough's plans and objectives. 
(b)  Regardless of whether the borough exercises its rights directly or the mayor designates a qualified rehabilitation entity pursuant to this section, while in possession of a property, the borough shall maintain, safeguard, and maintain insurance on the property. Notwithstanding the borough's possession of the property, the owner of the property shall not be relieved of any civil or criminal liability or any duty imposed by reason of acts or omissions of the owner. 
(c)  The court may approve the borrowing of funds by the Borough of Audubon to rehabilitate the property and may grant a lien or security interests with priority over all other liens or mortgages other than municipal liens. Prior to granting this lien priority, the court must find as follows: 
(1)  The borough sought to obtain the necessary financing from the senior lien holder, which declined to provide such financing on reasonable terms; 
(2)  The borough sought to obtain a voluntary subordination from the senior lien holder, which refused to provide such subordination; and 
(3)  Lien priority is necessary in order to induce another lender to provide financing on reasonable terms. No lien authorized by the court shall take effect unless recorded with the clerk of Camden County. 
(d)  Where the borough has designated a qualified rehabilitation entity to act on its behalf, the qualified rehabilitation entity shall provide bi-monthly reports to the mayor on its activities and progress toward rehabilitation and reuse of the property. The borough or qualified rehabilitation entity, as the case may be, shall provide such reports to the court as the court determines to be necessary. If the court finds that the borough or its designee have failed to take diligent action toward rehabilitation of the property within one (1) year from the grant of possession, then the court may request that the borough to designate another qualified rehabilitation entity to exercise its rights, or if the borough fails to do so, may terminate the order of possession and return possession and control of the property to its owner. 
(e)  The Borough of Audubon shall file a notice of completion with the court, and shall also serve a copy on the owner and any mortgage holder or lien holder, at such time as the borough has determined that no more than six (6) months remain to the anticipated date on which rehabilitation will be complete. This notice shall include an affidavit of the mayor, attesting that the rehabilitation is anticipated to be completed within six (6) months, and a statement setting forth the actions as it plans to undertake consistent with the plan.

Sec. 105-142. - Petition for reinstatement of control and possession by owner. 
(a)  An owner may petition for reinstatement of the owner's control and possession of the property at any time after one (1) year from the court's removal of possession, but no later than thirty (30) days after the Borough of Audubon has filed a notice of completion with the court or, in the event the notice of completion is filed within less than one (1) year of the grant of possession, within thirty (30) days after the borough has filed said notice. 
(b)  The court may allow additional time for good cause if that additional time does not materially delay completion of the rehabilitation, place undue hardship on the borough or affect any of the terms or conditions under which the borough has applied for or received financing for the rehabilitation of the property. 
(c)  If the owner fails to petition for the reinstatement of control and possession of the property within thirty (30) days after the borough has filed a notice of completion or, in any event, within two (2) years after the initial grant of possession, or if the owner fails to meet any conditions that may be set by the court in granting a reinstatement petition, the court may grant the borough title or authorize the borough to sell the property, subject to the provisions of N.J.S.A. 55:19-96. 
(Ord. No. 2013:02, 7-16-2013) 
Sec. 105-143. - Procedure for borough to place liens, obtain title and sell property. 
(a)  The mayor, with the approval of the court, may place a lien on the property to cover any costs of the borough in connection with any proceeding under N.J.S.A. 55:19-78 et seq. incurred prior to the grant by the court of an order of possession, which may include costs incurred to stabilize or secure the property to ensure that it can be rehabilitated in a cost-effective manner. Any such lien shall be considered a borough lien for the purposes of N.J.S.A. 54:5-9, with the rights and status of a borough lien pursuant thereto. 
(b)  Where the borough seeks to gain title to the property, it shall purchase the property for fair market value on such terms as the court shall approve, and may place the proceeds of sale in escrow with the court. 
(c)  The court may authorize the Borough of Audubon to sell the building free and clear of liens, claims and encumbrances, in which event all such liens, claims and encumbrances shall be transferred to the proceeds of sale with the same priority as existed prior to resale in accordance with the provisions of this section, except that municipal liens shall be paid at settlement. The proceeds of the purchase of the property shall be distributed as set forth in N.J.S.A. 55:19-97. 
(d)  Upon approval by the court, the borough shall sell the property on such terms and at such price as the court shall approve, and may place the proceeds of sale in escrow with the court. The court shall order a distribution of the proceeds of sale after paying court costs in the order of priority set forth in N.J.S.A. 55:19-97. 
(e)  With the exception of the holding of special tax sales pursuant to N.J.S.A. 55:19-101, the remedies available under N.J.S.A. 55:19-78 et seq. shall be available to the borough with respect to any abandoned property, whether or not the borough has established an abandoned property list and whether or not the property at issue has been included on any such list.

The owner shall be responsible for providing proof to the local housing inspector that said inspection(s) was made and for obtaining written confirmation from the borough that said inspection(s) satisfies the requirements of this article. 
(f)  Waiver of annual inspection. If eighty-five percent (85%) of the units in a multi-dwelling complex are issued a satisfactory rating following the borough's annual inspection for two (2) consecutive calendar years all units within the complex shall be exempt from the borough's annual inspection in the next subsequent year. This waiver is not absolute and the borough reserves the right to inspect before every initial occupancy, change in occupancy, and/or change in the number of occupants or upon a complaint from a tenant as described in subsection (a) of this section.

Chapter 109 - FLOOD DAMAGE PREVENTION[1] 
Footnotes: 
--- (1) --- 
Editor's note- Ord. No. 2016-10 , adopted Aug. 2, 2016, amended Ch. 109 in its entirety to read as set out herein. Former Ch. 109 pertained to similar subject matter and derived from Ord. No. 926-07, §§ 1.1-1.3, 2.0, 3.1-3.6, 4.1-4.4, 5.1-5.3, adopted Aug. 21, 2007. 

ARTICLE I. - IN GENERAL 

Sec. 109-1. - Definitions. 
    The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this chapter, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this section, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning: 
    AO zone means areas subject to inundation by 1-percent-annual-chance shallow flooding (usually sheet flow on sloping terrain) where average depths are between one (1) and three (3) feet. 
    AH zone means areas subject to inundation by 1-percent-annual-chance shallow flooding (usually areas of ponding) where average depths are between one (1) and three (3) feet. Base flood elevations (BFEs) derived from detailed hydraulic analyses are shown in this zone. 
    Appeal means a request for a review of the borough's construction code official interpretation of any provision of this chapter or a request for a variance. 
    Area of shallow flooding means a designated AO or AH zone on a community's digital flood insurance rate map (DFIRM) with a 1-percent-annual or greater chance of flooding to an average depth of one (1) to three (3) feet where a clearly defined channel does not exist, where the path of flooding is unpredictable and where velocity flow may be evident. Such flooding is characterized by ponding or sheet flow. 
    Area of special flood hazard means the land in the floodplain within a community subject to a one-percent or greater chance of flooding in any given year. It is shown on the FIRM as zone V, VE, V1-30, A, AO, A1-A30, AE, A99, or AH. 
    Base flood means the flood having a one-percent chance of being equaled or exceeded in any given year. 
    Base flood elevation (BFE) means the flood elevation shown on a published flood insurance study (FIS) including the flood insurance rate map (FIRM). For zones AE, AH, AO, and A1-30, the elevation represents the water surface elevation resulting from a flood that has a one-percent or greater chance of being equaled or exceeded in any given year. For zones VE and V1-30, the elevation represents the stillwater elevation (SWEL) plus wave effect (BFE = SWEL + wave effect) resulting from a flood that has a one-percent or greater chance of being equaled or exceeded in any given year. 
    Basement means any area of the building having its floor subgrade (below ground level) on all sides. 
    Breakaway wall means a wall that is not part of the structural support of the building and is intended through its design and construction to collapse under specific lateral loading forces without causing damage to the elevated portion of the building or supporting foundation system. 
    Development means any manmade change to improved or unimproved real estate, including, but not limited to, buildings or other structures mining, dredging, filling, grading, paving, excavation or drilling operations, or storage of equipment or materials located within the area of special flood hazard. 
    Digital flood insurance rate map (DFIRM) means the official map on which the Federal Insurance Administration has delineated both the areas of special flood hazards and the risk premium zones applicable to the community. 
    Elevated building means a non-basement building: 
(1)  Built, in the case of a building in an area of special flood hazard, to have the top of the elevated floor; and 
(2)  Adequately anchored so as not to impair the structural integrity of the building during a flood up to the magnitude of the base flood. 
    In an area of special flood hazard the term "elevated building" also includes a building elevated by means of fill or solid foundation perimeter walls with openings sufficient to facilitate the unimpeded movement of floodwaters. 
    Erosion means the process of the gradual wearing away of land masses. 
    Existing manufactured home park or subdivision means a manufactured home park or subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including, at a minimum, the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is completed before the effective date of the floodplain management regulations adopted by a community. 
    Flood or flooding means a general and temporary condition of partial or complete inundation of normally dry land areas from: 
(1)  The overflow of inland or tidal waters; and/or 
(2)  The unusual and rapid accumulation or runoff of surface waters from any source. 
    Flood insurance rate map (FIRM) means the official map on which the Federal Insurance Administration has delineated both the areas of special flood hazards and the risk premium zones applicable to the community. 
    Flood insurance study (FIS) means the official report in which the Federal Insurance Administration has provided flood profiles, as well as the flood insurance rate map(s) and the water surface elevation of the base flood. 
    Floodplain management regulations means zoning ordinances, subdivision regulations, building codes, health regulations, special purpose ordinances (such as a floodplain ordinance, grading ordinance and erosion control ordinance) and other applications of police power. The term "floodplain management regulations" describes such state or local regulations, in any combination thereof, which provide standards for the purpose of flood damage prevention and reduction. 
    Floodproofing means any combination of structural and nonstructural additions, changes, or adjustments to structures which reduce or eliminate flood damage to real estate or improved real property, water and sanitary facilities, structures and their contents. 
    Floodway means the channel of a river or other watercourse and the adjacent land areas that must be reserved in order to discharge the base flood without cumulatively increasing the water surface elevation more than two-tenths (0.2) foot. 
    Freeboard means a factor of safety usually expressed in feet above a flood level for purposes of floodplain management. "Freeboard" tends to compensate for the many unknown factors that could contribute to flood heights greater than the height calculated for a selected size flood and floodway conditions, such as wave action, bridge openings, and the hydrological effect of urbanization of the watershed. 
    Highest adjacent grade means the highest natural elevation of the ground surface prior to construction next to the proposed or existing walls of a structure. 
    Historic structure means any structure that is: 
(1)  Listed individually in the National Register of Historic Places (a listing maintained by the Department of Interior) or preliminarily determined by the Secretary of the Interior as meeting the requirements for individual listing on the National Register; 
(2)  Certified or preliminarily determined by the Secretary of the Interior as contributing to the historical significance of a registered historic district or a district preliminarily determined by the Secretary to qualify as a registered historic district; 
(3)  Individually listed on a state inventory of historic places in states with historic preservation programs which have been approved by the Secretary of the Interior; or 
(4)  Individually listed on a local inventory of historic places in communities with historic preservation programs that have been certified either: 
a.  By an approved state program as determined by the Secretary of the Interior; or 
b.  Directly by the Secretary of the Interior in states without approved programs. 
    Lowest floor means the lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area (including basement). An unfinished or flood-resistant enclosure, useable solely for the parking of vehicles, building access or storage in an area other than a basement is not considered a building's lowest floor, provided that such enclosure is not built so as to render the structure in violation of other applicable non-elevation design requirements of 44 CFR Section 60.3. 
    Manufactured home means a structure, transportable in one (1) or more sections, which is built on a permanent chassis and is designed for use with or without a permanent foundation when attached to the required utilities. The term "manufactured home" does not include a "recreational vehicle." 
    Manufactured home park or manufactured home subdivision means a parcel (or contiguous parcels) of land divided into two (2) or more manufactured home lots for rent or sale. 
    New construction means structures for which the start of construction commenced on or after the effective date of a floodplain regulation adopted by a community and includes any subsequent improvements to such structures. 
    New manufactured home park or subdivision means a manufactured home park or subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including at a minimum, the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is completed on or after the effective date of the floodplain management regulations adopted by the municipality. 
    Recreational vehicle means a vehicle which is: 
(1)  Built on a single chassis; 
(2)  Four hundred (400) square feet or less when measured at the longest horizontal projections; 
(3)  Designed to be self-propelled or permanently towable by a light-duty truck; and 
(4)  Designed primarily not for use as a permanent dwelling but as temporary living quarters for recreational, camping, travel, or seasonal use. 
    Start of construction, for other than new construction or substantial improvements under the Coastal Barrier Resources Act (P.L. No. 97-348), includes substantial improvements and means the date the building permit was issued, provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, placement, or other improvement was within one hundred eighty (180) days of the permit date. The "actual start" means either the first placement of permanent construction of a structure on a site such as the pouring of a slab or footings, the installation of piles, the construction of columns, or any work beyond the stage of excavation, or the placement of a manufactured home on a foundation. Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as clearing, grading and filling nor does it include the installation of streets and/or walkways, nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings or piers, or foundations or the erection of temporary forms, nor does it include the installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main structure. For a substantial improvement, the actual start of construction means the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building. 
    Structure means a walled and roofed building, a manufactured home, or a gas or liquid storage tank that is principally above ground. 
    Substantial damage means damage of any origin sustained by a structure whereby the cost of restoring the structure to its before-damaged condition would equal or exceed fifty (50) percent of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred. 
    Substantial improvement means any reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, or other improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds fifty (50) percent of the market value of the structure before the start of construction of the improvement. The term "substantial improvement" includes structures which have incurred substantial damage, regardless of the actual repair work performed. The term "substantial improvement" does not, however, include either: 
(1)  Any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing violations of state or local health, sanitary or safety code specifications which have been identified by the local code enforcement officer and which are the minimum necessary to assure safe living conditions; or 
(2)  Any alteration of a historic structure, provided that the alteration will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a historic structure. 
    Variance means a grant of relief from the requirements of this chapter that permits construction in a manner that would otherwise be prohibited by this chapter. 
    Violation means the failure of a structure or other development to be fully compliant with this chapter. A new or substantially improved structure or other development without the elevation certificate, other certifications, or other evidence of compliance required in 44 CFR § 60.3(b)(5), (c)(4), (c)(10), (e)(2), (e)(4), or (e)(5) is presumed to be in violation until such time as that documentation is provided. 
(Ord. No. 2016-10 , 8-2-2016) 
Sec. 109-2. - Statutory authorization. 
    The legislature of the state has, in N.J.S.A. 40:48-1 et seq., delegated the responsibility to local government units to adopt regulations designed to promote public health, safety, and general welfare of its citizenry. Therefore, the Borough of Audubon of Camden County, New Jersey, does ordain as follows. 
(Ord. No. 2016-10 , 8-2-2016) 
Sec. 109-3. - Findings of fact. 
(a)  The flood hazard areas of the borough are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety, and general welfare. 
(b)  These flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions in areas of special flood hazard which increase flood heights and velocities, and when inadequately anchored, causes damage in other areas. Uses that are inadequately floodproofed, elevated or otherwise protected from flood damage also contribute to the flood loss. 
(Ord. No. 2016-10 , 8-2-2016) 
Sec. 109-4. - Statement of purpose. 
    It is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare, and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed: 
(1)  To protect human life and health; 
(2)  To minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects; 
(3)  To minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public; 
(4)  To minimize prolonged business interruptions; 
(5)  To minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets, and bridges located in areas of special flood hazard; 
(6)  To help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of areas of special flood hazard so as to minimize future flood blight areas; 
(7)  To ensure that potential buyers are notified that property is in an area of special flood hazard; and 
(8)  To ensure that those who occupy the areas of special flood hazard assume responsibility for their actions. 
(Ord. No. 2016-10 , 8-2-2016) 
Sec. 109-5. - Methods of reducing flood losses. 
    In order to accomplish its purposes, this chapter includes methods and provisions for: 
(1)  Restricting or prohibiting uses which are dangerous to health, safety, and property due to water or erosion hazards, or which result in damaging increases in erosion or in flood heights or velocities; 
(2)  Requiring that uses vulnerable to floods including facilities which serve such uses be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction; 
(3)  Controlling the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural protective barriers which help accommodate or channel floodwaters; 
(4)  Controlling filling, grading, dredging, and other development which may increase flood damage; and 
(5)  Preventing or regulating the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards in other areas. 
(Ord. No. 2016-10 , 8-2-2016) 
Sec. 109-6. - Territorial applicability. 
    This chapter shall apply to all areas of special flood hazards within the jurisdiction of the Borough of Audubon, Camden County, New Jersey. 
(Ord. No. 2016-10 , 8-2-2016) 
Sec. 109-7. - Basis for establishing the areas of special flood hazard. 
(a)  The areas of special flood hazard for the Borough of Audubon, Community No. 340121, are identified and defined on the following documents prepared by the Federal Emergency Management Agency: 
(1)  A scientific and engineering report "Flood Insurance Study, Camden County, New Jersey (All Jurisdictions)" dated August 17, 2016. 
(2)  Flood Insurance Rate Map for Camden County, New Jersey (All Jurisdictions) as shown on index and panel numbers 34007C0039F and 34007C0043E, whose effective date is August 17, 2016. 
(b)  The above documents are hereby adopted and declared to be a part of this chapter. The flood insurance study and maps are on file at the Audubon Municipal Building at 606 W. Nicholson Road, Audubon, New Jersey 08106. 
(Ord. No. 2016-10 , 8-2-2016) 
Sec. 109-8. - Violations. 
    No structure or land shall hereafter be constructed, relocated to, extended, elevated, or altered without full compliance with the terms of this chapter and other applicable regulations. Violation of the provisions of this chapter by failure to comply with any of its requirements (including violations of conditions and safeguards established in connection with conditions) shall constitute a misdemeanor. Any person who violates this chapter or fails to comply with any of its requirements shall, upon conviction thereof be fined for each violation, and in addition pay all costs and expenses involved in the case if found guilty of an offense. Nothing herein contained shall prevent the borough from taking such other lawful action as is necessary to prevent or remedy any violation.

(Ord. No. 2016-10 , 8-2-2016) 
Sec. 109-11. - Warning and disclaimer of liability. 
(a)  The degree of flood protection required by this chapter is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on scientific and engineering considerations. Larger floods can and will occur on rare occasions. Flood heights may be increased by manmade or natural causes. This chapter does not imply that land outside the area of special flood hazards or uses permitted within such areas will be free from flooding or flood damages. 
(b)  This chapter shall not create liability on the part of the borough, any officer or employee thereof or the federal insurance administration, for any flood damages that result from reliance on this chapter or any administrative decision lawfully made thereunder.

(2)  The zoning board of adjustment shall hear and decide appeals when it is alleged there is an error in any requirement, decision, or determination made by the construction code official in the enforcement or administration of this chapter. 
(3)  Those aggrieved by the decision of the zoning board of adjustment may appeal such decision to any court of competent jurisdiction, as provided in state statutes and court rules. 
(4)  In passing upon such applications, the zoning board of adjustment shall consider all technical evaluations, all relevant factors, standards specified in the sections of this article, and: 
a.  The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the injury of others; 
b.  The danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion damage; 
c.  The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner; 
d.  The importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to the community; 
e.  The necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where applicable; 
f.  The availability of alternative locations for the proposed use which are not subject to flooding or erosion damage; 
g.  The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated development; 
h.  The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan and floodplain management program of that area; 
i.  The safety of access to the property in times of flood for ordinary and emergency vehicles; 
j.  The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise, and sediment transport of the floodwaters and the effects of wave action, if applicable, expected at the site; and

(5)  Upon consideration of the factors of subsection 109-44(a)(4) and the purposes of this chapter the zoning board of adjustment may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes of this chapter. 
(6)  The construction code official shall maintain the records of all appeal actions, including technical information, and report any variances to the federal insurance administration upon request. 
(b)  Conditions for variances. 
(1)  Generally, variances may be issued for new construction and substantial improvements to be erected on a lot of one-half (1/2) acre or less in size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed below the base flood level, providing subsections (a)(4)a. through (a)(4)k. in this section have been fully considered. As the lot size increases beyond the one-half (1/2) acre, the technical justification required for issuing the variance increases. 
(2)  Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic structures upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a historic structure and the variance is the minimum necessary to preserve the historic character and design of the structure. 
(3)  Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result. 
(4)  Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief. 
(5)  Variances shall only be issued upon: 
a.  A showing of good and sufficient cause; 
b.  A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship to the applicant; and 
c.  A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create nuisances, cause fraud on or victimization of the public as identified in subsection 109-44(a)(4), or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances. 
(6)  Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice that the structure will be permitted to be built with a lowest floor elevation below the base flood elevation and that the cost of flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the reduced lowest floor elevation.

Such appeal shall be decided by the board of commissioners only upon the record established before the planning board or board of adjustment. 
(b)  Notice of the meeting to review the record below shall be given by the board of commissioners by personal service or certified mail to the appellant, to those entitled to a notice of a decision pursuant to section 113-138 and to the board from which the appeal is taken at least ten (10) days prior to the date of the meeting.

    If a public utility, as defined in N.J.S.A. 48:2-13, is aggrieved by the action of a municipal agency through said agency's exercise of its powers under this chapter, with respect to any action in which the public utility has an interest, an appeal to the board of public utility commissioners of the state may be taken within thirty-five (35) days after such action without appeal to the municipal governing body pursuant to section 113-32 unless such public utility so chooses.

Sec. 113-34. - Escrow fees. 
(a)  Escrow deposits. In addition to the initial fees or charges as elsewhere set forth, the borough shall require escrow deposits in accordance with the provisions of the fee and deposit schedule set forth in subsection (l) of this section. The chief financial officer of the municipality shall make all of the payments to professionals for services rendered to the municipality or approving authority for review of applications for development, review and preparation of documents, inspection of improvements or other purposes under the provisions of the Municipal Land Use Law (N.J.S.A. 40:55D-1 et seq.). The application review and inspection charges shall be limited only to professional charges for review of applications, review and preparation of documents and inspections of developments under construction and for review by outside consultants when an application is of a nature beyond the scope of the expertise of the professionals normally utilized by the municipality. The only cost that shall be added to any such charges shall be actual out-of-pocket expenses of such professionals or consultants including normal and typical expenses incurred in processing applications and inspecting improvements. No applicant shall be charged for any municipal, clerical or administrative functions, overhead expenses, meeting room charge or any of the municipal costs and expenses except as provided for specifically by statute nor shall a municipal professional add any such charge to his bill. 
(b)  Scope of reimbursed services. The municipality shall be entitled to be reimbursed for the review of applications, both as to completeness and as to content; for the review and preparation of documents such as, but not limited to; drafting resolutions, developer's agreements, and necessary correspondence with applicant or applicant's professionals. 
(c)  Deposit of escrow funds; refunds. Deposits received from any applicant in excess of five thousand dollars ($5,000.00) shall be held by the chief financial officer in a special interest-bearing deposit account, and upon receipt of bills from professionals and approval of said bills as hereinafter provided for, the chief financial officer may use such funds to pay the bills submitted by such professional or expert. The municipality shall not be required to refund an amount of interest paid on a deposit which does not exceed one hundred dollars ($100.00) for the year. If the amount of interest exceeds one hundred dollars ($100.00), the entire amount shall belong to the applicant and shall be refunded to him by the municipality annually or at the time the deposit is repaid or applied for the purposes for which it was deposited, as the case may be, except that the municipality may retain for administrative expenses a sum equivalent to no more than thirty-three and one-third percent (33 1/3 %) of that entire amount, which shall be in lieu of all other administrative and custodial expenses. All sums not actually so expended shall be refunded to the applicant within ninety (90) days after the final decision by the appropriate municipal agency with respect to such application, upon certification by the board secretary that such application has been finally decided. 
(d)  Payment. Each payment charged to the deposit for review of applications, review and preparation of documents and inspection of improvements shall be pursuant to a voucher from the professional, which voucher shall identify the personnel performing the service and each date the services were performed, the hours spent to one-quarter (1/4) hour increments the hourly rate and the expenses incurred. All professionals shall submit vouchers to the chief financial officer. The professional shall send an informational copy of all vouchers or statements submitted to the chief financial officer of the municipality simultaneously to: 
(1)  The applicant; and 
(2)  The borough planning board and/or zoning board for whom said services were performed. 
The chief financial officer shall prepare and send to the applicant a statement which shall include an accounting of funds listing all deposits, interest earnings, disbursements and the cumulative balance of the escrow account. This information shall be provided on a quarterly basis, if monthly charges are one thousand dollars ($1,000.00). If an escrow account or deposit contains insufficient funds to enable the municipality or approving authority to perform required application reviews or improvement inspections, the chief financial officer shall provide the applicant with a notice of the insufficient escrow or deposit balance. In order for work to continue on the development or the application, the applicant shall, within a reasonable time period, post a deposit to the account in an amount to be agreed upon the by the municipality or approving authority and the applicant. In the interim, any required health and safety inspections shall be made and charged back against the replenishment of funds. 
(e)  Payments required prior to issuance of permits. No zoning permits, building permits, certificates of occupancy or any other types of permits may be issued with respect to any approved application for development until all bills for reimbursable services have been received by the municipality from professional personnel rendering services in connection with such application and payment has been made. 
(f)  Close out procedures. The following close out procedures shall apply to all deposits and escrow accounts established under the provisions of the Municipal Land Use Law (N.J.S.A. 40:55D-1 et seq.) and shall commence after the approving authority has granted final approval and signed the subdivision plat or site plan, in the case of application review escrows and deposits, or after the improvements have been approved in accordance with N.J.S.A. 40:55D-53, in the case of improvement inspection escrows and deposits. 
(1)  The applicant shall send written notice by certified mail to the chief financial officer of the municipality and the approving authority and to the relevant municipal professional, that the application or the improvements, as the case may be, are completed. 
(2)  After receipt of such notice, the professional shall render a final bill to the chief financial officer of the municipality within thirty (30) days and shall send a copy simultaneously to the applicant. 
(3)  The chief financial officer of the municipality shall render a written final accounting to the applicant on the uses to which the deposit was put within forty-five (45) days of receipt of the final bill. 
(4)  Any balances remaining in the deposit or escrow account including interest in accordance with N.J.S.A. 40:55D-53.1 shall be refunded to the developer along with the final accounting. 
(g)  Scope of charges. All professional charges for review of an application for development, review and preparation of documents or inspection of improvements shall be reasonable and necessary, given the status and progress of the application or construction. Review fees shall be charged only in connection with an application for development presently pending before the approving authority or upon review of compliance with the conditions of approval, or review of request for modification or amendment made by the applicant. A professional shall not review items which are subject to approval by any state governmental agency and not under municipal jurisdiction except to the extent consultation with a state agency is necessary due to the effect of state approvals on the subdivision or site plan. 
(h)  Limitation of inspection fees. Inspection fees shall be charged only for actual work shown on a subdivision or site plan or required by an approving resolution. Professionals inspecting improvements under construction shall charge only for inspections that are reasonably necessary to check the progress and quality of the work and such inspections shall be reasonably based on the approved development plans and documents. 
(i)  Substitution of professionals. If the municipality retains a different professional or consultant in the place of a professional originally responsible for development application review, or inspection of improvements, the municipality of approving authority shall be responsible for all time and expenses of the new professional to become familiar with the application or the project, and the municipality or approving authority shall not bill the applicant or charge to the deposit or the escrow account for any such services. 
(j)  Estimate of cost of improvements. The cost of the installation of improvements for the purposes of N.J.S.A. 40:55D-53 shall be estimated by the municipal engineer based on documented construction costs for the public improvements prevailing in the general area of the municipality. The developer may appeal the municipal engineer's estimate to the county construction board of appeals, established pursuant to N.J.S.A. 52:27D-127. 
(k)  Appeals. 
(1)  An applicant shall notify in writing the governing body with copies to the chief financial officer, the approving authority and the professional whenever the applicant disputes the charges made by a professional for a service rendered to the municipality in reviewing applications for development, review and preparation of documents, inspection of improvements, or other charges made pursuant to N.J.S.A. 40:55D-53.2. The governing body or its designee shall within a reasonable time attempt to remediate any disputed charges. If the matter is not resolved to the satisfaction of the applicant, the applicant may appeal to the county construction board of appeals, established pursuant to N.J.S.A. 52:27D-127 any charge to an escrow account or deposit by any municipal professional or consultant, or the cost or the installation of improvements estimated by the municipal engineer pursuant to N.J.S.A. 40:55D-53.4. An applicant or this authorized agent shall submit the appeal in writing to the county construction board of appeals. The applicant or his authorized agent shall simultaneously send a copy of the appeal to the municipality, approving authority, and any professional whose charges are the subject of the appeal. An applicant shall file an appeal within 45 days from receipt of the informational copy of the professional's voucher required by subsection N.J.S.A. 40:55D-53.2(c), except that if the professional has not supplied the applicant with an informational copy of the voucher, then the applicant shall file his appeal within 60 days from receipt of the municipal statement of activity against the deposit or escrow account required by N.J.S.A. 40:55D-53.2(c). An applicant may file an appeal for an ongoing series of charges by a professional during a period not exceeding six months to demonstrate that they represent a pattern of excessive or inaccurate charges. An applicant making use of this provision need not appeal each charge individually. 
(2)  Appeals shall be taken in accordance with the rules and procedures established by the county construction board of appeals. 
(3)  During the pendency of any appeal, the municipality or approving authority shall continue to process, hear and decide the application for development and to inspect the development in the normal course and shall not withhold, delay or deny reviews, inspections, signing of subdivision plats or site plans, the reduction or the release of performance or maintenance guarantees, the issuance of construction permits or certificates of occupancy, or any other approval or permit because an appeal has been filed or is pending under this subsection. The chief financial officer of the municipality may pay charges out of the appropriate escrow account or deposit for which an appeal has been filed. If a charge is disallowed after payment, the chief financial officer of the municipality shall reimburse the deposit or escrow account in the amount of any such disallowed after payment to a professional or consultant who is not an employee of a municipality, the professional or consultant shall reimburse the municipality in the amount of any such disallowed charge.

(a)  The board of adjustment or planning board, as applicable, shall consider the following when hearing a request for a variance, in addition to such other factors as it may wish to consider in its deliberations, and the final decision shall contain evidence that the following and other factors have been considered: 
(1)  The shape of the property involved on the effective date of the ordinance from which this chapter is derived was uniquely narrow or shallow compared with nearby properties which have been utilized according to the regulations of this chapter. 
(2)  Topographic conditions on the lot differ exceptionally from nearby improved lots. 
(3)  There are other unique conditions or situations which would make the strict application of any particular regulation of this chapter pointless, without relationship to the purposes thereof, and which would result in exceptional and undue hardship upon the owner or developer of the property, so long as such adverse condition has not been created by the applicant. 
(4)  The variance, if granted, would not alter the essential character of the zoning district in which the property is located, would not substantially or permanently impair the appropriate use or development of adjacent property or would not be detrimental to the public welfare. 
(5)  A variance, if granted, would represent the minimum relief that will achieve its purpose as well as be the least modification possible of the particular regulation of this chapter at issue. 
(6)  The variance shall be considered strictly on its own merits, without reference to similar situations or variances which may have been granted or denied previously. 
(b)  Either board may, if granting the variance, attach such conditions and safeguards as are necessary to ensure that the general purpose and intent of this chapter are complied with, which conditions may include but shall not be limited to harmonious design of buildings, plantings and their maintenance and the minimizing of noxious, offensive or hazardous elements.

(1)  The requested conditional use would be consistent with the spirit, purpose and intent of this chapter as a whole or of any part thereof. 
(2)  If the particular board should determine that the granting of a conditional use would not be detrimental to the adjacent properties or to the surrounding neighborhood, the burden of proof shall be upon those opposing, if any, the granting of the conditional use and not upon the applicant. 
(b)  Where the board deems necessary, that suitable conditions and safeguards may be imposed as to the manner, extent or degree of the requested conditional use, if granted, and where specified herein, that the conditional use shall be deemed to be a use by right unless the particular location involved is determined by the board to be contrary to the purposes and intent of this chapter.

(2)  The submission of a complete application for a variance or conditional use.

(b)  Whenever the board of adjustment receives an application for a variance on a proposed development for which site plan review and approval is simultaneously requested, the board of adjustment shall render its decision concerning the variance, which shall supersede subsequent action by the planning board to which the application for site plan review shall be referred. 
(c)  Whenever the board of adjustment refers a matter to the planning board before taking final action thereon, such reference shall not extend the length of time for the board of adjustment's action as prescribed by law, and whenever the planning board shall have made a recommendation regarding such matter authorized by this chapter to the board of adjustment, such recommendation may be rejected only by a majority vote of the full authorized membership of the board of adjustment.

Failure of the planning board to act within the time prescribed shall constitute minor subdivision approval, and a certificate of the planning board secretary as to the planning board's failure to act shall be issued upon request of the applicant, which certificate shall be sufficient in lieu of written endorsement or other evidence of approval and shall be so accepted by the county recording officer for purposes of filing subdivision plats. 
c.  Whenever review of the county planning board is required according to conditions prescribed herein, any approval of the minor subdivision shall be conditioned upon approval by the county planning board, either by its favorable report or its failure to act, as described herein.

a.  Final approval shall be granted or denied within forty-five (45) days after submission for such approval, unless extended with the consent of the applicant, and failure of the planning board to act within this prescribed period shall constitute final approval of the major subdivision, if acceptable guaranties required herein are furnished by the developer, in which case the planning board secretary shall issue a certificate as to the failure of the planning board to act, and it shall be sufficient in lieu of written endorsement or other evidence of approval herein required and shall be acceptable to the county recording officer for filing of subdivision plats.

Sec. 113-296. - Exceptions. 
    The planning board, when acting upon applications for preliminary approval of major subdivisions or for minor subdivisions, shall have the power to grant such exceptions from the requirements for subdivision approval as may be reasonable and within the general purpose and intent of the provisions herein for subdivision review and approval, if the literal enforcement of one (1) or more provisions of this chapter is impracticable or will exact undue hardship because of peculiar conditions pertaining to the land in question.

(a)  If the master plan or the official map provides for the reservation of designated streets, public drainageways, flood-control basins or public areas within the proposed development, before approving a subdivision or site plan the planning board may further require that such streets, ways, basins or areas be shown on the plat in locations and sizes suitable to their intended uses. The planning board may reserve the location and extent of such streets, ways, basins or areas shown on the plat for a period of one (1) year after the approval of the final plat or within such further time as may be agreed to by the developer. Unless during such period or extension thereof the municipality shall have entered into a contract to purchase or institute condemnation proceedings according to law for the fee or a lesser interest in the land comprising such streets, ways, basins or areas, the developer shall not be bound by such reservations shown on the plat and may proceed to use such land for private use in accordance with applicable development regulations. The provisions of this section shall not apply to streets and roads, flood-control basins or public drainageways necessitated by the subdivision or land development and required for final approval. 
(b)  The developer shall be entitled to just compensation for actual loss found to be caused by such temporary reservation and deprivation of use. In such instance, unless a lesser amount has previously been mutually agreed upon, just compensation shall be deemed to be the fair market value of an option to purchase the land reserved for the period of reservation, provided that determination of such fair market value shall include, but not be limited to consideration of the real property taxes apportioned to the land reserved and prorated for the period of reservation. The developer shall be compensated for the reasonable increased cost of legal, engineering or other professional services incurred in connection with obtaining subdivision approval or site plan approval, as the case may be, caused by the reservation. The municipality shall provide by ordinance for a procedure for the payment of all compensation payable under this section.

Such regulations shall be based on circulation and comprehensive utility service plans pursuant to N.J.S.A. 40:55D-28 and shall establish fair and reasonable standards to determine the proportionate or pro rata amount of the cost of such facilities that shall be borne by each developer or owner within a related and common area, which standards shall not be altered subsequent to preliminary approval. Where a developer pays the amount determined as his pro rata share under protest, he shall institute legal action within one (1) year of such payment in order to preserve the right to a judicial determination as to the fairness and reasonableness of such amount.

Sec. 113-300. - Open space preservation and maintenance. 
(a)  An ordinance pursuant to this article permitting planned unit development, planned unit residential development or residential development or residential cluster may provide that the municipality or other governmental agency may, at any time and from time to time, accept the dedication of land or any interest therein for public use and maintenance, but the ordinance shall not require, as a condition of the approval of a planned development, that land proposed to be set aside for common open space be dedicated or made available to public use. 
(b)  An ordinance pursuant to this article providing for planned unit development, planned unit residential development or residential cluster shall require that the developer provide for an organization for the ownership and maintenance of any open space for the benefit of owners or residents of the development, if said open space is not dedicated to the municipality or other governmental agency. Such organization shall not be dissolved and shall not dispose of any open space by sale or otherwise, except to an organization conceived and established to own and maintain the open space for the benefit of such development, and thereafter such organization shall not be dissolved or dispose of any of its open space without first offering to dedicate the same to the municipality or municipalities wherein the land is located. 
(c)  In the event that such organization shall fail to maintain the open space in reasonable order and condition, the municipal body or officer designated by ordinance to administer this section may serve written notice upon such organization or upon the owners of the development setting forth the manner in which the organization has failed to maintain the open space in reasonable condition, and said notice shall include a demand that such deficiencies of maintenance be cured within thirty-five (35) days thereof and shall state the date and place of a hearing thereon, which shall be held within fifteen (15) days of the notice. At such hearing, the designated municipal body or officer, as the case may be, may modify the terms of the original notice as to deficiencies and may give a reasonable extension of time, not to exceed sixty-five (65) days, within which they shall be cured. If the deficiencies set forth in the original notice or in the modification thereof shall not be cured within said thirty-five (35) days or any permitted extension thereof, the municipality, in order to preserve the open space and maintain the same for a period of one (1) year, may enter upon and maintain such land. Said entry and maintenance shall not vest in the public any rights to use the open space, except when the same is voluntarily dedicated to the public by the owners. Before the expiration of said year, the designated municipal body or officer, as the case may be, shall, upon its or his initiative or upon the request of the organization theretofore responsible for the maintenance of the open space, call a public hearing upon fifteen (15) days' written notice to such organization and to the owners of the development to be held by such municipal body or officer, at which hearing such organization and the owners of the development shall show cause why such maintenance by the municipality shall not, at the election of the municipality, continue for a succeeding year. If the designated municipal body or officer, as the case may be, shall determine that such organization is ready and able to maintain said open space in reasonable condition, the municipality shall cease to maintain said open space at the end of said year. If the municipal body or officer, as the case may be, shall determine such organization is not ready and able to maintain said open space in a reasonable condition, the municipality may, in its discretion, continue to maintain said open space during the next succeeding year, subject to a similar hearing and determination, in each year thereafter. The decision of the municipal body or officer in any such case shall constitute a final administrative decision subject to judicial review. If a municipal body or officer is not designated by ordinance to administer this section, the governing body shall have the same powers and be subject to the same restrictions as provided in this section. 
(d)  The cost of such maintenance by the municipality shall be assessed pro rata against the properties within the development that have a right of enjoyment of the open space in accordance with their assessed value at the time of imposition of the lien and shall become a lien and tax on said properties and be added to and be a part of the taxes to be levied and assessed thereon and enforced and collected with interest by the same officers and in the same manner as other taxes.

(4)  That the proposed planned development will not have an unreasonable adverse impact upon the area in which it is proposed to be established. 
(5)  In the case of a proposed development which contemplates construction over a period of years, that the terms and conditions intended to protect the interests of the public and of the residents, occupants and owners of the proposed development in the total completion of the development are adequate.

(1)  The furnishing of a performance guaranty, approved by the borough solicitor, in favor of the borough, in an amount not to exceed one hundred twenty percent (120%) of the estimated cost of required improvements, as verified by the borough engineer, which improvements shall include but not be limited to streets, grading, pavement, gutters, curbs, sidewalks, street lighting, and surveyor's monuments, as shown on the final plat as required by the Map Filing Law (N.J.S.A. 46:23-9.9 et seq.), as well as water mains, including laterals to the street rights-of-way lines, culverts, storm sewers, sanitary sewers, all drainage structures and erosion control and sedimentation control devices, and including such other on-site improvements as may be required by the site plan or zoning requirements herein. 
(2)  The posting with the commissioners of a maintenance guaranty for a period not to exceed two (2) years after final acceptance of any particular improvement, in an amount not to exceed fifteen percent (15%) of the actual cost of the improvement, as verified by the borough engineer; provided, however, that in the event that another governmental agency other than the borough or a public utility company will automatically own utility lines once satisfactorily installed or that the streets are covered by a performance or maintenance guaranty to the other governmental agency, no performance or maintenance guaranty shall be required by the borough for such utilities and improvements. 
(b)  The amount of any performance guaranty may be reduced by the commissioners by resolution as portions of the improvements have been certified by the borough engineer to have been satisfactorily completed, and the time allowed for installation of the improvements, for which the performance guaranty has been provided, may be extended by the commissioners by resolution. 
(c)  If the required improvements are not completed or corrected in accordance with the performance guaranty, the obligor and surety shall be liable thereon to the borough for the reasonable cost of the improvements not completed or corrected, and the borough may, either prior to or after the receipt of the proceeds thereof, complete such improvements or the correction thereof, as applicable. Such completion or correction of improvements shall be subject to the public bidding requirements of the Local Public Contracts Law (N.J.S.A. 40A:11-1 et seq.). 
(d)  When all of the required improvements have been completed, in the opinion of the developer, the obligor shall notify the commissioners, by certified mail, addressed in care of the borough clerk, and shall send a copy thereof to the borough engineer. Thereupon, the borough engineer shall inspect all of the improvements and shall file a detailed report, in writing, to the commissioners, indicating his recommendation of approval, partial approval or rejection of the improvements, with a statement of reasons for such rejection; if partial approval is recommended, he shall include his estimate of the cost of the improvements rejected. A copy of the borough engineer's report shall be furnished to the developer. 
(e)  If any parts of the required improvements are rejected by the commissioners, they may require the obligor to complete such improvements, and upon completion the same procedure of notification as set forth in subsection (d) of this section shall be followed. 
(f)  Nothing herein shall be construed to limit the right of the obligor to contest by legal proceedings any determination by the commissioners or opinion of the borough engineer. 
(g)  The obligor shall reimburse the borough for all reasonable inspection fees paid to the borough engineer for the foregoing inspection of improvements, which schedule of fees shall be made a part of the guaranty or surety documents before approval by the borough solicitor. 
(h)  The commissioners shall either approve, partially approve or reject the improvements and notify the obligor within sixty-five (65) days.

Sec. 113-358. - Required guaranties. 
    Following are the guaranties required: 
(1)  As a condition of final site plan approval, the planning board may require and shall accept in accordance with the standards adopted by this chapter for the purpose of assuring the proper installation and maintenance of all improvements required by this chapter the following: 
a.  A performance guaranty in favor of the borough, in an amount not to exceed one hundred twenty percent (120%) of the cost of installation, of all required improvements, provided that not more than ten percent (10%) of the total performance guaranty shall be in cash and the balance shall be in the form of a performance bond from a state bonding company approved by the borough solicitor or other form of performance guaranty as may be approved by the borough solicitor. The borough engineer shall review the improvements required by this chapter to be bonded and shall make his own separately itemized cost estimate which, if approved by the planning board, shall be the basis for the performance guaranty. The borough engineer shall forward a copy of his estimate to the applicant within thirty (30) days following the date of a request for the same by the applicant, sent by certified mail. 
b.  The furnishing of a maintenance guaranty posted with the borough for a period not to exceed two (2) years after final acceptance of the completed improvements, in an amount not to exceed fifteen percent (15%) of the final cost of the improvements required by this chapter. In the event of those instances where a public utility company or department of the borough will take over and own a particular improvement, such utility or department and the borough engineer shall inspect and file a written report to the planning board, the borough clerk and the borough commissioners relative to the completion of the particular improvement. 
c.  The performance guaranty shall be deposited with the borough clerk before a construction permit can be issued, and the maintenance guaranty shall be deposited with the borough clerk sufficient to cover any portion, or all, of the improvements desired by the developer to be accepted by the borough if completed in stages, before approval of completion for any stage, or all, of the improvements may be given by the borough. The borough clerk shall notify the construction official, the borough engineer and the planning board when the applicable guaranty has been properly posted. 
(2)  The amount of any performance guaranty may be reduced by the borough commissioners by resolution when portions of the improvements have been certified by the borough engineer to have been completed. The time allowed for installation of the improvements for which the performance guaranty has been provided may be extended by the borough commissioners by resolution. 
(3)  If the required improvements are not completed or corrected in accordance with the performance guarantee, the obligor and surety shall be liable thereon to the borough for the reasonable costs of the improvements not yet completed or corrected, and the borough may, either prior to or after receipt of such funds, complete the improvements. 
(4)  When all improvements required by this chapter have been completed, the obligor shall notify the borough commissioners, in writing, by certified mail, addressed via the borough clerk, of the completion of said improvements and shall send a copy thereof to the planning board and the borough engineer; thereupon, the borough engineer shall inspect all of the required improvements and file a detailed report, in writing, to the borough commissioners and the planning board, indicating his recommendations for approval, partial approval or rejection, with a statement of reasons if not certified complete. If partial approval is granted, the cost of the corrections or the replacement of such unacceptable improvements shall be set forth. 
(5)  The borough commissioners shall either approve, partially approve or reject the improvements, with the report of the borough engineer in hand, and the borough clerk shall so notify the obligor, in writing, by certified mail, of the commissioners' action and the basis therefor not later than sixty-five (65) days following the receipt of the notice from the obligor of the completion of the improvements, in part or in whole. Where partial approval is granted, the obligor shall be released from all liability pursuant to the performance guaranty, except for that portion or amount sufficient to cover completion of those improvements not yet approved. Failure of the borough commissioners to send or provide such notification to the obligor within the sixty-five (65) days shall be deemed to constitute approval of the improvements for which the obligor requested release, and both the obligor and the surety shall be released from all liability for those particular improvements, pursuant to such performance guaranty. 
(6)  If any portion of the required improvements is rejected, the borough commissioners may require the obligor to complete such improvements, and, upon completion, the same procedure of certification as set forth in subsection (5) of this section shall be followed. 
(7)  The obligor shall deposit with the borough clerk an amount of money equal to four percent (4%) of the total cost of required improvements as estimated by the borough engineer for but not limited to the necessary legal work required of the borough, all inspections for which the borough would otherwise pay, the cost of advertising and other costs by reason of the application for site plan review, and any unexpended money so deposited will be refunded to the obligor when the applicable required improvements have been accepted by the borough. 
(8)  Nothing herein, however, shall be construed to limit the right of the obligor to contest by legal proceedings any determination of the governing body or the municipal engineer.

Sec. 113-359. - Design standards. 
    The planning board shall ensure that the following design and construction standards are fully complied with in any site plan involving multifamily dwellings, including senior citizens' housing, shopping centers, industrial and commercial buildings and institutional buildings, and in their proper relationship to the surrounding ground. The following design standards shall apply for site plans involving multifamily dwellings and senior citizens' housing, shopping centers, industrial and commercial buildings and institutional buildings: 
(1)  Multifamily dwellings and senior citizens' housing. These shall meet the following criteria: 
a.  Circulation. Not fewer than two (2) separate means of vehicular access shall be provided to provide for emergency vehicles; however, one (1) of the accessways may be unpaved, so long as there are no obstructing walls, ditches, trees and other obstacles which might hinder the passage of emergency vehicles. 
1.  Current vehicular traffic flow on public streets shall not be disrupted by traffic to and from the site. 
2.  For public streets serving the site: 
(i)  24-hour traffic counts not more than one (1) year old shall be provided along all roads serving the site. 
(ii)  Morning and evening peak-hour traffic counts shall be furnished for all entrances to the site from public streets. 
(iii)  Peak-hour traffic flow generated by the site itself shall be provided, to show the relationship between the two (2) systems and to reveal possible conflict during peak hours. 
b.  Relative to traffic flow on the site itself. The circulation pattern on the site shall flow continuously, with no obstructions. All driveways shall be not less than sixteen (16) feet wide for one-way traffic and twenty-four (24) feet wide for two-way traffic. Any emergency accessway shall provide a clear width not less than twenty-four (24) feet. All traffic directions shall be marked with arrows. 
1.  Circulation to and from the off-street parking areas shall be as direct as possible, and no parking shall be permitted on driveways; furthermore, the design shall prevent backing directly in public streets from any parking space. 
2.  Circulation shall be direct to and from the entrance of the buildings, with minimal conflict with pedestrians walking from parking areas to buildings. 
3.  Traffic on the site shall avoid recreation areas as far as possible; clearly visible markings to indicate such recreation areas shall be provided. 
c.  Pedestrian traffic flow. Pedestrian traffic flow shall be served by sidewalks located along natural desire-lines and not merely located to form a pattern in plan. 
1.  Sidewalks shall be installed to borough standards along the site side of all public streets leading to site entrances. 
2.  Within the site, walkways shall be not less than four (4) feet in width for all minor walks merely connecting various areas other than between buildings or leading to parking areas; for major walks leading between buildings and leading to parking areas and connecting the public street with buildings, there shall be a width not less than five (5) feet; and for main entrances to buildings, the walks shall be not less than eight (8) feet in width. Walks serving commercial buildings shall conform to the pattern prevailing nearby. 
3.  In every case where any walkway on the site crosses a driveway, there shall be clearly visible markings, such as stripes on the driveway, and each intersection shall have reflector-type markers to indicate pedestrian crossings in all applicable directions. 
d.  Grading. As a means of providing proper stormwater runoff, maintenance of grass areas and general safety on the site, the following standards shall prevail with regard to all surface slopes on the site: 
1.  The minimum gradient along all driveways on the site shall be one percent (1%), and where necessary to achieve this, storm inlets and catch basins shall be provided. On grass areas in sandy soils the minimum gradient shall be one and one-half percent (11/2%), but in clay soils, the minimum shall be two percent (2%). Terraces or embankments shall be no steeper than one (1) foot vertical to three (3) feet horizontal for proper maintenance and to prevent soil erosion. 
2.  The minimum cross slope on walkways shall be one-eighth ( 1/8 ) inch per foot, and the maximum shall be one-fourth (1/4) inch per foot. 
3.  Grading between site property lines and the top of curb in all public streets abutting the site shall be a minimum of one-fourth (1/4) inch per foot and a maximum of one-half (1/2) inch per foot. 
4.  The general grade sloping away from all buildings for a distance of at least fifty (50) feet from the building shall be not less than two percent (2%), including the main entrance walk. 
5.  Soil erosion and sedimentation control. The applicant shall submit as a part of his completed application for preliminary site plan approval a copy of his erosion and sedimentation control plan showing the approval of the county soil conservation district pursuant to Soil Erosion and Sediment Control Act (N.J.S.A. 4:24-39 et seq.). The specific measures to be used will depend upon factors such as the size of the site, the types of soil, the degree of slope, vegetation cover and the like, but there are general requirements which shall apply to all sites, and the following practices shall apply to any soil erosion and sedimentation control plan: 
(i)  Only the areas needed for construction shall be disturbed; only those trees, shrubs and grasses absolutely necessary for construction and lay-down areas for materials shall be removed; all vegetation which remains undisturbed by means of substantial barricades shall be protected; and, as the initial operation, all topsoil shall be stripped from areas to be disturbed and piled in an area on the site where it will not be disturbed. 
(ii)  The duration of exposure of bare soil shall be minimized. 
(iii)  Sedimentation basins and diversion dikes before disturbing the land which drains to them shall be installed. Diversion dikes in the central part of the development may be constructed after base courses of streets are installed, but before construction is started on the land which drains into them. 
(iv)  Temporary seeding or mulching (depending upon the time of year) shall be used to control erosion on exposed areas which are critical during construction and which will remain bare for more than thirty (30) days. 
(v)  Storm drainage, sewers, water mains, electric and telephone cables, curbs and base courses of driveways shall be installed before building construction begins. 
(vi)  All erosion and sedimentation control measures shall be in accordance with standards and specifications of the county soil conservation district. 
(vii)  Stockpiled topsoil shall be protected with straw mulch or jute or plastic mesh. 
e.  Storm drainage. As a basic principle, grading shall be planned so that the site will ultimately drain by gravity; however, the following criteria shall be met: 
1.  On interior driveways, which shall be curbed as required herein, stormwater shall not flow more than five hundred (500) feet without being picked up by a drain inlet or catch basin. 
2.  Grass areas shall be graded in such manner that, for entrance areas, stormwater shall be picked up by catch basins to prevent water from flowing across the walkway, and in no case shall water be allowed to impound in grass areas except those basins forming a part of the soil erosion and sedimentation control system. 
3.  All drainage lines shall be sized according to a drainage analysis based upon the following rational formula, or other method previously approved by the borough engineer: 
Q = CIA 
Where: 
Q = The flow in cubic feet per second 
C = The runoff coefficient 
I = The intensity of rainfall in inches per hour 
A = The particular drainage area in acres 
4.  All storm drain lines shall have gradients indicated and based upon the analysis mentioned in subsection (1)e.3 of this section, and a copy of this analysis shall be made a part of the complete application for preliminary approval, where applicable. 
f.  Sanitary sewerage. Sanitary sewerage, in all instances, must comply with borough, county, state and federal requirements. 
g.  Landscaping. 
1.  A separate planting plan, with specifications, prepared by a qualified landscape architect shall be made a part of site plans one-half (1/2) acre or larger and shall be made a part of the complete application for preliminary site plan approval, showing the location, names according to the latest edition of Standardized Plant Names and sizes of all trees, shrubs, vines and ground covers, which list of plants and their location shall be selected for their hardiness, minimum maintenance and attractive growth habit. 
2.  Generally, specimen trees or shrubs shall be kept to a minimum, in preference to massing with edges of planting beds in sweeping curves for ease of maintenance of grass areas. 
3.  Special attention shall be given to providing shaded areas in and around recreation areas and shaded walks, especially in senior citizens' housing where walking is an important activity. 
4.  Benches shall be placed along walkways and, in senior citizens' housing, there shall be not fewer than one (1) bench for every eight (8) occupied dwelling units, which benches shall be located strategically about the site. 
5.  The areas away from buildings shall be kept free from low-growing shrubs, and high-headed trees shall be used instead for security reasons. 
6.  Provision shall be made for the installation of temporary grass when areas to be seeded become available during seasons which are not proper for permanent grass installation. 
h.  Lighting. The following criteria for site lighting shall be met: 
1.  All lighting on the site side of public streets, if to be installed by the developer, shall be according to borough standards. 
2.  All light standards within the site along driveways shall not exceed twenty-five (25) feet in height and shall be spaced in such manner as to provide a minimum of nine-tenths (0.9) footcandle along all driveways and adjacent sidewalks, spaced at appropriate intervals. 
3.  Illumination at each paved vehicular entrance shall measure not less than two (2.0) footcandles, which illumination shall prevail along walkways between the site entrance and all buildings. 
4.  Parking areas shall be provided with a minimum of one (1) footcandle. 
5.  Spotlights and floodlights, if used, shall not be mounted on buildings facing outward, but should be mounted to avoid glare. 
6.  All lighting shall be shielded to restrict the apex angle of illumination to one hundred fifty (150) degrees to avoid glare. 
7.  Mushroom-type lights may be used along walkways if properly designed and spaced to provide the minimum required illumination. 
8.  No illumination shall cause glare upon surrounding properties. 
9.  Illumination of the name of the project or buildings on the site shall be indirect, and no floodlighting of such signs shall be permitted. 
i.  Building location and architectural design. It is not the intent of this chapter to dictate architectural style, materials of construction and other factors which are the prerogatives of qualified architects and qualified site planners, as applicable, but the following are deemed to be within the scope of environmental considerations of the borough and are therefore included as requirements for preliminary site plan approval: 
1.  The location of the building shall take maximum advantage of the existing topography, with a view towards: 
(i)  Requiring the least amount of grading or otherwise disturbance of the site. 
(ii)  Serving the purpose of the building to the maximum. 
(iii)  Utilizing the particular site to maximum efficiency. 
2.  The architectural design of buildings and other structures on the site shall be harmonious with their environment and compatible with similar use structures within the area so as to add to the civic well-being of the borough. 
j.  Parking. Parking shall be in accordance with applicable portions of the zoning regulations herein. 
(2)  Shopping centers. The following standards shall be met where two (2) or more retail establishments are designed to be constructed on a single lot, whether or not future subdivision may be contemplated: 
a.  Circulation. Where the surrounding public streets cannot serve as peripheral circulation, the primary circulation pattern on the site shall be around the periphery, permitting the least conflict between pedestrian and parking movements with high-speed vehicular traffic; this will also facilitate separation between loading and unloading and the peripheral traffic. 
1.  The pattern of pedestrian traffic should generally radiate to and from the center of the stores, forming flow lines between various parking areas. Where possible, these pedestrian flow lines should not be interrupted by truck traffic. 
2.  Acceleration and deceleration lanes shall be provided for every vehicular entrance to the site from public streets. 
3.  Insofar as is possible, vehicular cross-traffic shall be avoided, and, where unavoidable, one (1) direction of the flow or the other shall be made a stop street. 
4.  Where application is for additional store or stores within an established retail area, both a 24-hour and a peak-hour traffic count shall be submitted for each street at each entrance, which shall be compared with that flow anticipated after completion of the proposed construction. 
b.  Grading. Generally, the ideal grading for a shopping center is for the stores to be on the highest point of the site and for the surface to slope gently towards the property lines in all directions. 
1.  Finished grade on the parking areas shall not exceed two percent (2%). 
2.  Where the site is otherwise relatively flat, the finished surface shall be graded to channel the stormwater flow into valleys leading to drain inlets and catch basins. Basically, the vehicular aisles loading to parking spaces may be made the valleys which, in turn, shall flow no more than three hundred (300) feet to inlets or catch basins. 
3.  Under no circumstances shall the parking area be used for the impounding basin in the finished shopping center. 
4.  Soil erosion and sedimentation control basins shall be established during construction. Where natural watercourses exist within a reasonable distance to be used as discharge points, the control basins may no longer be required after paving is complete, so long as the drainage system is properly designed. 
c.  Storm drainage. Under no circumstances shall stormwater flow from the paved parking areas directly into surrounding streets. The stormwater shall be picked up on the site and carried to approved discharge points. The stormwater drainage system shall be in accordance with a drainage analysis similar to that required in section 113-311(2)e.8. 
d.  Landscaping. A complete planting plan, prepared by a qualified landscape architect, shall be made a part of the completed application for preliminary site plan approval, and street trees shall be located strategically throughout the parking areas at a ratio of one (1) tree for every forty (40) cars, such trees generally being located at ends of rows or in turning islands, for example: 
1.  Around the periphery of the shopping center, except at entrances, there shall be street trees spaced at intervals of not less than fifty (50) feet nor more than sixty (60) feet and, where parking areas abut residential areas, a low wall or evergreen hedge shall be installed to block headlight glare upon the residential areas. 
2.  Provision shall be made for small play areas, where small children may play under supervision while their mothers shop; this requirement shall apply only where ten (10) or more stores are involved. Such play areas shall be enclosed with chain link fencing, with the gate controlled by the supervisor. 
e.  Lighting. Lighting for shopping centers, aside from signs which are controlled by the zoning regulations, consists of illumination of the entrances, the peripheral driveways, the parking areas, the loading and unloading areas and the pedestrianways, as follows: 
1.  Entrances shall have illumination of not less than two (2.0) footcandles. 
2.  Illumination of parking areas shall be not less than one (1.0) footcandle. 
3.  Illumination of peripheral driveways shall be not less than nine-tenths (0.9) footcandle. 
4.  Illumination of loading and unloading areas shall be a minimum of one (1.0) footcandle. 
5.  Illumination of pedestrianways shall be not less than two (2.0) footcandles. 
6.  Children's play areas should not be open at night, but should nevertheless have illumination of six-tenths (0.6) footcandle. 
(3)  Industrial and commercial buildings. 
a.  Circulation. All one-way driveways shall be not less than eighteen (18) feet in width to allow for stalled vehicles, and two-way drives shall be not less than thirty (30) feet wide. 
1.  Where there is more than one (1) working shift, there shall be sufficient parking space to serve the day shift plus the larger of the other shifts at one (1) time. 
2.  Customer parking on commercial areas shall be made separate from employee parking and unloading areas, with minimal conflict between pedestrian and vehicular flow. 
3.  Where the commercial site permits, there should be approximately one-fourth (1/4) of the required parking area or spaces, as applicable, in front of the store and the remainder to the rear, with customer entrances in the rear as well as the front. 
b.  Grading. A complete grading plan shall be made a part of the application for preliminary site plan approval. The grading shall be such that stormwater shall not flow from the site directly into the public street or across a public walkway; to prevent this, catchbasins and drain inlets shall be located at strategic points and the stormwater piped to an approved outfall. 
c.  Landscaping. Planting of street trees along the public street shall be high-headed trees to permit storefronts to be seen from automobiles; spacing shall be not more than fifty (50) feet. Shrub planting should be minimal, adjacent to buildings only. 
d.  Lighting. Lighting of parking areas is a primary concern to the borough; minimum illumination shall be as prescribed under subsection (2)e. of this section. Floodlighting of buildings shall not cause off-site glare.

DIVISION 1. - GENERALLY 

Sec. 113-377. - Zoning districts enumerated; zoning map. 
(a)  For the purposes of this article, the borough is hereby divided into eight (8) zoning districts, which shall be designated as follows: 
R Residential Districts A Business Districts A-1 Business Districts B Business Districts B-1 Business Districts B-2 Business Districts C Business Districts PR Planned Retail Districts  
(b)  The locations and boundaries of such districts shall be shown upon the zoning map attached to and hereby made a part of this chapter, which shall be designated the "zoning map;" said map and all the notations, references and other data shown thereon shall be as much a part of this chapter as if fully described herein. 
(Code 1992, § 208-80; Ord. No. 455, 4-10-1979) 
Sec. 113-378. - District boundaries. 
    The boundaries between districts are, unless otherwise indicated, either the centerlines of streets, lanes, watercourses, rights-of-way of power lines, railroads and other public utilities or such lines extended or parallel thereto; where the boundaries of a single district are indicated as including directly opposite sides of a street, lane, watercourse, right-of-way of power lines, railroad or other public utility for any portion of its length, the district so indicated shall be construed to apply to the entire bed of such street, lane or watercourse or right-of-way of such utility line lying within such portion of its length. Where uncertainty exists as to the location of any of said boundaries as shown on the zoning map, the following shall apply: 
(1)  Where a district boundary is indicated as approximately following the centerline of a street, watercourse or right-of-way of a utility line, such centerline shall be construed to be such boundary. 
(2)  Where a district boundary is indicated as approximately following a lot line or other property line, such lot line or other property line shall be construed to be such boundary. 
(3)  Where a district boundary divides a lot or runs through undivided property, the location of such boundary shall, unless specified by figures or dimensions on the map, be determined by the use of the scale appearing on said map. 
(Code 1992, § 208-81; Ord. No. 455, 4-10-1979) 
Sec. 113-379. - Lots divided by district boundary line. 
    Where a lot is divided by a district boundary line, the uses permitted in the less restrictive district may extend into that portion of said lot in the more restrictive district to the nearest lot line, but in no case for a greater distance than twenty-five (25) feet, so long as full use is made of the less restrictive area of the lot before extension into the more restrictive area of the lot, and provided that the yard, coverage and other regulations of the less restrictive district shall not be so extended. 
(Code 1992, § 208-82; Ord. No. 455, 4-10-1979) 
Sec. 113-380. - Federal- and state-owned property. 
    Wherever federal- or state-owned property is included in one (1) or more of the zoning districts, such property shall be subject to the zoning regulations herein only to the extent permitted by the Constitution and laws of the United States of America and of the state. 
(Code 1992, § 208-83; Ord. No. 455, 4-10-1979) 
Sec. 113-381. - Flood hazard areas. 
(a)  The flood hazard areas superimposed upon the borough zoning map are as delineated by the federal Department of Housing and Urban Development, in part, and represent those areas having the potential hazard of being flooded by storms of 100-year frequency (approximated at seven (7) inches in twenty-four (24) hours) as according to United States Corps of Engineers' data on the Delaware River, projected by elevation, and to a minor degree they reflect analysis of existing vegetation and soils. These areas have been divided into tidal floodplain and high-water table, each of which is described as follows: 
(1)  Tidal floodplain. The boundary of this area is established by a combination of natural stormwater flow projected for a 100-year storm and the impounding effect of high water in the Delaware River when such 100-year storm coincides with exceptionally high tides and high winds, and such area shall be subject to the following provisions and regulations: 
a.  Location. Where it is alleged by an applicant that the tidal floodplain on the ground differs from that shown on the zoning map, whether as a result of natural causes, manmade activity or otherwise, following recommendation of the borough engineer the planning board may, as a conditional use, allow or deny the extension or reduction of the tidal floodplain, subject to the following: 
1.  Sufficient evidence shall be prepared and submitted by a professional engineer, registered in the state, indicating that a location other than that shown on the zoning map is more accurate. 
2.  If an extension or reduction of the tidal floodplain is allowed by the planning board as a conditional use, all of the regulations herein pertaining to tidal floodplain shall apply to the new location and the zoning map revision shall be submitted to the commissioners for their review and, if approved, for their adoption as an amendment to this chapter. 
3.  If, however, the extension or reduction of the tidal floodplain as a conditional use is denied by the planning board, appeal may be taken as prescribed by law. 
b.  Use regulations in the tidal floodplain. Paved parking areas, retaining walls, swimming pools, tennis courts and other recreation areas and municipal uses, except schools and other permanent buildings, shall be permitted; provided, however, that no type of dwelling shall be permitted and any other use permitted in the zoning district in which the tidal floodplain lies shall be permitted only when authorized by the planning board or the zoning board of adjustment as a conditional use; and further provided that the specific location and method of solving the health, structural and sanitary engineering problems are solved in a manner acceptable to the borough board of health and the borough engineer, whose written opinions shall be submitted to the planning board, and provided that for any permitted use, the floodproofing and drainage facilities are installed as may be mandated by the planning board, following recommendation by the borough engineer and based upon standards and criteria promulgated by the federal flood insurance administrator, as revised from time to time. 
c.  Modification of the ground within the tidal floodplain. Minor grading and excavation may take place within the tidal floodplain in connection with a permitted use, provided that: 
1.  The cross-sectional area taken at right angle to the direction of flow shall neither be reduced, nor shall any other measure be taken which might disrupt or restrict the flow; and 
2.  Such additional conditions and safeguards as may be imposed by the planning board or board of adjustment, as applicable, shall be complied with. 
(2)  High-water table. The high-water table area indicated on the zoning map is based, in part, on the water hazard area map prepared by the federal Department of Housing and Urban Development for the borough and, in part, by existing soils and vegetation, together with personal knowledge of reliable, long-time residents of the borough, and shall be subject to the following provisions and regulations: 
a.  Location. Where it is alleged by an applicant that the high-water table on the ground differs from that shown on the zoning map, whether as result of natural causes, manmade activity or otherwise, following recommendation of the borough engineer the planning board or the board of adjustment may, as a conditional use, allow or deny the extension or reduction of the high-water table, subject to the following: 
1.  Sufficient evidence shall be prepared and submitted by a professional civil engineer, registered in the state, indicating that a location other than that shown on the zoning map is more accurate. 
2.  If an extension or reduction of the high-water table is allowed as a conditional use, all of the regulations herein pertaining to the high-water table shall apply to the new location, and the zoning map revision shall be submitted to the commissioners for their review and, if approved, for their adoption as an amendment to this chapter. 
3.  If, however, the extension or reduction of the high-water table in the above manner is denied by the planning board or board of adjustment, an appeal may be taken as prescribed by law. 
b.  Use regulations in the high-water table areas. Any use permitted in the zoning district in which the high-water table area is located shall be permitted as a conditional use, subject to the planning board's finding, after recommendation of the borough engineer, that the following conditions prevail: 
1.  That sufficient fill material will or has been installed to raise the level of the proposed building or other structure to such a degree that, in the board's opinion, there will be no potential hazard from the high-water table. 
2.  That the type of building or other structure proposed is so designed that no harmful effect is likely to result from a possible high-water table. 
3.  That there will be no interruption to the natural surface water flow and no impounding of surface water will result from the placement of fill to overcome the harmful effects of a possible high-water table. 
4.  That placement of fill material on the lot in question will not cause the high-water table to be relocated on property previously not within the high-water table. 
(b)  Boundary lines modified. In accordance with authorization appearing on the back of the Federal Department of Housing and Urban Development's flood hazard map, the boundary lines of the flood hazard areas on the zoning map have been modified to the degree considered proper and accurate, based upon conditions existing in the borough. 
(c)  Warning and disclaimer of liability. The degree of flood hazard area delineation and warning provided by this article is for regulatory purposes and is based upon the best available data and careful study thereof; larger flood levels or high-water tables may occur on rare occasions, or the areas may be increased by manmade or natural causes, such as falling timber, ice jams and similar occurrences; in such instances, areas beyond those boundaries shown on the zoning map might be included. This chapter shall not create liability on the part of the borough or any officer or employee thereof.

ARTICLE VIII. - SUPPLEMENTARY REQUIREMENTS 

Sec. 113-498. - Environmental impact statement. 
(a)  Purpose. It is the purpose of this section to require the submission of an environmental impact statement as a part of a land development application for any site plan, major subdivision, general development plan, planned unit development, planned residential development or any development or redevelopment approval within the borough. The purpose of requiring such a statement is to assist the land use board and its consultants in assessing the impact of a proposed project upon the local and regional environment, particularly with respect to water and air resources, energy resources, pollution of all kinds, topography, drainage, waste disposal, wildlife habitat and the landscape. No application for development shall be approved unless it has been affirmatively determined that the proposed project will not result in a significant adverse impact to the environment, has been conceived of and designed in a way that will not impair natural processes and will not place disproportionate excessive demand upon the total resources available to the project site and the impact area. 
(b)  Filing and review of environmental impact statement. 
(1)  Each applicant for approval with respect to any site plan, major subdivision, general development, planned commercial development or planned residential development or any development or redevelopment shall file sixteen (16) copies of the environmental impact statement, together with the original application. Upon application by an applicant for minor site plan approval, the planning board or zoning board of adjustment may waive the requirement for submission of an environmental impact statement or modify or reduce the requirements of the environmental impact statement as circumstances warrant. No environmental impact statement shall be required for a minor subdivision. 
(2)  The land use board shall examine the applicant's environmental impact statement in detail, together with the comments from the board's professionals and the environmental commission. If such statement is deemed to be lacking in sufficient detail or is incomplete in any detail, the board secretary shall reject the development application as being incorrectly filed; provided, however, that the applicant shall be notified thereof within forty-five (45) days of submission of the application, or it shall be deemed properly submitted. 
(3)  The borough recognizes that providing environmental information is essential to the orderly planning and development of the borough, and it further recognizes that the time lapse between preliminary or tentative development approvals and final approvals often results in environmental impact(s) which must be properly analyzed. It is therefore required that the provisions of this article with respect to the submission of an environmental impact statement shall apply to both applications for preliminary or final approval and for redevelopment where no environmental impact statement has been previously submitted for any section or sections of a development heretofore or hereafter receiving preliminary or tentative approval.

Sec. 113-499. - Traffic impact statements. 
(a)  Purpose. It is the purpose of this section to require the submission of a traffic impact statement as a part of a land development application for any site plan, major subdivision, general development plan, planned unit development, planned residential development or any development or redevelopment approval within the borough. The purpose of requiring such a statement is to assist the land use board and its consultants in assessing the impact of a proposed project upon the local and regional roadway network. The land use board may waive the requirement for a traffic impact study report totally or partially if sufficient evidence is submitted to the board to indicate that the proposed project will have a negligible traffic impact or that a complete report need not be prepared and submitted in order to adequately evaluate the specific traffic impact produced by the development application. The burden of demonstrating exceptions hereinabove stated shall at all times rest with the applicant, who must affirmatively demonstrate to the board the basis for the waiver request. 
(b)  Content. The traffic impact study report shall contain the following information: 
(1)  A full documentation of existing conditions on adjacent streets which provide direct site ingress/egress, including roadway pavement width, rights-of-way, parking conditions, pavement conditions, sight distances, grades and alignment of the roadway(s). Existing traffic control devices (traffic signals, speed limits, etc.) shall be described, as well as any pertinent signing or pavement markings. Existing traffic volumes for peak hour conditions shall be presented with the source of these data denoted. 
(2)  Projections of traffic to be generated by the proposed development for an average, daily, morning peak hour(s), an average daily, afternoon peak hour(s) and any other peak hour traffic condition deemed applicable as a result of the type and/or location of the proposed generator. Traffic generation rates should be based upon the latest edition of the ITE Trip Generation Handbook or upon local indices which can be substantiated by supporting documentation. Also, a trip distribution relating to the site traffic and the assignment of the site traffic to the adjacent street system shall be provided. The resultant trip distribution/site traffic assignment shall be fully documented. Any assumptions regarding the diversion of existing traffic to or from alternative routes should be clearly specified in the statement. 
(3)  An assessment of the traffic impact of the proposed development, including a capacity study of each site impacted intersection or roadway segment. These capacity studies shall be done for existing conditions, site predevelopment conditions and site build-out conditions. The site build-out analysis shall be based on traffic volumes projected forward to the anticipated build-out year with adjustments for area-wide growth and seasonal traffic flow variations. Capacity determinations shall be based upon normally accepted standards and documentation, with the basis of these capacity analyses clearly indicated and provided as documentation. In the event the project is staged over a period of time, traffic volume projections for each stage with corresponding capacity analyses shall be provided and documented. 
(4)  A site's traffic volume contribution to the overall background traffic at each site impacted intersection and/or roadway segment shall be determined. 
(5)  A determination of any roadway/intersection deficiencies for existing and/or future conditions. Specific recommendations for the resolution of these deficiencies shall also be addressed in the statement. The statement shall contain a listing of any and all actions to be undertaken by the applicant to mitigate any traffic problems and, as such, shall be considered a firm offer by the applicant to undertake said actions, subject to approval by the land use board. The responsibility for the traffic mitigation measures will be based on a developer's fair share of the improvements.
