PREFACE 
    This Code constitutes a complete recodification of the ordinances of the City of Statesville, North Carolina of a general and permanent nature. 
    Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the 1959 Code, as supplemented, and ordinances adopted by the city council. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this volume, the reader can locate any section of the 1959 Code, as supplemented, and any subsequent ordinance included herein. 
    The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order and the various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Footnotes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state laws have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this volume. 
Numbering System 
    The numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and municipal codes. Each section number consists of two component parts separated by a dash, the figure before the dash referring to the chapter number and the figure after the dash referring to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the first section of Chapter 1 is numbered 1-1 and the seventh section of Chapter 1 is 1-7. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter and at the same time new sections or even whole chapters can be inserted in their proper place simply by using the decimal system for amendments. By way of illustration: If new material consisting of three sections that would logically come between sections 1-2 and 1-3 is desired to be added, such new sections would be numbered 1-2.1, 1-2.2 and 1-2.3 respectively. New chapters may be included in the same manner. If the new material is to be included between Chapters 5 and 6, it will be designated as Chapter 5.5. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject, the next successive number being assigned to the article or division. 
Indices 
    The indices have been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of the headings being couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by municipal officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within each index which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which he is interested. 
    Looseleaf Supplement 
    A special feature of this Code to which the attention of the user is especially directed is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing for the Code. With this system, the Code will be kept up-to-date periodically. Upon the final passage of amendatory ordinances, they will be properly edited and the appropriate page or pages affected will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the Code, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
    Successfully keeping this Code up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the volume. As revised sheets are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
    Acknowledgments 
    The publication of this Code was under the direct supervision of Roger D. Merriam, Supervising Editor, and Ms. Laura Johnson, Editor, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida. Credit is gratefully given to the other members of the publisher's staff for their sincere interest and able assistance throughout the project. 
    The publisher is most grateful to Mr. Pete Connect, City Manager, and Mr. David J. Stewart, City Clerk, for their cooperation and assistance during the progress of the work on this Code. It is hoped that their efforts and those of the publisher have resulted in a Code of Ordinances which will make the active law of the City readily accessible to all citizens and which will be a valuable tool in the day-to-day administration of the City's affairs.

The petition shall contain a general statement of the ground for which the removal is sought. The signatures to the petition need not all be appended to one (1) paper, but each signer shall add to his or her signature his or her place of residence, giving the street and number. One (1) of the signers of each such paper shall make oath before an officer competent to administer oaths that the statements therein made are true, as he believes, and that each signature to the paper appended is the genuine signature of the person whose name it purports to be. 
(b)  Within ten (10) days from the date of filing of such petition, the city clerk shall examine and from the voters' register ascertain whether or not the petition is signed by the requisite number of qualified electors, and he shall attach to the petition his certificate, showing the results of such examination. If by the clerk's certificate it is shown to be insufficient, it may be amended within ten (10) days from the date of the certificate. The clerk shall, within ten (10) days after such amendment, make a like examination of the amended petition, and if his certificate shall show the same to be insufficient, it shall be returned to the person filing the same, without prejudice, however, to the filing of a new petition to the same effect. If the petition shall be deemed to be sufficient, the clerk shall submit the same to the city council without delay. 
(c)  If the petition shall be found to be sufficient, the city council shall order and fix a date for holding a primary election, in accordance with state law governing special elections.

At such election, if some person other than the incumbent is elected the incumbent shall thereupon be deemed removed from the office upon qualification of his or her successor. If the incumbent received a majority of the votes in the primary election, he or she shall continue in office. 
Sec. 3.14. - Failure to qualify. 
    In case the person elected should fail to qualify within ten (10) days after receiving notification of election, the office shall be deemed vacant.

The person so appointed by the council shall be subject to recall as other members of [the] council. 
Sec. 3.15. - Right of recall continued.

In order to more fully carry out the duties imposed by the provisions of this article for more permanent improvement of all streets together with curbs and gutters, drainage conduits and drainage structures and all sidewalks abutting thereon, the council shall have the power to pass an ordinance against the property owners on each side of the street one-fourth of the cost of paving or repaving any such street together with one-fourth of the cost of the curbs and gutters on either side of such street, including drainage conduits and drainage structures constructed or reconstructed, and one-half of the cost of paving or repaving the sidewalk adjoining on the real estate abutting on one (1) side of the street, or portion thereof so laid out and improved, together with one-half of the cost of paving or repaving the sidewalk adjoining on the real estate abutting on the other side of such street, or portion thereof so laid out and improved. It shall be incumbent on the owners of the real estate on each side of the street, or part thereof, so laid out and improved, to pay the amounts so assessed for such improvements, and the amounts charged against each landowner shall be assessed on and shall constitute a lien on the lot or lots of such landowners abutting on the street; provided, that the city shall pay for the remainder of the cost and for all street intersections so improved.

Immediately upon the completion of the work upon any street or sidewalk ordered done by the council under the provisions of this article the person in charge of the work shall make a report in writing to the council showing the cost of paving or repaving, together with the total cost of constructing or reconstructing curbs and gutters, drainage conduits and drainage structures throughout the entire length of the work, with the number of feet frontage of each of such lots. The council, after receipt of this report, shall cause notice of the assessments against abutting property on any street or sidewalk in any improvement district or section to be advertised at least once a week for two (2) consecutive weeks, which notice shall be deemed to be full and sufficient notice to all property owners abutting on the street or sidewalk. This notice shall state the time and place when and where such assessments are to be made and determined, and shall notify all persons interested to appear and show cause, if any, why such assessment shall not be made. At such time and place the council shall proceed to prorate the costs of the work and assess the property as above provided; provided, however, that no assessment against any piece of property improved as herein allowed shall exceed in amount the enhancement in value of the property by reason of such improvement. 
Sec. 8.3. - Assessment lien; payment; foreclosure.

Any property owner may elect to pay such assessment in cash without interest, if same be done within thirty (30) days from and after the date that the council shall make the assessment. In case there shall be a default in the payment of any annual installment for thirty (30) days after the same shall become due, then and in that event the installments remaining, if any, shall become due and the tax collector may proceed to sell such lot or lots for cash to the highest bidder at the courthouse door of Iredell County, after advertisement for thirty (30) days in some newspaper published in the city, and the tax collector shall make a deed to the purchaser and out of the moneys arising from this sale pay off and discharge amount charged and assessed on such lot or lots, together with the interest on the same and the cost of sale, and pay the surplus, if any, to the person or persons legally entitled to the same. 
Sec. 8.4. - Lien book; open to public. 
    For the convenience of the public the tax collector shall keep in his office a lien book, in which shall be entered the location of the lots and street number, if known, upon which assessments have been made, the name or names of the reputed owners thereof, and the amount due on such assessments.

Sec. 8.5. - Appeals from assessments. 
    Any person who shall feel aggrieved by the assessments made by the city council as herein provided, shall have the right within thirty (30) days after the assessments are made, and not after that time, to file his objection to the assessments, and to appeal from the decision of the council to the next term of the superior court of Iredell County, by serving upon the city notice in writing of his intention to do so, specifying in the notice the grounds of his objections to the findings, and by filing within such time with the clerk of the superior court of Iredell County a written undertaking in the sum of two hundred dollars ($200.00), with sufficient surety to be justified and approved by the clerk, to the effect that the appellant will pay to the city all such costs and damages as it may sustain by reason of the appeal. In the case of an appeal from the decision of the council, the ordinance laying out the improvement district, the action of the council in making or levying the assessment, and the objections of the property owner filed thereto shall constitute the case on appeal. All of the papers shall be certified by the city clerk to the superior court, and shall be docketed on the civil issue docket and stand at issue as other civil cases regularly brought in such court. If all issues be found in favor of the appellant on the appeal as above provided, the lien for assessments shall be discharged. If, however, the issues of any of them be found in favor of the city to any amount, the judgment shall be rendered in favor of the city for such amount, and the amount so found, together with the costs of the appeal (which costs shall be assessed as costs in other civil actions) shall be and continue a lien against the property upon which the original assessment was placed from the date of the commencement of the work or improvement.

ARTICLE IX. - CONDEMNATION PROCEEDINGS 

Sec. 9.1. - Power to purchase and condemn land; procedure for condemnation. 
    When, in the opinion of the city council, any land, right-of-way, privilege or easement shall be required for the purpose of opening new streets or of extending or widening those already open, for the extension and maintenance of the drainage, sewerage or water systems of the City of Statesville or for the extension and maintenance of the light, distribution or power system of the city, or for any other public purpose, the city may purchase the same from the owner or owners thereof and pay such compensation therefor as may be agreed upon; but if the city or the city council shall be unable to agree with the owner or owners thereof upon the amount of compensation, condemnation of such land, right-of-way, privilege or easement therein for such public use may be made in the manner hereinafter set forth. 
Sec. 9.2. - Proposed condemnation; order of the city council. 
    When it is proposed to condemn any land, rights, privileges or easements for the purpose herein specified, an order or resolution of the city council at a regular or special meeting of the city council shall be made, stating generally, or as near as may be, the nature of the improvements for which the land, rights, privileges, or easements are required. 
Sec. 9.3. - Petition to be filed with clerk of superior court. 
    The city shall file with the clerk of the superior court of Iredell County its verified petition praying for the appointment of commissioners to appraise and value the real property or rights, privileges or easements proposed to be taken or condemned for the purpose aforesaid, and to ascertain and report to the court what sum should be paid to the owner or owners as damages for the property, rights, privileges or easements so taken, the assessments to be made by the commissioners according to the value of the property, rights, privileges or easements to be acquired for public use. The petition shall set forth and describe the particular property, rights, privileges or easements proposed to be taken or condemned for the purpose aforesaid, and shall also state the names and residences of the owner or owners thereof and of the person who may have any interests therein, which may be affected by the condemnation, and whether any of the owners or minors, with or without guardians. 
Sec. 9.4. - Summons to parties interested; proceedings. 
    Upon the filing of such a petition, the clerk of the superior court shall issue a summons to the parties interested in the lands, rights, privileges or easements described in the petition, requiring them to appear at his office in the courthouse of the county ten (10) days after the service of the summons, and answer or otherwise plead to the petition, and the proceedings shall be conducted in all respects as are other special proceedings, and the clerk may issue process and make publication for parties and appoint guardians in like manner as provided by law in the case of special proceedings. 
Sec. 9.5. - Appointment of commissioners; duties; report; exception to report; appeal. 
    If the clerk shall find that the property, rights, privileges or easements described in the petition are required for public use, he shall make an order appointing three (3) disinterested and competent freeholders of Iredell County to ascertain and assess the value of the property, rights, privileges or easements proposed to be taken and the damages to be paid to the owner or owners thereof by the city. The clerk shall issue a notice of their appointment to the freeholders, to be served upon them by the sheriff of the county, and when so notified they shall, within five (5) days, go upon the premises and ascertain the value of the lands, rights, privileges or easements proposed to be taken or condemned for the public use, determine by a majority vote the amount of damages to be paid for the same, and make a report of their finding in writing to the clerk of the superior court of Iredell County, within five (5) days after they view the premises. Before making such report they may take the evidence of witnesses offered as to any values to be assessed; that if any party to the proceedings shall be dissatisfied with the report of the commissioners, he may file exceptions thereto with the clerk of the superior court within ten (10) days after the filing of the report with the clerk; and all issues of fact and law raised before the clerk in such proceedings and upon such exceptions shall be transferred to the superior court for trial in like manner as provided in the case of other precedence over all other civil cases or matters on docket of the court. If the city, at the time of the appraisal, shall pay into court the sum appraised by the commissioners, then and in that event the city may enter, take possession of and hold such lands, notwithstanding the pendency of the appeal, and until the final judgment rendered on the appeal. From the judgment of the superior court rendered in such proceedings any of the parties may appeal to the court of appeals; provided, however, that no appeal shall hinder or delay the city in opening such streets, in constructing such lines or erecting such improvements. 
Sec. 9.6. - Considerations governing assessments. 
    In making the valuation and assessment aforesaid, the commissioners shall take into consideration the loss or damage that may accrue to the owner or owners by reason of the land, right-of-way, privilege or easement being surrendered, and also any benefit or advantage such owner may receive from the placing, maintaining, extending or constructing of the proposed improvements for which such land, right-of-way, privilege or easement shall be required, and shall ascertain the amount of loss or damage in excess of the benefit or advantage, or the value or amount of such benefit or advantage in excess of loss or damage, as the case may be; that the value of any benefit or advantage to any lot or land arising from the placing, maintaining, extending or constructing of the proposed improvements accruing to such lot or other land may be assessed by the commissioners against the lot or land and shall be a lien thereon. 
Sec. 9.7. - Powers of court. 
    In all cases of appraisal under this article where the mode or manner of the proceedings is not expressly or sufficiently provided for herein, the court before which such proceedings may be pending shall have the power to make all necessary orders and give proper directions to carry into effect the object and intent of this article and the practice and procedure in such cases shall conform as near as may be to the ordinary practice and procedure in such court. 
Sec. 9.8. - Transfer of ownership not to delay proceedings. 
    No change of ownership or transfer of the real estate or any interest therein or of the subject matter of the appraisal or any part thereof shall in any manner affect such proceedings after the same has been instituted, but the same may be carried on and perfected as if no conveyance or transfer had been made or attempted to be made. 
Sec. 9.9. - Defective titles; new proceedings to perfect title; possession bond. 
    If at any time after the attempt to acquire such property or rights by appraisal of damages or otherwise, it shall be found that the title to such property or rights proposed to be taken or condemned or which have been acquired and condemned, are defective, the city may proceed anew to acquire or perfect such title in the same manner as if no appraisal had been made; and at any stage of the new proceedings the court may authorize the petitioner, if in possession of the property or rights, to continue in possession of the same, and if not in the possession to take possession and use such property or rights during the pending and until the final conclusion of such new proceedings, upon such petitioner paying into court a sufficient sum or giving security as the court may direct for damage, which may be finally assessed and recovered against it. 
Sec. 9.10. - Right of city to recover payments on defective titles. 
    If the title to any property or rights, privileges or easements condemned in any proceedings instituted under this article shall prove defective, the city may by action recover of the party or person who has received the money or compensation for the property, rights, privileges or easements so condemned any loss or damage it may have sustained by reason of such defect of title, not exceeding the amount so paid as compensation.

The city, when seeking to acquire such property or rights or easements therein or thereto, shall have the right and authority, at its option and election, to use the provisions and procedures as authorized and provided in G.S. 136-66.3(c) and article 9 of chapter 136 of the General Statutes for any of such purposes without being limited to streets constituting a part of the state highway system; provided, however, that the provisions of this subsection shall not apply with regard to properties owned by public service corporations as defined in G.S. 160A-243(c), unless: 
(1)  The exercise of such power of eminent domain is either consented to by the owner of the property to be acquired by the city; or 
(2)  It is first adjudicated after notice and a hearing that such acquisition will not prevent or unreasonably impair the continued devotion to the public use of such properties and the operation by such public service corporation. 
(b)  The authority conferred upon the city in subsection (a) shall only be exercised when the city is seeking to acquire land, easements, privileges, rights-of-way or other interests in real property located in and outside the corporate limits of the city.

ARTICLE I. - AIRPORT HAZARD OVERLAY DISTRICT 

Sec. 4-1. - Authority and enactment. 
    The legislature of the State of North Carolina has, in Ch. 63, Art. 4, Model Airport Zoning Act, authorized local governmental units to adopt regulations designed to protect the public health, public safety, and general welfare of their citizenry. The city council of the City of Statesville does hereby ordain and enact into law the following article as the Airport Hazard Ordinance of the City of Statesville's planning jurisdiction. 
(Ord. No. 9-04, 4-19-04) 
Sec. 4-2. - Definitions. 
    For the purposes of this article, the following words and phrases shall have the meanings respectively ascribed to them by this section: 
    Airport means the Statesville Regional Airport. 
    Airport elevation means the established airport elevation above mean sea level, which is nine hundred sixty-five (965) feet at Statesville Municipal Airport. 
    Airport hazard means any permanent or temporary structure or tree which would exceed the height limitations as depicted on the height zoning map referred to in section 4-3 of this article (which was developed based on the federal obstruction standards as contained in 14 CFR Parts 77.21, 77.23, and 77.25), and furthermore obstructs the aerial approaches of a publicly owned airport or is otherwise hazardous to its use for landing or taking off. 
    Approach surface means a surface longitudinally centered on the extended runway centerline, extending outward and upward from the end of the primary surface and at the same slope as the approach zone height limitation slope set forth in section 4-3 of this article. 
    Conical surface means a surface extending outward and upward from the periphery of the horizontal surface at a slope of twenty to one (20:1) for a horizontal distance of four thousand (4,000) feet. 
    Decision height means the height at which a decision must be made, during a precision instrument approach, to either continue the approach or to execute a missed approach. 
    FAA means the Federal Aviation Administration. 
    Height means the vertical distance from the ground elevation to the highest point of a structure or tree, including any appurtenance thereon. 
    Horizontal surface means a horizontal plane one hundred fifty (150) feet above the established airport elevation, the perimeter of which in plan coincides with the perimeter of the horizontal zone. 
    Minimum descent altitude means the lowest altitude, expressed in feet above mean sea level, to which descent is authorized on final approach or during circling-to-land maneuvering in execution of a standard instrument approach procedure when no electronic glide slope is provided. 
    Minimum en-route altitude means the lowest altitude in effect between the radio fixes which ensures acceptable navigational signal coverage and meets obstruction clearance requirements between those fixes. 
    Minimum obstruction clearance altitude means the lowest published altitude in effect between radio fixes or VOR airways, off airway routes, or route segments which meets obstruction clearance requirements for the entire route segment and which ensures acceptable navigational signal coverage. 
    Nonconforming structure means any permanent or temporary structure or tree which does not conform to this article as of the effective date of these regulations. 
    Nonprecision instrument runway means a runway having an existing instrument approach procedure utilizing air navigation facilities with horizontal guidance only, or a type of navigation equipment for which a straight-in nonprecision instrument approach procedure has been approved or planned. 
    Precision instrument runway means a runway having an existing instrument approach procedure utilizing an instrument landing system (ILS), precision approach radar (PAR) or global positioning system (GPS). It also means a runway for which a precision approach system is planned and is so indicated on an approved airport layout plan or any other planning document. 
    Primary surface means a surface longitudinally centered on a runway. When the runway has a specifically prepared hard surface, the primary surface extends two hundred (200) feet beyond each end of that runway. The width of the primary surface is one thousand (1,000) feet. The elevation of any point on the primary surface is the same as the elevation of the nearest point on the runway centerline. 
    Runway means a defined area on an airport prepared for landing and takeoff of aircraft along its length. 
    Structure means any object of a permanent or temporary nature, constructed or installed by human labor, including, but without limitation, buildings, towers, smokestacks, equipment, cranes and overhead transmission lines. 
    Transitional surfaces means surfaces that extended outward at ninety (90) degree angles to the runway centerline and the runway centerline extended at a slope of seven (7) feet horizontally for each one (1) foot vertically from the sides of the primary and approach surfaces to where they intersect the horizontal and conical surface. Transitional surfaces for those portions of the precision approach surfaces, which project through and beyond the limits of the conical surface, extend a distance of five thousand (5,000) feet measured horizontally from the edge of the approach surface and at ninety (90) degree angles to the extended runway centerline. 
    Tree means any object of natural growth. 
    Zoning administrator means the administrative office or agency responsible for administering zoning within the City of Statesville. 
(Ord. No. 9-04, 4-19-04; Ord. No. 67-07, 12-17-07)

    In order to carry out the purposes of this article, there are hereby created and established certain zones, which include all of the land lying beneath the approach surfaces, transitional surfaces, horizontal surfaces, and conical surfaces as they apply to Statesville Regional Airport. Such zones are shown on the height zoning map, prepared by W.K. Dickson dated September 2007, which is attached to this article and made part hereof. An area located in more than one (1) of the following zones is considered to be only in the zone with the more restrictive height limitation. The various zones are hereby established and defined as follows: 
(a)  Nonprecision instrument approach zone. The inner edge of this approach zone coincides with the width of the primary surface and is one thousand (1,000) feet wide. 
The approach zone expands outward uniformly to a width of four thousand (4,000) feet at a horizontal distance ten thousand (10,000) feet from the primary surface. Its centerline is the continuation of the centerline of the runway. 
(b)  Precision instrument runway approach zone. The inner edge of this approach zone coincides with the width of the primary surface and is one thousand (1,000) feet wide. The approach zone expands outward uniformly to a width of sixteen thousand (16,000) feet at a horizontal distance of fifty thousand (50,000) feet from the primary surface. Its centerline is the continuation of the centerline of the runway. 
(c)  Transitional zones. The transitional zones are the areas beneath the transitional surface. 
(d)  Horizontal zone. The horizontal zone is established by swinging arcs of ten thousand (10,000) feet radii from the center of each end of the primary surface of each runway and connecting the adjacent arcs by drawing lines tangent to those arcs. The horizontal zone does not include the approach and transitional zones. 
(e)  Conical zone. The conical zone is established as the area that commences at the periphery of the horizontal zone and extends outward therefrom a horizontal distance of four thousand (4,000) feet. 
(Ord. No. 9-04, 4-19-04; Ord. No. 67-07, 12-17-07)

Structures and/or trees that exceed the height limitations established for each zone in this article are hereby determined to be airport hazards. Except for the City of Statesville, the property owner of a tree determined to be an airport hazard shall not be responsible for bringing such tree into conformance with this article.

Chapter 8 - CABLE TELEVISION SERVICES 

Sec. 8-1. - Statement of intent and purpose. 
(a)  The City of Statesville, North Carolina, pursuant to applicable federal and state law, is authorized to grant one or more nonexclusive franchises to construct, operate, maintain, and reconstruct cable systems within the incorporated areas of the city. 
(b)  The city council of the City of Statesville finds that cable service has become an integral part of its citizens' lives, and that evolving cable systems have the potential to play an even more dramatic role in the future, providing great benefits and advanced capabilities to the city. At the same time, the council further finds that the public convenience, safety, and general welfare can best be served by establishing regulatory powers that are vested in the city or such persons as the city designates. 
(c)  In order to ensure that the city and its residents receive state-of-the-art cable services and capabilities as this technology further evolves, all franchises granted pursuant to this ordinance will be subject to periodic review to keep current with changing law, technology, and services. It is the intent of this chapter to help ensure that local cable operators provide the best possible cable service to residents of the city, and any franchises issued pursuant to this ordinance shall be deemed to include this finding as an integral part thereof. 
(d)  Further, it is recognized that cable systems have the capacity to provide entertainment and information services to the city's residents, and may have the capacity to provide a variety of broadband, interactive communications services to institutions and individuals. For these purposes, the following goals underlie the regulations contained herein: 
(1)  Cable television services should be made available to all of the city's residents at the lowest reasonable cost. 
(2)  The system should be capable of accommodating both the present and reasonably foreseeable future state-of-the-art cable television needs of the city. 
(3)  The systems authorized by this chapter shall be responsive to the needs and interests of the local community, and shall provide the widest possible diversity of information sources and services to the public. Each of the above-enumerated goals shall be sought to the maximum extent, taking into account the costs and benefits to the residents of the City of Statesville. 
The council further finds that on-going industry consolidation could result in less local accountability, and that, therefore, stringent customer service standards, including liquidated damages provisions, may be the only practical means of ensuring compliance and approximating the costs of franchise agreement noncompliance to the city and its residents.

This authority shall be vested in the City of Statesville City Council and administered through the city manager or his/her designee in order to provide day-to-day administration and enforcement of the provisions of this chapter and any franchise granted hereunder, and to carry out the city's responsibilities with regard to cable service. 
(b)  This chapter shall be construed in a manner consistent with all applicable federal and state laws. 
(c)  In the event that the federal or state government discontinues preemption in any area of cable communications over which it currently exercises jurisdiction in such manner as to expand rather than limit municipal regulatory authority, grantor may, if it so elects, adopt rules and regulations in these areas to the extent permitted by law, provided the same do not materially alter the rights and obligations of a grantee under any existing franchise.

    Grant of additional franchise and competing service [refers to] competing or overlapping franchises may have an adverse impact on the public rights-of-way and on the quality and availability of services to the public. In considering whether to grant one or more additional franchises, the city shall specifically consider, and address in a written report or in provisions of the franchise agreement, the following issues: 
(a)  The positive and/or negative impact of an additional franchise on the community. 
(b)  The ability and willingness of the specific applicant in question to provide cable services to the franchise area.

(d)  The financial capabilities of the applicant and its guaranteed commitment to make the necessary investment to erect, maintain, and operate the proposed cable system for the duration of the franchise term. In order to ensure that any prospective grantee does have the requisite current financial capabilities, the city may request equity and debt financing commitment letters, current audited financial statements, bonds, letters of credit, or other documentation to demonstrate to the city's satisfaction that the requisite funds to construct and operate the proposed system are available. 
(e)  The quality and technical reliability of the proposed system, based upon the applicant's plan of construction and the method of distribution of signals, and the applicant's technical qualifications to construct and operate such system. 
(f)  The experience of the applicant in the erection, maintenance, and operation of a cable system. 
(g)  The capacity of the public rights-of-way to accommodate one or more additional cable systems and the potential disruption of those public rights-of-way and private property that may occur if one or more additional franchises are granted. 
(h)  The likelihood and ability of the applicant to continue to provide competing cable service to subscribers within the franchise area for the duration of the franchise. 
(i)  Such other information as the city may deem appropriate to be considered prior to granting any competing or overlapping franchise. 
(j)  The purpose of this section is to ensure that any competition which may occur among grantees will be on terms which when taken as a whole are nondiscriminatory according to federal law. 
    Permits for nonfranchised entities: 
(a)  The city may issue a license, easement, or other permit to a person other than the grantee to permit that person to traverse any portion of the grantee's franchise area within the city in order to provide service outside, but not within the city. Such license or easement, absent a grant of a franchise in accordance with this chapter, shall not authorize nor permit said person to provide cable service to any subscriber within the city nor render any other service within the city. 
(b)  The granting of such license, easement or permit shall be conditioned upon the payment of fee for occupancy of the public right-of-way to the extent permitted by applicable law. 
    Review for competition [means that] the city recognizes that the cable television and telecommunications industries are in a period of convergence, that the technologies and services provided by these industries are rapidly changing, and that the Telecommunications Act of 1996 promoted and encouraged competition between and among these formally discrete industries. At this time it is premature to know fully the extent to which there will be changes in law, technology or services that may impact entities that have been or may be granted franchises or licenses to use the city's rights-of-way. It is the desire of the city to be a communications friendly city, that encourages the development of competitive advanced communications capabilities for the benefit of all its citizens. For this reason the regulatory ordinances and franchises of the city should not impede or restrict the fair opportunity to compete, but rather are intended to provide uniform and consistent requirements for all similarly situated providers. 
    Application and renewal fees: 
(a)  An application fee shall not be deemed to be "franchise fees" within the meaning of Section 622 of the Cable Act (47 U.S.C. § 542), and such payments shall not be deemed to be: 
1.  Payments in kind or any involuntary payments chargeable against the compensation to be paid to the city by grantee; or 
2.  Part of the compensation to be paid to the city by grantee pursuant to this chapter or a franchise agreement. 
(b)  All applicants for an initial franchise grant shall submit an application fee of two thousand five hundred dollars ($2,500) to compensate the city for its costs in reviewing, preparing and awarding a franchise, including the costs of outside consultants. Upon grant of a franchise the city shall pay a one-time fee to the city in the amount of fifteen thousand dollars ($15,000.00), which sum shall be due and payable concurrently with the grantee's acceptance of the franchise agreement. Consistent with the Cable Act, all such fees shall not constitute or be credited towards a grantee's franchise fee obligation. 
(c)  The city reserves the right, unless prohibited by applicable law, to require a grantee to pay the incidental costs of the franchise renewal and negotiation process. Incidental costs include staff time, professional fees, and administrative costs as stated in the franchise agreement.

Unless the franchise agreement provides otherwise, every grantee shall serve all areas of the city equally with populations of at least fifteen (15) residential dwelling units per cable mile as measured from a grantee's existing distribution system, including areas annexed subsequent to the grant of the franchise. The franchise agreement shall provide a schedule of the areas to be served, and the specific build-out requirements of the grantee, and shall also describe the process for extending service to areas that will meet minimum density requirements at some future date. Unless the franchise agreement provides otherwise, every grantee shall extend service to commercial areas at no additional costs where the costs to do so does not exceed the same costs of providing service in a residential area with a density of fifteen (15) homes per mile. 
(b)  During the initial construction phase of a new system, a grantee may implement its system in stages pursuant to a schedule and line extension policy established in its franchise agreement that serves all areas of the city equally, provided that any deviation from the service and line extension requirements of this chapter do not discriminate between different areas of the city on the basis of race, creed, religion or economic condition. A grantee of any such new franchise shall comply with all customer service obligations with respect to customers whose premises are passed by portions of the grantee's network which are fully activated, tested and available for service. 
(c)  Cost-sharing. Pursuant to section 8-167A of this chapter, and in franchise agreements with a fifteen (15) homes per mile requirement in areas with less than fifteen (15) homes per proposed cable mile, grantee shall offer a cost-sharing arrangement to residents. Grantee shall bear its pro rata share of the current construction costs based upon the actual number of homes per mile. The cost-sharing arrangement shall consist of the following: On the request of a subscriber desiring service, grantee shall prepare, at its cost, an engineering survey and cost analysis to determine the cost of the plant extension required to provide service to the subscriber from the closest usable point on the cable system. 
The cost of construction shall be allocated based on the following formula: If a request for extension into a residential area requires the construction of cable plant which does not pass at least fifteen (15) homes per cable mile, a proportionate share of construction costs shall be borne by grantee and by the subscribers. For example, if there are ten (10) dwelling units per mile, grantee's share will equal ten-fifteenths ( 10/15 ) of the construction cost. The remaining cost will be shared equally by each subscriber in the area to be constructed. The line extension formula shall also be applied to a portion of a cable mile meeting proportionate density requirements. For example, if there are seven (7) dwelling units per one-half mile, the grantee shall construct the plant. The cost sharing described above would be utilized if there were less than the proportionate share of dwelling units per the portion of a mile needed to reach the dwelling units. Should additional subscribers' request cable service, subscribers utilizing the cost-sharing plan for extension shall be reimbursed pro-rata for their contribution or a proportional share thereof. In such case, the pro-rata shares shall be recalculated and each new subscriber shall pay the new pro-rata share, and all prior subscribers shall receive refunds. In any event, at the end of twenty-four (24) months from completion of the project, the subscribers are no longer eligible for refunds, and the amounts paid by subscribers will be credited to the plant account of the grantee. The average cost of the line extension shall be recalculated annually based upon the current costs of labor and material. Each person contributing toward the direct cost of the line extension shall waive all ownership interest in the line extension. All equipment and components of the line extension, including, but not limited to, cable wire, electronics and pedestals shall at all times remain the exclusive property of the grantee. 
(13)  City monitoring. In addition to free cable service required by the ordinance, grantee shall provide one service feed to city administration offices (unless otherwise specified by city) that shall receive without charge all basic and expanded basic cable programming provided by grantee. Such service shall be provided in such a manner that the city may monitor the programming and use of the cable system for compliance with the franchise agreement and this chapter. The services provided pursuant to this requirement shall be in a secure office location, and not in a location open to public viewing. 
(14)  Access to inside wiring. Access to, and ownership of, inside wiring shall be in accordance with Section 76.800, et. seq. of the FCC rules and regulations as the same may be amended from time to time. 
(Ord. of 10-21-02) 
Sec. 8-7. - Construction standards. 
(1)  Right-of-way construction. Prior to commencing any construction in the city, a grantee must obtain all necessary permits and licenses required by federal, state and generally applicable city laws, ordinances and rules, and pay all associated nondiscriminatory fees. Further, a grantee shall comply with all applicable laws, ordinances, rules, and standards relating to the construction, operation and maintenance of a cable system. 
(2)  Compliance with laws. The construction, installation, and maintenance of the cable system shall be effectuated by grantee in a manner that is consistent with the laws, ordinances and construction standards of the State of North Carolina, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, the National Electrical Safety Code, National Electrical Code and the FCC, to the extent applicable, as well as all other laws, rules, regulations and ordinances that are generally applicable and promulgated pursuant to the city's lawful police power. All open connections on splitters, couplers and other devices shall be properly terminated. 
(3)  Minimum interference. All of grantee's construction, installation, operation, repair and maintenance, and the arrangement of its lines, cables and other appurtenances, on public or private property, shall be conducted in such a manner as to not unreasonably interfere with the rights and reasonable convenience of property owners that may be affected. In the event such work is not in accordance with applicable rules and regulations, the city may require the removal, within such period of time after notice as is reasonable under the circumstances, of grantee's lines, cables and appurtenances from the public rights-of-way in question, at the sole expense of the grantee. 
(4)  Repair of property. Grantee shall promptly repair and restore any city or private property which may be damaged as a result of the construction, installation, operation, repair, maintenance or removal of the cable system. Any such property damaged or destroyed shall be promptly repaired and restored by grantee, at grantee's sole cost and expense to the reasonable satisfaction of the city, to its condition prior to being damaged, or shall be replaced by grantee with equivalent property. The city may inspect and approve the condition of the public right-of-ways and cables, wires, attachments, and poles after restoration. The liability, indemnity, insurance and performance bond as provided herein shall continue in full force and effect during the period of any removal and until the grantee has fully complied with the terms and conditions of this chapter and the franchise agreement. In the event of a failure by the grantee to complete any restoration work required by the city within the time as may be established by the city and to the reasonable satisfaction of the city, the city may, following reasonable notice to the grantee, cause such work to be done and the grantee shall reimburse the city the cost thereof within thirty (30) days after receipt of an itemized list of such cost, or the city may at its option recover such costs through the performance bond provided by grantee. The city shall be permitted to seek legal and equitable relief to enforce the provisions of this section. 
(5)  Erection of poles. Grantee shall not erect any pole on or along any public rights-of-way in an existing aerial utility system without the advance written approval of the city. If additional poles in an existing aerial route are required, grantee shall negotiate, as needed, with the owners thereof for the installation of the needed poles. Grantee shall negotiate the lease of pole space and facilities from the existing pole owners for all aerial construction, under mutually acceptable terms and conditions. 
(6)  Reservations of street rights. Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to prevent the city from constructing storm or sanitary sewers, grading, paving, repairing or altering any public rights-of-way, or laying down, repairing or removing water mains, traffic signal control systems, city fiber plant, or constructing or establishing any public utility, service or other public work that the city may operate or undertake now or in the future. All such work shall be done, insofar as practicable, in such manner as not to obstruct, injure or prevent the free use and operation of poles, wires, conduits, conductors, pipes or appurtenances of grantee. If city in its reasonable judgment shall determine that grantee's facilities interfere with the construction location or repair of any public right-of-way or public improvement, then all such facilities of grantee shall be removed or replaced, or temporarily disconnected, in such manner as shall be directed by the city so that the same shall not interfere with the public works of the city. Such removal or replacement shall be at the expense of grantee; provided, however, that nothing in this chapter shall preclude grantee from seeking reimbursement for removal or replacement costs from any public funds generally available to rights-of-way users for the reimbursement of such costs. 
(7)  Underground installation. In those areas within the city where cable television, telephone, or electrical facilities are currently placed underground, all cable system facilities shall remain or be placed underground. In areas where either telephone or electric utility facilities are above ground at the time of installation, grantee may install its cable system facilities above ground, provided that at such time as both electric and telephone utility facilities are placed underground, grantee shall likewise place its cable system facilities underground without cost to the city. Nothing contained in this section shall require a grantee to construct, operate and maintain underground any ground-mounted appurtenances, except that grantee shall take steps to minimize the number and visual impact of such facilities. If the grantor reimburses any utility for such relocation, grantee shall be similarly reimbursed. This section shall not prevent the city or any of its agencies or joint agencies from requiring the installation or relocation of cable services facilities underground pursuant to a separate ordinance or regulation or requirement imposed in accordance with the exercise of the general police power or regulatory function of such agency or joint agency. 
(8)  Conduit. 
(a)  The city shall not be responsible for any cuts or damage to buried or underground facilities of a grantee that are not clearly marked or cannot be located through the North Carolina "one-call" service. 
(b)  Grantee shall provide the city detailed strand and trench maps in both paper and a mutually agreed upon electronic format of all new underground and buried cable facilities upon activation of such sections of the system. 
(c)  Grantee shall provide a contact number for the city to call in emergency situations requiring an immediate response on the part of the city. If the grantee does not properly and effectively identify the precise location of its facilities within forty-five (45) minutes of an emergency call from the city, the city shall not be responsible for damage to the grantee's facilities. 
(9)  Clearing poles and cables. Grantee shall have the right to remove, trim, cut and to keep clear of its poles, cables, underground conduits and related equipment the trees, shrubs and woody plants in and along the public rights-of-way, but, in the exercise of such right, grantee shall not cut such trees, shrubs and woody plants to any greater extent that is reasonably necessary for the construction, erection, installation, maintenance and use of cable system equipment. Except in emergency situations, all tree, shrub and woody plant pruning shall be carried out under the supervision of the city arborist and shall be governed in accordance with pruning guidelines of the American National Standard Institute and National Electric Code. The grantee shall compensate the city or any private owners of such trees, shrubs and woody plants for any damage caused by grantee's negligent conduct. 
(10)  Moving facilities. Grantee, on the request of the city, or any person holding a building permit issued by the city, or any permit issued by an appropriate state agency, shall temporarily move its wires, cables, poles or other cable system facilities to permit the moving of large objects, vehicles, buildings or other structures. The expense of such temporary moves shall be paid to grantee by the person requesting the same and grantee shall have the authority to require such payment in advance. Grantee shall be given not less than thirty (30) days advance notice to arrange for such temporary moves. 
(11)  Work performed by others. To the extent applicable, all provisions of this chapter shall apply to any subcontractors or others performing any work or services pursuant to the provisions of a franchise agreement on behalf of a grantee. 
(12)  [Liability.] Nothing contained in this chapter shall relieve any person from liability arising out of the failure to exercise reasonable care to avoid injuring grantee's facilities while performing any work connected with grading, regrading or changing the line of any public rights-of-way or with the construction of any sewer or water system or utility system. 
(Ord. of 10-21-02) 
Sec. 8-8. - General financial and insurance provisions. 
(1)  Franchise fee. 
(a)  The administration of this chapter or the franchise agreement imposes upon the city additional regulatory responsibility and expense and in consideration for permission to use the public rights-of-way of the city for the construction, operation and maintenance, of a cable system within the city, a grantee of any franchise hereunder shall pay to the city a franchise fee in an amount as designated in the franchise agreement, up to the maximum amount allowed by applicable law. To the extent that applicable law changes the maximum authorized franchise fee, the city reserves the right to change the franchise fee as stated in the franchise agreement, by adopting an ordinance establishing the new franchise fee rate and allowing reasonable notice to the grantee for administration of the change. The city shall hold a public hearing prior to adopting any change in the franchise fee. 
(b)  Payments due grantor under this section shall be computed quarterly, for the preceding quarter. Each quarterly payment shall be due and payable no later than forty-five (45) days after the end of the preceding quarter. Each payment shall be accompanied by a brief report by a grantee showing the basis for the computation and a "franchise fee worksheet" listing all of the sources of revenues attributable to the operation of grantee's system in the city. All such payments shall be certified as correct by an officer of the grantee. 
(c)  No acceptance of any payment shall be construed as an accord that the amount paid is in fact the correct amount, nor shall such acceptance of payment be construed as a release of any claim grantor may have for further sums payable under the provisions of this chapter or a franchise agreement. All amounts paid shall be subject to audit and recomputation by grantor or its designee at any time during any calendar year (but not more than once per calendar year) upon twenty (20) calendar days notice, which shall include a request for any documents sought to be reviewed. Audits shall be at the expense of the grantee if the additional amount due is greater than two (2) percent of the amount paid. Any additional amount due to the city as a result of the audit shall be paid within sixty (60) days following written notice to the grantee by the city which notice shall include a copy of the audit report. Grantor's right to audit and grantee's obligation to retain records related to the franchise fee audit, shall expire three (3) years from the date on which the most recent franchise fee payment by the grantee was due from the time of written notice. 
(d)  In the event that any franchise payment or recomputed amount is not made on or before the dates specified herein, grantee shall pay as additional compensation an interest charge, computed from such due date, at the annual rate equal to the commercial prime interest rate of the city's primary depository bank during the period that such unpaid amount is owed. 
(2)  Performance bond. Each grantee shall maintain a performance bond with the city to ensure compliance with this chapter and the applicable franchise agreement, in an amount and in a manner as set forth in the grantee's franchise agreement. 
(3)  Penalties procedure. 
(a)  Whenever grantor has reason to believe that a grantee has violated any material provision of a franchise agreement or this chapter, grantor shall first notify the grantee of the material violation and demand correction within a reasonable time, which shall not be less than twenty (20) days in the case of the failure of a grantee to pay any sum or other amount due the grantor under a franchise agreement, and thirty (30) days in all other cases. If a grantee fails to correct the violation within the time prescribed, or if a grantee is unable to correct the violation and fails to commence corrective action within the time prescribed and to diligently remedy such violation thereafter, the grantee shall then be given written notice of not less than twenty (20) days for public comment. Said notice shall indicate with reasonable specificity the violation alleged to have occurred. 
(b)  At the public hearing, the council shall hear and consider all relevant evidence and thereafter render findings and a decision based upon the evidence. Any such hearing must, at a minimum, provide the grantee a full and fair opportunity to be heard by the council. 
(c)  In the event the council finds that a grantee has corrected the violation or promptly commenced correction of such violation after notice thereof from grantor and is diligently proceeding to fully remedy the violation, or that no violation has occurred, the proceedings shall terminate and no penalty or other sanction shall be imposed. 
(d)  In the event the council finds that a violation exists and that a grantee has not corrected the same in a satisfactory manner or did not promptly commence and diligently proceed to correct the violation, the council may impose liquidated damages to be collected from the performance bond, as set out in the franchise agreement. 
(e)  If the council elects to assess liquidated damages, then such election shall constitute grantor's exclusive remedy for a period of sixty (60) days. Thereafter, if a grantee remains in noncompliance, the grantor may pursue any other available remedy. 
(f)  In the event that a franchise is cancelled or terminated by reason of the default of a grantee, the performance bond deposited pursuant to a franchise agreement shall remain in effect and available to the grantor until all pending claims or penalties are resolved or settled, after which point any remaining amounts in the performance bond shall revert to the grantee. 
(g)  The rights reserved to grantor with respect to the security fund are in addition to all other rights of grantor, whether reserved by a franchise agreement, this chapter, or authorized by law, and no action, proceeding, or exercise of a right with respect to such performance bond shall affect any other right grantor may have. 
(h)  In instances of repeated violations, whether remedied or not, the grantor shall serve special notice outlining additional remediation requirements. Failure to cure, as measured by repeated instances of the same violation, is evidence of an evasive practice and may lead to revocation under section 8-186. 
(i)  Grantee acknowledges that noncompliance with the provisions of the franchise agreement and the master ordinance will harm subscribers and the city and the amounts of actual damages will be difficult or impossible to ascertain. The city may therefore assess the following liquidated damages against grantee for unexcused noncompliance with the requirements of the franchise agreement and master ordinance. Grantee acknowledges that the liquidated damages set forth below are a reasonable approximation of actual damages and that this provision is intended to provide compensation and is not a penalty. All damages provided shall be cumulative, unless expressly stated. 
1.  For failure to materially complete construction or extend service in accordance with the ordinance and the franchise agreement: two hundred fifty dollars ($250.00) per calendar day for each day the violation continues; 
2.  For failure to materially comply with requirements for access channels: two hundred fifty dollars ($250.00) per calendar day for each day the violation continues; 
3.  For failure to comply with the material requirements of the I-Net provisions of the ordinance/franchise agreement: two hundred fifty dollars ($250.00) per calendar day for each day the violation continues; 
4.  For repeated, willful or continuing failure to submit reports, maintain records, provide documents or information: two hundred fifty dollars ($250.00) per calendar day for each day the violation continues; 
5.  For failure to comply with the material requirements of the customer service standards: two hundred fifty dollars ($250.00) per calendar day for each day the violation continues; 
6.  For failure to comply with the transfer provisions: two hundred fifty dollars ($250.00) per calendar day for each day the violation continues; 
7.  For violation of other material provisions of the ordinance and the franchise agreement: up to two hundred fifty dollars ($250.00) per day for each day the violation continues. 
(j)  For the purposes of calculating the amount of liquidated damages, time periods shall be tolled for such time as grantee is found to be diligently working to remedy such violation. 
(4)  Bonds, indemnification, and insurance. Each grantee shall maintain bonds and insurance with the city in amounts and in a manner as set forth in the grantee's franchise agreement. Each grantee also shall be required to indemnify the city in a manner as set forth in the grantee's franchise agreement. 
(Ord. of 10-21-02) 
Sec. 8-9. - Revocation. 
(1)  Grounds for revocation. Grantor reserves the right to revoke the franchise, and all rights and privileges pertaining thereto, in the event that: 
(a)  A grantee substantially violates any material provision of this chapter or a franchise agreement; 
(b)  A grantee attempts to evade any of the material provisions of this chapter or a franchise agreement; 
(c)  A grantee practices an act of fraud or deceit upon the grantor; 
(d)  A grantee becomes insolvent, unable or unwilling to pay its debts, or is adjudged bankrupt;

(2)  Procedure. 
(a)  Whenever grantor has reason to believe that there may be grounds for revocation of a franchise, grantor shall first notify the grantee in writing of its basis for believing grounds for revocation exist. Such notice shall indicate with reasonable specificity the grounds for revocation that are believed to exist so that the grantee may have a reasonable opportunity to cure or otherwise address the same. If a grantee fails to adequately cure or address the purported grounds for revocation within thirty (30) days of such notice, then the grantor may, upon thirty (30) days written notice to the grantee, commence a public administrative hearing to determine whether there exists any ground for revocation. 
(b)  The administrative hearing shall be conducted so as to protect the full due process rights of the parties and provide for, at a minimum, the right to have counsel, the right to call and cross examine witnesses, and the right to a full transcript of the proceedings. 
(c)  After the close of the hearing, grantor or the designated hearing officer shall issue a written decision based on the record of the proceedings, stating with specificity the findings and reasons supporting the decision. 
(d)  Upon revocation, a grantee shall have a period of one hundred and twenty (120) days subsequent to the date of the formal adoption of a revocation of the franchise by the city within which to file an appeal with a court of competent jurisdiction.

(Ord. of 10-21-02) 
Sec. 8-10. - Foreclosure, receivership and abandonment. 
(1)  Foreclosure. Upon the foreclosure or other judicial sale of all or a part of a system, a grantee shall notify grantor of such fact and such notification shall be treated as a notification that a change in control of the grantee has taken place, and the provisions of this chapter governing the consent to transfer or change in ownership shall apply without regard to how such transfer or change in ownership occurred. 
(2)  Receivership. Apart from and supplemental to the right to revoke a franchise, grantor shall have the right to cancel a franchise agreement one hundred twenty (120) days after the appointment of a receiver or trustee to take over and conduct the business of a grantee, whether in receivership, reorganization, bankruptcy, or other action or proceeding, unless such receivership or trusteeship shall have been vacated prior to the expiration of said one hundred twenty (120) days, or unless: 
(a)  Within one hundred twenty (120) days after its election or appointment, the receiver or trustee has fully complied with all the provisions of grantee's franchise agreement and this chapter and remedied all defaults thereunder; and 
(b)  Such receiver or trustee, within said one hundred twenty (120) days, has executed an agreement, duly approved by a court having jurisdiction, whereby such receiver or trustee assumes and agrees to be bound by each and every provision of this chapter and the applicable franchise agreement. 
(Ord. of 10-21-02) 
Sec. 8-11. - Purchase of system. 
(1)  Purchase by grantor upon termination of franchise term or revocation of franchise. The grantor may, in accordance with and to the extent permitted by 47 U.S.C. § 547, upon the payment of a fair valuation, purchase, condemn, acquire, take over, and hold the property and plant of a grantee, in whole or in part, on the following conditions: 
(a)  Upon revocation of a franchise, a fair valuation shall be an equitable value that shall not include any sum attributable to the value of the franchise itself, and plant and property shall be valued according to its book value at the time of revocation, or the system's initial cost less depreciation and salvage. 
(b)  At the expiration of a franchise agreement and following a denial of renewal of the franchise agreement, a fair valuation shall be the fair market value of the plant and property, exclusive of the value attributed to the franchise itself. 
(c)  In the event grantor shall acquire a franchise pursuant to the provisions of this chapter or a franchise agreement, and commence operation of the system, grantor shall reimburse the grantee for the fair market value of the system. 
(Ord. of 10-21-02) 
Sec. 8-12. - Sale or transfer. 
(1)  Sale or transfer of franchise. 
(a)  No grantee shall sell, transfer, lease, assign, sublet, or dispose of, in whole or in part, an interest in or control of a franchise or cable system or any of the rights or privileges granted by a franchise agreement, without the prior consent of the grantor, which consent shall not be unreasonably denied or delayed and may be denied only upon a good faith finding by the grantor that the proposed transferee lacks the legal, technical, or financial qualifications to consummate the transaction and operate the system so as to perform its obligations under this chapter and the applicable franchise agreement. This section shall not apply to sales of property or equipment in the normal course of business. Consent from the grantor shall not be required for a transfer in trust, mortgage, or other instrument of hypothecation, in whole or in part, to secure an indebtedness, or for a transfer to a corporation, partnership, or other entity controlling, controlled by, or under common control with a grantee. 
(b)  The following additional events shall be deemed to be a sale, assignment, or other transfer of an interest in or control of a grantee or its franchise or cable system requiring compliance with this section: 
(1)  The sale, assignment, or other transfer of all or a majority of a grantee's assets; 
(2)  The sale, assignment, or other transfer of capital stock or partnership, membership, or other equity interests in a grantee by one or more of its existing shareholders, partners, members, or other equity owners so as to create a new controlling interest in a grantee; 
(3)  The issuance of additional capital stock or partnership, membership or other equity interest by a grantee so as to create a new controlling interest in a grantee; and 
(4)  A grantee's agreement to transfer management or operation of the grantee or the system. The term "controlling interest" as used herein is not limited to major stockholders but includes actual working control in whatever manner exercised. 
(c)  In the case of any sale or transfer of ownership of an interest in or control of a grantee or its franchise or cable system, the city shall have one hundred twenty (120) days to act upon any request for approval of such sale or transfer that contains or is accompanied by such information as is required in accordance with FCC Regulations and the requirements of this chapter and the applicable franchise agreement, including information related to the legal, technical and financial qualifications, and the proposed transferee's ability to operate the system in accord with this chapter and the franchise agreement. Failure to provide all information reasonably requested by the city as part of its review may be grounds for a denial of the proposed transfer. If the city fails to render a final decision on the request within one hundred twenty (120) days after receipt by the city of all required information, such request shall be deemed granted unless the grantee and the city agree to an extension of the one hundred twenty-day period. 
(d)  The consent or approval of the city to any transfer of the grantee shall not constitute a waiver or release of the rights of the city in and to the public rights-of-way, and any transfer shall, by its terms, be expressly subject to the terms and conditions of this chapter and the franchise agreement. 
(e)  In the absence of extraordinary circumstances, the city will not approve any transfer or assignment of the franchise prior to completion of construction of the proposed initial system. 
(f)  Any approval by the city of a transfer shall be contingent upon the prospective new grantee becoming a signatory to the franchise agreement. 
(Ord. of 10-21-02) 
Sec. 8-13. - Rights of individuals protected. 
(1)  Discriminatory practices prohibited. No grantee shall deny service, deny access, or otherwise discriminate against subscribers, programmers, or general citizens on the basis of race, color, religion, national origin, sex, disability, or age. Every grantee shall strictly adhere to the equal employment opportunity requirements of state and federal law. Each grantee shall comply at all times with all other applicable federal, state, and local laws, and all executive and administrative orders relating to nondiscrimination. 
(2)  Subscriber privacy. Grantees shall at all times comply with the federal subscriber privacy requirements codified at 47 U.S.C. § 551. 
(Ord. of 10-21-02) 
Sec. 8-14. - Miscellaneous provisions. 
(1)  Rate regulation. The city reserves the right to regulate rates for all services offered over the cable system, to the extent permitted by federal or state law. Grantee shall be subject to the rate regulation provisions provided for herein, and those of the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) at 47 C.F.R., Part 76.900, Subpart N. The city shall follow the rules relating to cable rate regulation promulgated by the FCC at 47 C.F.R., Part 76.900, Subpart N. To the extent required by applicable federal or state law, grantee shall establish rates that are nondiscriminatory within the same general class of subscribers and which must be applied fairly and uniformly to all subscribers in the franchise area for all services. Nothing contained herein shall prohibit the grantee from offering: 
(1)  Discounts to commercial and multiple family dwelling subscribers billed on a bulk basis; 
(2)  Promotional discounts; 
(3)  Reduced installation rates for subscribers who have multiple services; 
(4)  Discounts for senior citizens and/or low income residents; or 
(5)  Reduced rates to subscribers who receive noncable services in addition to cable services. 
(2)  Rights reserved to grantor. 
(a)  Upon either the expiration or revocation of a franchise, grantor may permit and/or require a grantee to continue to operate the cable system for an extended period of time not to exceed three (3) months from the date of such expiration or revocation. A grantee shall continue to operate the system under the terms and conditions of this chapter and the applicable franchise agreement and to provide cable service and any and all other services which grantee had been providing. 
(b)  The grantor shall have the right to compel continued operation of the cable system whether by the grantee or a trustee or receiver or by the grantor, and to ensure that such operation is consistent with public interest as determined by a court of competent jurisdiction. The grantee may not remove equipment or documents necessary for continued operation of the system. 
(c)  At all reasonable times, grantee shall permit examination by the city of the system, together with any appurtenant property of grantee situated within or without the city when necessary to ascertain the grantee's compliance with this chapter, the franchise agreement, and all applicable laws. 
(d)  The city shall have the right of intervention in any suit or proceeding to which the grantee is a party relative to grantee's operations in the city, and the grantee shall not oppose such intervention by the city. 
(e)  Except as otherwise provided by applicable law, the grantee shall have no recourse whatsoever against the city or its officials, councils, commissions, agents, or employees for any loss, cost, expense, or damage arising out of any provision or requirements of this chapter or the franchise agreement, or of their enforcement. 
(3)  Nonenforcement by the city. Grantee shall not be relieved of its obligation to comply with any of the provisions of this chapter or the franchise agreement by reason of any failure of the city to enforce prompt compliance. 
(4)  Governing law and choice of forum. Any dispute arising with respect to this chapter or a franchise agreement granted pursuant to it, shall be subject to review by the state and federal courts having primary jurisdiction in the City of Statesville, North Carolina. 
(5)  Severability. If any material portion of this chapter, or a franchise agreement adopted pursuant to it, is held by an authority of competent jurisdiction, to be invalid or unlawful as conflicting with applicable laws now or hereafter in effect, or is held by a court or competent governmental authority to be modified in any way in order to conform to the requirements of any such applicable laws, such provision shall be considered a separate, distinct, and independent part of this chapter or franchise agreement, and, to the extent possible, such holding shall not affect the validity and enforceability of all other provisions thereof. 
(6)  Publication of notices. All public notices required to be published by grantor under this chapter or any franchise agreement shall be published in a manner consistent with the public notice laws of the State of North Carolina. 
(7)  System construction capabilities and schedule. 
(a)  The cable system shall generally conform to the system design and channel capacity specifications set forth by the grantee in its application for a franchise submitted to the city. At a minimum, the grantee shall construct a system with equivalent technical capabilities to a hybrid fiber coax [HFC] 750 MHz cable system. The grantee is permitted to modify its design and implementation plan, pursuant to the conditions provided herein, to accommodate technological innovations and refinements that enhance system reliability and capacity. 
(b)  The initial construction required under initial franchise agreement shall be completed in compliance with a schedule specified therein. If the grantee shows that, notwithstanding its due diligence, that it has been unable to extend service to a specified area because the acts or omissions of a third party (excluding the grantee's subcontractors or agents) or other factors have caused a delay in construction beyond that reasonably expected during the course of construction, and the grantee proposes a reasonable alternative deadline for extension of service to that area, the city shall grant reasonable extensions of time to complete construction.

HISTORICAL DATA 
ARTICLE I. - GROWTH AND DEVELOPMENT 
    The Town of Statesville was created by legislative enactment in a bill which passed its final reading in the North Carolina General Assembly, December 19, 1789, just about a month after the constitutional convention voted to take North Carolina into the newly formed United States. It was created as a county seat for Iredell County, formed from western Rowan County the year before. 
    The site, selected by a committee named for the purpose in the bill creating the county in 1788, was approximately at the center of Iredell, on land adjoining the Fourth Creek Presbyterian Church. In the bill which created the town, the site selection committee was named as a governing body of commissioners "for building and carrying on the said town" on fifty (50) acres of land bought from Fergus Sloan. 
    The name of Statesville was included in the original bill, but why that name was chosen can only be guessed. Nearly a century later, as the centennial celebration was approaching, three (3) guesses were made, but none of them was confirmed. One (1) guess was that it lay near the center of the State before the western portion was ceded to the Federal Government to form Tennessee. Another was that it lay near a State road that passed somewhere nearby. A third guess was that, since the name was actually picked during the year 1789, when North Carolina had refused to join the United States and was, along with Rhode Island, a free and independent State, the name of Statesville has something of a states' rights meaning. 
    A hastily built log courthouse, erected on a knoll above Fourth Creek Church, was opened in time for the June Session of the County Court in 1790, and in August lots were sold on Broad and Center Streets, with the courthouse at their intersection, and on Meeting, Front and Tradd Streets. 
    The village around the courthouse grew slowly, with a population of only two hundred fifteen (215) in 1850, some fifty (50) years after its founding. There was progress of a kind, however. Roads were shifted to pass the county seat, and it became a stopping place for stagecoaches, with a few taverns to take care of the travelers. In 1801 the first post office was established. In 1816 a school for boys was established and flourished for a while, and in the late 1820's a school for girls was begun. In 1820 a new brick courthouse on the square took the place of the old log one. 
    The Legislature of 1800 passed a law for continuing a town government by the election of three (3) commissioners every three (3) years, commissioners who had the power to make rules and regulations and levy taxes. Occasional references are found to such commissioners during the next half century, but their records have been lost. 
    In 1847 the form of government was changed, and the town was incorporated. Provision was made for a town magistrate and four (4) commissioners to be elected every two (2) years. Arthur M. Walker was appointed town magistrate, and with him a council of commissioners heavily laden with innkeepers. When records began to make their actions clear in 1855, the makeup of the council had changed but little from those appointed in the original incorporation. 
    The first ten (10) years of the new form of government were years of crisis for the village. An almost successful attempt was made in 1852 to divide the county in the center, with two (2) new county seats, thus dealing a death blow to Statesville by making it unnecessary. Late in 1854 the two (2) blocks to the west of the square and the courthouse were burned to the ground. The county records were saved, but those of the town were likely burned, since extant proceedings of the commissioners began with the following May. A violent windstorm then damaged the college which was built at the end of West Broad Street as a school for girls. 
    Finally the village aroused itself from such disasters, staved off the county division, completed the college building and built a new courthouse at the present site and other brick buildings to take the place of those burned. More important, the leaders saw to it that the Western North Carolina Railroad from Salisbury came by the town, reaching Statesville October 1, 1858. Another railroad, began as the Atlantic, Tennessee and Ohio from Charlotte in 1859, was completed early during the Civil War and then rebuilt during Reconstruction days. 
    As the railroads reached the town, the complexion of the government began to change. Chief magistrates Otho Gillispie and Robert Simonton, who followed Walker, were still tavern keepers, but their main interest was in railroads. A change in the charter was necessary to allow Statesville to vote bonds for finishing the railroad from Charlotte. The change was made in 1861, and the bonds were voted, giving the town its first bonded debt, a debt that was to plague it until the turn of the century. 
    The junction of the two (2) railroads changed the courthouse village into a trading center for several counties. It became a port of entry for that section of North Carolina all the way to the Tennessee and Virginia border and established an economic and political overlordship in that territory. Its lawyers became the representatives to Congress, and its merchants exchanged goods shipped in for all kind of produce, especially for cotton, tobacco, herbs and liquor. In the 1880's tobacco manufacturing was tried, and the growing town boasted it was the wholesale liquor capital of the world. 
    After the Civil War, Col. S. A. Sharpe was elected town magistrate, but soon his title was changed to mayor, with no other evident change in the form of city government until 1885. Then the town was divided in four (4) wards by the intersection of Broad and Center Streets, and two (2) aldermen were elected from each ward, with a mayor elected independently by the whole town. Usually the aldermen were from the merchant group and represented their viewpoint. 
    In the late 1880's, as the railroads began to move closer to the mountains, to Taylorsville and North Wilkesboro, the Statesville merchants began to make a conscious attempt to make up for the loss of their trading territory by turning to industry. In the early 1890's they built a cotton mill and, after 1900, two (2) more. By 1900 they were preaching diversification of industry and had established roller mills and furniture factories, while some heavy metal industry was growing up. 
    The growing city, with a population of more than two thousand (2,000) in 1890 and three thousand (3,000) in 1900, voted bonds to build an electric power station just before 1890 and then voted taxes for a graded school just after 1890. Before 1900 a third bond issue had been voted to build a water and sewer system. In 1907, soon after the first hydroelectric power dams were built along the Catawba River, the city council signed a contract with the Southern Power Company for electric power, thus giving industry another boost and providing a source of income for the government. 
    In the meantime the wholesale liquor industry was destroyed by a vote for local option prohibition in 1903, and Winston-Salem and Durham were forging ahead in the tobacco industry so much that Statesville was forced to drop out of competition. As the herb business gradually died out, the trading Statesville of the last half of the nineteenth century disappeared and a city of diversified industry took its place. 
    Even before the Civil War the corporation limits had been enlarged, and since then they have been extended time after time. The original fifty (50) acres has been extended to cover 5,910.27 acres, as of July 1, 1959. Since 1900, each census has shown a growth in population with the city passing the ten thousand (10,000) mark by 1930 and reaching nearly seventeen thousand (17,000) by the census of 1950. 
    In the late 1920's there began a change in civic policy in connection with industry. The early industries were the work of local men, often the merchants, and they furnished the capital. Some foreign capital was brought in, but it was at a minimum. The 1920's, though, began to see a conscious effort to attract outside capital and to get outside industry to move to Statesville. Most important before World War II was the establishment of the Carnation Company in 1938, important because it did so much to change the economy of Iredell County from row crops to dairying. Since World War II the policy of attracting outside industry has become more intense, and the tendency toward diversification of industry, so evident about 1900, has become the keynote of the new policy. 
    In organization the city government did not make much change from 1885 until after the Legislature of 1947, but its compositions reflected the change from trading to industry and then to the bringing in of outside industry. Voting for aldermen was changed from a ward basis to a citywide basis, and staggered terms for the eight (8) aldermen, with half of them elected every two (2) years, was tried. 
    In 1947 a civil service commission was set up, a recreation commission created and a zoning ordinance adopted. At the same time, provision was made for an election in 1948 for the approval of a city manager form of government and the reduction of the number of aldermen from two (2) in a ward to one (1) in each ward. Both amendments carried, and in 1949, C. L. Lineback was appointed first city manager. In 1949, too, a city court, with I. T. Avery as judge, was set up to take the magisterial duties off the mayor. In 1953 the board of aldermen was again increased by increasing the number of wards from four (4) to six (6) with the election of one (1) alderman from each ward. 
    On May 29, 1959, the General Assembly ratified a bill amending the city charter in various respects. The board of aldermen was amended to read city council and the number of wards remained the same, with the election of one (1) councilman from each ward by the qualified voters of the entire city. The mayor continues to be elected at large and by the qualified voters of the entire city. 
    The city acknowledges with grateful appreciation the preparation of this historical information by Mr. Homer Keever.

Sec. 14-95. - Purpose. 
    The purpose of this article is to establish regulations governing burglary, robbery and fire alarm systems and to reduce the number of false alarms in the city, and the resulting waste of Statesville police and fire department's resources. 
(Ord. No. 46-94, 10-3-94) 
Sec. 14-96. - Definitions. 
(a)  Alarm system means any electronic or mechanical device which emits any signal (electronic, visible, audible, silent, recorded or otherwise) which is designed, intended, or used to detect an unauthorized entry into a building, structure, or premises, or to signal an attempted robbery or holdup, or to alert others of the commission of an unlawful act, or to detect presence of fire or smoke in or around a building, structure or premises. 
(b)  Chief means the chief of police/fire of the Statesville police/fire department or their designee. 
(c)  False alarms means the activation of an alarm system through mechanical or electronic failure, malfunction, improper installation, or the negligence of the subscriber, his/her or their employees, or agents. A false alarm shall not include an alarm which can reasonably be determined to have been activated by adverse weather conditions, a failure in the electrical power to the alarm or other condition beyond the control of the alarm user. An alarm is false within the meaning of this ordinance when, upon inspection by the Statesville police/fire department, evidence indicates that no unauthorized entry, robbery, or other such crime was committed or attempted in or on the premises which would have activated a property functioning alarm system. False fire alarms would be without evidence of fire, smoke or other emergencies that require the response of fire units or personnel. 
(d)  Alarm user means any person, corporation, partnership, governmental or educational entity owning or leasing an alarm system which is maintained for the protection of such premises. 
(Ord. No. 46-94, 10-3-94) 
Sec. 14-97. - False alarms. 
(a)  Second false alarms. If, within any sixty-day period, the Statesville police/fire departments respond to two (2) false alarms at the same premises or location, the chief of police/fire may send a letter to the alarm user informing him of the false alarms and encouraging the prevention of future false alarms. If a third or subsequent false alarm occurs within a sixty-day period a chargeable false alarm violation exists. 
(b)  Third, and subsequent alarms. If, within any sixty-day period, the Statesville police/fire department is dispatched and arrives upon the premises or location of a third or subsequent false alarm, without having the call cancelled before arrival, the alarm user at this premises or location shall reimburse the city. The reimbursement for any such incident shall be fifty dollars ($50.00) for all such responses after the two (2) initial responses. 
    The alarm user will continue to be in violation for each subsequent false alarm activation until sixty (60) sequential days have elapsed without a false alarm. The alarm user is then entitled to begin a new sixty-day period for false alarms as spelled out in section 14-97(a). 
(c)  Maintenance. Each alarm user in the city, on the effective date of this article, shall furnish and maintain to the Statesville police/fire departments or to an alarm answering service, a current list of the person(s) name(s), address(s) and telephone number(s) who may be able to deactivate the alarm system. After the effective date of this article, it shall be unlawful to actuate an alarm system without first notifying the Statesville police/fire department or an alarm answering service of the name(s) and telephone number(s) of person(s) authorized and able to deactivate the alarm system. Failure to comply with [this] subsection (c) above will result in a fifty dollar ($50.00) civil penalty for each alarm incident. 
(d)  Audible alarms to discontinue emitting alarms after set time. On or after October 4, 1994, it shall be unlawful for any person to install or maintain any audible alarm which does not automatically discontinue emitting an audible sound within thirty (30) minutes after activation. Failure to comply with this subsection will result in a fifty dollar ($50.00) civil penalty. 
(e)  Audible alarms to discontinue emitting alarm after set time.

Failure to comply with this subsection will result in a twenty-five dollar ($25.00) civil penalty. 
(f)  Continuing alarm. An alarm user or their representative shall reset an alarm system when notified by the Statesville police/fire department that such alarm has activated. When an alarm sounds continuously for a period of thirty (30) minutes from the time units respond to the alarm, due to the failure of the alarm user or their representative to reset the alarm, every subsequent thirty-minute period or portion thereof that such alarm continues to sound shall be considered a separate false alarm. The alarm user shall reimburse the city for police/fire services for false alarms under this subsection at a flat rate of ten dollars ($10.00) for each false alarm resulting from the continuous operation of an alarm, not to exceed one hundred dollars ($100.00) for any twenty-four-hour period. 
(Ord. No. 46-94, 10-3-94; Ord. No. 41-96, 7-15-96; Ord. No. 24-02, 6-27-02) 
Sec. 14-98. - Authority to waive reimbursement. 
    The chief of police/fire shall have the power to waive any fee charged to an alarm user when such alarm user submits in writing to the chief of police/fire evidence that the false alarm was not the result of negligence, and that it occurred in spite of a prior test period of at least thirty (30) days for reasonable training and maintenance, or when such alarm user submits evidence to the chief of police/fire which indicates that an alarm to which any city unit responded was not a false alarm. 
(Ord. No. 46-94, 10-3-94) 
Sec. 14-99. - Punishment.

The notice of violation shall also inform the violator of the violator's appeal rights. If the violation is in the nature of an offense for which an order of abatement would be appropriate in a civil proceeding, a reasonable period of time must be states within which the violation must be abated.

The decision of the city council or other hearing officer is subject to review in the Superior Court of Iredell County in the nature of certiorari.

(4)  Upon failure of the violator to comply with the notice of violation within ten (10) days of service of the notice of violation, a civil citation shall be issued by the appropriate official of the city and served on the violator or his agent, either in person or by first class United States mail, postage prepaid and addressed to the last known address of the violator as contained in the records of the city or obtained from the violator or his or her agent. The appropriate city official serving the civil citation shall sign and have notarized an affidavit describing the type of service and the date of the service. The violator shall be deemed to have been served upon the mailing or personal service of the civil citation. 
(5)  The civil citation shall direct the violator to immediately cease the violation, shall inform the violator of the civil penalty, and shall direct the violator to make payment of the civil penalty to the city within ten (10) days of the date of the civil citation, or alternatively to pay the citation by mail postmarked within ten (10) days of service of the civil citation. Once a notice of violation has been issued and the ten-day warning period has expired, civil citations may be issued for each day the same or similar violation continues until the prohibited activity is ceased or abated. 
(6)  If the violator fails to respond to a civil citation within ten (10) days of its service and pay the penalty prescribed therein, the city may institute a civil action in the nature of debt in the appropriate division of the North Carolina General Court of Justice for the collection of the penalty, costs, attorney fees and such other relief as permitted by law.

Sec. 23-31. - Pole attachment. 
(1)  Purpose and scope. The City of Statesville finds that it would be in its best interest to regulate the use of poles by entities providing cable television, telephone, or similar services within the area they serve. The purpose of this section is to provide for the safe and orderly attachment of cables, wires, and associated apparatus to the poles of the City of Statesville. 
(2)  Short title. This Ordinance shall be known and may be cited as "The Pole Attachment Ordinance of the City of Statesville, State of North Carolina." 
(3)  Definitions. 
Grantee means any entity, including without limitation, the natural person(s), partnership(s), domestic and foreign corporation(s), association(s), joint venture(s), or organization(s) of any kind which has been legally granted a cable television franchise by the city, or which provides telephone or similar services in the city or its immediate vicinity, and including all successors, transferees, and assignees of such entities. 
Grantor means the City of Statesville as represented by the city council acting within the scope of its jurisdiction. 
City means the City of Statesville, North Carolina, a political subdivision of the State of North Carolina. 
(4)  Permit required. 
(a)  The city recognizes that certain cables, wires, and apparatus have been attached to its poles without the issuance of a permit prior to the enactment and effective date of this section, either pursuant to a franchise agreement for cable television service or pursuant to the provision of telephone service in the area. No applications shall be required of municipal franchisees for such existing construction, but all construction shall nevertheless be required to adhere to the standards of this section. All individuals who have made connections to the city's power poles without permission or intend to attach to the city's power poles shall apply in writing to the electric utility director for a permit. The city shall charge two hundred dollars ($200.00) for such permit. 
(b)  From and after the effective date of this section the City of Statesville, as grantor owning certain poles within its service area, shall permit attachment of cables, wires, and apparatus to such poles only upon submission of an application by grantee. The city will not unreasonably withhold its consent to the use of such poles to municipal franchisees. In general, permission will not be granted for the attachment to any pole of more than one (1) strand in any one direction supporting communication cables of the grantee, exclusive of service drop cables originating on the pole or nearest main line pole of the city. Any attachment to municipal poles by entities not franchising utility services through the city shall be required to obtain a permit with the city within twelve (12) months of adoption of this ordinance. 
Permittees shall pay the same rate per pole as set forth in the city's annual fee schedule. 
(c)  It shall be unlawful to connect any wire, fiber optic cable, support cable, communication or signal device, camera, etc., to grantor's pole without permit granted by the director of electric utilities. Failure to obtain a permit shall cause the city to immediately remove such devices from unpermitted rules at violator's expense. 
(5)  Maintenance of attachments in safe condition. Grantee shall, at its own expense, make and maintain all its attachments and facilities in safe condition and in thorough repair, and in a manner acceptable to the city and so that said attachments and facilities of grantee will not conflict with or alter existing equipment or use of said poles by the city, or by other utility companies using or having the right to use said poles, or interfere with the working use of facilities thereon or which may from time to time be placed thereon. Grantee shall at any time, at its own expense, upon notice from the city, relocate, replace or renew its facilities placed on said poles, and transfer them to substitute poles, or perform any other work in connection with said facilities that may be required by the city, provided, however, that in cases of emergency, the city may arrange to relocate, replace, or renew the facilities placed on said poles by grantee, transfer them to substituted poles or perform any other work in connection with said facilities that may be required in the maintenance, replacement, removal or relocation of said poles, the facilities thereon or which may be placed thereon, or for the service needs of the city, and grantee shall, on demand, reimburse the city for the expense thereby incurred. 
(6)  Construction and technical standards. 
(a)  Grantee's cables, wires, and appliances, in each and every location, shall be erected and maintained in accordance with the requirements and specifications of the National Electrical Safety Code, and any amendments or revisions of said code and safety requirements of the city, and in compliance with any rules or orders now in effect or that may hereafter be issued by the State Regulatory Authority, or other authority having jurisdiction. The grantee shall not install any facilities in the city's poles which will make said poles unsightly in appearance. The city has the right to refuse attachment by the grantee of its facilities if, in the opinion of the city, the attachment will render said poles unsightly in appearance. The city shall designate the location of grantee's attachments to the poles of the city in accordance the requirements and specifications of the National Electrical Safety Code and the city's outstanding obligation to others as to the use of said poles. 
(b)  In the event that any pole or poles of the city to which grantee desires to make attachments are inadequate to support the additional facilities in accordance with the aforesaid specifications, the grantee will notify the city of any deficiency. If the grantee still desires to make the attachments, it shall authorize the city to make the necessary changes and shall reimburse the city, on demand, for all costs incurred by the city in making such changes, including cost of preliminary survey, engineering, and other expenses involved. If the grantee does not elect to have changes made, the grantee will then reimburse the city the cost of preliminary survey and expenses incurred by the city. Where the grantee's desired attachments can be accommodated on present poles of the city by rearranging the city's facilities thereon, the grantee shall compensate the city for the full expense incurred in completing such rearrangements. The grantee will also, on demand, reimburse the owner or owners of other facilities attached to said poles for any expense incurred by it, or them, in transferring or rearranging said facilities. Any guying of poles required to accommodate the attachments of grantee shall be provided by and at the expense of the grantee and to the satisfaction of the city. If existing attachments of other owners are in violation of the National Electric Safety Code or the safety requirements of the city, the grantee shall not be billed for any costs except those costs in excess of the costs to correct the existing violations. 
(7)  City not liable for service interruptions. The city reserves to itself, its successors and assigns, and to the owner or owners of other facilities attached to said poles, the right to maintain, replace and enlarge its facilities and to operate the same from time to time in such a manner as will best enable it, in its sole judgment, to meet the needs of its customers and fulfill its own service requirements. The city shall not be liable to grantee or to grantee's customers for any interruption to service of grantee or for interference with the operation of the cables, wires, and apparatus of grantee arising in any manner out of the use of the city's poles hereunder, or arising in any manner out of the condition or character of the city's facilities or the manner of the operation thereof. 
(8)  Right to inspect. The city, because of the importance of its service, reserves the right to inspect each new installation of grantee on its poles and in the vicinity of its lines or apparatus and to make periodic inspections, annually or as plant conditions may warrant, of the entire plant of grantee. Such inspections made or not, shall not operate to relieve grantee of any responsibility, obligation or liability imposed by law or any other ordinance or agreement. 
(9)  Pole attachment fees. Grantee shall immediately notify the city of any new attachments made to city poles. Grantee shall pay to the city, for attachments made to poles, a pole attachment fee as set forth in the City of Statesville fee schedule maintained in the city office by the city clerk. Said rental shall be payable annually in advance on the first day of January of each year, and shall be based upon the number of poles on which attachments are being maintained on the first day of December. City may periodically inventory the city's poles for compliance with the above and shall assess a per pole penalty of fifty dollars ($50.00) for each pole found out of compliance with this section. 
(10)  Grantee responsible for damage. Grantee shall exercise special precautions to avoid damage to facilities of the city and of others supported on said poles, and hereby assumes all responsibility for any and all loss for such damage. Grantee shall make an immediate report to the city of the occurrence of any damage and hereby agrees to reimburse the city for the expense incurred in making repairs. 
(11)  Hold harmless provision. Grantee shall indemnify, defend, and save harmless the city from and against any and all claims, demands, loss, costs and expense because of: 
1.  Damages to property; 
2.  Injury or death to persons (whether such injury or death is to grantee's or the city's employees, or the public); 
3.  Any and all interference with the service rendered by grantee over its facilities including television and radio reception of customers or patrons of grantee; 
4.  Any interference with the television or radio reception of any person which may be occasioned by the installation or operation of grantee's facilities; 
5.  Payments made under any workmen's compensation law or under any plan for employees' disability and death benefits, which may arise out of or be caused by the erection, maintenance, presence, operation, or removal of grantee's facilities; 
6.  The proximity of grantee's facilities to the wires and other facilities of the city; 
7.  Any act of grantee, its agents or employees, on or in the vicinity of the city's poles; or 
8.  Any claims made upon the city for additional compensation for use of its distribution rights of way for an additional use. 
(12)  Necessary precautions. Grantee agrees to take any necessary precautions prescribed by the city, by the installation of protective equipment or otherwise, to protect all persons and property against injury or damage that may result from grantee's attachments to the city's poles. If, in the city's opinion, grantee has not taken such necessary precautions, the city shall have the right to terminate the permission herein granted upon thirty (30) days' written notice to grantee. However, the city shall not be considered in any way responsible for the adequacy or inadequacy of such precautions of grantee. The city shall have the right to remove immediately and without notice any attachment which could place the city's equipment or the public in danger. 
(13)  Removal of attachments. 
(a)  Grantee may at any time remove its attachments from any pole or poles of the city, but shall immediately give written notice of such removal to the city. No refund of any rental will be due on account of such removal. 
(b)  Upon notice from the city to grantee that the use of any pole or poles is forbidden by municipal authorities or property owners, the permit covering the use of such pole or poles shall immediately terminate without notice, and cables, wires, and appliances of the grantee shall be removed at once from the affected pole or poles. 
(14)  Penalties and remedies. 
(a)  If grantee shall fail to comply with any of the provisions of this section, including the specifications hereinbefore referred to, or default in any of its obligations, and shall fail within sixty (60) days after written notice from the city to correct such default or noncompliance, the city may, at its option, forthwith revoke the permit covering the poles as to which such default or noncompliance shall have occurred. In case of such termination, no refund shall be made. 
(b)  Bills for expenses and other charges under this section, except those advance payments specifically covered herein, shall be payable within thirty (30) days after presentation. 
(c)  Failure to enforce or insist upon compliance with any of the terms or conditions of this section shall not constitute a general waiver or relinquishment of any such terms or conditions, but the same shall be and remain at all times in full force and effect. 
(15)  Rights of grantees. 
(a)  Nothing herein contained shall be construed as affecting the rights or privileges granted by the city, by contract or otherwise, to others, to use any poles covered by this section; and the city shall have the right to continue and extend such rights or privileges. The attachment privileges herein granted shall at all times be subject to such contracts and arrangements. 
(b)  Grantee shall not assign, transfer or sublet the privileges hereby granted without the prior consent in writing of the city. 
(c)  No use, however extended, of the city's poles, shall create or vest in grantee any ownership or property rights in said poles, but grantee's rights therein shall be and remain a mere license. Nothing herein contained shall be construed to compel the city to maintain any of said poles for a period longer than demanded by its own service requirements. 
(16)  Rights of city to abandon poles. The city reserves to itself and its successors and assigns the right to abandon a pole or poles to which the grantee's facilities are attached. The grantee shall be given sixty (60) days notice of each proposed abandonment, and if the grantee does not remove its facilities, the city may institute a fine of one hundred dollars ($100.00) per day for each day after said sixty (60) days. In addition to this fine, the grantee may deem grantee's facilities worthless, and they may be caused by the city to be removed from the pole or poles, and be disposed of at any suitable place, all at the expense of grantee. The city shall be free from any liability therefore to anyone. 
(17)  Notice. Wherever in this section notice is provided to be given by either party hereto to the other, unless otherwise specified, such notice shall be in writing and given by letter deposited in the U.S. mail, or by personal delivery to the city at its office.

Subdivision III. - Significant Industrial Users 

Sec. 23-194. - Volume of flow. 
(a)  The volume of flow used in computing industrial wastewater surcharges shall be based upon metered water consumption as shown in the records of meter reading maintained by the City of Statesville Finance Department. If a person discharging wastes into the sanitary sewer system produces evidence to the director that more than ten (10) percent of the total annual volume of water used for all purposes does not reach the City of Statesville sanitary sewer, an estimated percentage of total water consumption to be used in computing charges may be agreed upon between the director and the person discharging industrial wastes into the sewer. 
(b)  Where the person discharging industrial wastewater into the sanitary sewers procures all or part of his water supply from sources other than the City of Statesville, all or part of which is discharged into the sanitary sewer, the person discharging the wastewater shall install and maintain, at his expense, water meters of a type approved by the director for the purpose of determining the actual volume flow. 
(c)  In order to control the excessive discharge of other than city-supplied water to the sewer system, a fixed ratio between metered city water and the discharge to the sewer system may be established by the director for those persons using other than city-supplied water as part of their water supply. Any additional discharge to the sewer system which causes this ratio to change may be used as a basis for an additional surcharge. For persons connected to the sewer system on the effective date of Ordinance No. 25-12 [Dec. 3, 2013], this fixed ratio shall be that ratio which exists on that date; for persons proposing to connect to the sewer system, the ratio shall be fixed as of the date of the connection; in either instance, the ratio shall be determined on an individual basis by the director.

This surcharge shall be in addition to any existing sewer service charge, and is based on the quarterly monitoring sample. 
(b)  The surcharge shall be computed as follows: 
(1)  When the concentration of COD, suspended solids or NH 3 in the industrial waste discharge to the city's sanitary sewers exceeds the prescribed limits, a monthly surcharge shall be imposed upon the offending industrial user's sewage flow when the excess is calculated using the industrial plant water flow and the difference between the actual COD, suspended solids or NH 3 concentration and the permissible limits of seven hundred (700) mg/l, three hundred (300) mg/l and twenty-five (25) mg/l respectively. 
(2)  The sewer surcharge for the following fiscal year shall be established by the director as soon as possible after the fiscal year audit. This surcharge shall be invoked as herein provided in addition to the existing regular sewer service charge. The surcharge shall reflect the total cost of treating the excess pounds of industrial waste including necessary cost of administration of the sewage plant and this article. The method used to determine the surcharge amount shall consist of dividing the total audited budget cost for operating each component of the city's sewage treatment plant which is affected by COD, suspended solids or NH 3 , including the applicable administrative and plant debt service, for the preceding fiscal year, by the total pounds of COD, suspended solids or NH 3 removed by the wastewater treatment system during the preceding fiscal year. 
(c)  Industrial users shall be mailed a bill showing the amounts of the combined surcharge and date on which payment is due. Failure to receive a bill shall not excuse nonpayment of the same. 
(d)  Surcharge bills for city water users remaining unpaid within thirty (30) days of the date of billing shall be delinquent. A notice shall be mailed to the user informing him of the delinquent status of his account, and if, after five (5) days from the date of mailing such notice the bill remains unpaid, the water connection serving the user will be severed and shall not be turned back on until the bill is paid. 
(e)  Surcharge bills for a user having a private water supply remaining unpaid within thirty (30) days of the date of billing shall be delinquent. A notice shall be mailed to the user informing him of the delinquent status of his account and if, after five (5) days from the date of mailing the notice the bill remains unpaid, the user's connection with the wastewater treatment system will be severed and will only be reconnected at the user's expense and upon payment of all charges due. Upon the severing of the connection with the sanitary sewer, the director shall notify the state division of water quality of his action and the resulting possibility of a discharge to the surface waters of the state.

(a)  Bulk municipal users discharging wastewater into the sanitary sewer shall pay a surcharge amounting to the costs enumerated in subsection (b) below for treating all wastewater having a COD in excess of seven hundred (700) ppm, a suspended solids concentration in excess of three hundred (300) ppm, or an NH 3 in excess of twenty-five (25) ppm, by weight. This surcharge shall be in addition to any existing sewer service charge. 
(b)  The surcharge shall be computed as follows: 
(1)  When the concentration of COD, suspended solids or NH 3 in the bulk municipal user's discharge to the city's sanitary sewer exceeds the prescribed limits, a monthly surcharge shall be imposed upon the offending bulk municipal user's sewage flow when the excess is calculated using the metered wastewater flow and the difference between the actual COD, suspended solids or NH 3 concentration and the permissible limits of seven hundred (700) mg/l, three hundred (300) mg/l, and twenty-five (25) mg/l respectively. 
(2)  The sewer surcharge for the following fiscal year shall be established by the director as soon as possible after the fiscal year audit. This surcharge shall be invoked as herein provided in addition to the existing regular sewer service charge. The surcharge shall reflect the total cost of treating the excess pounds of waste including necessary cost of administration of the sewage plant and this article. The method used to determine the surcharge amount shall consist of dividing the total audited budget cost for operating each component of the city's sewage treatment plant which is affected by COD, suspended solids or NH 3 removed by the wastewater treatment system during the preceding fiscal year. This surcharge shall be based on the previous quarter's sampling results. 
(c)  Bulk municipal users shall be mailed a bill showing the amounts of the combined surcharge and date on which payment is due. Failure to receive a bill shall not excuse nonpayment of the same. 
(d)  Surcharge bills for bulk municipal users remaining unpaid within thirty (30) days of the date of billing shall be delinquent. A notice shall be mailed to the user informing the municipality of the delinquent status of the account and if, after five (5) days from the date of mailing such notice, the bill remains unpaid, the city shall have the right to suspend wastewater service until the bill is paid. The POTW director shall notify the state division of water quality of his action and the resulting possibility of a discharge to the surface waters of the state. 
(e)  If, at any time, the total flow amounts from the point(s) of delivery combined shall exceed the maximum daily flow allocations as stated in the interlocal agreement, in addition to all other rates, fees and charges the bulk municipal user shall pay to City of Statesville a penalty per one thousand (1,000) gallons or one hundred (100) cubic feet that equals one hundred (100) percent the rate being charged at the time for all flow amounts that exceed the maximum daily allocation. The city shall also have the right to charge the bulk municipal discharger a penalty that equals one hundred (100) percent the rate being charged for any flows that exceed the maximum instantaneous rate as defined within the interlocal agreement when the maximum daily flow allocation is exceeded.

Such records relating to compliance with sanitary sewer collection system standards shall be made available upon request by the director. All such records relating to compliance with standards shall be made available to officials of the Untied States Environmental Protection Agency and state upon demand. 
(2)  Each bulk municipal user shall install, at his own cost and expense, metering and sampling facilities in such a manner as to ensure accurate measurement of flow and flow proportionate samples. 
(b)  Inspection, sampling and analysis. 
(1)  Compliance determinations with respect to subdivision II of this article, prohibitions and limitations may be made on the basis of either instantaneous grab samples or composite samples of wastewater. Composite samples may be taken over a twenty-four-hour period, over a longer or shorter time span, as determined necessary by the director to meet the needs of specific circumstances. 
(2)  Laboratory analysis of bulk municipal wastewater samples shall be performed in accordance with the current edition of Standard Methods, Methods for Chemical Analysis of Water and Waste, published by the United States Environmental Protection Agency or the Annual Book of Standards, Part 23, Water, Atmospheric Analysis, published by the American Society for Testing and Materials. 
(3)  Sampling of municipal wastewater for the purpose of compliance determination with respect to subdivision II of the article, prohibitions and limitations will be done at such intervals as the director may designate. However, it is the intention of the director to conduct compliance sampling or to cause such sampling to be conducted for all major contributing municipal users at least once every three (3) months.

Sec. 23-209. - Notification of the discharge of hazardous waste. 
    The city prohibits the discharge of any hazardous wastes without notification to and approval by the POTW director. 
(1)  Any user who commences the discharge of hazardous waste shall notify the POTW, the EPA Regional Waste Management Division Director, and state hazardous waste authorities, in writing, of any discharge into the POTW of a substance which, if otherwise disposed of, would be a hazardous waste under 40 CFR Part 261. Such notification must include the name of the hazardous waste as set forth in 40 CFR Part 261, the EPA hazardous waste number, and the type of discharge (continuous, batch, or other). If the user discharges more than one hundred (100) kilograms of such waste per calendar month to the POTW, the notification also shall contain the following information to the extent such information is known and readily available to the user: an identification of the hazardous constituents contained in the wastes, an estimation of the mass and concentration of such constituents in the wastestream discharge during the calendar month, and an estimation of the mass and concentration such of constituents in the wastestream expected to be discharged during the following twelve (12) months. All notifications must take place no later than one hundred eighty (180) days before the discharge commences. The user shall not begin the discharge until receiving written approval from the City of Statesville. Any notification under this paragraph need be submitted only once for each hazardous waste discharge. However, notification of changed conditions must be submitted under section 23-205 of this article. The notification requirement in this section does not apply to pollutants already reported by users subject to categorical pretreatment standards under the self-monitoring requirements of sections 23-201, 23-203, and 23-204 of this article. 
(2)  Dischargers are exempt from the requirements of paragraph (1), above, during a calendar month in which they discharge no more than fifteen (15) kilograms of hazardous wastes, unless the wastes are acute hazardous wastes as specific in 40 CFR 261.30(d) and 261.33(e). Discharge of more than fifteen (15) kilograms on nonacute hazardous wastes in a calendar month, or of any quantity of acute hazardous wastes as specified in 40 CFR 261.30(d) and 261.33(e), requires a one-time notification. Subsequent months during which the user discharges more than such quantities of any hazardous waste do not require additional notification. 
(3)  In the case of any new regulation under section 3001 of RCRA identifying additional characteristics of hazardous waste or listing any additional substance as a hazardous waste, the user must notify the POTW director, the EPA Regional Waste Management Waste Division Director, and state hazardous waste authorities of the discharge of such substance within ninety (90) days of the effective date of such regulations. 
(4)  In the case of any notification made under this section, the user shall certify that it has a program in place to reduce the volume and toxicity of hazardous wastes generated to the degree it has determined to be economically practical. 
(5)  This provision does not create a right to discharge any substance not otherwise permitted to be discharged by this article, a permit issued thereunder, or any applicable federal or state law. 
(Ord. No. 25-12, 12-3-2012) 
Sec. 23-210. - Analytical requirements. 
    All pollutant analyses, including sampling techniques, to be submitted as part of a wastewater discharge permit application or report shall be performed by a laboratory certified by the state to perform the wastewater analyses in accordance with the techniques prescribed in 40 CFR Part 136, unless otherwise specified in an applicable categorical pretreatment standard or unless otherwise performed in accordance with procedures approved by EPA or City of Statesville. If 40 CFR Part 136 does not contain sampling or analytical techniques for the pollutant in question, sampling and analyses must be performed in accordance with procedures approved by EPA and City of Statesville. Analyses must be performed by a state certified lab for each parameter analyzed, if such certification exists for that parameter. 
(Ord. No. 25-12, 12-3-2012) 
Sec. 23-211. - Grab and composite sample collection. 
(a)  All wastewater samples must be representative of the user's discharge. Wastewater monitoring and flow measurement facilities shall be properly operated, kept clean, and maintained in good working order at all times. The failure of a user to keep its monitoring facility in good working order shall not be grounds for the user to claim that sample results are unrepresentative of its discharge. 
(b)  Grab samples must be used for pH, cyanide, total phenols, oil and grease, sulfide, volatile organic compounds, and any other pollutants as required by 40 CFR 136. The POTW shall determine the number of grabs necessary to be representative of the user's discharge. See 40 CFR 403.12(g)(5) for additional grab sample number requirements for BMR and ninety-day compliance reports. Additionally, the POTW director may allow collection of multiple grabs during a twenty-four-hour period which are composited prior to analysis as allowed under 40 CFR 136. 
(c)  Composite samples. All wastewater composite samples shall be collected with a minimum of hourly aliquots or grabs for each hour that there is a discharge. All wastewater composite samples shall be collected using flow proportional composite collection techniques, unless time-proportional composite sampling or grab sampling is authorized by the POTW director. When authorizing time-proportional composites or grabs, the samples must be representative and the decision to allow the alternative sampling must be documented. 
(Ord. No. 25-12, 12-3-2012) 
Sec. 23-212. - Timing. 
    Written reports will be deemed to have been submitted on the date postmarked. For reports which are not mailed, postage prepaid, into a mail facility serviced by the United States Postal Service, the date of receipt of the report shall govern. 
(Ord. No. 25-12, 12-3-2012) 
Sec. 23-213. - Record keeping. 
    Users subject to the reporting requirements of this article shall retain, and make available for inspection and copying, all records of information obtained pursuant to any monitoring activities required by this article and any additional records of information obtained pursuant to monitoring activities undertaken by the user independent of such requirements. Records shall include the date, exact place, method and time of sampling and the name of the person(s) taking the samples; the dates analyses were performed; who performed the analyses; the analytical techniques or methods used; and the results of such analyses. These records shall remain available for a period of at least three (3) years. This period shall be automatically extended for the duration of any litigation concerning the user or the city, or where the user has been specifically notified of a longer retention period by the POTW director. 
(Ord. No. 25-12, 12-3-2012) 
Sec. 23-214. - Electronic reporting. 
    The POTW director may develop procedures for receipt of electronic reports for any reporting requirements of this article. Such procedures shall comply with 40 CFR Part 3. These procedures shall be enforceable under subdivision VIII of this article. 
(Ord. No. 25-12, 12-3-2012) 
Subdivision VI. - Compliance Monitoring 

Sec. 23-215. - Monitoring facilities. 
    The City of Statesville requires the user to provide and operate at the user's own expense, monitoring facilities to allow inspection, sampling and flow measurement of the building sewer and/or internal drainage systems. The monitoring facility should normally be situated on the user's premises, but the city may, when such a location would be impractical or cause undue hardship on the user, allow the facility to be constructed in the area and located so that it will not be obstructed by landscaping or parked vehicles. 
    There shall be ample room in or near such sampling manhole or facility to allow accurate sampling and preparation of samples for analysis. The facility, sampling and measuring equipment shall be maintained at all times in a safe and proper operating condition at the expense of the user. 
    Whether constructed on public or private property, the sampling and monitoring facilities shall be provided in accordance with the city's requirements and all applicable local construction standards and specifications. Construction shall be completed within ninety (90) days following written notification by the City of Statesville. 
(Ord. No. 25-12, 12-3-2012) 
Sec. 23-216. - Inspection and sampling. 
    The City of Statesville will inspect the facilities of any user to ascertain whether the purpose of this article is being met and all requirements are being complied with. Persons or occupants of premises where wastewater is created or discharged shall allow the City of Statesville, approval authority and EPA or their representative ready access at all reasonable times to all parts of the premises for the purposes of inspection, sampling, records examination and copying or in the performance of any of their duties. The City of Statesville, approval authority and EPA shall have the right to set up on the user's property such devices as are necessary to conduct sampling, inspection, compliance monitoring and/or metering operations. Where a user has security measures in force which would require proper identification and clearance before entry into their premises, the user shall make necessary arrangements with their security guards so that upon presentation of suitable identification, personnel from the City of Statesville, approval authority and EPA will be permitted to enter, without delay, for the purposes of performing their specific responsibilities. Denial of the City of Statesville, approval authority's or EPA's access to the user's premises shall be a violation of this article. Unreasonable delays may constitute denial of access. 
(Ord. No. 25-12, 12-3-2012) 
Sec. 23-217. - Search warrants. 
    If the City of Statesville, approval authority or EPA has been refused access to a building, structure, or property, or any part thereof, and is able to demonstrate probable cause to believe that there may be a violation of this article, or that there is a need to inspect and/or sample as part of a routine inspection and sampling program of the City of Statesville designed to verify compliance with this article or any permit or order issued hereunder, or to protect the overall public health, safety and welfare of the community, then the City of Statesville, approval authority, or EPA may seek issuance of a search warrant from the City of Statesville or County of Iredell. 
(Ord. No. 25-12, 12-3-2012) 
Subdivision VII. - Confidential Information 

Sec. 23-218. - Release of confidential information. 
(a)  Information and data provided by an industrial user to the POTW director pursuant to this article identifying the nature and frequency of a discharge, shall be available to the public without restriction. All other information which may be so submitted by an industrial user to the POTW director in connection with any required reports shall also be available to the public unless the industrial user or other interested person specifically identifies the information as confidential upon submission and is able to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the POTW director that the disclosure of such information or a particular part thereof to the general public would divulge methods or processes entitled to protection as trade secrets. 
(b)  Information provided by an industrial user to the POTW director that is determined to be entitled to confidential treatment shall be made available upon written request to the division of water quality or any state agency for uses related to the pretreatment program, the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit, collection system permit, stormwater permit, and/or non-discharge permit, and for uses related to judicial review or enforcement proceedings involving the person furnishing the report. 
(c)  Information and data received by the division or other state agency under paragraph (b) above shall be subject to the processes set forth in G.S. 143-215.3C. 
(Ord. No. 25-12, 12-3-2012) 
Subdivision VIII. - Enforcement 

Sec. 23-219. - Administrative remedies. 
(a)  Notification of violation. Whenever the POTW director finds that any industrial user has violated or is violating this article, wastewater permit, or any prohibition, limitation or requirements contained therein or any other pretreatment requirement the POTW director may serve upon such a person a written notice stating the nature of the violation. Within fifteen (15) days from the receipt of this notice, an explanation for the violation and a plan for the satisfactory correction thereof shall be submitted to the City of Statesville by the user. Submission of this plan does not relieve the discharger of liability for any violations occurring before or after receipt of the notice of violation. Enforcement action shall be taken in accordance with the city's enforcement response plan that is on file at the city clerk's office. 
(b)  Consent orders. The POTW director is hereby empowered to enter into consent orders, assurances of voluntary compliance, or other similar documents establishing an agreement with the person responsible for the noncompliance. Such orders will include specific action to be taken by the discharger to correct the noncompliance within a time period also specified by the order. Consent orders shall have the same force and effect as an administrative order issued pursuant to subsection 23-219(d), below. 
(c)  Show cause hearing. The POTW director may order any industrial user who causes or is responsible for an unauthorized discharge, has violated this article or is in noncompliance with a wastewater discharge permit to show cause why a proposed enforcement action should not be taken. In the event the POTW director determines that a show cause order should be issued, a notice shall be served on the user specifying the time and place for the hearing, the proposed enforcement action, the reasons for such action and a request that the user show cause why this proposed enforcement action should not be taken. The notice of the hearing shall be served personally or by registered or certified mail (return receipt requested) at least ten (10) days before the hearing. Service may be made on any agent or officer of a corporation. 
    The POTW director shall review the evidence presented at the hearing and determine whether the proposed enforcement action is appropriate. 
    A show cause hearing under this section is not a prerequisite to the assessment of a civil penalty under section 23-220 nor is any action or inaction taken by the POTW director under this section subject to an administrative appeal under subsection 23-200(8). 
(d)  Administrative orders. When the POTW director finds that an industrial user has violated or continues to violate this article, permits or orders issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment requirement the POTW director may issue an order to cease and resist all such violations and direct those persons in noncompliance to do any of the following: 
(1)  Immediately comply with all requirements; 
(2)  Comply in accordance with a compliance time schedule set forth in the order; 
(3)  Take appropriate remedial or preventive action in the event of a continuing or threatened violation; 
(4)  Disconnect unless adequate treatment facilities, devices or other related appurtenances are installed and properly operated within a specified time period. Appeals may be made in accordance with subsection 23-200(8) of this article. 
(e)  Emergency suspensions. The POTW director may suspend the wastewater treatment service and or wastewater permit when such suspension is necessary in order to stop an actual or threatened discharge which presents or may present imminent or substantial endangerment to the health or welfare of persons or the environment, interferes with the POTW or causes the POTW to violate any condition of its NPDES or non-discharge permit. 
    Any user notified of a suspension of the wastewater treatment service and/or the wastewater permit shall immediately stop or eliminate the contribution. A hearing will be held within fifteen (15) days of the notice of suspension to determine whether the suspension may be lifted or the user's waste discharge permit terminated. In the event of a failure to comply voluntarily with the suspension order, the POTW director shall take such steps as deemed necessary including immediate severance of the water connection, to prevent or minimize damage to the POTW system for endangerment to any individuals. The POTW director shall reinstate the wastewater permit and the water service upon proof of the elimination of the noncompliant discharge. The industrial user shall submit a detailed written statement describing the causes of the harmful contribution and the measures taken to prevent any future occurrence to the POTW director prior to the date of the above-described hearing. 
(f)  Termination of permit or permission to discharge. The POTW director may revoke a wastewater discharge permit or permission to discharge for good cause, including but not limited to, the following reasons: 
(1)  Failure to accurately report the wastewater constituents and characteristics of this discharge; 
(2)  Failure to report significant changes in operations, or wastewater constituents and characteristics; 
(3)  Refusal of reasonable access to the user's premises for the purpose of inspection or monitoring; or, 
(4)  Violation of conditions of the permit or permission to discharge, conditions of this article, or any applicable state and federal regulations. 
    Noncompliant industrial users will be notified of the proposed termination of their wastewater permit and will be offered an opportunity to show cause under section 23-217 of this article why the proposed action should not be taken. 
(Ord. No. 25-12, 12-3-2012) 
Sec. 23-220. - Civil penalties. 
(a)  Any user who is found to have failed to comply with any provision of this article, or the orders, rules, regulations and permits issued hereunder may be assessed a civil penalty up to twenty-five thousand dollars ($25,000.00) per day per violation. 
(1)  Penalties between ten thousand dollars ($10,000.00) and twenty-five thousand dollars ($25,000.00) per day per violation may be assessed against a violator only if: 
a.  For any class of violation, only if a civil penalty has been imposed against the violator within the five (5) years preceding the violation, or 
b.  In the case of failure to file, submit, or make available, as the case may be, any documents, data, or reports required by this article, or the orders, rules, regulations and permits issued hereunder, only if the POTW director determines that the violation was intentional and a civil penalty has been imposed against the violator within the five (5) years preceding the violation. 
(b)  In determining the amount of the civil penalty, the POTW director shall consider the following: 
(1)  The degree and extent of the harm to the natural resources, to the public health, or to public or private property resulting from the violation; 
(2)  The duration and gravity of the violation; 
(3)  The effect on ground or surface water quantity or quality or on air quality; 
(4)  The cost of rectifying the damage; 
(5)  The amount of money saved by noncompliance; 
(6)  Whether the violation was committed willfully or intentionally; 
(7)  The prior record of the violator in complying or failing to comply with the pretreatment program; 
(8)  The costs of enforcement to the city. 
(c)  Appeals of civil penalties assessed in accordance with this section shall be as provided in subsection 23-200(8).

(3)  Water supply severance. Whenever an industrial user is in violation of the provisions of this article or an order or permit issued hereunder, water service to the industrial user may be severed and service will only recommence, at the user's expense, after it has satisfactorily demonstrated ability to comply. 
(4)  Public nuisances. Any violation of the prohibitions or effluent limitations of this article or of a permit or order issued hereunder, is hereby declared a public nuisance and shall be corrected or abated as directed by the POTW director. Any person(s) creating a public nuisance shall be subject to the provisions of the city governing such nuisances, including reimbursing the POTW for any costs incurred in removing, abating or remedying said nuisance. 
(Ord. No. 25-12, 12-3-2012) 
Sec. 23-222. - Remedies nonexclusive. 
    The remedies provided for in this article are not exclusive. The POTW director may take any, all, or any combination of these actions against a noncompliant user. Enforcement of pretreatment violations will generally be in accordance with the City of Statesville enforcement response plan. However, the POTW director may take other action against any user when the circumstances warrant. Further, the POTW director is empowered to take more than one (1) enforcement action against any noncompliant user.

(1)  A local limit exists for each pollutant discharged and the user was in compliance with each limit directly prior to, and during, the pass-through or interference; or 
(2)  No local limit exists, but the discharge did not change substantially in nature or constituents from the user's prior discharge when the city was regularly in compliance with its NPDES permit, and in the case of interference, was in compliance with applicable sludge use or disposal requirements. 
(Ord. No. 25-12, 12-3-2012) 
Sec. 23-225.1. - Bypass. 
(a)  A user may allow any bypass to occur which does not cause pretreatment standards or requirements to be violated, but only if it also is for essential maintenance to assure efficient operation. These bypasses are not subject to the provision of paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section. 
(b)  (1)  If a user knows in advance of the need for a bypass, it shall submit prior notice to the POTW director at least ten (10) days before the date of the bypass, if possible. 
(2)  A user shall submit oral notice to the POTW director of an unanticipated bypass that exceeds applicable pretreatment standards within twenty-four (24) hours from the time it becomes aware of the bypass. A written submission shall also be provided within five (5) days of this time the user becomes aware of the bypass. The written submission shall contain a description of the bypass and its cause; the duration of the bypass, including exact dates and times, and, if the bypass has not been corrected, the anticipated time it is expected to continue; and steps taken or planned to reduce, eliminate, and prevent reoccurrence of the bypass.

a.  Bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life, personal injury, or severe property damage; 
b.  There were no feasible alternatives to the bypass, such as the use of auxiliary treatment facilities, retention of untreated wastes, or maintenance during normal periods of equipment downtime. This condition is not satisfied if adequate back-up equipment should have been installed in the exercise of reasonable engineering judgment to prevent a bypass which occurred during normal periods of equipment downtime or preventive maintenance; and 
c.  The user submitted notices as required under paragraph (b) of this section. 
(2)  The POTW director may approve an anticipated bypass, after considering its adverse effects, if the POTW director determines that it will meet the three (3) conditions listed in paragraph (c)(1) of this section.

Source: "Statesville System Development Fee Analysis, 2017." Available in city clerk's office. 
(d)  Utilization of SDFs and SDF ordinance. The public works director shall administer the assessment of SDFs and shall ensure that the council is provided sufficient information to allow the setting of appropriate policies. The public works director shall establish and maintain records, which are in agreement with the budget, the SDF ordinance and the appropriate statutes of North Carolina. The proceeds of the system development fees shall be segregated into a capital reserve fund established pursuant to G. S. Ch. 159, Art. 3, Pt. 2 and may be expended only in association with capital rehabilitation projects as defined herein and previously completed capital improvements for which capacity exists. 
(e)  Fee schedule. The SDF schedule for customers shall be adopted by the city council and is available for inspection in the city clerk and city engineer's office. 
(f)  Tap size to govern rated flows. At the time of installation, should the tap size exceed the size of the meter requested for a customer, the SDF shall be calculated on the tap size. 
(g)  Effective date of payment of SDF and septic system policy. Except as provided below, the owner or developer shall contract with the city to pay the SDF at such time as a water meter permit is issued. Such contract shall be executed before the city agrees to sign any applications for North Carolina Department of Environment and Natural Resources permit applications. Water meters will not be issued unless assessed SDFs have been paid in full based upon existing information at the time of issuance. SDFs will be assessed for all new customers, expansions and renovations of existing structures requiring larger water meters on or after July 1, 2018. This SDF as outlined in section 23-259 of this code will not apply to any structures that receive water meters before July 1, 2018, unless said structures require larger water service. A structure that receives a water permit on or after July 1, 2018, which is connected to an individual septic tank nitrification system and in the future obtains wastewater service shall pay the applicable sewer SDF at the time the wastewater permit is obtained. 
(1)  Customer replacement of a mobile home. A customer who was connected to a wastewater collection system prior to July 1, 2018, or who has paid a SDF may replace a mobile home or other structure on the same lot without paying the SDF provided the connection is the same size and a letter is provided from the customer service department verifying the previous connection. 
(2)  Fees when new structures are replacing demolished structures on the same or re-platted parcels. In the event that a structure or structures are demolished and replaced by a new structure or structures on an existing or re-platted parcel, the city will subtract the value of abandoned taps based on prevailing rates from the total needed for the new structure or structures. If the meter size of the new structure is less than or equal to the meter(s) that previously served that site, no SDFs will be due and no fees will be refunded. If the new requirements are greater, the builder/owner will be charged the difference. The policy is applicable only to the platted or re-platted lots where the new structure and its parking areas will be located. No water and sewer capacity from other sites may be credited to the site in question nor can any balances in water and sewer capacity be transferred from the site in questions to other sites. 
(h)  Fire protection lines. The city shall not collect SDF for use of taps for fire protection purposes. The use of fire protection lines for daily water use is illegal and upon discovery the customer shall be subject to disconnection of fire service until the SDF for the size fire line tap is paid and appropriate metering devices installed to calculate flow. 
(i)  Existing structure requesting additional capacity. When an existing development or structure requests additional water and/or wastewater capacity, the customer must reapply with the city for water and wastewater services and is subject to system development fees in accordance with this section. 
(j)  Review of system development fees. The city shall publish the system development fee in its annual budget ordinance. The city shall update the system development fee analysis every five (5) years.

    The purpose of this chapter is to regulate the planting, maintenance and removal of trees and shrubs on city and municipally owned property and rights-of-way wherever located.

PART 2. - SUBDIVISION REVIEW 

Section 2.02 - Minor Subdivisions 
A.  Purpose 
    Recognizing that small-scale subdivisions generally require less intense review, the City establishes this simplified procedure for minor subdivisions. This procedure is intended to provide one-time relief for applicants. 
B.  Applicability, Exceptions 
    A minor subdivision shall be processed as a Final Plat. A subdivision is considered minor if it meets all of the following criteria: 
1.  Streets: No new public streets are required for lot access to a public street; 
2.  Easements: No new off-site easements or improvements are required; 
3.  Design: The design and layout of the subdivision shall conform to all requirements of this Code; 
4.  Lots: The subdivision results in ten (10) or fewer lots; and 
5.  Utilities: No new utility improvements are required. 
C.  Application and Procedure 
    The application shall be filed with the Planning Department who shall review the application and forward the plat for review by affected utilities and other applicable agencies. The Planning Director shall determine its completeness and compliance with this Code. 
D.  Review Criteria 
    The minor subdivision shall comply with the criteria set forth for Final Plats. 
E.  Decision Maker 
    Staff shall approve or disapprove the minor subdivision application within thirty (30) days of submittal of a complete application. 
Section 2.03 - Major Subdivisions 
A.  Purpose 
    The purpose of this section is to ensure subdivisions comply with adopted standards for lot development and public improvements. 
B.  Applicability 
    The process for major subdivisions shall be followed when an owner of any tract or parcel of land desires to subdivide a tract or parcel into two (2) or more lots that create the need for the dedication of public right-of-way for new streets, road improvements to existing streets or the construction of off-site utility improvements and the subdivision does not comply with the criteria for minor subdivisions. 
C.  Sketch Plan 
1.  Purpose: The purpose of a Sketch Plan is to ensure proposed land uses, intensities, and street layouts in multi-phase development are consistent with this Code the Comprehensive Plan and can demonstrate that the development has a plan to provide utility extensions at the applicant's expense. 
2.  Applicability: A Sketch Plan is required for any major subdivision. A Sketch Plan shall show all contiguous land holdings of the applicant and establish a phasing plan. 
3.  Application and Procedures: The applicant shall file an application with the Planning Department. 
4.  Notification of Subdivision: 
a.  School District: The Planning Director shall notify the superintendent of the school district that such plan has been submitted and is available for inspection. The notice shall give the date, time and place of the TRC meeting. 
b.  Other Comments: The TRC may request comments from any person or agency directly affected by the proposed development. 
5.  Review Criteria: A Sketch Plan shall be reviewed for: 
a.  Consistency with the goals and objectives of the Comprehensive Plan; 
b.  Consistency with applicable zoning of the property; 
c.  Consistency of public improvements within the development and surrounding area; 
d.  Availability and adequacy of required public utilities and services necessary to serve the project, including but not limited to, sanitary and storm sewers, water, electrical, police, fire, roads and pedestrian accessibility; 
e.  Capacity or safety of the street network influenced by the use; 
f.  Adverse environmental impacts generated by the project; and 
g.  Other applicable provisions of this Code. 
6.  Decision Maker: The TRC and Planning Board shall determine whether the development meets the review criteria and shall recommend approval, approval with conditions or denial to the City Council. The City Council shall approve, approve with conditions, or deny the Sketch Plan. 
7.  Exceptions: Whenever the tract to be subdivided is of such unusual size or shape or is surrounded by such development or unusual conditions that the strict application of the requirements of this Code would result in real difficulties or substantial hardship or injustice, the Board of Adjustment may recommend and the City Council may approve variances from the strict application of the lot standards for this code so the property may be developed in a reasonable manner, provided the public health, safety and welfare are protected and the general intent and spirit of this Code are preserved. 
8.  Effect of Approval and Validity: 
a.  Approval of a Sketch Plan constitutes acceptance of the type, arrangement, and intensity of land use; the classification and arrangement of streets indicated; the proposed phasing plan; and the nature of utility service proposed. 
b.  Approved Sketch Plans shall not expire, provided development proceeds in accordance with the phasing plan. Once development lags one (1) year behind the phasing plan, or a period of two (2) years elapses prior to approval of a Preliminary Plat, the Sketch Plan shall automatically expire. The Planning Board may approve extensions, provided the Sketch Plan conforms to current requirements. 
c.  Sketch Plan approval does not ensure approval of a Preliminary Plat involving a substantially different concept or failing to meet these regulations, and approval does not provide any vesting of development rights or any assurance that permits of any kind will be issued. If the Preliminary Plat deviates from the Sketch Plan, the applicant shall secure approval of a revised Sketch Plan in accordance with this section. 
D.  Preliminary Plat: 
1.  Purpose: Preliminary Plat approval allows the TRC to review all substantive aspects of a proposed subdivision and impose such conditions as will be necessary to ensure compliance with applicable regulations.

The City Council, at its sole discretion, may choose to revert the zoning, retain the existing zoning or grant a limited extension of the zoning for lapsed uses. 
Section 2.07 - Conditional Use Overlay Districts 
A.  Purpose 
    The Conditional Use Overlay Districts included herein allow for the consideration of certain uses that, because of their nature or scale, have particular impacts on both the immediate area and the community as a whole and are created or established for selected criteria as indicated in the applicability section below. The development of these uses cannot be predetermined and controlled by general district regulations. In addition, circumstances arise when a general zoning district designation would not be appropriate for a certain property, but specific uses permitted under the district would be consistent with the objectives of this section. To accommodate those situations, this section establishes the conditional use overlay process. A conditional use overlay district is not intended for securing speculative zoning for a proposal but rather is based on a firm development proposal. 
B.  Authorized Uses 
    Within a Conditional Use Overlay District only those uses shown in Table 3-1 shall be permitted, and all requirements of the underlying zoning district shall be met. In addition, no use shall be permitted unless authorized by the City Council. A conditional use overlay district shall specify the use authorized, location on the property of the use, number of dwelling units, location and extent of supporting facilities such as parking lots, driveways and access streets, location and extent of buffer and other special purpose areas, timing of development, location and extent of rights-of-way and areas to be dedicated for public use, and such matters as the applicant may propose as conditions. 
C.  Applicability 
    Except as herein provided, petitions to establish a Conditional Use Overlay District must be submitted and will be processed in accordance with the provisions in this Section. 
D.  Application Requirements 
    All applications shall include a conceptual site plan, drawn to scale, and supporting text that, if approved, will become part of the amendment. The Site Plan shall include any supporting information and text that specifies the actual use or uses intended for the property and any rules, regulations and conditions that in addition to all predetermined ordinance requirements, will govern the development and use of the property. The applicant shall, at a minimum, include each of the items listed below. The Site Plan, including the information detailed below, shall constitute part of the petition for rezoning to a Conditional Use Overlay District: 
1.  A vicinity map showing the property's general location in relation to major streets, railroads and waterways. 
2.  A drawing of the parcel, including the parcel identification number. If only rezoning a portion of a parcel, a plat must be provided, drawn to scale, showing the bearings and distances of the portion requested. 
3.  All existing easements, reservations and rights-of-way on the property(ies) in question. 
4.  Delineation of areas within the regulatory floodplain as shown on the official Flood Hazard Boundary Maps for the City of Statesville and delineation of watershed boundaries labeled with their respective classifications and impervious calculations. 
5.  For residential uses, the number of units and a general outline of the area where the structures will be located. For nonresidential uses, the approximate square footage of all structures and an outline of the area where the structure will be located. 
6.  Traffic, parking and circulation plans showing the proposed locations and arrangement of parking spaces and access points to adjacent streets including typical parking space dimensions and locations along with typical street cross sections. This shall include all existing and proposed points of access to public streets. 
7.  All proposed setbacks, buffers, screening and landscaping proposed by the applicant and required by the UDC. 
8.  Generalized information on the number, height, size and location of structures. 
9.  The proposed phasing of the project. 
10.  The proposed number, location, type and size of all signs. 
11.  The location and description of any outdoor lighting. 
E.  Additional Information 
    When dealing with the Conditional Use Overlay District process, it may be desirable to request additional information in order to evaluate a proposed use and its relationship to the surrounding area. Therefore, the Planning Board and/or City Council may request additional information in addition to that required above, as they deem necessary. 
F.  Public Input Meeting 
    Before a public meeting may be held on a petition for a Conditional Use Overlay District, the applicant shall file a written report detailing at least one (1) community meeting held by the applicant. The community meeting shall be held prior to any recommendation by staff and prior to the Planning Board's consideration of the request. The following procedures shall be met: 
1.  Based on the perceived impact of the proposal, the affected property owners shall be notified by the applicant. Such notice shall be mailed to said property owners not less than ten (10) days prior to the date of the public input meeting and a certification of this mailing shall be submitted as part of the required report. The notice shall contain information regarding the time and location of the public input meeting as well as a description of the proposal. 
2.  The report shall include, among other items, a listing of the following: 
a.  Those persons and organizations contacted about the meeting; 
b.  The manner, date, time and location of the meeting; 
c.  A roster of persons in attendance at the meeting; 
d.  A summary of issues discussed at the meeting; and 
e.  A description of any changes to the rezoning petition as a result of the meeting. 
G.  Review 
    In evaluating an application for the establishment of a Conditional Use Overlay District, it is appropriate for the Planning Board and City Council to consider the following: 
1.  Adherence to the general policies and objectives of the adopted land use plan, particularly in relation to the proposed site and surrounding area. 
2.  The potential impacts on the surrounding area, including but not limited to the absolute certainty the specific use(s), traffic, erosion, land values and the compatibility of land use activities. 
3.  Spot zoning issues: 
a.  Size of tract; 
b.  Compatibility with adopted plans; 
c.  Public benefits and detriments of proposed rezoning; and 
d.  The relationship between the proposed use and current use of adjacent properties. 
H.  Conditions for Approval 
    In approving a petition for the reclassification of a piece of property to a Conditional Use Overlay District, the Planning Board may recommend and the City Council may of its own accord require that reasonable and appropriate conditions be attached to approval of the petition. Any such conditions shall be limited to those that address the conformance of the development plan and use of the site to City ordinances and adopted land development plans. Conditions should address the impacts reasonably expected to be generated by the development or use of the site. The applicant shall have a reasonable opportunity to consider and respond to any proposed conditions prior to final action by the City Council. Only those conditions mutually agreed upon by the City Council and the applicant, with input from the public, may be incorporated into the Conditional Use Overlay District. 
I.  Effect of Approval 
    If a petition for a Conditional Use Overlay District is approved, the development and use of the property shall be governed by: 
1.  The standards and regulations applicable to the district's zoning classification; 
2.  The approved site plan for the district; 
3.  Any additional approved rules, regulations and conditions, all of which shall constitute the zoning regulations for the approved district; and 
4.  All general and additional rules, regulations and conditions adopted as part of the Conditional Use Overlay District shall be an amendment to the UDC and the Zoning Map. 
J.  Zoning Map Designation 
    Following approval of the petition for a Conditional Use Overlay District, the subject property shall be identified on the Zoning Map by the appropriate district designation followed by the letters "CU." 
K.  Review of Site Plans 
    Detailed site plans shall be reviewed by staff if said plans are consistent with the rezoning plan or are prepared in coordination with minor changes or modifications; major changes shall be reviewed by the Planning Board and City Council. 
L.  Determination, Major Changes Requiring an Amendment 
    Before making a determination as to whether a proposed action is an amendment based upon a major change, the Planning Director shall review the record of the proceedings on the original application for the approval of the Conditional Use Overlay District. 
1.  A change in a specific or general use category shall constitute a new application. 
2.  The Planning Director shall use the following criteria in determining whether a proposed change is an amendment constituting a major change to the approved Conditional Use Overlay District: 
a.  An increase in intensity of use, meaning an increase in useable floor area by more than ten percent (10%) or an increase in the number of dwelling or lodging units by more than ten percent (10%) or an increase in outside land area devoted to sales, displays or demonstrations; 
b.  Any change in use resulting in a more intensive use; 
c.  Any change in parking areas resulting in an increase or reduction of ten percent (10%) or more in the number of spaces approved by the City Council; 
d.  Structural alterations significantly affecting the basic size, as shown on the approved plan; 
e.  A ten percent (10%) or more decrease in the amount or location of open space, recreation facilities or landscape screening; 
f.  Substantial changes in pedestrian or vehicular access or circulation. 
3.  If the Planning Director determines that the proposed action requires an amendment, he/she shall require the applicant to file a request for approval of the amendment. Such request shall be submitted to the Planning Board and City Council under the process described in this Article. 
M.  Minor Changes and Modifications 
    The Planning Director shall have the delegated authority to approve minor changes in the Conditional Use Overlay District provided they are in harmony with the action of the City Council. A minor change shall mean: 
1.  Any change in location or any increase in the size or number of signs; 
2.  Any change in use resulting in a less intensive use; 
3.  Increases in the intensity of nonresidential development by no more than ten percent (10%) or one thousand (1,000) square feet, whichever is less; 
4.  Any change(s) that increases the density of residential development by no more than ten percent (10%); 
5.  Any time an applicant agrees to impose standards that are more stringent than those previously approved by the City Council; or 
6.  All other changes or modifications to the Conditional Use Overlay District shall be treated the same as amendments to the UDC or the Zoning Map. 
N.  Review of Approval of a Conditional Use Overlay District 
    It is intended that property shall be reclassified to a Conditional Use Overlay District only in the event a property is intended to be developed. Therefore, no sooner than eighteen (18) months after the date of approval of the petition, the Planning Director shall examine the progress made toward developing the property in accordance with the approved petition and any conditions attached. If the Planning Director determines that progress has not been made in accordance with the approved petition and conditions, the Planning Director shall forward to the City Council a report which may recommend that the property revert back to the previous zoning classification. 
O.  Transfer of Ownership 
    The requirements of the approved conditional use overlay district shall be binding upon the owners, their heirs and assigns and future owners until such time as the City may release such limitation on the use of the subject property under the procedures provided herein. 
Section 2.08 - Vested Development Rights 
A.  Purpose 
    The purpose of this section is to implement the provisions of G.S. 160A-385.1 pursuant to which a statutory zoning vested right is established upon the approval of a site specific development plan. 
B.  Definitions 
1.  Landowner - Any owner of a legal or equitable interest in real property, including the heirs, devisees, successors, assigns, and personal representative of such owner. The landowner may allow a person holding a valid option to purchase to act as his agent or representative for purposes of submitting a proposed site specific development plan in the manner allowed by this code. 
2.  Property - All real property subject to zoning regulations and restrictions of the City of Statesville. 
3.  Site Specific Development Plan - In general, a plan which has been submitted to the City by a landowner describing with reasonable certainty the type and intensity of use for a specific parcel(s) of property. More specifically, a site specific development plan must contain, as a minimum, the information called for in Section 2.08 C. 
4.  Zoning Vested Right - The right, pursuant to G.S. 160A-385.1, to undertake and complete the development and use of the property under the terms and conditions of an approved site specific development plan. 
C.  Submission of a Site Specific Development Plan 
    To apply for a zoning vested right, a landowner shall first submit to the Planning Department a site specific development plan. Unless otherwise expressly provided by the City, such a plan shall include: 
1.  Name, address, and phone number of the property owner (or his agent) and the tax parcel number(s) of the property. 
2.  A boundary survey and vicinity map, showing the property's total acreage, zoning classification, general location in relation to adjoining streets, railroads and/or waterways; date and north arrow; scale 1" = 50' maximum. 
3.  Existing land uses of all adjoining properties. 
4.  Proposed use of all land and structures, their approximate completion time for the project or phase. 
5.  Proposed location and number of all structures, their approximate exterior dimensions. 
6.  A description of all screening and buffering as required by this code or proposed by the applicant. 
7.  All existing and proposed easements, reservations and rights-of-way. 
8.  Proposed phasing, if any, and approximate completion time for the project or phase. 
9.  Delineation of areas within the regulatory floodplain as shown on official Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) Flood Hazard Boundary Maps for the City and extraterritorial areas within the City's zoning jurisdiction. 
10.  Traffic, parking and circulation plans, showing the proposed location and arrangement and size of parking spaces and ingress and egress to adjacent streets. The driveway/street cuts must be approved by the local District Highway Engineer's Office of the North Carolina Department of Transportation or the City Public Works Director for all street connections made. 
D.  Processing Application for a Zoning Vested Right 
    An application for a zoning vested right shall be processed in a like manner for a zoning amendment. After having obtained a recommendation from the Planning Board and having conducted a public hearing on subject application in which proper notice therefore was given, the City Council shall determine whether or not to approve the site specific development plan and to accord the vested right. The City Council may approve the site specific development plan if it has evaluated the application and has determined that: 
1.  The use meets all required specifications of this code. 
2.  The use will not materially endanger the public health or safety and will not substantially injure the value of adjoining property if located where proposed. City Council may stipulate certain terms and conditions as a prerequisite to approval of the site specific development plan for assurance in this regard. 
3.  The effect of the City Council's approval of a site specific development plan shall be to vest such site plan for a period of two (2) years from the date of approval. If the landowner requests, however, the City Council may approve a vesting period not to exceed five (5) years from the date of approval. The vesting of any site plan beyond a two-year period may only be authorized by the City Council where it has found that due to (1) the sizing and phasing of the development; or (2) the level of investment; or (3) the need for the development; or (4) economic cycles; or (5) market conditions, building permits for all phases of the development cannot be secured within two (2) years. 
E.  Establishment and Termination of a Zoning Vested Right 
    A zoning vested right shall be deemed established upon City Council approval of a site specific development plan. A vested right shall confer upon the landowner the right to undertake and complete the development and use of said property under the terms and conditions of the site specific development plans as provided for in this section. 
    Approval of a site specific development plan with the condition that a variance be obtained shall not confer a zoning vested right until the necessary variance is obtained. 
    A zoning vested right is not a personal right, but shall attach to and run with the applicable property. After approval of a site specific development plan, all successors to the original landowner shall be entitled to exercise such right while applicable. 
    A vested right once established as herein provided, shall preclude any zoning action by the City which would change, alter, impair, prevent, diminish or otherwise delay the development or use of the property as set forth in the approved site specific development plan except under the following conditions: 
1.  The affected landowner provides written consent to the City of his desire to terminate the vested right; or 
2.  The City determines, after having advertised and held a public hearing, that material or man-made hazards exist on or in the immediate vicinity of the property which poses a serious threat to the public health, safety and welfare if the project were to proceed as indicated in the site specific development plan; or 
3.  The City determines, after having advertised and held a public hearing, that the landowner or his representative intentionally supplied inaccurate information or made material misrepresentations which made a difference in the approval by the City of the site specific development plan; or 
4.  Upon the enactment or promulgation of a State of Federal law or regulation which precludes development as contemplated in the site specific development plan. In such case the City may, after having advertised and conducted a public hearing, modify the affected provisions upon a finding that the change in State or Federal law has a fundamental effect on the plan. 
F.  Review of Conferred Vested Rights 
    Once a vested right is granted to a particular site specific development plan, nothing in this section shall preclude the City from conducting subsequent reviews and approvals to ensure compliance with the terms and conditions of the original approval, provided such reviews and approvals are not inconsistent with the original approval. 
    The vested right resulting from the approval of a site specific development plan may be revoked as provided for in this section. In addition a revocation may occur if the City Council determines that the landowner has failed to comply with the terms and conditions of the approval or with any other applicable portion of the this code. The vested right shall otherwise expire at the end of the approval period established by the City Council. 
G.  Voluntary Annexation 
    A petition for annexation filed with the City under G.S. 160A-31 or G.S. 160A-58.1 shall contain a signed statement declaring whether or not any zoning vested right with respect to the properties subject to the petition has been established under the G.S. 160A-385.1 or G.S. 153A-344.1. A statement that declares that no zoning vested right has been established under G.S. 160A-385.1 or G.S. 153A-344.1, or the failure to sign a statement declaring whether or not a zoning vested right has been established, shall be binding on the landowner and any such zoning vested right shall be terminated. 
H.  Limitations 
    The establishment of a zoning vested right shall not preclude the City from establishing and putting into place overlay zoning that imposes additional requirements but does not affect the allowable type or intensity of use, or ordinances or regulations that are general in nature and are applicable to all property subject to land use regulations by the City including, but not limited to, building, fire, plumbing, electrical, and mechanical codes. Upon the expiration, termination, or revocation of a vested right, all applicable new or amended regulations shall become pertinent to that property subject to a site specific development plan. 
I.  Statement of Inclusion 
    Noting in this section is intended or shall be deemed to create any vested right other than those established pursuant to G.S. 160A-385.1. 
Section 2.09 - Planned Unit Developments 
A.  Purpose

b.  City Council: The City Council shall review the Concept Plan, and Planning Board's recommendation at a public hearing, and approve, approve with conditions, or deny the plan. The City Council may require the dedication of perimeter rights-of-way as a condition of approval. 
D.  Final Development Plan 
1.  Purpose: The Final Development Plan provides greater detail about a development, and together with the development schedule and Final Plat, shall act as the blueprint for a Planned Development. 
2.  Application and Procedure: The applicant shall file an application with the Planning Department, which shall be reviewed by the staff prior to forwarding the application to the City Council for action. An electronic file shall be submitted to the Director of Electric Utilities. 
3.  Review Criteria: The Final Development Plan shall be reviewed for substantial conformance with the Concept Plan, and the review criteria for rezonings and major subdivisions. Substantial conformance means the application: 
a.  Does not increase the number of dwelling units or non-residential square footage; 
b.  Maintains the mix of residential and non-residential development; 
c.  Neither reduces nor relocates the area set aside for common open space; 
d.  Substantially increases non-residential floor area; or 
e.  Substantially increases lot coverage or building height. 
4.  Decision Makers: The City Council shall review the Final Development Plan, within thirty (30) days following receipt of a complete application. The Council shall approve, approve with conditions, or deny the plan, within forty-five (45) days of its initial consideration. 
5.  Recording: The Final Development Plan, a certified copy of the ordinance approving the plan, and any other related documents shall be recorded in the County Recorder's Office within forty-five (45) days of approval by the City Council. 
6.  Amendments to the Final Development Plan: No changes shall be made in the approved Final Development Plan unless in conformance with the following requirements. 
a.  Minor Change: The Planning Director may authorize minor changes under the following conditions:

(c)  changes in the location of sidewalks and pathways, provided that pedestrian circulation elements remain interconnected; 
(d)  reorientation, but not complete relocation, of structures; 
(e)  changes that will not impact properties or uses outside of and adjacent to the Planned Development; or 
(f)  redesign of open space that does not decrease its recreational, buffering, or environmental benefits. 
(2)  Prohibitions: No minor change authorized by this Section may: 
(a)  change the permitted uses or character of development; 
(b)  increase lot coverage; 
(c)  increase density or intensity of use; 
(d)  increase demand for traffic circulation and public utilities; 
(e)  decrease public or private open space; or

Major Change: All other changes to the approved Final Development Plan shall be deemed "major" and shall be approved only by the Council after review of a revised Final Development Plan and/or Map. No major change may be made in the approved Final Development Plan unless the applicant establishes such amendments are required due to: 
(1)  changes in conditions that occurred after the Final Development Plan was approved; 
(2)  changes in the development policy of the community; or 
(3)  conditions that were reasonably unforeseen at the time the Final Development Plan was approved. 
c.  Recording of Changes and Amendments: Any approved changes shall be recorded as amendments to the previously recorded Plan and/or Map. 
E.  Development According to the Final Development Plan and Final Plat 
    No building permit shall be issued on any site unless a site plan has been submitted and approved and such site plan conforms to the conditions of the adopted Final Development Plan and Final Plat. 
F.  Transfer of Ownership 
    The requirements, restrictions, conditions and provisions of the approved Planned Development Concept Plan, Final Development Plan, and Final Plat shall be binding upon the owners, their heirs and assigns and future owners until such time as the City may release such limitation on the use of the subject property under the procedures provided herein. 
G.  Expiration of a Planned Unit Development 
    The approval of the Final Development Plan shall be null and void unless an Incremental Master Development Plan for at least the initial phase has been submitted for review and approval within three (3) years after the date of approval of the PUD application.

Section 2.14 - Certificate of Appropriateness 
A.  Purpose 
    In order to safeguard the heritage of the locality, the City of Statesville, under the authority of State statute (G.S. 160A, Article 19, Part 3C), sets forth these regulations to facilitate the preservation and conservation of historic properties. Historic properties subject to the regulations of this Section are: (1) all tracts of land situated within a locally designated historic district and (2) all individual tracts of land which have been locally designated a historic landmark. 
    Historic properties shall be an additional zone overlapping any of the zoning districts established with this ordinance. Historic districts shall be delineated on the zoning map to distinguish that portion of any zoning district to which the historic district designation shall apply. Historic landmarks shall be denoted on the zoning map with common call letters followed by a sequential reference number to be assigned each landmark (i.e., HL-1; HL-2; HL-3; etc.). The requirements for historic properties shall be additional to other zoning district requirements and when in conflict with underlying requirements, the requirements for historic properties shall prevail. 
B.  Applicability 
1.  Certificate of Appropriateness Required. No exterior portion of any building or other structure (including masonry walls, fences, light fixtures, steps and pavement, or other appurtenant features) nor above ground utility structure nor any type of outdoor advertising sign shall be erected, altered, restored or moved on historic property until after an application for a Certificate of Appropriateness as to exterior architectural features has been submitted to and approved by the Historic Preservation Commission. Exterior architectural features shall include the architectural style, general design and general arrangement of the exterior of a building or other structure, including the kind and texture of the building material, and the type and style of all windows, doors, light fixtures, signs and other appurtenant fixtures. In the case of outdoor advertising signs, exterior architectural features shall be construed to mean the style, material, size and location of all such signs. 
2.  Ground Disturbance. The Historic Preservation Commission's review of requests for certificates of appropriateness may also consider whether ground disturbance resulting from proposed repair or replacement or construction of foundations, landscaping activities, or moving of buildings and structures may affect any archaeological sites or materials. 
3.  Conformity Required. A certificate of appropriateness shall be required whether or not a building permit is required. Any such building permits or such other permits not issued in conformity with this section shall be invalid. 
4.  Demolition and Repair. No building or structure situated on historic property, having been designated as such by the Statesville City Council, shall be demolished or otherwise removed until the owner thereof has received a certificate of appropriateness for the demolition or removal. 
5.  Maintenance and Repair. The ordinary maintenance or repair of any exterior architectural feature of a historic property which does not involve a change in design, material, or outer appearance thereof, shall not require a certificate of appropriateness. 
6.  Unsafe or Dangerous Conditions. The construction, reconstruction, alteration, restoration or demolition of any exterior features, which the building inspector or similar official shall certify is required for public safety because of an unsafe or dangerous condition, shall not be prevented by the requirements pertaining to historic properties. 
7.  Interior Review. Jurisdiction of the commission over interior spaces shall be limited to specific interior features of architectural, artistic, or historical significance in publicly owned landmarks; and of privately owned historic landmarks for which consent for interior review has been given by the owner. Consent of an owner for interior review shall bind future owners and/or successors in title, provided such consent has been filed in the office of the register of deeds and is located and indexed according to the name of the owner of the property in the grantee and grantor indexes. The landmark designation shall specify the interior features to be reviewed and the specific nature of the Commission's jurisdiction over the interior. 
8.  Construction on Public Property. As provided for in subsection E.10 of this section. 
C.  Application Requirements 
    An application for a Certificate of Appropriateness shall be filed in the office of the Planning Department.

1.  Height. The maximum height of all new buildings permitted in an a historic district shall be thirty-five (35) feet unless the HPC authorizes a height above thirty-five (35) feet. However, such authorized height shall not exceed ten percent (10%) of the average height of existing adjacent buildings. Chimneys, steeples, spires, cupolas and the like, not intended for human occupancy, shall be reviewed on an individual basis and shall be subject to the requirements stipulated by the certificate of appropriateness issued for that particular project. 
2.  Walls of Continuity. Physical ingredients such as brick walls, wrought iron fences, evergreen landscape masses, building facades, or combination of these, shall be compatible to the character of the historic district. 
3.  Height-width Proportion of Front Facades. The ratio between the height and width of the structure shall be compatible to those historically significant structures on properties (i.e., lot, parcel or tract) located within the historic district and within two hundred (200) feet of the subject property. 
4.  Height-width Proportion of Openings. The relationship of width to height of windows and doors should be compatible with those properties within the historic district and within two hundred (200) feet of the subject property in all directions. 
5.  Rhythm of Building Spacing. The recurrent building masses to spaces between them shall be compatible to those properties within the historic district which are within two hundred (200) feet of the subject property in all directions. 
6.  Relationship of Materials. Within the historic district, the predominant material shall be brick, stone, stucco, wood siding or such other material that shall be compatible to those properties within the historic district and within two hundred (200) feet of the subject property in all directions. 
7.  Relationship of Textures. The predominant texture may be smooth (stucco) or wrought (brick) or horizontal wood siding, or such other texture as shall be compatible to those properties within the historic district and within two hundred (200) feet of the subject property in all directions.

12.  Directional Expression of Front Elevation. The direction which the front elevation of the structure takes must be found on other properties within the historic district and within two hundred (200) feet of the subject property in all directions. 
13.  Relationship of Ground Cover. Ground cover or paving such as brick pavers, cobblestone, granite blocks or other such materials shall be compatible with those properties within the historic district and within two hundred (200) feet of the subject property in all directions. 
14.  Archaeological Properties and Resources. When major ground-disturbing activity is proposed, the HPC may call for an investigation of the site to determine if archaeological resources exist and what impact the activity may have on those resources. 
E.  Decision Makers 
1.  The Historic Preservation Commission shall receive applications for certificates of appropriateness for major works. The Commission shall review such applications according to the criteria to determine appropriateness and to the illustrated portfolio appendix of the historic preservation commission rules of procedure. After said review the Commission shall approve or disapprove such application. The Commission shall not consider interior arrangement, except as specified in Section 2.14 B.7. and shall take no action except for the purpose of preventing the construction, reconstruction, alteration, restoration or moving of buildings, structures, appurtenant fixtures or outdoor advertising signs upon historic properties which would be incongruous with the historic aspects of that property. 
2.  Prior to issuance or denial of a certificate of appropriateness, the Commission shall take such action as may reasonably be required to inform the owners of any property likely to be materially affected by the application and shall give the applicant and such owners an opportunity to be heard. "Notice to such owners" shall include a written notice of proposal to all of the individuals, firms, or corporations owning property adjacent to both sides and rear and the property in front of (across the street from) the property for which an application for a certificate of appropriateness has been received by the Historic Preservation Commission. 
3.  All applications for certificates of appropriateness shall be reviewed and acted upon within a reasonable time, not to exceed one hundred eighty (180) days from the date the application for a certificate of appropriateness is filed, as defined by the commission's rules of procedure. As part of its review, the commission may view the premises and seek the advice of the Division of Archives and History or such other expert advice as it may deem necessary under the circumstances. 
4.  In cases where the Commission deems it necessary, the Commission may hold a public hearing concerning an application for a certificate of appropriateness. 
5.  The Historic Preservation Commission's final action on an application for a certificate of appropriateness shall be by the passage of a motion to take one (1) of the following actions: 
(a)  Approve the application for a certificate of appropriateness as proposed; 
(b)  Approve the application for a certificate of appropriateness subject to specific conditions and/or modification of the proposal presented in the application for a certificate of appropriateness; or 
(c)  Disapprove the application for a certificate of appropriateness as proposed or modified. 
6.  Upon passage of a motion to approve an application, with or without modification, the Historic Preservation Commission shall issue a certificate of appropriateness. A certificate of appropriateness shall be valid for a period of six (6) months from the date of issuance for the purpose of obtaining a building permit or other permit for the purpose of construction or altering structures. The certificate of appropriateness shall expire six (6) months from the date of issuance if: 
(a)  The recipient has not applied for any necessary building or zoning permit by then; or 
(b)  If no such permit is required, if the work has not begun by then. 
7.  Compliance with the certificate of appropriateness shall be determined by the planning department. Failure to comply with a certificate of appropriateness shall be a violation of the zoning ordinance. The discontinuance of work or the lack of progress toward achieving compliance with a certificate of appropriateness for a period of six (6) months shall be considered as a failure to comply with a certificate of appropriateness. 
8.  An appeal to the Zoning Board of Adjustment from the Commission action in granting or denying the certificate shall be in the nature of certiorari. The Board may not reopen the case but must make its decision solely on the record sent to it by the Historic Preservation Commission and appeal from Board of Adjustment/Judicial review. 
9.  In the event that the Historic Preservation Commission, in considering an application for a certificate of appropriateness, shall find that a building or structure for which a building permit is requested is to restore or reconstruct a building or structure which existed at the same location but does not meet zoning requirements, said building or structure may be authorized to be restored or reconstructed at the same location where the original building or structure was located, provided the Zoning Board of Adjustment authorizes such as a special exception and no use other than that permitted in the district in which such is located is made of said property. Such conditions as may be attached to the Historic Preservation Commission approval and those conditions as may be set by the Zoning Board of Adjustment shall be included in any certificate of appropriateness related thereto. Before the restoration or reconstruction may begin, the Commission shall consider whether archaeological investigation around the existing building or structure is warranted, and may make recommendation that such investigation be conducted. 
10.  In passing upon applications for certificates of appropriateness concerning any porches, steps, posts, fences, walls or other items extending over, on, or within public rights-of-way, the historic preservation commission shall find the particular feature to be necessary for the restoration, reconstruction or maintenance thereof and will not impede or block pedestrian traffic or constitute a hazard to public safety. Such findings shall be transmitted to the City Council for consideration in authorizing or denying such encroachments into public rights-of-way. 
11.  In addition to any other condition the Council may make regarding such authorization, any items restored, reconstructed or maintained on, over, or within a public sidewalk, public alley area or other such public right-of-way shall be the responsibility of the owner, and the owner's restoration, reconstruction or maintenance of any such item within such area shall constitute the owner's agreement to protect and hold the City of Statesville blameless against any and all liability, cost, damage or expense suffered by the City as a result of or growing out of the restoration, reconstruction or maintenance thereof. Such items, so approved, may be lawfully restored, reconstructed or maintained. Further provided that at the lowest point, any such item projecting over any sidewalk, public alley or other such public right-of-way shall be at least nine (9) feet above the sidewalk immediately below. 
F.  Demolition or Removal 
    No structure within a historic district may be demolished without a permit issued by the City Council. If the Historic Preservation Commission has formally voted to recommend designation of a property as a landmark or designation of an area as a district, and final designation has not been made by the City Council, the demolition of any building, structure, or site located on the proposed landmark or in the proposed district may be delayed by the Historic Preservation Commission for a period of up to one hundred eight (180) days or until the City Council takes final action on the designation, whichever occurs first. 
    An application for a certificate of appropriateness and a permit to demolish or remove a building, structure or site shall be filed or processed as all other applications received. The Historic Preservation Commission shall hear the request and within forty-five (45) days of the hearing recommend to the City Council for or against the application. The City Council shall consider the following in deciding whether to issue a permit: 
1.  The recommendation of the Historic Preservation Commission; 
2.  The location of the structure within the historic district; 
3.  The state of repair of the structure; 
4.  The architectural and historical significance of the structure; 
5.  The owner's plans with regards to replacing the structure; 
6.  The overall impact of the structure on the historic district; and 
7.  The economic impact of the denial of the permit upon the owner of the structure. 
    The City Council may, as a condition of issuing a permit for demolition, require the owner to replace the structure to be demolished with another structure that meets plans submitted by the owner and approved by the City Council. The City Council may establish a reasonable period of time for the owner to replace the demolished structure. 
G.  Powers, Generally 
    Nothing contained in this ordinance shall profit, impair or limit in any way the power of the City of Statesville (at its own initiative or request of the Historic Preservation Commission) to prevent the construction, reconstruction, alteration, restoration or removal of buildings, structures, appurtenant fixtures or outdoor signs upon historic properties in violation of the provisions of this ordinance, and the enforcement of any remedy provided herein shall not prevent the enforcement of any other remedy or remedies provided herein or in other ordinances or laws.

9.  Heaving, subsidence, or cracking of foundations, sidewalks, steps or pathways; 
10.  Deterioration of fences, gates and accessory structures; 
11.  Deterioration of any exterior feature so as to create or permit the creation of any hazardous or unsafe conditions to life, health or other property. 
I.  Petition and Action 
    The Historic Preservation Commission may file a petition listing specific defects with the Director of Planning or his/her designee requesting that the Director of Planning or his/her designee under the following procedures require the correction of deterioration or making of repairs to any historic landmark or structure located within a local historic district so that such structure shall be preserved and protected in accordance with the purposes of Section 2.14 B. of this Code. 
1.  Whenever a petition is filed with the Director of Planning or his/her designee charging that a structure is undergoing demolition by neglect, the Director of Planning or his/her designee shall, if the Director of Planning or his/her designee's preliminary investigation discloses a basis for such charges, within seven (7) days issue and cause to be served upon the owner and/or such other person who may have legal possession, custody and control thereof, as the same may be determined by reasonable diligence, a complaint stating the charges in that respect and containing a notice that a hearing will be held before the Director of Planning or his/her designee not less than thirty (30) days nor more than sixty (60) days after the servicing of such complaints; that the owner and/or parties in interest shall be given a right to answer to give testimony at the place and time fixed in the complaint; that the Commission shall also be given notice of the hearing and that the rules of evidence prevailing in courts of law or equity shall not be controlling in hearings before the Director of Planning or his/her designee. The purpose of the hearing is to receive evidence concerning the charge of deterioration and to ascertain whether the owner and/or other parties in interest wishes to petition the Commission for a claim of undue economic hardship. 
2.  If after such notice and hearing, the Director of Planning or his/her designee determines that the structure is undergoing demolition by neglect because it is deteriorating, or if its condition is contributing to deterioration, according to the standards of Section 2.14 H., the Director of Planning or his/her designee shall state in writing the findings of fact in support of such determination and shall issue and cause to be served upon the owner and/or other parties in interest therein an order to repair within the time specified those elements of the structure that are deteriorating, contributing to deterioration, or deteriorated. In the event that the owner and/or other parties in interest wish to petition for a claim of undue economic hardship, the Director of Planning or his/her designee's order shall be stayed until after the Commission's determination in accordance with the procedures of Section 2.14 K. 
J.  Methods of Service 
    Complaints or orders issued by the Director of Planning or his/her designee shall be served upon persons either personally or by registered or certified mail; but if the whereabouts of such persons are unknown and the same cannot be ascertained by the Director of Planning or his/her designee in the exercise of reasonable diligence, and the Director of Planning or his/her designee shall make an affidavit to that effect, stating the steps taken to determine and locate the person(s) in interest, then the serving of such complaint or order may be made by publishing the same once each week for two (2) successive weeks in a newspaper generally circulated within the City.

1.  The Board of Adjustment as established by the City of Statesville, hereinafter referred to as the "appeal board", shall hear and decide requests for variances from the requirements of this ordinance. 
2.  Any person aggrieved by the decision of the appeal board may appeal such decision to the Court, as provided in Chapter 7A of the North Carolina General Statutes. 
3.  Variances may be issued for: 
(a)  the repair or rehabilitation of historic structures upon the determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a historic structure and that the variance is the minimum necessary to preserve the historic character and design of the structure; 
(b)  functionally dependent facilities if determined to meet the definition as stated in Article 1 of this ordinance, provided provisions of Section 2.25 R.9. (b), (c), and (e) have been satisfied, and such facilities are protected by methods that minimize flood damages during the base flood and create no additional threats to public safety; or 
(c)  any other type of development, provided it meets the requirements of this Section. 
4.  In passing upon variances, the appeal board shall consider all technical evaluations, all relevant factors, all standards specified in other sections of this ordinance, and: 
(a)  the danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the injury of others; 
(b)  the danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion damage; 
(c)  the susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner; 
(d)  the importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to the community; 
(e)  the necessity to the facility of a waterfront location as defined in this ordinance, as a functionally dependent facility, where applicable; 
(f)  the availability of alternative locations, not subject to flooding or erosion damage, for the proposed use;

(k)  the costs of providing governmental services during and after flood conditions including maintenance and repair of public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical and water systems, and streets and bridges. 
5.  A written report addressing each of the above factors shall be submitted with the application for a variance. 
6.  Upon consideration of the factors listed above and the purposes of this ordinance, the appeal board may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes and objectives of this ordinance. 
7.  Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice specifying the difference between the Base Flood Elevation (BFE) and the elevation to which the structure is to be built and that such construction below the Base Flood Elevation increases risks to life and property, and that the issuance of a variance to construct a structure below the Base Flood Elevation will result in increased premium rates for flood insurance up to $25.00 per $100.00 of insurance coverage. Such notification shall be maintained with a record of all variance actions, including justification for their issuance. 
8.  The Floodplain Administrator shall maintain the records of all appeal actions and report any variances to the Federal Emergency Management Agency and the State of North Carolina upon request. 
9.  Conditions for Variances: 
(a)  Variances shall not be issued when the variance will make the structure in violation of other Federal, State, or local laws, regulations, or ordinances. 
(b)  Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway or non-encroachment area if the variance would result in any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge. 
(c)  Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief. 
(d)  Variances shall only be issued prior to development permit approval. 
(e)  Variances shall only be issued upon: 
(i)  a showing of good and sufficient cause; 
(ii)  a determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship; and 
(iii)  a determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, or extraordinary public expense, create nuisance, cause fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances. 
10.  A variance may be issued for solid waste disposal facilities or sites, hazardous waste management facilities, salvage yards, and chemical storage facilities that are located in Special Flood Hazard Areas provided that all of the following conditions are met. 
(a)  The use serves a critical need in the community. 
(b)  No feasible location exists for the use outside the Special Flood Hazard Area. 
(c)  The reference level of any structure is elevated or floodproofed to at least the regulatory flood protection elevation.

1.  All new construction and substantial improvements shall be designed (or modified) and adequately anchored to prevent flotation, collapse, and lateral movement of the structure. 
2.  All new construction and substantial improvements shall be constructed with materials and utility equipment resistant to flood damage. 
3.  All new construction and substantial improvements shall be constructed by methods and practices that minimize flood damages. 
4.  Electrical, heating, ventilation, plumbing, air conditioning equipment, and other service facilities shall be designed and/or located so as to prevent water from entering or accumulating within the components during conditions of flooding to the regulatory flood protection elevation. These include, but are not limited to, HVAC equipment, water softener units, bath/kitchen fixtures, ductwork, electric/gas meter panels/boxes, utility/cable boxes, hot water heaters, and electric outlets/switches. 
5.  All new and replacement water supply systems shall be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of floodwaters into the system. 
6.  New and replacement sanitary sewage systems shall be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of floodwaters into the systems and discharges from the systems into flood waters. 
7.  On-site waste disposal systems shall be located and constructed to avoid impairment to them or contamination from them during flooding. 
8.  Any alteration, repair, reconstruction, or improvements to a structure, which is in compliance with the provisions of this ordinance, shall meet the requirements of "new construction" as contained in this ordinance. 
9.  Nothing in this ordinance shall prevent the repair, reconstruction, or replacement of a building or structure existing on the effective date of this ordinance and located totally or partially within the floodway, non-encroachment area, or stream setback, provided there is no additional encroachment below the regulatory flood protection elevation in the floodway, non-encroachment area, or stream setback, and provided that such repair, reconstruction, or replacement meets all of the other requirements of this ordinance. 
10.  New solid waste disposal facilities and sites, hazardous waste management facilities, salvage yards, and chemical storage facilities shall not be permitted, except by variance as specified in this Section). A structure or tank for chemical or fuel storage incidental to an allowed use or to the operation of a water treatment plant or wastewater treatment facility may be located in a Special Flood Hazard Area only if the structure or tank is either elevated or floodproofed to at least the regulatory flood protection elevation and certified in accordance with the provisions of this Section.

15.  When a structure is partially located in a special flood hazard area, the entire structure shall meet the requirements for new construction and substantial improvements. 
16.  When a structure is located in multiple flood hazard zones or in a flood hazard risk zone with multiple base flood elevations, the provisions for the more restrictive flood hazard risk zone and the highest base flood elevation shall apply. 
T.  Specific Standards 
    In all Special Flood Hazard Areas where Base Flood Elevation (BFE) data has been provided, as set forth in this Section, the following provisions, in addition to the provisions of this Section, are required: 
1.  Residential Construction. New construction and substantial improvement of any residential structure (including manufactured homes) shall have the reference level, including basement, elevated no lower than the regulatory flood protection elevation, as defined in this Section. 
2.  Non-Residential Construction. New construction and substantial improvement of any commercial, industrial, or other non-residential structure shall have the reference level, including basement, elevated no lower than the regulatory flood protection elevation, as defined in this ordinance. Structures located in A, AE, and A1-30 Zones may be floodproofed to the regulatory flood protection elevation instead of elevating the structure above the regulatory flood protection elevation provided that all areas of the structure, together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities, below the regulatory flood protection elevation are watertight with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water, using structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and the effect of buoyancy. A registered professional engineer or architect shall certify that the standards of this subsection are satisfied. Such certification shall be provided to the Floodplain Administrator as set forth in this Section, along with the operational and maintenance plans. 
3.  Manufactured Homes. 
(a)  New and replacement manufactured homes shall be elevated so that the reference level of the manufactured home is no lower than the regulatory flood protection elevation, as defined in this Section. 
(b)  Manufactured homes shall be securely anchored to an adequately anchored foundation to resist flotation, collapse, and lateral movement, either by certified engineered foundation system, or in accordance with the most current edition of the State of North Carolina Regulations for Manufactured Homes adopted by the Commissioner of Insurance pursuant to NCGS 143-143.15. Additionally, when the elevation would be met by an elevation of the chassis thirty-six (36) inches or less above the grade at the site, the chassis shall be supported by reinforced piers or engineered foundation. When the elevation of the chassis is above thirty-six (36) inches in height, an engineering certification is required. 
(c)  All enclosures or skirting below the lowest floor shall meet the requirements of this Section. 
(d)  An evacuation plan must be developed for evacuation of all residents of all new, substantially improved or substantially damaged manufactured home parks or subdivisions located within flood prone areas. This plan shall be filed with and approved by the Floodplain Administrator and the local Emergency Management coordinator. 
4.  Elevated Buildings. Fully enclosed area, of new construction and substantially improved structures, which is below the lowest floor: 
(a)  shall not be designed or used for human habitation, but shall only be used for parking of vehicles, building access, or limited storage of maintenance equipment used in connection with the premises. Access to the enclosed area shall be the minimum necessary to allow for parking of vehicles (garage door) or limited storage of maintenance equipment (standard exterior door), or entry to the living area (stairway or elevator). The interior portion of such enclosed area shall not be finished or partitioned into separate rooms, except to enclose storage areas; 
(b)  shall be constructed entirely of flood resistant materials at least to the regulatory flood protection elevation; and 
(c)  shall include, in Zones A, AE, and A1-30, flood openings to automatically equalize hydrostatic flood forces on walls by allowing for the entry and exit of floodwaters. To meet this requirement, the openings must either be certified by a professional engineer or architect or meet or exceed the following minimum design criteria: 
(i)  A minimum of two (2) flood openings on different sides of each enclosed area subject to flooding; 
(ii)  The total net area of all flood openings must be at least one (1) square inch for each square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding; 
(iii)  If a building has more than one (1) enclosed area, each enclosed area must have flood openings to allow floodwaters to automatically enter and exit; 
(iv)  The bottom of all required flood openings shall be no higher than one (1) foot above the adjacent grade; 
(v)  Flood openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, or other coverings or devices, provided they permit the automatic flow of floodwaters in both directions; and 
(vi)  Enclosures made of flexible skirting are not considered enclosures for regulatory purposes, and, therefore, do not require flood openings. Masonry or wood underpinning, regardless of structural status, is considered an enclosure and requires flood openings as outlined above. 
5.  Additions/Improvements. 
(a)  Additions and/or improvements to pre-FIRM structures when the addition and/or improvements in combination with any interior modifications to the existing structure are: 
(i)  not a substantial improvement, the addition and/or improvements must be designed to minimize flood damages and must not be any more non-conforming than the existing structure. 
(ii)  a substantial improvement, both the existing structure and the addition and/or improvements must comply with the standards for new construction. 
(b)  Additions to post-FIRM structures with no modifications to the existing structure other than a standard door in the common wall shall require only the addition to comply with the standards for new construction. 
(c)  Additions and/or improvements to post-FIRM structures when the addition and/or improvements in combination with any interior modifications to the existing structure are: 
(i)  not a substantial improvement, the addition and/or improvements only must comply with the standards for new construction. 
(ii)  a substantial improvement, both the existing structure and the addition and/or improvements must comply with the standards for new construction. 
6.  Recreational Vehicles. Recreational vehicles shall either: 
(a)  be on site for fewer than one hundred eighty (180) consecutive days and be fully licensed and ready for highway use (a recreational vehicle is ready for highway use if it is on its wheels or jacking system, is attached to the site only by quick disconnect type utilities, and has no permanently attached additions); or 
(b)  meet all the requirements for new construction. 
7.  Temporary Non-Residential Structures. Prior to the issuance of a floodplain development permit for a temporary structure, the applicant must submit to the Floodplain Administrator a plan for the removal of such structure(s) in the event of a hurricane, flash flood or other type of flood warning notification. The following information shall be submitted in writing to the Floodplain Administrator for review and written approval: 
(a)  a specified time period for which the temporary use will be permitted. Time specified may not exceed three (3) months, renewable up to one (1) year; 
(b)  the name, address, and phone number of the individual responsible for the removal of the temporary structure; 
(c)  the time frame prior to the event at which a structure will be removed (i.e., minimum of seventy-two (72) hours before landfall of a hurricane or immediately upon flood warning notification); 
(d)  a copy of the contract or other suitable instrument with the entity responsible for physical removal of the structure; and 
(e)  designation, accompanied by documentation, of a location outside the Special Flood Hazard Area, to which the temporary structure will be moved. 
8.  Accessory Structures. When accessory structures (sheds, detached garages, etc.) are to be placed within a Special Flood Hazard Area, the following criteria shall be met: 
(a)  Accessory structures shall not be used for human habitation (including working, sleeping, living, cooking or restroom areas); 
(b)  Accessory structures shall not be temperature-controlled; 
(c)  Accessory structures shall be designed to have low flood damage potential; 
(d)  Accessory structures shall be constructed and placed on the building site so as to offer the minimum resistance to the flow of floodwaters; 
(e)  Accessory structures shall be firmly anchored in accordance with the provisions of this Section; 
(f)  All service facilities such as electrical shall be installed in accordance with the provisions of this Section; and 
(g)  Flood openings to facilitate automatic equalization of hydrostatic flood forces shall be provided below regulatory flood protection elevation in conformance with the provisions of this Section; 
(h)  An accessory structure with a footprint less than one hundred fifty (150) square feet that satisfies the criteria outlined above does not require an elevation or floodproofing certificate. Elevation or floodproofing certifications are required for all other accessory structures in accordance with this Section. 
U.  Standards for Floodplains Without Established Base Flood Elevations 
    Within the Special Flood Hazard Areas designated as Approximate Zone A and established in Section 2.25 G., where no Base Flood Elevation (BFE) data has been provided by FEMA, the following provisions, in addition to the provisions of this Section, shall apply: 
1.  No encroachments, including fill, new construction, substantial improvements or new development shall be permitted within a distance of twenty (20) feet each side from top of bank or five (5) times the width of the stream, whichever is greater, unless certification with supporting technical data by a registered professional engineer is provided demonstrating that such encroachments shall not result in any increase in flood levels during the occurrence of the base flood discharge. 
2.  The BFE used in determining the regulatory flood protection elevation shall be determined based on the following criteria: 
(a)  When Base Flood Elevation (BFE) data is available from other sources, all new construction and substantial improvements within such areas shall also comply with all applicable provisions of this ordinance and shall be elevated or floodproofed in accordance with standards in this Section. 
(b)  When floodway or non-encroachment area data is available from a Federal, State, or other source, all new construction and substantial improvements within floodway and non-encroachment areas shall also comply with the requirements of this Section. 
(c)  All subdivision, manufactured home park and other development proposals shall provide Base Flood Elevation (BFE) data if development is greater than five (5) acres or has more than fifty (50) lots/manufactured home sites. Such Base Flood Elevation (BFE) data shall be adopted by reference in accordance with this Section and utilized in implementing this ordinance. 
(d)  When Base Flood Elevation (BFE) data is not available from a Federal, State, or other source as outlined above, the reference level shall be elevated or floodproofed (nonresidential) to or above the regulatory flood protection elevation, as defined in this Section. All other applicable provisions of this Section shall also apply. 
V.  Standards for Riverine Floodplains with Base Flood Elevations but Without Established Floodways or Non-Encroachment Areas 
    Along rivers and streams where BFE data is provided by FEMA or is available from another source but neither floodway nor non-encroachment areas are identified for a Special Flood Hazard Area on the FIRM or in the FIS report, the following requirements shall apply to all development within such areas: 
1.  Standards of this Section; and 
2.  Until a regulatory floodway or non-encroachment area is designated, no encroachments, including fill, new construction, substantial improvements, or other development, shall be permitted unless certification with supporting technical data by a registered professional engineer is provided demonstrating that the cumulative effect of the proposed development, when combined with all other existing and anticipated development, will not increase the water surface elevation of the base flood more than one (1) foot at any point within the community. 
W.  Floodways and Non-Encroachment Areas 
    Areas designated as floodways or non-encroachment areas are located within the Special Flood Hazard Areas established in this Section. The floodways and non-encroachment areas are extremely hazardous areas due to the velocity of floodwaters that have erosion potential and carry debris and potential projectiles. The following provisions, in addition to standards outlined in this Section, shall apply to all development within such areas: 
1.  No encroachments, including fill, new construction, substantial improvements and other developments shall be permitted unless: 
(a)  it is demonstrated that the proposed encroachment would not result in any increase in the flood levels during the occurrence of the base flood, based on hydrologic and hydraulic analyses performed in accordance with standard engineering practice and presented to the Floodplain Administrator prior to issuance of floodplain development permit, or 
(b)  a Conditional Letter of Map Revision (CLOMR) has been approved by FEMA. A Letter of Map Revision (LOMR) must also be obtained upon completion of the proposed encroachment. 
2.  No manufactured homes shall be permitted, except replacement manufactured homes in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision, provided the following provisions are met: 
(a)  the anchoring and the elevation standards of this Section; and 
(b)  the no encroachment standard of this Section. 
X.  Effect on Rights and Liabilities Under the Existing Flood Damage Prevention Ordinance 
    This ordinance in part comes forward by re-enactment of some of the provisions of the flood damage prevention ordinance enacted September 17, 1979 as amended, and it is not the intention to repeal but rather to re-enact and continue to enforce without interruption of such existing provisions, so that all rights and liabilities that have accrued there under are reserved and may be enforced. The enactment of this ordinance shall not affect any action, suit or proceeding instituted or pending. All provisions of the flood damage prevention ordinance of the City of Statesville enacted on September 17, 1979 as amended, which are not reenacted herein are repealed. 
Y.  Effect Upon Outstanding Floodplain Development Permits 
    Nothing herein contained shall require any change in the plans, construction, size, or designated use of any development or any part thereof for which a floodplain development permit has been granted by the floodplain administrator or his or her authorized agents before the time of passage of this ordinance; provided, however, that when construction is not begun under such outstanding permit within a period of six (6) months subsequent to the date of issuance of the outstanding permit, construction or use shall be in conformity with the provisions of this ordinance.

Z.  Planned Unit Developments 
1.  Purpose - The Planned Unit Development District, hereinafter referred as the "PUD District", is established to accommodate large-scale, master-planned, mixed-use developments that could not be accomplished through conventional zoning districts. Development within each PUD District shall occur in accordance with unique conditions and standards established during the rezoning process. Such conditions and standards shall be applicable only to the specific parcel(s) of land that comprises the PUD District, and shall run with the land regardless of ownership. The PUD District is not intended for use with subdivisions or developments which accommodate a single or few land use(s) for which other zoning districts are intended. 
2.  General Provisions - The following general provisions apply to the PUD District: 
a.  Permissible Uses. Permissible uses in the PUD District shall be any use or range of uses specified in the zoning application. Permissible uses, by way of example, may include residential, commercial, or office uses. The type and location of any and all uses within the PUD District must be demonstrated to be appropriate for the project area and surrounding area. All proposed uses listed in the approved zoning application are considered to be conditional uses; all are permitted subject to the conditions established through the rezoning process in connection with the specific application. 
b.  Minimum Size and Contiguity. The minimum area of a PUD District shall contain at least twenty (20) contiguous acres. Such contiguous acreage of land shall be under single or unified ownership or control. Parcels of land separated only by any right-of-way (road, utility, railroad) or public easement shall be considered contiguous. 
c.  Ownership and Division of Land. No tract of land may be considered for a PUD District unless such tract is under single or unified ownership or control. If listed in several ownerships, the application for zoning shall be accompanied by each landowner's written consent. The holder of a written option to purchase or a developer under contract shall be considered an owner for purposes of this section provided the landowner's (or landowners') written consent is included with the application. 
d.  Relationship to Other Regulations. All PUDs shall be subject to adopted local regulations in effect at the time of rezoning approval and shall also comply with State and Federal regulations. 
3.  General Development Standards 
a.  Private Covenants and Restrictions Required. Covenants and Restrictions for the property within a PUD District are required and must be recorded in the public records of Iredell County, prior to the approval of a plat or issuance of a building permit for a vertical building on the property. These restrictions will run with the land, so that if it is subdivided or developed in phases, then the Covenants and Restrictions will still be enforced. 
b.  Open Space. The following Open Space requirements apply within a PUD District: 
(1)  Not less than twenty percent (20%) of the gross land area of the PUD shall be devoted to Open Space. 
(2)  Open Space within a PUD District may be comprised of a combination of the following: natural areas, wetland preserves, trails, boardwalks, parks, ball fields, equestrian fields or tracks, plazas, golf courses (excluding clubhouse and maintenance facilities), buffers (outside of a platted lot), any water bodies including ponds and lakes, and/or innovative and accessible water quality devices (i.e. storm water management ponds and systems). Unless dedicated to City or a similar legal entity, the POA is required to provide for the continuing maintenance of Open Space. 
c.  Landscaping, Screening, Buffers and Trees. Due to the unique layout and integrated uses of this type of project, the current ordinance may not be applicable to its fullest extent. Therefore a landscape plan shall be submitted that follows the general provisions of the Section 30.6 Landscape Standards and will be approved by staff during the incremental master development process. 
d.  Common Sign Plan. Signs within the development shall adhere to the standards set forth or as part of the zoning application or an amendment thereto. The applicant may submit a unified sign plan that establishes the design standards and sign locations for the project. Such unified sign plan may be submitted after the approval of the zoning application and may be approved by the administrator as an alternate to individual sign permits. 
e.  Storm Water Control. Storm water management shall meet or exceed the requirements for storm water management in Section 8.05. A common master storm water management plan may be developed for the project as a whole and may employ best management practices. This does not prohibit the development of the PUD District in phases nor the phased implementation of the storm water management system. 
f.  Street Design. 
(1)  Street design shall adhere to the City's standards, however dimensional standards and design may be altered as part of the PUD process. The applicant may submit alternative street design standards that vary in response to proposed function of the street, the anticipated adjacent land uses, character of the neighborhood, the anticipated traffic volume (subject to City and/or NCDOT approval), the hierarchy within the street network, and the need for traffic calming measures. 
(2)  Streets within the PUD may be private or may be dedicated to the City of Statesville with the City's consent. Such roads may be maintained by the City of Statesville or NCDOT according to jurisdiction. Private streets will remain the responsibility of the POA. 
g.  Parking and Loading. The standards for parking and loading shall apply to all development within the PUD, with the following exceptions: 
(1)  On-street parking shall be allowed provided that the road width will accommodate same. On-street parking may consist of parallel, perpendicular, angled or any combination of these types of parking spaces. 
(2)  Parking standards and minimums shall be established for each non residential use as part of the PUD development standards. 
(3)  On-street parking shall count as required parking for the uses that are adjacent to the on-street spaces. 
(4)  Structured parking is allowed. 
(5)  There is no off-street loading requirement for a building with less than ten thousand (10,000) square feet of gross building area. Otherwise, off-street loading shall comply with the requirements for off-street loading set forth. 
4.  Phasing a PUD - A PUD may be developed in phases. Approval of the PUD shall authorize the applicant to commence the intended use for the property, to occupy any building, to sell any subdivision lots or obtain building permits before all of the infrastructure for the entire project is complete subject to the terms of a Development Agreement that complies with the provisions of Article 3 and the following conditions: 
a.  Each incremental master development plan submittal shall clearly depict the submittal as a separate phase and the submittal shall provide a projected commencement date and substantial completion date for such phase. 
b.  Once a phase is established and the incremental master development plan is approved, the commencement of the intended use, the occupancy of buildings or the sale of subdivision lots within such phase may not occur, except as provided in paragraph 4.c. of this section, until the required infrastructure improvements in that phase are substantially complete or guaranteed pursuant to the Development Agreement. 
c.  In cases when, because of weather conditions or other factors beyond the control of the applicant (exclusive of financial hardship) it would be unreasonable to require the applicant to comply with the requirements of phasing in this section, the City Council may authorize the commencement of the intended use or the occupancy of buildings, the sale of subdivision lots or additional building permits so long as adequate security is provided per the requirements of this section. 
5.  Additional Regulations for All Development Within a PUD. 
a.  Residential Uses in Commercial and Office Buildings. A residential use may be located above a commercial or office use located on the first floor of the same building. 
b.  Building Heights. The applicant may propose a height that exceeds the established limits of the current ordinance, provided the increased height does not negatively impact surrounding properties and is approved by the City of Statesville Planning Director. 
c.  Appurtenances. A step, stoop, open porch, balcony, awnings or other appurtenance may extend up to four (4) feet into the front setback, provided such features do not impede pedestrian circulation. 
d.  Utility Lines. All new utilities within the proposed development shall be underground unless just cause requires otherwise. Just cause shall be determined by the City Council. 
e.  Accessory Uses. 
(1)  Residential accessory uses. One (1) accessory dwelling unit is permitted as an accessory to a residential use. This structure may be used by a member of the family dwelling in the primary residence for a home occupation or personal office or as an accessory apartment, which may be occupied by domestic help, security, or occasional guests of the family dwelling in the primary residence. 
(2)  Commercial accessory uses. Commercial uses may include as accessory uses any commercial use, activity, and structure on the same site or lot that: 
(a)  is operated primarily for the convenience of employees, clients, or customers of the principal use; 
(b)  is clearly subordinate to the principal use; and 
(c)  is located and operated as an integral part of the principal use and does not comprise a separate business use or activity.

Figure 6-1: Sample Density Calculation

C.  Lot Width and Depth 
1.  Lots shall be of sufficient dimensions to allow construction of buildings that can be used for purposes permissible in that zoning district while complying with minimum setback requirements summarized in this section. 
2.  Subject to the planned unit development provisions of Section 3.04 W. and the alternative development patterns of Article 7, the minimum lot width as measured at the front building line shall comply with the minimum lot widths established in Table 6-1. 
3.  Minimum lot widths in MF districts for two-family and multi-family shall be increased ten (10) feet per additional unit for lots less than one hundred twenty-five (125) feet in width. 
4.  Minimum lot widths for two-family (duplexes) located within the R-8 and R-8M districts shall be one hundred (100) feet. Minimum lot widths for two-family (duplexes) located within the R-5 and R-5M districts shall be seventy-five (75) feet. 
5.  Lot width shall be not less than required by the relevant district. The minimum width at the street line shall not be less than thirty-seven and one-half (371/2) feet. Corner lots shall have an additional width of ten (10) feet to permit adequate setback from the abutting street. Greater lot width is required in all R-15, R-10, and R-5 zoning districts when: 
a.  Either public water or sewer is provided, but not both. In such case, the minimum average width shall be eighty-five (85) feet. 
b.  Neither public water nor sewer is provided. In such case, the minimum average width shall be not less than one hundred (100) feet. 
6.  All lots shall have a minimum depth of not less than one hundred ten (110) feet. Greater lot depth is required in all R-15, R-10, and R-5 zoning districts when: 
a.  Public water but not public sewer is provided. In such case, the minimum average depth shall be one hundred twenty (120) feet. 
b.  Neither public water nor public sewer is provided. In such case, the minimum average depth shall be one hundred fifty (150) feet. 
7.  Side lot lines shall be substantially at right angles or radial to street right-of-way lines. 
D.  Building Setback Requirements 
1.  Subject to the provisions of planned unit developments in Section 3.04 W., and alternative development patterns in Article 7, as well as other provisions of this Section, no portion of any building may be located on any lot closer to any lot line than is authorized Table 6-1. 
2.  If the street right-of-way is readily determinable (by reference to a recorded map, set irons, or other means), the abutting yard's setback shall be measured from such right-of-way line. If the right-of-way line is not determinable, the abutting yard's setback shall be measured from the street centerline. Setbacks shall be one-half (1/2) the street right-of-way width for the applicable street classification as defined in Section 8.06, plus the required setback shown in Table 6-1. In the event that the Comprehensive Transportation Plan provides for a future right-of-way, such setback line shall be measured from a line located a minimum distance of one-half (1/2) the proposed right-of-way width from the centerline of the street. 
3.  Overhead canopies or roofs over gas pumps located within a business or industrial district shall have a minimum setback of twelve (12) feet from any street right-of-way. 
4.  Gas pumps shall have a minimum setback of twenty (20) feet from the street right-of-way. 
5.  Fences running along street rights-of-way that exceed six (6) feet in height or are substantially opaque regardless of height shall be set back at least three (3) feet from the side or rear property line and shall comply with the front-yard setbacks in Table 6-1. 
6.  Whenever a lot in a nonresidential district has a common boundary line with a lot in a residential district, the property line setback for the nonresidential lot shall be the greater of the two (2) districts. 
7.  Setback distances shall be measured from the property line or street right-of-way to the nearest portion of any building, excluding: 
a.  The outermost four (4) feet of any uncovered porch, step, eave, gutter, canopy, or similar fixture; and 
b.  A deck or patio floor if no portion of the same extends more than twelve (12) inches off the ground; and 
c.  Handicapped ramps and lifts. 
E.  Building Height Limitations 
1.  For the purpose of this section, the height of a building shall be the vertical distance of a building measured from the average elevation of the finished grade around the perimeter of the foundation of the structure to the highest interior finished ceiling, excluding the exceptions established herein. The maximum height shall not exceed the height in Table 6-1. 
2.  Principal uses other than single-family and two-family dwellings in residential, B-1 and O-1 Districts may exceed the thirty-five-foot height provided that the side yard is increased one (1) foot for every one (1) foot or fraction thereof of additional height. However, in no case shall a building in these districts exceed fifty (50) feet in height. 
3.  In an O & 1-2 and B-2 district or in a B-3, B-4 and B-5 District, the height of a building may exceed fifty (50) or sixty-five (65) feet respectively provided that the side yard is increased by five (5) feet or a fraction thereof for every five (5) feet of additional height. However, in no case shall a building exceed sixty-five (65) feet in the O & 1-2 and B-2 Districts or eighty (80) feet in the B-3, B-4 and B-5.

3.  Property lines at street intersections shall be rounded with a minimum radius of twenty (20) feet. When the intersection angle is less than seventy-five (75) degrees, the City Engineer may require a greater radius. 
4.  Jogs in streets shall be offset by at least one hundred fifty (150) feet. 
K.  Easements 
1.  Utility easements for residential subdivisions along front and rear lot lines shall be at least ten (10) feet wide and centered thereon; easements alongside lot lines shall be equal to the required side yard setback. Front, rear, and side yard utility easements for nonresidential, cluster and architecturally integrated cluster subdivisions shall be established by the City Council upon review and recommendation of the Technical Review Committee and Planning Board. 
2.  Where a subdivision is traversed by a watercourse, drainage way, channel, or stream, a storm easement or drainage right-of-way conforming substantially to the boundaries of such watercourse, but no less than ten (10) feet in width, shall be provided in such width as required by the City Engineer. 
3.  Lakes, ponds, creeks and similar natural areas within the City may be accepted for maintenance upon recommendation by the Planning Board and approved by the City Council. 
L.  Permanent Reference Points 
    Prior to the approval of the final plat, permanent reference points shall have been placed in accordance with the following requirements: 
1.  At least one (1) corner of the subdivision shall be designated by course and distance (tie) from a readily discernible reference marker. If a corner is within two thousand (2,000) feet of a U.S. Coast and Geodetic Station or N.C. Grid System coordinated monument or City coordinated system, the corner shall be marked with a monument designated by computed X and Y coordinates, which shall be identified on a map with a statement identifying this station or monument to an accuracy of one-ten thousandth (1/10,000) of a foot. When such a monument or station is not available, the tie shall be made to some pertinent and readily recognizable landmark or identifiable point, physical object or structure that is not likely to be destroyed. 
2.  Within each block of a subdivision, at least two (2) monuments designed and designated as control corners shall be installed. The surveyor shall employ additional monuments if and when required. All monuments shall be constructed of concrete and shall be at least four (4) inches in diameter or square and not less than three (3) feet in length. Each monument shall have imbedded in its top or attached by a suitable means, a metal plate of noncorrosive material and marked plainly with the point, the surveyor's registration number, the month and the year it was installed and the words "Monument" or "Control Corner." Monuments shall be set at least thirty (30) inches in the ground with at least six (6) inches exposed above the ground unless this requirement is impractical. The location of monuments or control corners shall be determined by the City Engineer. 
3.  A steel or wrought iron pipe or its equivalent, not less than three-fourths (3/4) of an inch in diameter and at least thirty (30) inches in length, shall be set at all corners, except those located by monuments.

(Ord. No. 02-16, 2-1-2016; Ord. No. 08-17, 4-3-2017) 
Section 6.03 - Parking Standards 
A.  Off Street Parking Requirements 
1.  Off-street parking shall be provided and permanently maintained on every lot on which any of the following uses are hereafter established in all districts, with the exception of the Central Business District where nonresidential uses are exempt from off-street parking requirements. 
2.  Off-street parking in the CB, CBP, Municipal Service and H-115 Districts shall be located only in the defined side and rear yards. If parking is located within the side yard, hardscape screening four (4) feet in height and/or landscape screening three (3) feet in height at planting (reaching four (4) feet in height within one (1) year) shall be required. Corner lots will screen side and rear yard parking from the intersecting streets. 
3.  The number of required off-street parking spaces shall be increased when a change of use of either a structure or of land requires additional parking spaces in compliance with this Article. Parking spaces may be decreased when a change of use in either the structure or the land requires fewer spaces than provided for the replaced use. 
4.  A one-time enlargement of a structure or increase in the amount of land used may be made for existing uses which are not deficient in off-street parking, provided that the enlargement or increase does not represent a requirement in excess of five (5) off-street parking spaces. In the event that such increase represents a requirement in excess of five (5) off-street parking spaces, such increase shall require complete compliance with the provisions of this section for the entire use. 
5.  In residential areas, the parking or storage of motor vehicles, recreation vehicles, boats and/or trailers shall be prohibited in the area between the street and the front yard, except that the parking of motor vehicles, recreation vehicles, boats and/or trailers are permitted upon a driveway or parking area constructed of concrete, asphalt, gravel or any other material commonly used for parking of vehicles, but not including grass or dirt. 
6.  A certificate of occupancy will not be issued for any use until all off-street parking and loading requirements in accordance with this ordinance have been met and are in place and ready for use. 
B.  Computation of Off-Street Parking Requirements 
1.  When units of measurement determining the number of required parking spaces results in the requirement of a fractional space, any remainder under one-half (1/2) shall be disregarded and any fraction equal to or over one-half (1/2) shall require the provision of one (1) entire parking space. 
2.  Where seating consists of benches, pews, or other continuous seating surface, each twenty (20) inches of seating surface shall be considered as one (1) seat. 
3.  Where more than one (1) work shift is employed for any operation, parking requirements based on the number of employees shall be calculated for the largest shift. 
4.  Driveways shall be considered as providing off-street parking spaces for all single-family and two-family dwellings provided that there is a minimum of twenty (20) feet along the driveway between the building and the right-of-way, and that not more than thirty percent (30%) of the front yard is paved or graveled. Request for more than thirty percent (30%) shall be reviewed by TRC. 
C.  Parking Space Dimensions 
1.  Except as provided in the following paragraphs, each parking space shall contain a rectangular area at least eighteen (18) feet long and nine (9) feet wide. Lines demarcating parking spaces may be drawn at various angles in relation to curbs or aisles, so long as the parking spaces so created contain within them the rectangular area required by this section. 
2.  In parking areas containing ten (10) or more parking spaces, up to twenty percent (20%) of the parking spaces needed may contain a rectangular area of only seven and one-half (71/2) feet in width by fifteen (15) feet in length. If such spaces are provided, they shall be conspicuously designated as reserved for small or compact cars only. 
3.  Wherever parking areas consist of spaces set aside for parallel parking, the dimensions of such parking spaces shall be not less than twenty-two (22) feet by nine (9) feet unless otherwise approved. 
D.  Required Widths of Parking Area Aisles and Driveways 
1.  Parking area aisle widths shall conform to Table 6-3 which varies the width requirement according to the angle of parking. 
2.  Driveways shall be not less than ten (10) feet in width for one-way traffic and twenty (20) feet in width for two-way traffic. 
Table 6-3: Required Aisle Width by Parking Angle (feet) 
Parking Angle 0° 30° 45° 60° 90° One-Way Traffic 13' 11' 13' 18' 24' Two-Way Traffic 19' 20' 21' 23' 24'  
E.  General Design Requirements 
1.  Unless no other practicable alternative is available, vehicle accommodation areas shall be designed so that vehicles may exit such areas without backing onto a public street. This requirement does not apply driveways that serve one (1) or two (2) dwelling units, except that the creation of a lot that requires backing onto arterial streets is prohibited. 
2.  Vehicle accommodation areas of all developments shall be designed so that sanitation, emergency, and other public service vehicles can serve such developments without the necessity of backing unreasonable distances or making other dangerous or hazardous turning movements. 
3.  Every vehicle accommodation area shall be designed so that vehicles cannot extend beyond the perimeter of such area onto adjacent properties or public rights-of-way. Such areas shall also be designed so that vehicles do not extend over sidewalks or tend to bump against or damage any wall, vegetation, or other obstruction. 
4.  Circulation areas shall be designed so that vehicles can proceed safely without posing a danger to pedestrians or other vehicles and without interfering with parking areas. 
5.  Except by way of approved driveways, access from or egress to a public road from a parking area shall be expressly prohibited. 
F.  Vehicle Accommodation Area Surfaces 
1.  Vehicle accommodation areas shall be graded to avoid ponding and surfaced with asphalt or concrete except under the following circumstances, provided however that the following provisions are not an exemption from required landscaping: 
a.  In the LI and HI districts where the vehicle accommodation area is located at least two hundred (200) feet from the nearest residence; 
b.  Commercial or other non-residential parking areas that are required to have fewer than ten (10) parking spaces; 
c.  Driveways for single family or duplex residences. 
2.  Parking spaces in concrete or asphalt surfaced parking lots shall be appropriately demarcated with painted lines. 
3.  Vehicle accommodation areas that are not provided with concrete or asphalt surfaces shall: 
a.  Be graded and surfaced with crushed stone, gravel, or other suitable material as suggested by the City Engineer to provide a stable surface; 
b.  Be maintained to manage dust and erosion; 
c.  Have perimeters clearly defined with bricks, stones, railroad ties, or other similar devices. In addition, whenever such a vehicle accommodation area abuts a paved street, the driveway leading from such street to such area (or, if there is no driveway, the portion of the vehicle accommodation area that opens onto such streets), shall be paved with concrete or asphalt for a distance of fifteen (15) feet back from the edge of the street pavement. 
4.  The City Engineer may authorize the use of alternate parking surfaces after finding the surface to provide equivalent or better safety, dust control, convenience and durability. 
G.  Joint Use of Required Parking Spaces 
1.  One (1) parking area may contain required spaces for several different uses, but except as otherwise provided in this section, the required space assigned to one (1) use may not be credited to any other use. 
2.  To the extent that developments that wish to make joint use of the same parking spaces operate at different times, the same spaces may be credited to both uses. For example, if a parking lot is used in connection with an office building on Monday through Friday but is generally ninety percent (90%) vacant on the weekends, another development that operates only on weekends could be credited with ninety percent (90%) of the spaces on that lot. Or, if a church parking lot is generally occupied only to fifty percent (50%) of capacity on days other than Sunday, another development could make use of fifty percent (50%) of the church lot's spaces on those other days. 
H.  Satellite Parking 
1.  If the number of off-street parking spaces required by this ordinance cannot reasonably be provided on the same lot where the principal use associated with these parking spaces is located, then spaces may be provided on adjacent or nearby lots in accordance with the provisions of this section. These off-site spaces are referred to in this section as "satellite" parking spaces. Satellite parking spaces shall only be located in the zoning district(s) where the principal use is permitted. 
2.  All such satellite parking spaces (except spaces intended for employee use) must be located within three hundred (300) feet of a public entrance of a principal building housing the use associated with such parking, or within any principal building. Satellite parking spaces intended for employee use may be located within any reasonable distance. 
3.  The developer wishing to take advantage of the provisions of this section must present satisfactory written evidence that he has the permission of the owner or other person in charge of the satellite parking spaces to use such spaces. The developer must also sign an acknowledgement that the continuing validity of his permit depends upon his continuing ability to provide the requisite number of parking spaces. 
4.  All such off-street parking areas located in a Residential (R) district shall require the issuance of a Special Use Permit by the City Council in accordance with the following section. 
I.  Number of Required Off-Street Parking Spaces 
    The number of required off-street parking spaces shall be as set forth in the Table 6-4. 
J.  No Parking Indicated Near Fire Hydrants 
    Whenever a fire hydrant is located adjacent to any portion of a vehicle accommodation area required to be paved, the pavement shall be clearly marked to indicate that parking within fifteen (15) feet of such hydrant is prohibited. 
K.  Handicapped Parking 
    Provisions relating to parking for the handicapped are set forth in the North Carolina State Building Code, and all vehicle accommodation areas shall comply with such requirements to the extent they are applicable. 
L.  Reduction of Off-Street Parking Requirements in Age Restricted Developments 
1.  Residential developments which are designed for and restricted to use by senior populations shall be designed to accommodate their special needs. These developments shall be defined as housing developments in which one hundred percent (100%) of the residents are sixty-two (62) years of age or older, or eighty percent (80%) of the total number of residents are fifty-five (55) years of age or older and the development is designed to have tenants age in place with appropriate facilities. 
2.  Existing facilities meeting these criteria may apply for a reduction in their parking requirements. The City Council, after recommendation from the Planning Board, may authorize a reduction in the parking requirements to the following standards: 
On Site Parking Requirements for Age Restricted Developments: 
one (1) parking space (nine (9) feet by eighteen (18) feet) for each dwelling unit 
one (1) parking space for each employee of the development 
one (1) parking space for each service/transportation vehicle 
one (1) drop-off/pick-up vehicle space (transit or other) including drive-through or turn around area. 
3.  Documentation verifying the dedication of these units for elderly use only shall be provided, as well as a site plan meeting code requirements, for staff or Technical Review Committee review, if needed. 
4.  Design for on-site parking shall comply with the requirements set forth in this section. 
M.  Overflow or Additional Parking 
    Overflow or additional parking spaces equaling ten percent (10%) or more above that required in Table 6-4 shall be constructed as required herein unless an alternate plan is recommended by the Planning Board and approved by City Council.

Section 6.04 - Landscape Standards 
A.  Purpose 
    The City of Statesville in a pro-active response to the marked increase in development seeks to positively impact the economy, to protect the natural resources of the community, and to provide aesthetic characteristics that will collectively improve the quality of life. 
    The purpose of establishing these standards is to encourage landscape development and preservation of the existing forest canopy that characterizes Statesville as a unique place by enhancing its natural beauty and maintaining a liveable environment. 
B.  Definitions 
    The following definitions shall apply to the regulation and control of landscaping within this ordinance: 
1.  Buffer Yard: the required installation of landscaping and screening materials between adjacent properties along the periphery of the property. 
a.  Type A: a planting strip having a minimum width of eight (8) feet which is intended to separate uses, provide vegetation in densely developed areas, and enhance the appearance of individual properties. 
b.  Type B: a low density screen having a minimum width of ten (10) feet which is intended to partially block visual contact between zoning classifications and create spatial separation. 
c.  Type C: a medium density screen having a minimum width of fifteen (15) feet which is intended to partially block visual contact between zoning classifications and create spatial separation. 
d.  Type D: a medium-high density screen having a minimum width of twenty (20) feet which is intended to partially block visual contact between zoning classifications and create spatial separation. 
e.  Type E: a high density screen having a minimum width of twenty-five (25) feet which is intended to substantially block visual contact between zoning classifications, create spatial separation, and reduce lighting and noise that would otherwise intrude upon adjacent zoning classifications. 
f.  Type F: a very high density screen having a minimum width of thirty (30) feet which is intended to substantially block visual contact between zoning classifications, create spatial separation, and reduce lighting and noise that would otherwise intrude upon adjacent zoning classifications. 
2.  Caliper: a standard trunk diameter measurement for nursery grown trees taken six (6) inches above the ground for up to and including four (4) inches in caliper size, and twelve (12) inches above the ground for larger sizes. 
3.  Critical Root Zone (CRZ): a circular region measured outward from a tree trunk representing the essential area of the roots that must be maintained in order for the tree's survival. The critical root zone is one (1) foot of radial distance for every inch of tree DBH, with a minimum of eight (8) feet. 
4.  Diameter-at-Breast-Height (DBH): is the tree trunk diameter measured in inches at a height of four and one-half (41/2) feet above the ground.

Section 6.05 - Lighting 
    Outdoor lighting shall be so located as not to directly reflect on adjacent property, or on public streets in such a manner as to adversely affect the enjoyment of adjacent property, or endanger the motorist traversing such public streets. This shall be achieved by a number of methods including, but not limited to, shielding, orientation and lumen cast. 
Section 6.06 - Open Space Standards 
A.  Open Space Defined 
    Open space is land and/or bodies of water used for recreation, amenity or buffer; it will be freely accessible to all residents of a development, where required by this chapter. Open space shall not be occupied by buildings or structures unless accessory to a permitted recreational use, roads, parking or road rights-of-way, utility easements, nor shall it include the yards or lots of residential dwelling units required to meet minimum lot area or parking area requirements. Retention basins may be counted towards up to forty percent (40%) of open space, provided that side slopes are 5:1 run:rise or flatter unless otherwise approved by the City Engineer. 
B.  Open Space Plan 
    An open space plan will be submitted as a part of the application for a planned unit development, cluster subdivision or architecturally integrated cluster subdivision that designates: 
1.  The areas to be reserved as open space and the specific design of open space areas; 
2.  The type of open space that will be provided; and 
3.  The manner in which the open space will be perpetuated, maintained and administered. 
C.  Types of Open Space 
    The types of open space which may be provided to satisfy the requirements of this chapter, together with the maintenance required for each type, are as follows: (NOTE: Areas that are designated as permanent soil stock piling or borrow pits cannot be dedicated as open space.) 
1.  Natural areas are areas of undisturbed vegetation. Woodlands, wetlands and stream buffers are specific types of natural areas. Maintenance is limited to removal of litter, dead trees, plant materials, and brush. Natural water courses are to be maintained as free flowing and devoid of debris. Stream channels will be maintained so as not to alter floodplain levels. 
2.  Recreational areas are designed for specific, active recreational uses such as tot lots, tennis courts, swimming pools, ballfields and similar uses. Recreational areas will be accessible to all residents of the development. Maintenance is limited to insure that there exist no hazards, nuisances or unhealthy conditions. 
3.  Greenways are linear green belts linking residential areas with other open space areas. These greenways may contain bicycle paths, footpaths and bridle paths. Connecting greenways between residences and recreational areas are encouraged. Maintenance is limited to a minimum removal and avoidance of hazards, nuisances or unhealthy conditions. 
4.  Landscaped areas and lawns with or without trees and shrubs will be mowed regularly to insure neatness. Landscaped areas will be trimmed, cleaned and weeded regularly. 
D.  Preservation and Maintenance of Open Space 
    Land designated as common open space may not be sold or developed and must be platted as a lot. Open space areas will be maintained so that their use and enjoyment as open spaces are not diminished or destroyed. Open space areas may be owned, preserved and maintained as required by this section by any of the following mechanisms or combinations thereof: 
1.  Dedication of and acceptance by a registered land trust; 
2.  Common ownership of the open space by a property owner's association which assumes full responsibility for its maintenance; 
3.  Private ownership which will prevent development and/or subsequent subdivision of the open space land and provide the maintenance responsibility. Copy of approved and recorded plat must be submitted to the City prior to the issuance of a certificate of occupancy. 
E.  Areas Not Allowed as Open Space 
    The following areas shall not count toward common open space set-aside requirements: 
1.  Private lots, yards, balconies and patios dedicated for use by a specific unit; 
2.  Electric or gas transmission line rights-of-way; 
3.  Public right-of-way or private streets and drives; 
4.  Open parking areas and driveways for dwellings; 
5.  Land covered by structures except for ancillary structures associated with the use of the open space such as gazebos and picnic shelters; 
6.  Designated outdoor storage areas; 
7.  Land areas between buildings of less than forty (40) feet; 
8.  Land areas between buildings and parking lots or driveways of less than forty (40) feet in width; 
9.  Required setbacks; and 
10.  Detention/retention facilities except as provided in this section. 
F.  Open Space Linkages 
    Where a trail, natural area or public park is dedicated to or acquired by the City, such area may be credited toward the minimum amount of common open space required. Such areas also may qualify for density bonuses. 
G.  Design Criteria for Open Space 
    All common open space lands shall meet the following design criteria, as relevant: 
1.  Water bodies, retention areas, detention basins and wetlands basins, may constitute up to forty percent (40%) of required open space, provided that retention facilities are designed to provide safe access to water and detention facilities encompass at least ten thousand (10,000) square feet of area with less than two percent (2%) grade. Side slopes to retention and detention facilities shall provide at least six (6) feet of horizontal run for each foot of vertical rise. 
2.  At least forty percent (40%) of required open space must be dry land with a slope of less than ten percent (10%) unless otherwise approved the City Council. 
3.  Unless otherwise approved by the City Council, open space shall be continuous, contiguous with open space on abutting properties and accessible to the public. 
H.  Connectivity Required 
    To the maximum extent practicable, common open space shall be organized to create integrated systems of open space that connect with the following types of lands located within or adjacent to the development: 
1.  Dedicated public park or greenway lands; 
2.  Dedicated school sites; 
3.  Other dedicated open spaces; 
4.  Common open space located adjacent to the development; 
5.  Portions of the regional trail and open space system; 
6.  Neighborhood shopping and activity centers; and 
7.  Adjacent employment centers. 
I.  Contiguity Required 
    To the maximum extent practicable, common open space land shall be compact and contiguous unless the land is used as a continuation of an existing greenway, trail, or other linear park, or unless specific topographic features require a different configuration. An example of such topographic features would be the provision of open space along a scenic creek. With the exceptions of trails, the minimum width of an open space parcel shall be one hundred (100) feet. 
J.  Accessibility Required 
    Common open space shall be reasonably accessible to all of the residents of the development: 
1.  At a minimum, pedestrian access to common open space shall occur every five-hundred (500) feet of linear length of common open space. 
2.  Pedestrian access to common open space shall occur within five hundred (500) feet of every dwelling unit in the development. 
3.  The City may require access to be restricted if it would degrade, destroy, or adversely interfere with sensitive environmental or natural areas or with significant historic or cultural resources. 
4.  Where provided, access to common open space shall be a minimum of twenty-five (25) feet wide and shall be located where such access is visible to dwelling units and shall not be isolated by walls, screening, landscaping, or any other kind of barrier that would prevent resident surveillance of the open space. 
K.  Open Space Amenities 
    Common open spaces, other than those preserved as natural features or areas, should include gardens, courtyards, recreation, or play areas and shall contain at least three (3) of the following features: 
1.  Seasonal planting areas. 
2.  Benches or other seating. 
3.  Gazebos or other decorative shelters. 
4.  Play structures for children. 
5.  On-site community recreation amenities. 
Section 6.07 - Sign Regulations 
A.  Purpose 
    The purpose of these regulations is to ensure that persons and businesses desiring to exercise their rights, under the First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution, by expressing commercial and non-commercial messages shall be treated uniformly while ensuring that the public health, safety and welfare are protected. These regulations for signs have the following specific objectives: 
1.  To ensure that signs are designed, constructed, installed and maintained so that the public safety and traffic safety are not compromised; 
2.  To allow and promote positive conditions for sign communications while at the same time avoiding nuisances to nearby properties and promoting an attractive environment; 
3.  To reflect and support the desired character and development patterns of the various zoning districts; 
4.  To allow for adequate and effective signs in commercial and industrial zones while preventing signs from dominating the appearance of the area; and 
5.  To ensure that the constitutionally guaranteed right of free speech is protected. 
B.  Applicability and Effect 
    Other than lawful nonconforming signs, no signs shall be permitted in any zoning district except in accordance with the provisions of this Section and shall require a sign permit in conformance with the provisions in Section 2.23. 
1.  Applicability: The provisions of this Chapter shall apply to the erection, alteration, reconstruction, construction and maintenance of all on-premise and off-premise signs and billboards within the City and its Extraterritorial Jurisdiction. 
2.  Restrictiveness: To the extent that any other provision of this Section shall be more restrictive than the provisions set forth in this Code, the more restrictive provision shall apply. 
3.  Severability: The sections, paragraphs, clauses, and phrases of this Section are severable and if any phrase, clause, sentence, paragraph or section of this Section shall be declared unlawful by the valid judgment, decree or injunction order of a court of competent jurisdiction, such ruling shall not affect any of the remaining phrases, clauses, sentences, paragraphs and sections of this Section. In the event that, contrary to the policies, interests, and values of the City, a court of competent jurisdiction issues a judgment, decree or injunction order that this Section is unlawful because of any omission or prohibition in this Section, then all provisions of this Section not specifically declared to be unlawful shall remain in full force and effect. In the event that a judgment, decree or injunction order declaring all or a portion of this Section to be unlawful is reversed or vacated by a court of competent jurisdiction, the provisions contained in this Section shall remain in full force and effect.

D.  Measurements 
1.  Height. Figure 6-4 shows the method for calculating sign height. Where topography, neighboring buildings, or existing landscaping would obscure a sign from the adjoining street, the applicant may request a variance in conformance with Section 2.11. The height of a sign shall be measured from the top of highest attached component of the sign, to the higher of: 
a.  The average grade of the ground excluding berms, filling, mounding or excavations, at the base of the sign, or 
b.  The average grade level of the adjacent street or highway centerline for signs located within twenty-five (25) feet of the right-of-way, whichever is higher. 
2.  Sign Face Area. On-premise signs shall be calculated by measuring from the extreme boundaries of the each sign face, as illustrated in Figure 6-5. The message area shall include any emblem, logo, trademark, representation or other display, together with any material or color forming an integral part of the background of the display or used to differentiate the sign from the backdrop or structure against which it is placed, but shall not include the supporting framework, bracing, poles, apron, supports, structural members, decorative fence or wall that is clearly incidental to the sign and not a part of the message. Billboards and off-premise sign area calculations shall include the border and trim. 
a.  Cabinet Signs: The sign area is determined by multiplying the width by the height. The sign area of round cabinet signs shall be calculated based on the formula: 3.14 × radius × radius. 
b.  Back-to-Back Signs: The sign area of back-to-back signs shall be calculated by measuring only one (1) sign face. If there is a separation of more than three (3) feet between faces or an angle greater than fifteen (15) degrees, then each sign face shall be calculated. 
c.  Multiple Signs: The sign area for multiple signs shall be calculated by taking the sum of the sign area for each individual sign. 
E.  Sign Setbacks 
    Signs located within the required front yard or side street of a principal structure shall be located a minimum of five (5) feet from the property line of road right-of-way. The location of signs shall not interfere with the site visibility triangle. 
F.  Freestanding Signs 
    Only one (1) freestanding sign may be erected per parcel except 
1.  As otherwise allowed for properties with more than five hundred (500) feet of frontage; or 
2.  For parcels that are one (1) acre or more in size that have frontage on two (2) public collector or arterial streets, a second freestanding sign may be authorized. 
G.  Permitted Sign Standards 
    The type of sign permitted, maximum number of signs, maximum size, maximum height, maximum projection, minimum setback, lighting method, and permit requirement shall be in conformance with Table 6-13 in addition to the following standards: 
1.  Construction Standards; All Signs 
a.  Building code compliance: All signs shall be constructed and maintained in accordance with the provisions of the adopted building code. 
b.  Materials required: All signs for which a permit is required by this Section, except temporary signs, shall be constructed of non-combustible material. 
c.  Reflectors: Reflectors and lights shall be permitted on ground signs, roof signs, and wall signs; provided, however, that the reflectors and lights shall be provided with proper glass lenses so that no light therefrom creates a hazardous or dangerous condition. 
d.  Internal illumination: The illumination of internally illuminated signs, which are authorized only in the B-3, B-4 and B-5 zoning districts, shall not exceed twenty (20) footcandles of incandescent light measured at a distance of ten (10) feet from such structure. 
e.  External illumination: Externally illuminated signs shall be lighted so that no lights are positioned in such a manner that light glares or shines into the eyes of motorists or pedestrians or onto a residential structure. 
2.  Special Limitations. In addition to the limitations set forth in the other sections of this article, the following limitations shall apply to these specific types of signs: 
a.  Wall signs: No wall sign shall cover wholly or partially any wall opening, nor project beyond the ends or top of the wall to which it is attached.

d.  Entrance sign: All entrance signs shall be placed on private property and may not be placed in the right-of-way, except in a center median based on the following criteria: 
(1)  the sign has two (2) faces; 
(2)  the location has been approved in writing by the City Engineer; and 
(3)  applicant agrees to be responsible for maintenance and repair of the entrance sign and ensures that the existence of the entrance sign is documented on the final plat for the development. 
e.  Subdivision sign: All subdivision signs shall be placed on private property and may not be placed in the right-of-way, except in a center median based on the following criteria: 
(1)  the sign has two (2) faces; 
(2)  the location has been approved in writing by the City Engineer; and 
(3)  the applicant agrees in writing to be responsible for maintenance and repair of the entrance sign and ensures that the existence of the entrance sign is documented on the final plat for the development. 
f.  Banners in City parks: 
(1)  City sponsored or operated events shall be exempt from sign regulations. 
(2)  Banners shall be considered temporary signs. 
(3)  In addition to the special limitations of this Section, banners placed in the City parks shall be further regulated as follows: 
(a)  Banners in the City's parks can be displayed for no more than seventy-two (72) hours; 
(b)  No person shall be permitted to display more than one (1) banner on the premises, and only one (1) banner shall be displayed on the premises at any given time;

Section 6.08 - Design Standards for Non-Residential Developments 
A.  Purpose and Applicability 
    The purpose of this article is to ensure that the physical characteristics of proposed development are compatible when considered within the context of the surrounding area. Guidelines should be read in conjunction with the general development regulations and zone-specific standards. 
B.  General Compatibility Requirement 
    All development subject to this article shall be compatible with the established architectural character of the city by using a design that is complementary to predominant architectural styles, designs, and forms. Compatibility shall be achieved through techniques such as the repetition of roof lines, the use of similar proportions in building mass and outdoor spaces, similar relationships to the street, similar window and door patterns, and the use of building materials that have color, shades, and textures similar to those existing in the immediate area of the proposed development. 
C.  General Principals - Site 
    The environmental/architectural inventory shall be the foundation on which all site design decisions are based. Minor variations to these regulations may occur based on environmental/architectural conditions at the site. The Planning Director shall approve all site design decisions based on the inventory. 
D.  Building Relocation to Surrounding Properties 
    Buildings shall not significantly overshadow secluded private open spaces or main public area windows into adjacent buildings, insure no significant loss of amenity to adjacent dwellings, open space or streetscape. Buildings shall not significantly block scenic vistas from public view. Active recreation and service areas shall be located away from secluded private open spaces on adjacent buildings. 
E.  Building Aesthetics, Purpose 
    Building aesthetics establish a base criteria related to the appearance of specific structures. These regulations strike a balance between creativity and innovation on one hand, while avoiding obtrusive, incongruous structures on the other. The City strongly discourages architectural styles that do not build upon and promote the existing character of the City. The City supports the view that inspiring, well-maintained, and harmonious development is in the best economic development interests of all residents and businesses. 
F.  Building Design 
1.  Emphasize Human Scale 
Building design shall emphasize a human scale at ground level, at entryways and along street frontages through the creative use of windows, doors, columns, canopies, and awnings. 
2.  Major Building Design Features Proportional 
Major building design features, such as windows, doors, eaves, and parapets shall be designed to be in proportion to one another. 
3.  Structural Lines Retained at Storefront Level 
The structural lines of a building and its materials shall be retained at the storefront level. For instance, brick piers and columns shall be carried down to street level. 
4.  Awnings and Canopies 
Awnings and canopies shall complement the color and material of the building to which they are fixed. 
5.  Massing 
A single, large, dominant building mass shall be avoided. Where large structures are required, mass should be broken up through the use of setbacks, projecting and recessed elements, and similar design techniques. Roofline offsets shall be provided to lend an architectural interest and variety to the massing of a building and to relieve the effect of a single long roof. 
G.  Avoiding Monotony in Design 
    Monotony of design in single or multiple building projects shall be avoided by varying detail, form, and siting to the maximum extent practicable, within the standards set forth in this article, to provide visual interest. 
H.  Harmony of Design 
1.  Purpose 
The purpose of this section is to achieve good design, not a certain stylistic result. It will also establish a consistent framework for assessing proposed development, to protect the visual pattern of the community, and to promote harmony in the visual relationships and transitions between new and older buildings. New buildings shall respect the scale, form, and proportion of existing development. This can be done by repeating building lines and surface treatments and by requiring some uniformity of detail, scale, proportion, texture, materials, color, and building form. 
2.  Building Materials 
Building materials shall either be similar to the materials already being used in the neighborhood or, if dissimilar materials are being proposed, other characteristics such as scale and proportions, form, architectural detailing, color, and texture, shall be utilized to ensure that enough similarity exists for the building to be compatible, despite the differences in materials. All sides of the building shall use materials consistent with those on the front if visible from public streets or neighboring properties, and should be carefully designed with similar detailing, compatible quality, and compatible materials. Materials used only on one (1) face of a structure which gives the impression of thinness and artificiality are prohibited. 
Metal buildings shall be prohibited except as specifically allowed in LI and HI zoning districts. 
3.  Similar Size and Height for Infill Development 
New Infill development shall either be similar in size and height or, if larger, be articulated and subdivided into massing that is proportional to the mass and scale of other structures on the same block, or if no buildings exist thereon, then on adjoining blocks. 
4.  Unify Individual Storefronts 
If several storefronts are located in one (1) building, the individual storefronts shall be unified in all exterior design elements, such as mass, window and door placement, color, materials, and signage. The unified design should represent a theme, rhythm and/or design flow. 
5.  Additions and Renovations 
Building additions and facade renovations should be designed to reflect existing buildings in scale, materials, window treatment, and color. A change in scale may require a transitional design element between the new development and existing buildings. 
6.  Varying Architectural Styles 
In developments with multiple structures of varying architectural styles, buildings shall be compatible by such means as a pattern of architectural features, similar scale and proportions, and consistent location of signage. 
I.  Architectural Character 
1.  Purpose 
Architectural character focuses on the micro-level details that greatly affect the overall appearance of a particular development. These architectural character regulations provide direction in aspects of color, facade materials, rooflines, and the enhancement of entryways. The primary goal is to define the "finishing touches" that provide the development with a sense of permanence, style, and compatibility. The City prohibits proposals that have not taken these materials into account. The City desires that all development be treated as a lasting contributor to the community and as a "good neighbor" to its surroundings. 
2.  Roofs 
a.  Roof lines shall be varied to reduce the scale of structures and add visual interest. Flat roofs and roof pitches less than 3/12 shall include cornices, parapets and/or other detailing. 
b.  Roof shape (for example: flat, hip, mansard, or gable) and material shall be architecturally compatible with facade elements and the rest of the building. 
J.  Facades 
1.  Recesses and Projections 
Facades greater than one hundred (100) feet in length, measured horizontally, must incorporate recesses and projections along at least twenty percent (20%) of the length of the facade. Windows, awnings, and arcades should total at least sixty percent (60%) of the facade length abutting a public street. 
2.  Repeating Design Patterns 
Facades greater than one hundred (100) feet in length, measured horizontally, shall incorporate a repeating pattern of change in color, texture, and material modules. All elements should repeat at intervals of no more than thirty (30) feet, either horizontally or vertically. 
3.  Materials 
Brick, stone, or wood facades shall not be covered or replaced with artificial siding or panels except in residential neighborhoods where the preservation of such facades are economically or environmentally impractical. The use of mirrorized glass is not permitted. 
4.  Exterior Wall Cladding 
All exterior walls visible from a parking lot or public right-of-way shall be clad with the same material required for the front of the building. 
K.  Entryways 
    Each principle building on a site should have a clearly defined, highly visible customer entrance featuring no less than two (2) of the following: canopies or porticos, arcades, arches, wing walls, planters, recesses/projections, raised corniced parapets over the door, peaked roof forms, display windows, and/or architectural details such as tile work and moldings which are integrated into the building structure. Emergency exit doors, service doors and ventilation grates on the first floor and visible from a public street shall be decorative. 
L.  Mechanical Screening 
    Projecting elements like mechanical equipment, utility meters, storage areas, trash enclosures, transformers, generators, propane gas tanks and other utility hardware on the building, roof or ground shall be screened from public view with material similar to the structure or they shall be so located as not to be visible from any public view with materials similar to the structure or they shall be located as not to be visible from any public view or from potential buildings, streets or residences nearby. Rooftop mechanical equipment shall be screened. Abandoned mechanical equipment is prohibited and shall be removed. 
M.  Color and Materials 
1.  Predominant Exterior Building Materials 
Predominant exterior building materials shall be high quality materials, including brick, wood, sandstone, other native stone, and tinted/textured concrete masonry units. Tinted textural concrete masonry, except when used as accent block, is not permitted in the Central Business (CB) District and the Central Business Perimeter (CBP) district. 
2.  Colors 
a.  Facade colors shall be of low reflectance and/or subtle colors. Building trim may feature brighter colors. Neon tubing is not allowed as an accent material. The use of high intensity colors or fluorescent colors shall be prohibited. 
b.  Variations in color schemes are encouraged in order to articulate entryways and public amenities so as to give greater recognition to these features. 
N.  On-Site Storage 
    Storage of inventory, trailers, and containers shall be prohibited unless located within a screened area constructed of the same material as the main building on site. 
Section 6.09 - Guidelines for Structures in the Central Business, Central Business Perimeter and the Municipal Service Districts 
A.  All exterior changes and new construction must be approved by the Downtown Design Review Committee in accordance with the adopted Design Guidelines; except art, which shall be reviewed by the Design Review Committee and approved by City Council. 
B.  Metal exteriors (excluding roofing) in aforementioned districts shall be prohibited. The exteriors shall consist of masonry (excluding common face block, cement block, tilt up panels and dryvit) or other non-metal materials. 
C.  The use of reflective or highly tinted glass is prohibited unless the applicant can demonstrate need for such material because of the use and function of the structure, its commonality with the surrounding structures, and the structure has no historical and/or architectural value. 
D.  The enclosing, bricking in, or covering of windows or door openings shall not be permitted. 
E.  Broken or missing glass in windows and doors shall be replaced within sixty (60) days of official notice by the City of Statesville. 
F.  Dumpsters to be located in the downtown for construction/renovation/demolition are subject to Section 5.03. 
(Ord. No. 04-13, 3-4-2013) 
Section 6.10 - Fencing 
    Chain link and square wire fencing including barbed wire, concertina wire and razor wire are prohibited in the CB, CBP and H-115 Districts. Governmental uses requiring security fencing shall be reviewed by the Downtown Design Review Committee in the CB and CBP and the TRC if located in the H-115 District. Both committees shall review fences in regards to height, coloring, intended use to be secured and the location of the fence on the site. 
ARTICLE 7. - ALTERNATE DEVELOPMENT PATTERNS 
    The provisions of this article describe a variety of desirable development patterns that generally are not facilitated by conventional zoning. These developments should be designed to enhance an improved living environment through open space/recreation, connectivity and architectural standards. 

Section 7.01 - Cluster Subdivisions 
A.  The purpose of cluster developments is to provide creative and innovative single family developments that minimize land disturbances and maximize the preservation and conservation of sensitive natural areas and open space by grouping dwellings in clusters through: 
1.  Variation of lot sizes, and use of open space; 
2.  Maintenance and restrictive use of open space; 
3.  Integration of existing and potential development adjoining the cluster subdivision. 
B.  Cluster subdivisions shall be processed as major subdivisions pursuant to Section 2.03.

(Ord. No. 02-15, 3-2-2015) 
Section 7.02 - Architecturally Integrated Cluster Subdivisions 
A.  The purpose of this section is to provide flexibility for creative, higher quality architectural residential developments with open space in R-5, R-5MF, R-8 and R-8MF zoning districts, for developments having a minimum of three (3) acres in regards to minimum lot sizes, lot widths, and setbacks. This section is designed to provide flexibility consistent with public health and safety without increasing overall densities permitted within any residential zoning district. 
B.  In any architecturally integrated subdivision, lots may be created and structures constructed without regard to minimum lot size, lot width, or setback requirements except that: 
1.  Side and rear yard setbacks shall apply where and to the extent that the subdivided tract abuts land that is not inclusive of the subdivision. A five-foot reduction in the rear yard setback is permitted provided that opaque screening is installed along the rear yard boundary.

C.  Street Construction and Materials 
    Street construction and materials shall comply with City street construction standards, procedures and policies, as well as the following subgrade, base and pavement material and construction specifications: 
1.  Tests: All tests and data described below shall be conducted or provided and paid for by the paving contractor or the developer. Test results shall be submitted to the Public Works Department for review and/or approval. 
2.  Subgrade: Embankments shall be constructed in eight (8) to twelve (12) inch lifts. Individual lifts shall be compacted using sheep's foot rollers, vibratory compactors, pneumatic tire rollers or other equipment capable of obtaining the required compaction. The surface of the completed subgrade shall be bladed to a smooth and uniform texture. The centerline profile shall conform to the established elevations with an acceptable tolerance of +/- one-half (1/2) inch. The acceptable tolerance under a template conforming to the designed cross-section shall be +/- one-quarter (1/4) inch. Soil density tests shall be performed on roadway fills four (4) feet in height and greater or as requested by the City Engineer. The compaction tests will be performed to within twelve (12) inches of the final grade of the subgrade. For the fills requiring compaction tests they shall be compacted to ninety-five percent (95%) of maximum dry density per the standard proctor test (ASTM D698, AASHTO T99). One (1) set of compaction tests shall be performed on every other twelve (12) inch lift at one hundred (100) foot intervals along the roadway fill section. An independent party selected by the developer's engineer and approved by the City Engineer shall perform the tests. Where the subgrade compaction is determined to be less than the required degree, the developer shall remove, replace, and/or recompact the section in question, or use other means approved by the Public Works Department, until the density is determined to meet the required limit. Copies of all test results shall be submitted to the Public Works Department. The compaction of the top twelve (12) inches of the subgrade shall be inspected by proof rolling. The subgrade shall have sufficient stability to support any and all types of construction equipment used to construct the roadway without "pumping" (vertical and/or horizontal displacement of the subgrade). The "proof-roll" compaction inspection of the subgrade shall be by a vehicle with a minimum gross vehicle weight of twenty-four thousand (24,000) pounds, fully loaded with a minimum of sixteen (16) tons (thirty-two thousand (32,000) pounds) of graded aggregate (fifty-four thousand (54,000) pounds total weight minimum). The weight of the proof-roll inspection vehicle and the accompanying load shall be shown on a printed "load-out" ticket from a reputable quarry. The Public Works Department shall approve all subgrades. The contractor, at the contractor's expense, shall correct any areas not passing the proof roll inspection. 
3.  Concrete Pavement: 
a.  Written approval of the City Engineer shall be obtained for any use of concrete pavement. 
b.  Concrete pavement compressive strength shall be four thousand (4,000) psi at twenty-eight (28) days. Concrete test cylinders will be taken from each batch poured for every seven hundred fifty (750) feet of street-paving construction. These shall be tested according to ASTM C31-69 and C39-72 to ascertain the twenty-eight (28) day compressive strength. 
c.  A concrete slump test (ASTM C143-74) will be conducted at the same time that the cylinders are made. The concrete shall not be accepted which has a slump value greater than two and one-half (21/2) inches. 
d.  Core samples shall be made at intervals of not less than five hundred (500) feet and not more than one thousand (1,000) feet of paving. Core sample report must be approved by the Public Works Department prior to final plat approval. 
4.  Asphalt Pavement: 
a.  Placement of the base material and asphalt shall be inspected and approved by the Public Works Department as specified below. The paving contractor/developer is responsible for requesting such inspections, and placement of base and/or asphalt shall not be done until such inspections have been scheduled. 
b.  The compacted base course (graded aggregate or crusher run) shall have sufficient stability to support any and all types of construction equipment used to construct the roadway without "pumping" (vertical and/or horizontal displacement of the base due to any number of factors including too much water, not enough compactive effort, etc.), regardless of compaction. The "proof-roll" compaction inspection of the graded aggregate base shall be by a vehicle with a minimum gross vehicle weight of twenty-four thousand (24,000) pounds, fully loaded with a minimum of sixteen (16) tons (thirty-two thousand (32,000) pounds) of graded aggregate (fifty-four thousand (54,000) pounds total weight minimum). The weight of the proof-roll inspection vehicle and the accompanying load shall be shown on a printed "load-out" ticket from a reputable quarry. A representative of Public Works shall inspect all graded aggregate bases. The contractor, at the contractor's expense, shall correct any areas not passing the proof-roll inspection. 
c.  The graded aggregate base thickness, as required in the current Development regulations, shall not be deficient in any area by more than one-half (1/2) total inches. Any deficient area shall be corrected by adding additional quantities of the same materials and rebuilt to the desired thickness. The contractor, at contractor's expense, and during the proof-roll compaction inspection process, shall do the measurement. Three (3) holes shall be dug every one thousand five hundred (1,500) feet or one (1) hole per each five hundred (500) feet, to confirm the required thickness. At least one (1) hole shall be dug for any areas less than the above footage. The Public Works Department shall determine the hole(s)' location and confirm the depth of graded aggregate base. 
d.  Core samples shall be taken of the asphalt at intervals of not less than three hundred (300) feet and not more than five hundred (500) feet. Samples shall be taken from the center of the travel lane and samples shall alternate between travel lanes. The thickness of the asphalt shall not be less than one-quarter (1/4) inch from the plan dimensions. Core sample report must be approved by the City Engineer prior to final plat approval. If the core sample report indicates a deficiency in thickness of the street base and asphalt pavement a minimum one (1) inch overlay shall be required when the following deficiencies occur. 
(1)  When the number of cores deficient in thickness within the allowable one-quarter (1/4) of an inch tolerance exceeds thirty-five percent (35%) of the total cores taken on one (1) street. 
(2)  When two (2) or more consecutive tests show a deficiency of more than one-quarter (1/4) of an inch allowable tolerance. When a core shows a deficiency in excess of the allowable tolerance additional cores will be taken to delineate the area of the deficient thickness. 
(3)  Any required overlay shall extend a minimum of one hundred fifty (150) feet beyond the outer limits of the deficient area for the full width of the street. Smooth, neat joints shall be saw cut normal to the roadway for full depth of asphalt pavement, removing the original pavement for a minimum of ten (10) feet at each end of the overlay. The thickness of the overlay shall be determined by the depth of the deficient area and shall not be less than one (1) inch in compacted thickness. The type of material used in the overlay shall be specified by the City. 
D.  Traffic Control 
    Traffic control devices shall be provided for new development pursuant to standards adopted by the City and NCDOT, MUTCD Manual.

E.  Access Standards 
1.  Purpose: The purpose of regulating the amount and nature of vehicular access points is to balance the need for providing access to individual private properties with the need to preserve an adequate level of capacity on the streets providing access. Vehicular access restrictions may be required to be shown on subdivision plats. 
2.  Access to Primary Arterials: Where a residential subdivision borders on or contains an existing or proposed primary arterial, the City may require that access to such streets be limited by one (1) of the following means: 
a.  Lots shall back onto the primary arterial and front onto a parallel local street; no access shall be provided from the primary arterial; or 
b.  A series of cul-de-sacs, U-shaped streets, or short loops entered from and designed generally at right angles to the primary arterial; or 
c.  A marginal access or service road (separated from the primary arterial by a ten (10) foot wide planting strip and having access at suitable points). 
3.  Railroads and Limited Access Highways: Railroad rights-of-way and limited access highways, where so located as to affect the subdivision of adjoining lands, shall be treated as follows: 
a.  In residential districts, a Type E Buffer Yard shall be provided adjacent to the railroad right-of-way or limited access highway. This strip shall be part of the platted lots and shall be designated on the plat. 
b.  In districts zoned for business, commercial or industrial uses, wherever practicable, the nearest street extending parallel or approximately parallel to the railroad right-of-way shall be at a sufficient distance from the railroad right-of-way to ensure suitable depth for commercial or industrial sites. 
c.  When streets parallel to the railroad right-of-way intersect a street that crosses the railroad right-of-way at grade, they shall, to the extent practicable, be at a distance of at least one hundred fifty (150) feet from the railroad right-of-way. Such distance shall be determined with due consideration of the minimum distance required for future separation of grades by means of appropriate approach gradients. 
4.  Driveway Permits: A driveway permit, issued by the City Engineer, is required prior to the construction of any new access point. When a traffic impact analysis is required, no driveway permit will be issued until the traffic impact analysis process has been completed. Any non-residential change in use resulting in the following will require a new driveway permit: 
a.  an increase of greater than fifty (50) peak hour trips, or 
b.  a ten percent (10%) increase in average daily trips, or 
c.  over ten (10) additional daily vehicle trips made by vehicles exceeding thirty thousand (30,000) pounds in gross vehicle weight. 
For the purposes of evaluating driveway permit requests, the boundary of the site is considered to be all contiguous parcels under the same ownership on the date of adoption of this provision. 
5.  Driveway Design Standards: 
a.  Dimensions: The minimum driveway width shall be thirteen (13) feet for residential and twenty-five (25) feet for non-residential land uses, and the maximum driveway width shall be twenty-four (24) feet for residential and thirty (30) feet for non-residential land uses. The minimum concrete thickness shall be six (6) inches. 
b.  Approach: The driveways adjacent to paved roads shall provide a concrete driveway approach from the property line to the roadbed edge unless otherwise approved by the City Engineer. 
c.  Multiple-Frontage Lots: When a residential lot has multiple frontages, the driveway(s) shall be located on the street with the lowest functional classification except where the City Engineer determines that commercial traffic would introduce excessive traffic to a local residential street. 
6.  Reserved. 
7.  Design Objectives: In reviewing an application for a driveway permit for any non-residential or multi-family use, the City Engineer shall determine that the following objectives have been met: 
a.  Adequate corner clearance from any adjacent street intersections has been provided to preserve the functional integrity of the intersection, and spacing from adjacent driveways is sufficient to safely minimize conflicts between traffic entering and exiting adjacent driveways; 
b.  Adequate stopping sight distance and intersection sight distance are provided; 
c.  Auxiliary turn lanes are provided as needed to: 
(1)  minimize speed differentials with mainline highway traffic, 
(2)  prevent the encroachment of turning vehicles on mainline traffic, and 
(3)  prevent the queuing of inbound traffic from impacting mainline traffic. 
d.  Sufficient storage distance between the curb line and the first point of conflict for traffic on the site is provided to prevent the backup of traffic onto public streets. This distance shall be adequate to absorb the maximum peak period inbound traffic during the normal weekday; 
e.  Appropriate conflict reduction measures have been provided to safely manage inbound and outbound traffic. Median design features and driveway channelization shall be used as appropriate to accomplish conflict reduction; 
f.  Access locations have been properly offset from driveways or street intersections located across the roadway in order to limit conflicts within the mainline or median of the street; 
g.  The design of the access satisfies standard geometric guidelines for turning radii, driveway slope, angle of entry, design speed and width. The access grade within the public right-of-way shall not exceed three percent (3%). The drainage design of the access should not interfere with the drainage system in the public right-of-way; 
h.  The access provides for the safe crossing of pedestrians, the handicapped and bicyclists; 
i.  The installation of necessary traffic control devices for the safe and proper operation of the access meet the requirements adopted by the City and in the case of traffic signals, are located so as to allow for proper signal coordination and adequate left turn storage needs at the access and nearby intersections; 
j.  No single family or two-family lot smaller than one (1) acre shall be created which is accessed from an arterial street or a major collector street; 
k.  These standards are not intended to preclude access to existing lots. Where the City's standards would preclude access to a lot, the Planning Board may vary the access standard. 
8.  Substandard Access: Where the access standards or design objectives of this section cannot be met, the City Engineer shall be guided by the following process in determining whether substandard access may be permitted. 
a.  The City Engineer shall first determine whether alternate access to another street that meets the standards of the Code. 
b.  Where alternate access opportunities are determined not to exist, the City Engineer may grant a reduction in spacing standards of up to twenty percent (20%). 
c.  If after considering alternatives under (1) and (2) above, the City Engineer determines that no feasible alternatives exist, a substandard access permit may be granted subject to variance provisions and the following findings: 
(1)  Conditions or circumstances exist which limit the strict application of the requirements of this Code, including the lack of a secondary access to another public street, the inability to use joint access, and the lack of engineering or construction solutions that can be applied to mitigate the condition; 
(2)  The proposed access will not result in undue delay or congestion or be detrimental to the safety of motoring public using the roadway; and 
(3)  The limiting access will create an exceptional and undue hardship on the applicant and that the permit issued will allow a reasonable use of the property. 
9.  Acceleration and Deceleration Lanes: For any driveway or street located on an arterial street, except driveways serving one (1) to five (5) single-family residences, acceleration and deceleration lanes shall be provided. The minimum length for deceleration lanes shall be one hundred twenty (120) feet for collector streets or two hundred (200) feet for arterial streets except that either the City Engineer or the State Department of Transportation's district traffic and safety engineer, as applicable, may specify longer or shorter lanes based on grade, distance from an intersection, design speed, etc. The City Engineer shall make recommendations to the district traffic engineer on the need for and design of acceleration lanes on State routes. The City Engineer shall determine the need for and design specifications for acceleration lanes along City streets. 
10.  Sight Distance and Alignment: All driveways shall be located and streets aligned so as to provide at least the horizontal and vertical sight distances listed below. All sight distances shall be determined by the methods found in the latest edition of A Policy on Geometric Design of Highways and Streets (AASHTO). The developer shall cut such ground or vegetation (including trees) to the extent necessary to provide adequate sight distance. 
a.  Horizontal sight distance refers to the ability to detect objects in the roadway while negotiating a horizontal curve. The distance is measured from a point at which the height of the driver's eye is three and one-half (3.50) feet above the roadway to a stationary object having a height of six (6) inches above the roadway. 
Arterial streets 500 feet Collector streets 350 feet Local streets 200 feet  
b.  Vertical sight distance refers to the ability to detect an object in the roadway while negotiating the crest of a hill. The distance is measured the same as for horizontal curves. 
20 mph design 150 ft. sight distance 25 mph design 175 ft. sight distance 30 mph design 200 ft. sight distance 35 mph design 240 ft. sight distance 40 mph design 275 ft. sight distance 50 mph design 350 ft. sight distance  
In approaches to intersections, there shall be a leveling of the street at a grade not exceeding four percent (4%) for a distance of not less than fifty (50) feet from the nearest right-of-way of the intersecting street. 
c.  Horizontal curve design shall be in accordance with good engineering practice considering probable traffic speed, traffic volume and other appropriate factors. In no event shall horizontal curves have a radius of less than one hundred fifty (150) feet. Super-elevation of curves shall be limited to high-speed thoroughfares. There shall be provided a tangent of at least one hundred (100) feet between reverse curves. 
d.  Vertical curve design shall be in accordance with good engineering design, considering traffic and drainage factors. In general, vertical curves shall not be less than one hundred (100) feet in length. 
F.  Oversizing Streets 
1.  Responsibility: Where a designated street, according the Comprehensive Transportation Plan, runs through the proposed subdivision, the applicant shall be responsible for the construction of such street to a collector street standard. 
2.  Reimbursement and Costs: If the designated street exceeds the collector standard, the applicant may be required to construct the designated street subject to reimbursement by the City for the construction cost of the difference between the collector street and arterial street. Should reimbursement funds by the City not be available, the applicant's responsibility for construction shall be limited to a collector standard; however, the design shall be modified to facilitate future expansion of such street. Any required improvements deleted by the City Engineer in order to facilitate the future street expansion shall not relieve the responsibility of the subdivider for such improvements. The cost of such deleted improvements shall be paid to the City. Such monies shall be deposited in a street construction fund such as a transportation improvement fee fund, which may be expended by the City Council for the purpose of construction of arterial and collector streets within the City. Should the subdivider make such payments, he shall be relieved of any obligation for the completion of such deleted improvements. 
G.  Other Improvements 
1.  Sidewalks and Pedestrian Paths Standards: 
a.  Required: Sidewalks or pedestrian paths shall be required along all streets, except where Council has approved use of the alternate Industrial Street Standard. 
b.  Surrounding Areas: Sidewalks or pedestrian paths shall be required along all streets located within the City or ETJ, unless otherwise approved by the City Council. 
c.  Design: Walkways shall be designed to comply with the Americans with Disabilities Act, provided that the Council may approve a different standard for walkways across private property. 
d.  Location: All required walkways shall be located within a dedicated right-of-way or access easement. A median strip of grass or landscaped area at least two and one-half (2.5) feet wide shall separate all sidewalks from adjacent curbs unless approved by the City Engineer. 
e.  Easements: Sidewalk and path easements shall be a minimum of ten (10) feet in width if adjacent to a public street or land. The minimum width of the sidewalk/path easement between the rear or side lot lines of a parcel shall be fifteen (15) feet, unless approved otherwise by the City Council. 
2.  Street Signs: 
a.  The applicant shall deposit with the local government at the time of final subdivision approval the set fee for each road sign required by the City Engineer. The developer shall install all road signs before issuance of a Certificate of Occupancy for any residence on the streets approved. Street name signs shall be placed at all intersections within or abutting the subdivision, the type and location of which shall be approved by the City Engineer. 
b.  Developers shall be responsible for placing street signs and traffic signs in accordance with these regulations. All required signs shall be in place prior to the approval of final subdivision. 
c.  Major street name signs shall be installed above the intersecting local street name sign. A street name sign shall be installed for every street at an intersection. Standard street name signs shall have at least four-inch high letters for major thoroughfares and at least three-inch high letters for local streets. 
d.  Traffic control devices to include signs, signals, street markings, etc., shall be installed by the developer. The type and location of traffic control devices shall be determined by the City Engineer based upon the latest edition of the Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices. Stop signs shall be installed at every intersection. 
3.  Street Lighting: Installation of street lights shall be required in accordance with design and specification standards approved by the Director of Electric Utilities. Developers should make early contact with the applicable power company in order for a lighting plan to be developed, approved and installed in a timely manner. 
4.  Utilities: 
a.  Location: All existing utility facilities throughout the subdivision shall be shown on the preliminary plan and located in compliance with City standards. In addition, all proposed utility facilities, except electric should be shown on the preliminary plan. (Note: Electric Utility facilities are designed and installed by the applicable electric utility.) 
b.  Easements: Easements as required by the City Engineer shall be provided for utilities (private and municipal) and such easements shall be at least twelve (12) feet wide. Proper coordination shall be established between the subdivider and the applicable utility companies for the establishment of utility easements established in adjoining properties. 
c.  Slopes from the back of curb to the edge of right-of-way shall be no greater than one-quarter (1/4) foot to one (1) foot to accommodate utility installation. 
d.  Where the alternative Industrial Street Standard has been approved, road shoulders shall be sloped away from the edge of pavement at one-half (1/2) inch per twelve (12) inches, for a minimum distance of six (6) feet, followed by a six-foot wide ditch with 3:1 sides. 
5.  Street Trees: Street trees shall be planted unless the Board of Adjustment, upon recommendation of the City Arborist/Line Clearance Supervisor, grants a variance. The variance shall be granted only if there are trees growing along the right-of-way or on the abutting property that, in the opinion of the Board of Adjustment, comply with these regulations. 
H.  Traffic Impact Analysis 
    The purpose of a traffic impact analysis (TIA) is to assess the impact of a proposed development on the existing transportation system. A TIA will (1) ensure that the transportation network has adequate capacity to handle projected transportation demand associated with the project, (2) identify problems with the transportation system, (3) delineate solutions to identified problems, and (4) identify improvements to be incorporated into the proposed development. 
1.  TIA Required. Applicants for development authorization in which the proposed development, redevelopment, or change of use is expected to generate three thousand (3,000) or more trips daily shall have prepared by a qualified professional a TIA meeting the guidelines established in this section. In addition to the foregoing, the City Engineer or Planning Director shall have the discretion to require a TIA when there are localized safety or capacity deficiencies or a proposed access is within one thousand (1,000) feet of an interchange or where known problems exist or are anticipated. 
2.  Pre-submittal Conference. An applicant for development authorization for any project expected to meet or exceed the TIA threshold specified in Section 1, above, shall schedule a pre-submittal conference with the City. The engineering firm selected to prepare the TIA shall attend this meeting. The purpose of the meeting is to establish the study area, the trip distribution, the traffic counts to be utilized, approved developments in the area, pass-by and internal capture percentages, additional hours of analysis, if required (other than a.m. or p.m. peak), and resolve any other questions specific to the site. 
3.  TIA Submission. Three (3) copies of the TIA, if required, shall accompany the application for development authorization. The TIA shall be prepared by a licensed engineer registered to practice in the State of North Carolina who shall have traffic assessment and transportation management experience. At a minimum, the TIA shall include the following: 
(a)  Study purpose and objectives. 
(b)  Description of the site and study area boundaries including appropriate mapping and rationale for selection of the study area boundaries. 
(c)  A summary of existing conditions including, but not limited to, surrounding street and key intersection traffic volumes (daily and peak-hour), turning movements, capacities, safety deficiencies, and funded transportation improvements. 
(d)  Anticipated or approved development in the area. 
(e)  Trip generation, trip distribution, and discussion of the following: 
(1)  Trip generation rates shall be based on trip generation rates contained in the latest edition of Trip Generation published by the Institute of Transportation Engineers (ITE). The applicant shall also provide the ITE code used to identify the development trip generation rate and assumptions used or data collected for any variations from generally accepted ITE rates or equations. 
(2)  Pass-by trip factors and assumptions. 
(3)  Internal trip assumptions for mixed use developments. 
(4)  Trip distribution assumptions. 
(f)  Projection of future traffic volumes and assessment of future roadway and intersection operating conditions for the year of the ultimate completion of the project. All projections should specifically document projected background traffic as well as the traffic generated by the proposed development. If the project is to be phased; projections for each phase of the development is required. If the unphased build-out period of the project is greater than nine (9) years, then a minimum of one (1) intermediate and one (1) full build-out projection is required. All projections and assessments should include the following three (3) scenarios: 
(1)  No build.
