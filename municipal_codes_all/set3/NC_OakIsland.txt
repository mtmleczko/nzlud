PREFACE 
    This Code constitutes a codification of the general and permanent ordinances of the Town of Oak Island, North Carolina. 
    Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the ordinances adopted by the town council. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this Code, the reader can locate any ordinance included herein. 
    The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order, and the various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Notes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state law have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this Code. 
Chapter and Section Numbering System 
    The chapter and section numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and local government codes. Each section number consists of two parts separated by a dash. The figure before the dash refers to the chapter number, and the figure after the dash refers to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the second section of chapter 1 is numbered 1-2, and the first section of chapter 6 is 6-1. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter, and at the same time new sections can be inserted in their proper place by using the decimal system for amendments. For example, if new material consisting of one section that would logically come between sections 6-1 and 6-2 is desired to be added, such new section would be numbered 6-1.5. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject. The next successive number shall be assigned to the new article or division. New chapters may be included by using one of the reserved chapter numbers. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. 
Page Numbering System 
    The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the volume. The number to the right of the colon represents the number of the page in that portion. In the case of a chapter of the Code, the number to the left of the colon indicates the number of the chapter. In the case of an appendix to the Code, the letter immediately to the left of the colon indicates the letter of the appendix. The following are typical parts of codes of ordinances, which may or may not appear in this Code at this time, and their corresponding prefixes: 
CHARTER CHT:1 CHARTER COMPARATIVE TABLE CHTCT:1 CODE CD1:1 CODE APPENDIX CDA:1 CODE COMPARATIVE TABLES CCT:1 STATE LAW REFERENCE TABLE SLT:1 CHARTER INDEX CHTi:1 CODE INDEX CDi:1  
Indexes 
    The indexes have been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the indexes themselves which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which the user is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
    A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up-to-date. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited, and the affected page or pages will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
    Keeping this publication up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. As revised pages are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
Acknowledgments 
    This publication was under the direct supervision of Jan N. Shekitka, Senior Code Attorney, and Robert MacNaughton, Editor, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida. Credit is gratefully given to the other members of the publisher's staff for their sincere interest and able assistance throughout the project. 
    The publisher is most grateful to the town's staff for their cooperation and assistance during the progress of the work on this publication. It is hoped that their efforts and those of the publisher have resulted in a Code of Ordinances which will make the active law of the town readily accessible to all citizens and which will be a valuable tool in the day-to-day administration of the town's affairs.

(k)  The ballots used in a recall election shall submit the following proposition: 
"[ ] FOR [ ] AGAINST 
The recall of (name and title of elected official)." 
(l)  If less than a majority of the votes cast on the question of recalling an elected official are for recall, the elected official shall continue in office for the remainder of the unexpired term and, except as provided by subsection (n) of this section, shall be subject to recall as before. If a majority of the votes are for the recall of the elected official designated on the ballot, the elected official shall, regardless of any defects in the recall petition, be deemed removed from office on the date the Board of Elections certifies the results of the recall election. 
(m)  If an elected official concerning whom a sufficient recall petition is submitted to the Town Council resigns before the recall election or is removed from office as a result of the recall election, the vacancy shall be filled in the manner provided by Section 4.3 or Section 4.4 of this Charter for filling vacancies in that office, except as provided in subsection (o) of this section. An elected official who resigns after a sufficient petition for his or her recall has been submitted to the Town Council or who is removed from office by the voters as a result of a recall election shall not be appointed to fill the vacancy caused by that elected official's own resignation or removal. 
(n)  No recall petition shall be filed in accordance with subsection (d) of this section against an elected official who has been subjected to a recall election, and not removed thereby, until at least six months after that recall election. No recall petition shall be filed in accordance with subsection (d) of this section against an elected official during the first three months of the term of that office or during the six months before the expiration of the term of that office. 
(o)  If the recall of two or more members of the Town Council or the recall of the Mayor and one or more members of the Town Council are effected at a single recall election, the successors of the elected officials recalled shall be elected by the registered voters of the Town at a special municipal election, and the successors shall serve for the remainder of the terms of the elected officials recalled. The members of the Town Council who have not been recalled shall call that special election, which shall be conducted by the Brunswick County Board of Elections under the laws then governing elections in the State. If the recall of all or a majority of the members of the Town Council is effected at a single election, they shall continue in office for the purpose, and only for the purpose, of calling a special municipal election for the election of their successors as provided in this section. That election shall also be conducted by successors of the officials recalled shall be elected by the registered voters of the Town at a special municipal election, and the successors shall serve for the remainder of the terms of the officials recalled. The members of the Town Council who have not been recalled shall call that special election, which shall be conducted by the Brunswick County Board of Elections under the laws then governing elections in the State.

Sec. 4-49. - Dangerous dog or other dangerous animal. 
(a)  Definitions. As used in this division, the following terms shall have the meanings set forth below: 
    At large means when a determined dangerous dog or other dangerous animal(s) is off the premises of the owner and not under restraint or is not confined to a secure enclosure while on the premises of the owner, it shall be deemed at large. 
    Dangerous or vicious dog means a dog that has been determined by the animal control officer to be dangerous or vicious in accordance with the definition in section 4-1. 
    Owner means any person, group of persons, firm, partnership or corporation owning, keeping, harboring, having charge of or taking care of a dangerous dog or other dangerous animal. 
    Owner's premises means any real property owned or leased by the owner of the dog, but does not include any public right-of-way or a common area of a condominium, apartment complex, or townhouse development. 
    Restraint means that a dangerous or vicious dog or animal is firmly under the control of a person by means of a leash, chain, or rope, of reasonable length, at all times. For purposes of this section, tying a dangerous or vicious dog, or dangerous animal to a stake, pipe, tree or any other stationary object shall not constitute restraint. When the animal is not under the control of a person by means of a leash, "restraint" shall mean confinement to a secure building or enclosure deemed appropriate by the animal control officer. 
    Secure building or enclosure means an enclosure from which a dangerous dog or other dangerous animal cannot escape unless freed by an owner. 
(b)  Exemption. This division shall not apply to a dog being used by a law enforcement officer to carry out the law enforcement officer's official duties, or a dog being used in a lawful hunt, or a dog where the injury inflicted by the dog was sustained by a person who, at the time of the injury, was committing a willful trespass or tort, was tormenting, abusing, or assaulting the dog, had tormented, abused, or assaulted the dog or was committing or attempting to commit a crime. 
(c)  [ Determination; appeal. ] The animal control officer is designated as the person responsible for determining when a dog is "dangerous or vicious"; and a separate board, consisting of at least three members, shall be appointed by town council to hear any appeals. When the animal control officer makes a determination that a dog is "dangerous or vicious," the owner must be notified in writing, and reasons given for the determination. This written notification shall be sent by certified mail with a return receipt requested. The owner may appeal the determination by filing written objections with the hearing board within three days of the date the certified notification was delivered and signed by the recipient. The hearing board shall schedule a hearing within ten days of the filing of the objections. Any appeal from the final decision of such hearing board shall be taken to the superior court by filing notice of appeal and a petition for review within ten days of the final decision of the hearing board. Appeals from rulings of the hearing board shall be heard in the superior court division. The appeal shall be heard de novo before a superior court judge sitting in Brunswick County. 
(d)  [ Prohibition from public beach/public beach access. ] It shall be unlawful at all times for a dangerous or vicious dog to be taken on a public beach access or on the public beach. If any dangerous or vicious dog is found in violation of this subsection, the dog's owner shall be guilty of a misdemeanor and will be fined $500.00 for each offense.

ARTICLE IV. - DECKS, WALKWAYS AND STEPS 

Sec. 8-121. - Repair and replacement of decks, walkways and steps in the sea turtle habitat restoration area and the harbor sand placement project area. 
(a)  Where this section refers to the term "dunes," it shall mean those dunes then in existence on December 10, 1999, or those restored by the town prior to the placement of any sand from the sea turtle project or placement of sand from any other sand placement project. 
(b)  This section will apply to all oceanfront private property owner applications for permits for construction, repair or replacement of all decks, walkways and steps to be used for the purpose of gaining access to the public beach from private property along the oceanfront in the town. 
(c)  No part of the structure or supporting members of any deck, walkway or steps will be allowed to rest on public property. For the purposes of this section, private property ends and public property begins at the mean high water mark as surveyed by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers prior to the placement of sand for the sea turtle project or other sand placement project. 
(d)  Street-end access points will employ sand walkovers except those required to be elevated by the project cooperation agreement in the sea turtle project and at the town-designated disability access sites. 
(e)  For the purpose of establishing access points between town-owned and town-maintained street-end access points, sand walkover access paths shall be located at approximately 180-foot intervals in 750 feet wide blocks and at approximately 157-foot intervals where blocks between town-owned street-end access points are approximately 320 feet wide. Town staff is authorized to vary distances between access points established between town-owned street-end access points as may be necessary to accomplish as nearly as possible equal distance between access points. Access paths in the sea turtle project area shall be approximately six feet wide except in those areas designated for emergency vehicle access and town equipment access which may be up to ten feet in width. Access paths outside the sea turtle project area and in the area of the harbor project shall be up to ten feet in width as the town staff determines necessary for emergency vehicle access and access for town equipment. Emergency vehicle and town equipment access points shall be designated by town staff and clearly marked as such. Unless required by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers pursuant to the project cooperation agreement or other U.S. Army Corps of Engineers agency rule, wooden walkways or walkovers from private property onto public property will not be permitted. For purposes of this section, private property ends and public property begins at the mean high water mark as surveyed by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers prior to the placement of sand for the sea turtle project or other sand placement project. 
(f)  To protect and promote the vegetation placed by the town on the new sand dunes as required by the project cooperation agreement in the sea turtle project and for the purpose of protecting and promoting vegetation placed by the town on the new sand dunes in the area of the harbor project, pedestrian foot traffic shall not be allowed across sand dune areas vegetated by the town. The town shall install sand fencing along the landward side of the new sand dune and post and rope fencing on the seaward side of the new dune in the area of the sea turtle project. In the area of the harbor project, similar sand fencing shall be put in place as areas are vegetated by the town or it volunteers. Consistent with the number of access paths required between town-owned street-end access points, exact location of sand fencing and post and rope fencing on the sand dunes in the area of the harbor project may be varied in the discretion of town staff as the beach profile and vegetation patterns become more established. Sand fencing will be placed in a "U" configuration at accesses (from "U" post and rope will be used to mark or delineate access). This vegetation will also be protected by enforcement of the town's existing provisions preventing walking, running, etc., across sand dunes, and violations shall be subject to the penalty provisions of section 1-7. 
(g)  Individual property owner access to the public beach will continue as before with the construction, repair or replacement of decks, walkways and steps being governed by the prior ordinance as readopted and clarified by this section. Placement of sand fencing and rope and post fencing shall not be done in such a manner as would impair an oceanfront property owner from direct entry onto the public beach from his private property. For the purposes of this section, private property ends and public property begins at the mean high water mark as determined by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers' survey as described herein. 
(h)  Garbage receptacles will be placed by the town on the seaward side of each town-owned street-end access point and also on the landward side of the street-end access points. Other garbage receptacles may, at the discretion of town staff, depending on the amount of usage, be placed at on the seaward and/or landward side of nonstreet-end access points. 
(i)  This section is intended by the town to govern construction, repair and replacement of decks, walkways and steps for all oceanfront private property owners in the town and access to and across the public beach in the sea turtle project area and the harbor project area.

Sec. 14-1. - Regulation of bulkheads on town street ends. 
(a)  Vertical bulkheads shall be the primary approved method of erosion control on public rights-of-way abutting any protected waters (i.e., waterway and estuarine waters). Exceptions may be made, with a recommendation by the estuarine shoreline stabilization committee, to test other methods of erosion control, such as wood or stone breakwaters, on a case-by-case basis. 
(b)  Bulkheads shall be constructed of vinyl (preferred) or 2.5 salt-treated lumber or other industry approved material. Riprap material shall not be considered approved materials, with the exception that appropriate riprap (i.e., quarried stone 12 inches or greater in size) may be used, with approval of the public works directors, to: 
(1)  Stabilize drainage outfall areas at road ends where vertical bulkheads would be an unsuitable solution to an erosion problem, or 
(2)  Correct accelerated erosion areas at the corners of older, existing town-owned street end bulkheads where the adjacent properties were not originally, nor have since, been bulkheaded. 
(c)  Bulkheads, and associated access stairways, shall be constructed in accordance with public works' specifications and Coastal Area Management Act guidelines, and such construction shall be approved, permitted and inspected by the building inspections department. 
(d)  It is preferred that new bulkheads be constructed in rights-of-ways where adjacent property owners have, or are about to, bulkhead their properties or install other approved erosion control devices. 
(e)  Access stairways shall be constructed at each new or replacement street end bulkhead location at the same time such new/replacement bulkhead is constructed, or as soon as practical thereafter. As funds are available, access stairways shall also be constructed at street end locations where bulkheads have been previously built without access stairways. Exception to the above requirement may be made for those locations where the public works director deems that access stairway construction would be unsafe or imprudent due to the condition of the site. 
(f)  The town shall pay for the total cost of bulkheads, and associated access stairways, on unimproved street ends on an "as needed" basis, but only when funds are available. All other costs for adjacent property bulkheads or other work shall be borne by such adjacent property owners. When feasible, within the above stipulations, priority shall be given to constructing street end bulkheads at the same time as the adjacent property owners so that construction of bulkhead wing walls can be avoided and the overall coast of construction correspondingly reduced. 
(g)  The total cost of street end bulkheads and associated improvements per this section shall include but not be limited to bulkheads, wing walls, deadmen, tie backs, backfill, grading, seeding, access stairways, fencing and decking.

The director of development services or his/her designee may, at staff discretion, allow a longer period for abatement of the nuisance if he believes circumstances warrant. An appeal application of staff's notice of violation determination would trigger such an enforcement abatement period until the board of adjustment appeal hearing is closed. 
(b)  Abatement of a public nuisance shall consist of taking whatever appropriate steps are reasonably necessary to remove the conditions which result in the declaration of a public nuisance. Without limitation, the director of development services or his designee, in ordering the abatement of a public nuisance, may require the removal of debris, rubbish, accumulations of animal or vegetable matter, growth of weeds and grass, burned or partially burned buildings, the isolation of the condition to be abated so that access cannot be gained by persons or property which may be injured by the nuisance or such other steps which are reasonably necessary to abate the nuisance.

(b)  Costs. The actual cost incurred by the town in removing or otherwise remedying a public nuisance shall be charged to the owner of such lot or parcel of land; and it shall be the duty of the tax collector to mail a statement of such charges to the owner or other person in possession of such premises with instructions that such charges are due and payable within 30 days from the mailing of such statement. If such costs charged in accordance with this subsection are not paid as stated, the costs shall be a lien upon the land or premises where the nuisance arose and shall be collected as unpaid taxes.

The town may also recover from the violator the town's cost of inspection, services of notices and costs incurred for abatement of the nuisance. Each day that the violation shall continue or be carried on shall constitute an additional, separate violation. 
    A civil penalty of up to $250.00 per day is hereby imposed for each day beyond the time allowed for abatement of the nuisance until the nuisance is abated. If a violator fails to pay the civil penalty in full, the same will be a lien against the real property and collected as unpaid taxes.

Sec. 14-91. - Legislative intent. 
    This division is enacted in recognition of the fact that a clean, wholesome, attractive environment is declared to be of importance to the health and safety of the inhabitants of the town and is essential to the maintenance and continued development of the economy of the town and to the general welfare of its citizens. The unrestrained accumulation of junk vehicles is a hazard to such health, safety and welfare of the citizens of the town, necessitating the regulation, restraint and elimination thereof. This division is enacted in recognition of the fact that even a single junk vehicle abandoned or stored on private or public property: 
(1)  Can constitute both a public and private nuisance; 
(2)  Is a source of potential hurt to children and others who find them an attractive nuisance; 
(3)  Is replete with broken glass, sharp torn metal edges and points, gasoline remaining in tanks of highly explosive and combustible nature and hurtful acids in batteries, to mention but a few of the more obvious sources of potential physical hurt found in junk vehicles; 
(4)  Destroys the aesthetic qualities of the town and is generally unsightly; 
(5)  Tends to depreciate not only the property on which it is located, but also the property of other persons in the neighborhood and damages the welfare of the town as a whole; and 
(6)  Tends to result in uncontrolled growth of vegetation and other collection of debris that becomes a haven and breeding ground for insects, rodents and similar harmful creatures.

(a)  Notice to owner. The zoning administrator or his/her designee shall give written notice for vehicles with valid registration within 24 hours if the vehicle is registered in this state or within 72 hours if the vehicle is not registered in this state. This notice shall, if feasible, be given by telephone. Regardless if the owner is reached by telephone, notice shall be mailed to the last known address unless he/she or the owner's agent waives this notice in writing on the owner of the junk vehicle or on the owner or the tenant of any property on which a junk vehicle is openly stored.

The failure of the person served to so notify the town shall be an admission that the vehicle is a junk vehicle, and open storage shall be terminated in accordance with notice to the person served. However, notification to the town of such contention shall permit a representative of the town, if the latter so desires, to further inspect such vehicle within five days of the town's receipt of such notification of contention. 
(b1)  Probable cause hearing. The owner or any other person entitled to claim possession of the vehicle may request in writing a hearing to determine if probable cause existed for the towing.

(c)  Findings by town. 
(1)  Within five days after such inspections, the zoning administrator or his/her designee shall inform the person originally served of its findings, in writing, that the aesthetic benefits of removing the vehicle outweigh the burdens imposed on the private property owner, by registered or certified mail or by return receipt requested. If the findings are that one or more of the junk vehicles specified in the original notice are indeed junk vehicles and are being stored by the person served with the original notice, such person shall terminate open storage of such junk vehicles within the town within ten days. 
(2)  The disposition of a junk vehicle shall be in accordance with G.S. 160A-303.2. 
(d)  Institution of proceedings. If the person so served institutes a proceeding to set aside such determination, such termination of storage shall not be required pending a decision in the proceeding.

Sec. 14-128. - Exemptions. 
    Exempted from this article is the removal of sand, seashells, or similar materials for souvenirs in amounts that can be carried on the person; or damage caused by rescue vehicles in an attempt to gain emergency access to the public beach. Nothing in this section shall be deemed to allow any acts which shall willfully damage or destroy vegetation as an exemption. 
(a)  Private and emergency vehicles authorized through the Town of Oak Island Police Department and public vehicles are allowed to access the public beach by way of designated, improved vehicular accessways. 
(b)  The provisions of this article shall not apply to the town, the state or any agency of the federal government, their contractors and subcontractors, while engaged in beach restoration efforts on that portion of the beach lying within the boundaries of the town and adjacent to the waters of the Atlantic Ocean, such beach restoration efforts to include, but [not] be limited to, beach bulldozing and the pumping or placing of sand on the beach strand. 
(c)  Areas designated in connection with approved residential or commercial facilities for the installation or water and sewage systems are exempt if the proper permits obtained.

(Ord. of 3-12-2002, ch. 5, art. 1, § 1.4; Amend. of 5-10-2016(1)) 
Sec. 14-129. - Access provisions. 
(a)  Town-owned and maintained street-end access points will employ sand walkovers, except those required to be elevated by the PCA in the sea turtle project and at town-designated disability access sites. 
(b)  For the purpose of establishing access points between town-owned and maintained street-end access points, sand walkover access paths shall be located at approximately 180-foot intervals in 750-foot wide blocks, and at approximately 157-foot intervals where blocks between town-owned street-end access points are approximately 320 feet wide. Town staff is authorized to vary distances between access points established between town-owned street-end access points as may be necessary to accomplish as nearly as possible equal distance between access points. Access paths in the sea turtle project area shall be approximately six feet wide, except in those areas designated for emergency vehicle access and town equipment access, which may be up to ten feet in width. Access paths outside the sea turtle project and the harbor project shall be up to ten feet in width as town staff determines necessary for emergency vehicle access and access for town equipment. Emergency vehicle and town equipment access points shall be designated by town staff and clearly marked as such. Unless required by the USACE pursuant to the PCA or other USACE agency rule, wooden walkways or walkovers from private property onto public property will not be permitted. For purposes of this article, private property ends and public property begins at the mean high water mark as surveyed by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers prior to placement of sand for the sea turtle project or other sand placement projects. 
(c)  To protect and promote the vegetation placed by the town on the new sand dunes as required by the PCA in the sea turtle project and for the purpose of protecting and promoting vegetation placed by the town on the new sand dunes in the area of the harbor project, pedestrian traffic shall not be allowed across sand dune areas vegetated by the town. The town shall install sand fencing along the landward side of the new sand dune, and post and rope fencing on the seaward side of the new dune in the area of the sea turtle project. In the area of the harbor project, similar sand fencing and/or post and rope fencing shall be put in place as areas are vegetated by the town or its volunteers. Consistent with the number of access paths required in subsection (b) of this section between town-owned street-end access points, exact location of sand fencing and post and rope fencing on the sand dunes in the area of the harbor project may be varied in the discretion of town staff as the beach profile and vegetation patterns become more established. Sand fencing will be placed in a "U" configuration at accesses. (From "U", post and rope will be used to mark and delineate access.) 
(d)  Garbage receptacles at the discretion of the town may be installed on the seaward side of each town-owned street-end access point and also on the landward side of the street-end access points. Other garbage receptacles may, at the discretion of town staff, depending upon the amount of usage, be placed on the seaward and/or landward side of nonstreet-end access points. 
(e)  Individual oceanfront property owner access to the public beach will continue as before, and placement of sand fencing and rope and post fencing shall not be done in such a manner as would impair an oceanfront property owner from direct entry onto the public beach from his private property. For the purposes of this article, private property ends and public property begins at the mean high water mark as determined by the USACE survey in January 2000. 
(f)  Commercial beach access structures must meet commercial structure Americans with Disabilities Act requirements according to the North Carolina Building Code. 
(g)  Signage less than one square foot instructing persons to avoid trespassing into the dunes, and rope fence for pedestrian traffic control may be installed. Construction of such devices shall only be permitted with the prior written consent of the code enforcement official. Willful removal or damage to any public or private approved dune stabilization device such as sand fencing or pedestrian control mechanisms shall constitute a violation of the provisions of this section. 
(h)  The board of adjustment may grant an exception for private residential beach access structures regarding horizontal and vertical development for purposes of allowing a handicapped accessible structure to be built. These structures must meet the provisions of the North Carolina Building Code and the standards in section 18-82(r) of the zoning ordinance. 
(i)  The town encourages adjoining property owners to construct centrally located shared beach access structures where appropriate in order to reduce the overall number of structures on the beach. In cases where shared structures are proposed, the property owners must submit a site plan and restrictive covenants that indicate the location of the proposed structure and the proper restrictions against construction of additional individual structures. 
(Ord. of 3-12-2002, ch. 5, art. 1, § 1.8; Amend. of 5-10-2016(1); Amend. of 4-18-2017(2); Amend. of 12-12-2017) 
Sec. 14-130. - Decks, walkways and stairs; construction standards and development. 
    The following rules shall govern all development within the ocean erodible areas, the construction, repair, or replacement of all oceanside decks, walkways and steps. In all cases, whether new construction, repair, or replacement, the following standards and rules shall apply: 
(1)  No dune system shall be altered that will adversely impact the integrity of the dunes. 
(2)  Construction of decks, walkways, and steps shall be in accordance with the state building code as the code may be amended from time to time. 
(3)  Where the height of the structure would cause steps to impede upon the public beach when built as prescribed in this article, a landing may be built to allow steps to land in an easterly or westerly direction, terminating on private property and meeting all required setbacks. A local permit officer shall determine, based on findings following a site visit and after analyzing specific site conditions, in which direction steps shall land. In no case shall the development exceed what is absolutely necessary and required by the state building code for landings and turnaround areas. 
(4)  If an additional set of steps that would terminate beneath the primary structure for access to storage, parking, or shower facilities is desired by a property owner, this may be allowed as long as the development would not increase damages to dunes or vegetation. In no case shall the development exceed what is absolutely necessary and required by the state building code for landing and turnaround areas. 
(5)  Cantilevered seating areas along walkways will be allowed, but in no case shall the entire width of the walkway, including the cantilevered area, exceed six feet. 
(6)  New construction (includes the construction of new residences, accessory structures, additions, or enlargements permitted by section 8-121) of decks, walkways, and steps will be in accordance with CAMA regulations. A CAMA minor development permit must be obtained for all new construction. New construction of walkways and steps for the purpose of gaining access to the public beach shall be constructed in accordance with applicable CAMA regulations for such structures. No part of the structure or any supporting member of any deck, walkway, or step will be allowed to rest on public property. For the purposes of this article, private property ends and public property begins at the mean high water mark as surveyed by the USACE in January 2000. Walkways and steps may in no way encroach into the side setbacks of the district in which the structure is located unless it is a town-approved shared access by neighboring contiguous property lines. A maximum of one single or shared walkway per residence/property is permissible and such walkways shall be compliant pursuant to section 14-129. In areas where the mean high water mark as surveyed and determined by the USACE in January 2000 is located within six feet or closer to the oceanward side of any home or other structure proposing to construct a deck, walkway, or steps, then, in that event, a deck or walkway up to six feet in width may be constructed, but the deck or walkway must be supported by cantilevering to the main structure or angle-bracing sufficient to meet all state building code standards as the code may be amended from time to time. It is the purpose and intent of this section to allow new construction of decks, walkways, and steps on existing structures where such construction might necessarily extend beyond the mean high water mark, but at the same time to prevent any part of the deck, walkway, or steps, or its supporting members from coming to rest on public property, except to the extent absolutely necessary to allow landing of steps within the area of six feet seaward of the existing structure. Angle-bracing and cantilevering shall not be required in those areas where construction would allow for all portions of the deck, walkway, or steps to remain on private property. 
(7)  The following are intended to apply to replacement of decks, walkways, or steps which have been damaged more than 50 percent of their value, based on actual replacement costs, including labor and material: 
a.  Decks on existing structures may be replaced, provided that they are constructed in accordance with the state building code as the code may be amended from time to time. The deck may not exceed six feet in width, but may extend the full length of any previous deck that existed on the structure. 
b.  If the mean high water mark as surveyed and determined by the USACE in January 2000 is located six feet or closer to the oceanward side of the existing structure, then any deck to be constructed pursuant to this article may not exceed six feet in width and must be supported entirely by cantilevering or diagonal bracing attached to existing house pilings. The design and construction of this deck must be accompanied by a professional engineer's certificate that the deck will meet all building code standards of the state as such standards may be amended from time to time. 
c.  Walkways and steps for access to the public beach shall be constructed in accordance with applicable CAMA regulations for such structures. Steps must land south and be completely within private property as described in this article. Steps and walkways may in no way encroach into the side setbacks of the district in which the structure is located unless it is a shared walkway access by neighboring contiguous property lines. A maximum of one single or shared walkway per residence/property is permissible and such walkways shall be compliant pursuant to section 14-129. In cases where the mean high water mark as surveyed and determined by the USACE in January 2000 is located six feet or closer to the oceanward side of the structure to which the deck, walkway, and steps is to be attached, then in that event, the landing of the steps leading from the deck may come to rest within the area up to six feet oceanward of the house. It is the intent and purpose of this section to allow repair and replacement of decks, walkways, and steps, but at the same time to minimize the intrusion of repair and replacement on public property. 
d.  In any case where the general construction of the primary structure would prohibit the attachment of a cantilevered or diagonally-braced deck (i.e., prefirm house not elevated on pilings or with concrete or block pilings that cannot be drilled), a special exception may be made to allow the construction of a freestanding deck, not to exceed the regulations prescribed in this section. An engineer's report confirming these findings must accompany any request for this exception. 
e.  New construction (includes the construction of new residences, accessory structures, additions, or enlargements permitted by section 8-121) of decks, walkways, and steps will be in accordance with CAMA regulations. Private shared elevated beach access walkways are permissible along the property line of contiguous lots and parcels so long as a signed and notarized agreement by the properties owners is recorded at the Brunswick County Register of Deeds allowing all property owners access and use rights that runs with the land in perpetuity regardless of any future property owners. Such agreements can be access easements, restrictive covenants, or some other town approved document. A CAMA permit must be obtained for all new construction. New construction of walkways and steps for the purpose of gaining access to the public beach shall be constructed in accordance with applicable CAMA regulations for such structures.

Editor's note- An amendment of May 10, 2016, amended the title of § 14-130 to read as herein set out. Said title formerly read "Decks, walkways and stairs; construction standards." 
Sec. 14-131. - Repair and maintenance of the public beach, dunes, and sand management project areas. 
(a)  In no case shall any person physically alter the dunes, ocean beach, or any part of sand management project areas without first having obtained a permit for such alteration from the town and any appropriate state agencies. An application for such permit must include a statement describing the proposed development or action, length of time for the project to be completed, and any other information deemed pertinent by the town. Any work permitted by the town shall not commence until such time as a CAMA permit has also been issued. No CAMA permit for the alteration of dunes, ocean beach, or sand management project areas shall be issued unless a copy of the permit issued by the town has been received and reviewed by the proper permitting office. Any damage caused to dunes, ocean beach, or sand management project areas or the vegetation located thereon shall be immediately corrected or restored as nearly as possible to the conditions that were present prior to the commencement of the activity. If vegetation cannot be restored immediately, the person responsible for causing such damage shall be responsible for replanting vegetation to the satisfaction of the town at the start of the next planting season. 
(b)  The town may from time to time have need to repair and maintain dunes and project areas. Nothing in this article shall prohibit the town or other public entities from completing necessary actions to protect and maintain the health, safety, and general welfare of the public. 
(c)  The normal, non-impacting maintenance of lawns, commercial, office, and institutional tracts which are already developed. Maintenance shall include lawn maintenance, the relocating and replacement of shrubs, the cutting and removal of poisonous or harmful plants, briers, and dead foliage. In accomplishing the foregoing, the use of equipment which limits damage to surrounding vegetation is encouraged; the use of heavy commercial equipment is discouraged. The removal or destruction of vegetation referenced in this section is prohibited. 
(Ord. of 3-12-2002, ch. 5, art. 1, § 1.10; Amend. of 5-10-2016(1)) 
Sec. 14-132. - Additional prohibited activities. 
The following additional activities are prohibited: 
(a)  Walking, running, playing, climbing or other pedestrian traffic of any kind or description across sand dunes except in designated access areas. 
(b)  Allowing pets to traverse sand dunes except in designated access areas. 
(c)  Placing anything in or on sand dunes or their designated access areas. 
(d)  Attaching anything to sand dune access area posts, ropes, sand fences or signs. 
(e)  Vehicular traffic of any kind or description across sand dunes except in designated access areas as authorized by the town. 
(f)  Cutting, removing, trampling or in any manner damaging dune vegetation. 
(g)  Throwing or depositing refuse onto sand dunes or their designated access areas. 
(h)  Allowing refuse to be windblown onto sand dunes or their designated access areas. 
(i)  Engaging in any other activities that reduce the stability of sand dunes and potentially decrease their storm protection value, wildlife habitat value and aesthetic value. 
(j)  Installation of vegetation inconsistent with sand dune systems, such as lawn grasses or sod, or herbaceous varieties that are not commonly known as "salt-tolerant" dune varieties or that may be determined to be "invasive exotic species." 
(k)  Digging, shelling, mining, or mechanical alteration of the dune topography. 
(l)  Discharging water into the dune where it will cause significant scouring or erosion or otherwise affect the integrity of the dune. 
(m)  Development activities without a valid building permit, health department approval, or CAMA authorization. 
(n)  When, due to beach width, tide levels, crowd conditions, or other factors, placement of tents or similar devices will obstruct the passage of emergency or ocean rescue vehicles or the line of sight from lifeguard stands or other surveillance areas. 
(o)  Substantially altering the contour or shape of the flat beach area by excessive digging or mounding of sand whereby, in the opinion of code enforcement officers, such alteration presents a dangerous condition. Persons responsible for altering the contour or shape of the beach to any extent shall restore the beach to its original condition prior to leaving the area unattended for any period of time. 
(p)  One shall not remove any vegetation growing on any sand dune except areas designated on site plans for commercial or multifamily development as approved for land disturbing activities under the provisions of the Coastal Area Management Act and as shown on site plans approved by appropriate officials of the town.

Editor's note- An amendment of July 13, 2010, changed the title of § 14-132 from "Dune planting area" to "Additional prohibited activities." 
Sec. 14-133. - Nonconformities. 
    Nonconforming structures. Private access structures and beach walkovers that are damaged or destroyed greater than 50 percent of their replacement value may only be built back in conformance with current requirements as set forth in this article. Public access structures and beach walkovers that are damaged or destroyed greater than 50 percent of their replacement value may be built back. Access structures and beach walkovers for single-family and duplex lots that are damaged or destroyed greater than 50 percent of their replacement value may not be built back. All determinations of replacement value under this section shall be made by the building inspector.

    The development services director or his/her designee is designated as the town official to perform the duties relating to the issuance of and/or revocation of permits described under the terms of this article and enforcing the terms and conditions of this article. 
(Amend. of 12-12-2017) 
Sec. 14-135. - Undue restriction. 
    If the dune protection standards in chapter 14, article III; unduly restricts the landowner's reasonable use of the land due to the secondary dune being greater than or equal to 40 feet from the front property line, less restrictive means of preserving the significant dune(s) may be authorized by the board of adjustment, subject to one or more of the following: 
(1)  Stabilization of the portions of the dune impacted by development through revegetation with native vegetation; 
(2)  Use of sand fencing with a minimum height of four feet to inhibit sand migration due to disturbance; 
(3)  Mechanical excavation of replacement sand, where appropriate; 
(4)  Use of piles and elevation of crossovers or other development at least two feet above the sand dune; 
(5)  Avoidance of storage of equipment, materials, vehicles, or other debris on dune faces; and 
(6)  Modified dune must maintain the original girth, height, and be reconnected with the dune on either side of each property line.

(1)  To encourage the construction of and the continued use of the land for commercial and service uses. 
(2)  To provide for the orderly expansion of such uses. 
(3)  To prohibit heavier commercial and industrial use of land and to prohibit uses which would substantially interfere with the continuation of the uses presently existing or with the orderly growth and redevelopment of property to meet the needs of increased population in the market area. 
(4)  To permit a concentrated, intensive development of the commercial uses while maintaining a substantial relationship between the intensity of land use and the capacity of utilities and streets. 
(5)  To encourage development and redevelopment while retaining the flexibility to protect the health, safety and welfare of the community. 
(b)  Density. Density regulations in the conditional use CB district are as follows: See area and height table, section 18-118. 
(c)  Buffering required. Wherever a conditional use CB district lot abuts a residential district, a buffer as described in division 10 of this article shall be required when the lot is developed or placed in use. 
(d)  Conditional use permit required. All uses in the conditional use CB district require a duly authorized conditional use permit. 
(e)  Process. For property in or contiguous to the CB community business district proposed for a zoning map change to conditional use CB district, a public hearing is required and procedures prescribed in section 18-335 will be followed (first step in the process). For property contiguous to the CB district, the following criteria must be met before a zoning change request may be processed for consideration: 
i)  The contiguous property shall be a part of a single CUCB request that includes property within the CB district of record on February 1, 2008, fronting E. Oak Island Drive. 
ii)  Any subsequent conditional use permit request must include all property within the area proposed for CUCB zoning. 
iii)  The length of the common property line of both properties shall be at least 60 feet. 
If the property is rezoned to conditional use CB district, a conditional use permit application may be submitted for the particular use allowed in the conditional use CB district (second step). Consideration of the conditional use permit application will follow the process prescribed to section 18-221 through section [18-226].

DIVISION 8. - CONDITIONAL USES 

Sec. 18-221. - Purpose of division. 
    The purpose of this division is to allow for those uses that have the potential of being incompatible with adjacent land uses. For this reason, special consideration shall be given to those uses listed as conditional uses in the zoning districts as listed in division 4 of this article. The reasons for requiring such special consideration involve, among other things, the size of the area required for the development of a use the effect such uses have on any whole. Approval of a conditional use does not establish a binding precedent to grant other conditional uses. A conditional use is not transferable from one parcel of land to another. Any structure or use existing at the effective date of this article that is listed as a use permitted subject to the conditional use process in the district in which it is located may be continued as if a conditional use had been applied for and issued. This provision shall apply regardless of whether the structure or use fully complies with the present lot area, setbacks or other dimensional criteria of this article provided that no structure or use that fails to meet such standards may be altered, expanded or enlarged except as provided for under section 18-193(1). Where the board of adjustment is acting under the authority prescribed by this section, review of proposed alteration, expansions or enlargement for preexisting uses that are listed as conditional uses under section 18-116, shall constitute a special exception. In the administrative review of special exception, the board shall act in a quasi-judicial capacity and shall have the authority to approve a special exception as provided for under sections 18-222 through 18-225. The board shall calendar and conduct a hearing on an application for special exceptions in accordance with the provisions in subsections 18-223(c)(1) through (6) except that no recommendation from the planning board shall be required. In considering an application for special exception, the board may require that the special provisions for a particular use as established in section 18-226 be provided and/or maintained or they may modify or elect not to apply certain provisions if the characteristics of a particular site make them impracticable or infeasible. However, no setbacks or other dimensional requirements that are specified within the special provisions established in section 18-226, special provisions for conditional uses, that are greater than those provided for within the district in which the property is located shall be modified or reduced below the minimum setbacks or other dimensional requirements of such zoning district. 
(Ord. of 6-12-2001, ch. 1, § 9.1(A); Ord. of 5-13-2003, § 3; Ord. of 3-9-2004, § 2)

d.  Procedure. 
1.  Conditional use permit application. In addition to the conditional use permit submittal requirements of section 18-221, the following information shall accompany the submission as addenda to the conditional use permit application: 
i.  A statement describing the general character of the intended development along with such other pertinent information as may be necessary to make a determination that the contemplated arrangement or use makes it desirable to apply regulations and requirements differing from those ordinarily applicable in the zoning district. 
ii.  A general development plan of the project showing at least the following information as may be required by the planning board in a specific situation in sufficient detail to allow the planning board and the town council to apply the criteria for approval as set forth as follows: 
An accurate map of the project area including its relationship to surrounding properties; 
Statistical data on total size of the project area, area of open space, density computation and proposed number of residential units, impact on municipal services, and other data pertinent to a comprehensive development; 
The pattern of roads, driveways, and parking facilities, intended design standards; 
The size, arrangement and location of lots or of building groups; 
The type, size and location of structures; 
The location of water and sewer facilities; 
Architectural drawings and sketches illustrating the design and character of the proposed structures; 
The location of recreational open space areas and areas reserved or dedicated for public uses such as schools, parks, etc.; 
The general landscape treatment; 
The existing topography showing basic topographic changes to be made through construction; and 
A general outline of intended organization structure related to property owners association, deed restrictions, and provision of service. 
2.  Referral to planning board. A UTD petition shall be referred to the planning board and processed as any application for conditional use. Upon completion of necessary study and investigation, the planning board shall make its recommendations to the town council as to the appropriateness and desirability of the proposed change, the suitability of the building site and any development plans, and any additional conditions which it may feel to be necessary and appropriate. 
e.  Basis for approval. The planning board, in making its recommendations, and the town council, in making its determinations, shall give the consideration and satisfy themselves as to the following stipulations: 
1.  Scheduling intent and financing ability. The proponents of the proposed development shall demonstrate that they intend to start construction within an appropriately timed manner following the approval of the project, that the project appears economically sound, that adequate financing is possible, and that the development will be carried out according to a reasonable construction schedule satisfactory to the town. 
2.  Consistency and justification. The proposed development must be shown to be consistent in all respects to the spirit and intent of this section, to conform with the town's general plans for community development, to be supportive of the general welfare and economic prosperity of the town and of the immediate neighborhood, to have specific development plans prepared with competent professional advice and guidance, and to show that the benefits and improved design of the resultant development justified the variation from the normal requirements of this division and other policies and regulations of the town. 
3.  Residential development. It must be shown that: 
i.  Such development will create an attractive residential environment of sustained desirability, economic stability, compatible with the character established for the area by the land use plan, and where the economic impact of the development in terms of income levels, property values, and service demands is at least as beneficial to the community as that which could be anticipated in the underlying zoning district. 
ii.  The project will not create traffic or parking demand incompatible with that anticipated in the land use plan. 
iii.  The total average density of the project will be consistent with that permitted within the zoning district. The maximum allowable density shall be computed by dividing the total area within the project, excluding streets, by the lot size per unit permitted in the base zoning district. An increase in the allowable maximum density, not to exceed ten percent, may be permitted upon recommendation of the planning board, provided that the increased density is justified by the applicant's attention to preserving important natural features, wildlife habitat, recreational facilities, or other measures which enhance the physical environment of the project. 
iv.  The aggregate open space of the development will be no less than would have resulted from the application of open space requirements of section 18-451. 
v.  Adequate guarantee is provided for permanent retention as open space of the residential open land resulting from the application of these regulations, either by private reservation or by dedication to the public. 
vi.  In the case of private reservation of open area, the open area to be reserved shall be protected against building development, by recording with the register of deeds as part of the conditions for project approval, an open space easement restricting the area against any future building or use except as is consistent with that of providing landscaped open space for the aesthetic and recreational satisfaction of the surrounding residences. Buildings or uses for noncommercial recreational or cultural purposes compatible with the open space objective may be permitted only where specifically authorized as part of the development plan or subsequently with the express approval of the town council. 
vii.  Any common facilities for the project will be maintained by a management organization with authority to assess property owners within the project with the costs of maintaining the facilities. The manner of ensuring maintenance and assessing such costs shall be determined prior to the final approval of the project plans and shall be included in the title to each property involved. 
4.  Commercial development. It must be shown that: 
i.  The proposed development will be adequately served by off-street parking and truck service facilities. 
ii.  The locations for entrances and exits have been designed to prevent unnecessary interference with the safe and efficient movement of vehicular and pedestrian traffic on surrounding streets and walkways, and the development will not create an effect upon the general traffic pattern of the area incompatible with that anticipated in the land use plan. 
iii.  The architectural design, landscaping, control of lighting, and general site development will result in an attractive and harmonious service area creating a positive effect upon the property values of the surrounding neighborhood. 
f.  Determination. 
1.  The town council, after due consideration, may approve the application as submitted, approve the application with additional conditions or deny the application. 
2.  The authorization of a conditional use permit shall be based on assurance that the proposed development will be carried out basically as presented in the official submission plans. Detailed construction and engineering plans need not necessarily be completed at the time the UTD request is approved, but approval of the preliminary plan shall be conditioned upon the subsequent submittal and approval of more specific and detailed plans as the development progresses according to a schedule approved by the town council. 
3.  The developer shall be responsible for ensuring the implementation of the development according to the terms and conditions established as part of the development plan approval. 
4.  Any subsequent change or addition to the plans of use shall first be submitted for review by the planning board, and if in the opinion of the planning board such change or addition constitutes a substantial alteration of the original plan, a new public hearing shall be required. 
(38.5)  Veterinary clinics with associated kennels. 
a.  The property shall have frontage upon a collector or higher classification street. 
b.  The veterinary clinic or hospital may be permitted upon a finding that the use will not constitute a nuisance because of anticipated traffic, noise or odor. 
c.  Associated kennels or animal runs shall be located a minimum of 250 feet from any adjacent property boundary lines unless such kennels and runs are located within a fully enclosed, roofed, walled and soundproofed structure. 
(39)  Waterslide. 
a.  Buffers must be installed on all property lines abutting residentially zoned or used property in accordance with the requirements of this division. 
b.  Lighting installed on the property must comply with the provisions for town lighting in division 11 of this article and shall be installed in a manner that prevents trespass onto adjoining properties and controls glare on the public right-of-way and on public trust waters. 
c.  Required off-street parking spaces shall be provided.

Sec. 18-301. - Purpose of division. 
    On occasion areas within the zoning jurisdiction of the town may be rezoned to a new classification, and on occasion areas may be annexed into the zoning jurisdiction of the town and the town's zoning for the newly annexed area may be different than that previously existing for the area in question. Likewise, land use and development regulations may from time to time be amended or modified in a manner that could negatively impact development proposals approved previously for which permits have not yet been issued. This division is for the specific purpose of protecting those landowners who have made substantial expenditures in good faith reliance on a valid governmental approval for a certain use or development of property based on the preexisting land use regulations, or lack thereof, and who would suffer a substantial detriment if required to comply with the newly adopted zoning requirements.

(a)  A vested right shall be deemed to have been established with respect to any property upon the valid approval, or conditional approval, of a site-specific development plan or a phased development plan, following notice and public hearing by the town/county having jurisdiction over the property. A vested right means the landowner shall have the right to undertake and complete the development and use of the property in accordance with the specific terms and conditions of the approved site specific or phased development plan. Failure of the landowner to comply with the terms and conditions of an approved or conditionally approved site-specific development plan will result in a forfeiture of vested rights. A site-specific development plan shall be deemed to have been approved upon the effective date of the town's/county's action or ordinance relating thereto. 
(b)  Once a vested right has been established in accordance with subsection (a) of this section, this right shall remain vested for a period of two years and this vesting may be extended for a period of up to five years by a majority vote of the town council where warranted in light of all relevant circumstances including, but not limited to, the size and phasing of development, the level of investment, the need for the development, economic cycles, and market conditions. 
(c)  Notwithstanding the other provisions of this section, land development approvals authorized prior to the effective date of the ordinance from which this section is derived shall automatically expire within two years of such date when the following circumstances are in evidence: 
(1)  The development permits or permit applications authorized by such prior approval have not been filed with or applied for through the development services department. 
(2)  The land use authorized by such prior approval has not been commenced, under circumstances where no substantial site preparation or construction work would be necessary prior to the commencement of such use.

(a)  The landowner shall have the obligation to seek an extension of time for vested rights beyond the two-year period by filing an application for the extension with the town clerk with copies to be delivered to the office of development services or its successor for review and commentary to the town council. The town council may extend the period for vested rights for up to five years on its own motion but absent an application from the landowner or council action the time period for vested rights shall be two years. 
(b)  The town council may, but shall not be required to, refer the application to the planning board for its review and recommendation. The town council may require the landowner to submit site-specific development plans for approval by the town for each phase in order to obtain final approval to develop within the restrictions of the vested zoning classification. Following approval, the office of development services may from time to time conduct reviews and periodic inspections, in addition to its regular building code inspections, to ensure compliance with the terms and conditions of the original approval and compliance with the zoning classification under which the approval was issued.

This statement must be filed prior to the passage of any annexation article, extension of extraterritorial jurisdiction ordinance or the passage of any rezoning ordinance or land use regulation amendment. Failure to file by the property owner within this time frame will result in forfeiture of any vested rights they might have claimed. The town, in consultation with the town attorney, shall make an initial determination of whether or not vested rights have been established. If the landowner disagrees with this determination, then he may, within 30 days of the date of such written determination, appeal the matter to the full town council for hearing.

Sec. 18-334. - Zoning board of adjustment. 
(a)  Establishment. There shall be a board of adjustment. This board of adjustment shall consist of five members who shall receive no compensation for their services. The five members shall be residents of the area within the municipal limits and shall be appointed by the town council for overlapping terms of three years. The town council, at its discretion, may appoint not more than three alternate members to serve on the board of adjustment in the absence or temporary disqualification, for any cause, of any regular member or to fill a vacancy pending appointment of a member. Such alternate members shall be appointed for the same terms as regular members, and shall be appointed in the same manner as regular members, and at regular times for appointment. Such alternate members, while attending any regular or special meeting of the board and serving on behalf of any regular member, shall have and exercise all the powers and duties of such regular members so absent. 
(b)  Proceedings of the board of adjustment. 
(1)  Officers. The board of adjustment shall elect a chair from its membership and such other officers as the board of adjustment deems best. 
(2)  Meetings. Meetings of the board of adjustment shall be held at the call of the chair and at such other times as the board of adjustment may determine. All meetings of the board shall be held at a regular place and shall keep minutes of its proceedings in a book maintained for that purpose only, showing the vote of each member upon each question, or, if absent and failing to vote, an indication of such fact; and final disposition of each matter to come before them. The chair of the board or the clerk to the board may administer oaths to witnesses. 
(3)  Appeals. The board of adjustment shall hear and decide appeals from and review any binding order, requirement, decision, or determination made by an administrative official charged with enforcement of any ordinance adopted pursuant to the authority of G.S. 160A Article 19. The owner and others with standing to appeal shall have 30 days from receipt of written notice or any source of actual constructive notice of the decision within which to file an appeal. An appeal to the board of adjustment may be taken by any person who has standing under G.S. 160A-393(d) or the town may appeal a decision to the board of adjustment. An appeal is taken by filing a notice of appeal with the town clerk. The notice of appeal shall state grounds for the appeal. The zoning administrator shall forthwith transmit to the board, appellant and landowner, all the papers constituting the record upon which the action appealed from was taken. An appeal stays all proceedings in furtherance of the action appealed from unless the administrative official who made the decision certifies to the board, after the notice of appeal shall have been filed with town clerk, that by reason of the facts stated in the certificate a stay would, in the officials' opinion, cause imminent peril to life or property, or because the violation is transitory in nature, a stay would seriously interfere with enforcement of the ordinance in which case proceedings shall not be stayed otherwise than by a restraining order, which may be granted by a court. If the enforcement proceedings are not stayed, the appellant may file with the official a request for an expedited hearing of the appeal, and the board of adjustment shall meet to hear the appeal within 15 days such a request is filed. Notwithstanding the foregoing, appeals of decisions granting a permit or otherwise affirming that a proposed use of property is consistent with the ordinance shall not stay the further review of an application for permits or permissions to use such property; in these situations the appellant may request and the board may grant a stay of a final decision of permit applications or building permits affected by the issue being appealed. The official who made the decision shall be present at the hearing as a witness. If the party or the town would be unduly prejudiced by the presentation of matters not presented in the notice of appeal, the board shall continue the hearing. The board of adjustment may reverse or affirm, wholly or partly, or may modify the decision appealed from and shall make any order, requirement, decision, or determination that ought to be made. The board shall have all powers that the official who made the decision. 
(4)  Voting. The concurring vote of four-fifths of the board of adjustment shall be necessary to grant a variance. A majority of the members shall be required to decide any other quasi-judicial matter or to determine an appeal made in the nature of certiorari. Vacant positions on the board and members who are disqualified from voting on a quasi-judicial matter shall not be considered members of the board for calculation of the requisite majority if there are no qualified alternates available to take the place of such members. A member of the board or anybody exercising the functions of a board of adjustment shall not participate in or vote on any quasi-judicial matter in a manner which would violate affected persons' constitutional rights to an impartial decision maker. Impermissible conflicts include, but are not limited to, a member having a fixed opinion prior to hearing the matter that is not susceptible to change, undisclosed ex parte communications, a close familial, business or other associational relationship with the affected person, or a financial interest in the outcome of the matter. If an objection is raised to a member's participation and that member does not recuse himself or herself, the remaining members shall by majority vote rule on the objection. 
(c)  Notice. Where variances or appeals are to be considered by the board of adjustment, a mail notification giving the time, place and subject of the hearing shall be mailed by first class mail to the owner of the property in question and all property owners within 100 feet of the site, lot, or parcel in question at least ten, but not more than 25 days prior to the hearing by the zoning administrator. The property will also be posted at least ten, but not more than 25 days before the hearing. A fee in accordance with the town schedule of fees, as such schedule shall be amended, shall be collected at the time of the filing of an application to the board of adjustment to cover the costs of notification and other administrative costs. 
(d)  Powers and duties of the board. The board of adjustment shall have the following powers and duties: 
(1)  Administrative review. To hear and decide appeals where it is alleged there is error in any order, requirement, decision or determination made by the building codes administrator, zoning administrator, or other administrative officials in the carrying out or enforcement of any provision of this article. 
(2)  Variances. A variance may be granted by the board if it concludes that strict enforcement of this article would result in unnecessary hardships for the applicant and that, by granting the variance, the spirit of this article will be observed, public safety and welfare secured, and substantial justice done. No change in permitted uses may be authorized by variance. The board may reach these conclusions if it finds that: 
a.  Unnecessary hardship would result from the strict application of the ordinance. It shall not be necessary to demonstrate that, in the absence of the variance, no reasonable use can be made of the property. 
b.  The hardship results from conditions that are peculiar to the property, such as location, size, or topography. Hardships resulting from personal circumstances, as well as circumstances that are common to the neighborhood or the general public, may not be the basis for granting a variance. 
c.  The hardship did not result from actions taken by the applicant or the property owner. The act of purchasing property with knowledge that circumstances exist that may justify the granting of a variance shall not be regarded as self-created hardship. 
d.  The requested variance is consistent with the spirit, purpose, and intent of the ordinance, such that public safety is secured, and substantial justice is achieved. 
In granting a variance, the board of adjustment may impose appropriate conditions, reasonably related to the condition or circumstance giving rise to the need for a variance on any approval issued by the board. 
The board of adjustment through the chair, or in the chair's absence anyone acting as chair, may subpoena witnesses and compel the production of evidence. To request issuance of a subpoena, persons with standing G.S. 160A-393(d) may make a written request to the chair explaining why it is necessary for certain witnesses or evidence to be compelled. The chair shall issue the subpoenas he or she determines to be relevant, reasonable in nature and scope and not oppressive. The chair shall rule on any motion to quash or modify a subpoena. Decisions regarding subpoenas made by the chair may be appealed to the full board of adjustment.

Such application shall not be reconsidered by the board unless the applicant clearly demonstrates that: 
a.  Circumstances affecting the property that is the subject of the application have substantially changed; or 
b.  New information is available that could not have been presented with reasonable diligence at the initial hearing. A request for a rehearing on this basis must be filed within the time period for an appeal as specified under subsection (f)(1) of this section; however, such a request shall not extend the period within which an appeal must be filed with superior court.

Sec. 18-335. - Changes or amendments. 
    The town council may amend, repeal, supplement or change the text regulations and zoning district lines according to the following procedures: 
(1)  Action by the applicant. 
a.  Initiation of amendment. Proposed changes or amendments may be initiated by the town council, planning board, board of adjustment, town officials or by one or more owners or lessees of property within the area proposed to be changed or affected. 
b.  Fee. The fee established in the town's fee schedule shall be paid to the town for each application for an amendment to cover the costs of advertising and other administrative expenses involved. 
(2)  Application procedures. Any application for an amendment to the text of this article or the zoning map shall be filed with the department of development services at least 45 days prior to the date on which it is to be introduced to the planning board. The town clerk shall be responsible for presenting the recommendations of the planning board to the town council. Each application shall be signed by the property owner or the property owner's agent, be in triplicate and shall contain at least the following information: 
a.  The applicant's name in full, the applicant's address and a description of the property proposed for rezoning. 
b.  The applicant's interest in the property and the existing and proposed zoning district classification. 
c.  If the proposed change would require a change in the zoning map, an accurate diagram of the property proposed for rezoning showing: 
1.  All property lines with dimensions and north arrow. 
2.  Adjoining streets with rights-of-way and paving widths. 
3.  The location of all existing structures on the property. 
4.  The existing land uses associated with the property. 
5.  The zoning classification of all abutting zoning districts. 
6.  A list of all abutting property owners. 
d.  A statement of justification regarding the changing conditions in the area or in the town generally that makes the proposed amendment necessary to the promotion of the public health, safety and general welfare, or that identifies an obvious error in the zoning map based upon the zoning classification or current land use of surrounding properties. 
e.  A statement of justification that substantiates that the proposed amendment would support one or more of the stated objectives of the town land use plan. 
f.  Neighborhood meeting required in accordance with the provisions of section 18-413(a)(1). 
(3)  Proposed amendments to be submitted to planning board. Unless initiated by the planning board, all proposed amendments to the text of this article or the zoning map shall be submitted to the planning board for review and recommendation. If no written report is received from the planning board within 30 days of referral of the amendment to that board, the town council may proceed in its consideration of the amendment without the planning board report. The planning board shall advise and comment on whether the proposed amendment is consistent with any comprehensive plan that has been adopted and any other officially adopted plan that is applicable. The planning board shall provide a written recommendation to the governing board that addresses plan consistency and other matters as deemed appropriate by the planning board, but a comment by the planning board that a proposed amendment is inconsistent with the comprehensive plan shall not preclude consideration or approval of the proposed amendment by the governing board. Prior to adopting or rejecting any zoning amendment, the town council shall adopt a statement describing whether its action is consistent with an adopted comprehensive plan and explaining why the council considers the action taken to be reasonable and in the public interest. Such statement is not subject to judicial review. A city council member shall not vote on any zoning map or text amendment where the outcome of the matter being considered is reasonably likely to have a direct, substantial, and readily identifiable financial impact on the member. Members of appointed boards providing advice to the city council shall not vote on recommendations regarding any zoning map or text amendment where the outcome of the matter being considered is reasonably likely to have a direct, substantial and readily identifiable financial impact on the member. 
(4)  Required public hearing A public hearing shall be held by the town council before adoption, amendment, or repeal of any amendment to the text of this article or to the zoning map. Notice of such hearing shall be provided as required or as authorized under G.S. 160A-364 and/or G.S. 160A-384, or their successor statutes. The property will also be posted with a sign describing the action being considered and the date and time of the hearing. When multiple parcels are included with a proposed zoning map amendment, a posting of each parcel is not required but the town shall post sufficient notices to provide reasonable notice to interested persons. Except where an alternative to mail notice is used as provided for under G.S. 160A-384, the owner of a property proposed for a zoning change and all property owners located within 100 feet of a property shall be mailed a notice by first class mail specifying the time, place and subject of the public hearing to be conducted by the town council at least ten and not more than 25 days prior to such hearing. Following such hearing, the town council may change the existing zoning classification covered by the petition, or any part or parts thereof, to the classification requested, or to a different classification or classifications of the same fundamental character as contained in the notice after considering the debate and discussion occurring at the hearing without the necessity of withdrawal or modification of the petition. The posting of signs shall be done initially between 25 days and ten days prior to the date of the public hearing. 
(5)  Petition withdrawal. Any petition for an amendment to this article may be withdrawn at any time at the direction of the person initiating such a request, upon written notice to the town clerk. 
(6)  Reconsideration. When the town council shall have denied any application for the change in any zoning district, it shall not thereafter accept any other application for the same change of zoning districting affecting the same property, or any portion thereof, until the expiration of six months from the date of such previous denial. 
(7)  Protest against an amendment. To qualify as a protest against a zoning map amendment in accordance with G.S. 160A-385, a petition must be signed by the owners of either (a) 20 percent or more of the area included in such proposed change, or (b) five percent of a 100-foot-wide buffer extending along the entire boundary of each discrete or separate area proposed to be rezoned. A street right-of-way shall not be considered in computing the 100-foot buffer area as long as that street right-of-way is 100 feet wide or less. When less than an entire parcel of land is subject to the proposed zoning map amendment, the 100-foot buffer shall be measured from the property line of the at parcel. In the absence of evidence to the contrary, the town may rely on the county tax listing to determine the "owners" of potentially qualifying areas. In case of a qualified protest against zoning map amendment such amendment shall not become effective except by a favorable vote of three-fourths of all members of the town council. Any party or parties intending to file such a protest shall do so in the office of the town clerk not later than the close of business at least three business days prior to the date of the public hearing concerning the amendment.

The zoning ordinance of February 12, 1980, plus amendments are hereby repealed; however, nothing in this new zoning article shall be construed to amend or repeal any other existing ordinance. The town also enforces the state building code with attachments and amendments.

Sec. 18-380. - Variances. 
    Where, because of severe topographical or other conditions peculiar to the site, strict adherence to the provisions of this article would cause an unnecessary hardship, the town council, upon the recommendations of the planning board, may authorize a variance to the terms of this article only to the extent that it is absolutely necessary and not to an extent which would violate the intent of this article. In granting any variance, the town council shall make the findings required in this section, taking into account the nature of the proposed subdivision, the existing use of land in the vicinity, the number of persons to reside or work in the proposed subdivision and the effect of the proposed subdivision upon traffic conditions in the vicinity.

The planning board shall have 45 days from the time of its initial review of the proposed amendment within which to submit its report. If the planning board fails to submit a report within the specified time, it shall be deemed to have recommended approval of the amendment.

This time period may be extended with the written consent of the subdivider and/or the town council upon written request from the chair of the planning board. Approval of the preliminary plat shall be valid for a period of 24 months and will not be invalidated by subsequent amendments of the development ordinances of the town. If the preliminary plat is disapproved, the subdivider may make the recommended changes and submit a revised preliminary plat, or appeal the decision to the town council. If the planning board does not make a written recommendation within 75 days after its first consideration of the plat and a written request for an extension of time for review has not been forwarded by the chair of the planning board, the subdivider may apply to the town council for approval or disapproval. If changes are made to the preliminary plat after the planning board meeting, other than the changes noted by the planning board as a condition of approval, then the preliminary plat has to go back before the planning board for review and a recommendation. The town council's consideration of the preliminary plat shall be consistent with the requirements of this section. 
(4)  Environmental impact statement. Pursuant to G.S. ch. 133 or G.S. ch. 133A, the planning board or town council may require the subdivider to submit an environmental impact statement with the preliminary plat if:

(Ord. of 6-12-2001, ch. 2, § 4.4; Ord. of 1-8-2002, ch. 2, § 4.4) 
Sec. 18-446. - Streets. 
(a)  Type of street required. All subdivision lots shall abut on a public or private street as specified in subsection 18-445(b)(5). Subdividers are required to provide street rights-of-way, street pavement widths, and street cross sections to adequately serve the lots in the proposed subdivision. The streets shall be consistent with the following design principles: 
(1)  The street system shall discourage generation of excessive through traffic in the subdivision. 
(2)  Rights-of-way and pavement widths shall be determined by the traffic carried or anticipated to be carried by the street. 
(3)  Access to adjoining property shall be considered in planning for the street system. 
(4)  Sidewalks shall be provided in accordance with subsection (h)(2) of this section. 
(5)  Where cul-de-sacs are used, they shall be as short as feasible. 
All proposed public streets within the corporate limits of the town shall be dedicated to the town; all proposed public streets in the town's extraterritorial jurisdiction shall be dedicated to the state. All streets shall be built to the standards of the state department of transportation. Streets not dedicated to the town which are not eligible for acceptance into the state highway system because there are too few lots or residences shall, nevertheless, be built in accordance with the standards necessary to be put on the state highway system. A written maintenance agreement with the provisions for the future maintenance of the street shall be included with the final plat. The planning board shall consider required installation of either bikepaths, bike lanes, or shared roadway facilities for bikes in the subdivision where there are transportation and/or recreational benefits from such installation. In its review of sidewalks and bikeways, the planning board shall consider possible connections to the town's existing sidewalk and bikeway systems. 
(b)  Subdivision street disclosure statement. Where streets are to be dedicated to the public but have not yet been accepted, by a public entity, a statement explaining the status of the street shall be included with the final plat. Such statement shall explain that the property and/or lot owners are ultimately responsible for the upkeep and maintenance of all streets until such time that the streets are assumed for maintenance by a public entity. 
(c)  Half streets. The dedication of half streets of less than the state requirement at the perimeter of a new subdivision shall be prohibited. If circumstances render this impracticable, adequate provision for the concurrent dedication of the remaining half of the street shall be furnished by the subdivider. Where there exists a half street in an adjoining subdivision, the remaining half shall be provided by the proposed subdivision. However, in circumstances where more than 60 feet of right-of-way is required, a partial width right-of-way, not less than 60 feet in width, may be dedicated when adjoining undeveloped property is owned or controlled by the subdivider; provided, however, that the width of the partial dedication is such as to permit the installation of such facilities as may be necessary to serve abutting lots. When the adjoining property is subdivided, the remainder of the full required right-of-way shall be dedicated. 
(d)  Marginal access streets. Where a tract of land to be subdivided adjoins an arterial street, the subdivider shall be required to provide reverse frontage on a minor street for the lots to be developed adjacent to the arterial. Where reverse frontage is established, private driveways shall be prevented from having direct access to the arterial. In the case of a minor subdivision proposed to front onto an arterial street, the subdivision administrator may regulate access by requiring that: 
(1)  Access be limited to a minor street, when available. 
(2)  An alternative access design, such as joint driveways, be used to achieve the intent of this provision. 
(e)  Access to adjacent properties. Where, in the opinion of the planning board, it is necessary to provide for street access to an adjoining property, proposed streets shall be extended by dedication to the boundary of such property and a temporary turnaround provided. 
(f)  Nonresidential streets. The subdivider of a nonresidential subdivision shall provide streets in accordance with state department of transportation standards and the standards in this article, whichever are stricter in regard to each particular item. 
(g)  Street design standards. The design of all streets and roads within the jurisdiction of this article shall be in accordance with the accepted policies of the state department of transportation, division of highways' subdivision roads minimum construction standards, and shall apply for any items not included in this article, or where stricter than this article. The provision of street rights-of-way shall conform to the recommendations of the mutually adopted "Transportation Plan Technical Report for Oak Island," or successor document. In cases where a dedication of right-of-way is required, the subdivider will only be required to dedicate a maximum of 100 feet of right-of-way. In cases where over 100 feet of right-of-way is desired, the subdivider will be required only to reserve the amount in excess of 100 feet. In all cases in which right-of-way is sought for an access controlled facility, the subdivider will only be required to make a reservation. 
(1)  Right-of-way widths. Right-of-way widths shall not be less than required by state department of transportation standards for the type of road proposed and shall apply except in those cases where right-of-way requirements have been specifically set out in an approved thoroughfare plan. 
(2)  Street widths. Widths for street and road classifications, other than local, shall be as required by the state department of transportation. Width of local roads and streets shall be as follows: 
a.  Local residential: 
1.  Curb and gutter section: 26 feet, face of curb 
2.  Shoulder section: 20 feet to edge of pavement, four-foot shoulders 
b.  Residential collector: 
1.  Curb and gutter section: 34 feet, face to face of curb 
2.  Shoulder section: 22 feet to edge of pavement, six-foot shoulders 
(3)  Intersections. 
a.  Streets shall be laid out so as to intersect as nearly as possible at right angles, and no street shall intersect any other street at any angle less than 60 degrees. 
b.  Property lines at intersections should be set so that the distance from the edge of pavement, of the street turnout, to the property line will be at least as great as the distance from the edge of pavement to the property line along the intersecting streets. This property line can be established as a radius or as a sight triangle. Greater offsets from the edge of pavement to the property lines will be required, if necessary, to provide sight distance for the vehicle on the side street. 
c.  Offset intersections are to be avoided unless exception is granted by the state department of transportation. Intersections which cannot be aligned should be separated by a minimum length of 200 feet between survey centerlines. 
d.  Intersections with arterials, collectors and thoroughfares shall be as required by the state department of transportation. 
(4)  Culs-de-sac. Permanent dead-end streets should not exceed 500 feet in length unless necessitated by topography or property accessibility and in no case shall be permitted to be over 700 feet in length. Measurement shall be from the point where the centerline of the dead-end street intersects with the center of a through street to the center of the turnaround of the cul-de-sac. The distance from the edge of the pavement on the vehicular turnaround to the center of the cul-de-sac shall have a minimum length of 50 feet (e.g., a 50-foot radius). Culs-de-sac may not be used to avoid connection with an existing street or to avoid the extension of an important street, unless exception is granted by the town council. In all cases, permanent easements must be granted to the town by the subdivider or property owner at locations which would allow the extension and intersection of the dead-end road with existing dedicated roadways. Such easements must be at least the size of the existing roadway which would join the dead-end road at that location. 
(5)  Alleys. 
a.  Alleys shall be required to serve lots used for commercial and industrial purposes except that this requirement may be waived where other definite and ensured provision is made for service access. Alleys shall not be provided in residential subdivisions unless necessitated by unusual circumstances. 
b.  The width of an alley shall be at least 20 feet. 
c.  Dead-end alleys shall be avoided where possible, but if unavoidable, shall be provided with adequate turnaround facilities at the dead end as may be approved by the town council. 
d.  Sharp changes in alignment and grade shall be avoided. 
e.  All alleys shall be designed in accordance with the state department of transportation standards. 
(h)  Other street requirements. 
(1)  Through traffic discouraged on residential collector and local streets. Residential collector and local streets shall be laid out in such a way that their use by through traffic will be discouraged. Streets shall be designed or walkways dedicated to ensure convenient access to parks, playgrounds, schools, or other places of public assembly. 
(2)  Sidewalks. Sidewalks are considered necessary on all streets in both commercial and residential areas to provide for pedestrian safety. Sidewalks shall be constructed by the subdivider on both sides of collector or higher street classification and on one side of all lower street classifications. Such sidewalks shall be constructed to a minimum width of four feet, and shall consist of a minimum depth of four inches of concrete. All sidewalks shall be placed in the right-of-way, unless the development is platted as a planned unit or group development. Sidewalks shall consist of a minimum of six inches of concrete at driveway crossings or shall be adequately reinforced otherwise. 
(3)  Street names. Proposed streets which are obviously in alignment with existing streets shall be given the same name. In assigning new names, duplication of existing names shall be avoided and in no case shall the proposed name be phonetically similar to existing names in the county irrespective of the use of a suffix such as a street, road, drive, place, court, etc. Street names shall be subject to the approval of the town council. 
(4)  Street name signs. The subdivider shall be required to provide and erect street name signs and stop signs to town and state standards at all intersections within the subdivision. 
(5)  Permits for connection to state roads. An approved permit is required for connection to any existing town or state system road. This permit is required prior to any construction on the street or road. 
(6)  Offsets to utility service. Access for utilities should be located clear of roadway shoulders, preferably a minimum of at least 30 feet from the edge of pavement on arterial streets or major thoroughfares. On streets with curb and gutter, utility access should be set back a minimum distance of six feet from the face of the curb. 
(7)  Wheelchair ramps. In accordance with G.S. 136-44.14, all street curbs in the state being constructed or reconstructed for maintenance procedures, traffic operations, repairs, correction of utilities, or altered for any reason after September 1, 1973, shall provide wheelchair ramps for the physically handicapped at all intersections where both curb and gutter and sidewalks are provided and at other major points of pedestrian flow.

DIVISION 1. - GENERALLY 

Sec. 18-541. - Statutory authorization. 
    Municipal. The legislature of the State of North Carolina has in part 6, article 21 of chapter 143; parts 3, 5, and 8 of article 19 of chapter 160A; and article 8 of chapter 160A of the North Carolina General Statutes, delegated to local governmental units the responsibility to adopt regulations designed to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare. 
    Therefore, the Town Council of Oak Island, North Carolina, does ordain as follows: 
(Amend. of 10-10-2017, Art. 1, § A; Amend. of 4-9-2018(3)) 
Sec. 18-542. - Findings of fact. 
(a)  The floodprone areas within the jurisdiction of Oak Island are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life, property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures of flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety, and general welfare. 
(b)  These flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains causing increases in flood heights and velocities and by the occupancy in floodprone areas of uses vulnerable to floods or other hazards. 
(Amend. of 10-10-2017, Art. 1, § B) 
Sec. 18-543. - Statement of purpose. 
    It is the purpose of this article to promote public health, safety, and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions within floodprone areas by provisions designed to: 
(1)  Restrict or prohibit uses that are dangerous to health, safety, and property due to water or erosion hazards or that result in damaging increases in erosion, flood heights or velocities; 
(2)  Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities that serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction; 
(3)  Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural protective barriers, which are involved in the accommodation of floodwaters; 
(4)  Control filling, grading, dredging, and all other development that may increase erosion or flood damage; and 
(5)  Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers that will unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands. 
(Amend. of 10-10-2017, Art. 1, § C) 
Sec. 18-544. - Objectives. 
    The objectives of this article are to: 
(1)  Protect human life, safety, and health; 
(2)  Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects; 
(3)  Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public; 
(4)  Minimize prolonged business losses and interruptions; 
(5)  Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities (i.e. water and gas mains, electric, telephone, cable and sewer lines, streets, and bridges) that are located in floodprone areas; 
(6)  Minimize damage to private and public property due to flooding; 
(7)  Make flood insurance available to the community through the National Flood Insurance Program; 
(8)  Maintain the natural and beneficial functions of floodplains; 
(9)  Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of floodprone areas; and 
(10)  Ensure that potential buyers are aware that property is in a special flood hazard area. 
(Amend. of 10-10-2017, Art. 1, § D) 
Sec. 18-545. - Lands to which this article applies. 
    This article shall apply to all special flood hazard areas within the jurisdiction, including extra-territorial jurisdictions (ETJs), if applicable of Oak Island. 
(Amend. of 10-10-2017, Art. 3, § A) 
Sec. 18-546. - Basis for establishing the special flood hazard areas. 
    The special flood hazard areas are those identified under the cooperating technical state (CTS) agreement between the State of North Carolina and FEMA in its FIS dated August 28, 2018 for Brunswick County and associated DFIRM panels, including any digital data developed as part of the FIS, which are adopted by reference and declared a part of this article. Future revisions to the FIS and DFIRM panels that do not change flood hazard data within the jurisdictional authority of Oak Island are also adopted by reference and declared a part of this article. Subsequent letter of map revisions (LOMRs) and/or physical map revisions (PMRs) shall be adopted within three months. 
(Amend. of 10-10-2017, Art. 3, § B; Amend. of 4-9-2018(3)) 
Sec. 18-547. - Establishment of floodplain development permit. 
    A floodplain development permit shall be required in conformance with the provisions of this article prior to the commencement of any development activities within special flood hazard areas determined in accordance with the provisions of section 18-546 of this article. 
(Amend. of 10-10-2017, Art. 3, § C) 
Sec. 18-548. - Compliance. 
    No structure or land shall hereafter be located, extended, converted, altered, or developed in any way without full compliance with the terms of this article and other applicable regulations. 
(Amend. of 10-10-2017, Art. 3, § D) 
Sec. 18-549. - Abrogation and greater restrictions. 
    This article is not intended to repeal, abrogate, or impair any existing easements, covenants, or deed restrictions. However, where this article and another conflict or overlap, whichever imposes the more stringent restrictions shall prevail. 
(Amend. of 10-10-2017, Art. 3, § E) 
Sec. 18-550. - Interpretation. 
    In the interpretation and application of this article, all provisions shall be: 
(1)  Considered as minimum requirements;

(Amend. of 10-10-2017, Art. 3, § F) 
Sec. 18-551. - Warning and disclaimer of liability. 
    The degree of flood protection required by this article is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on scientific and engineering consideration. Larger floods can and will occur. Actual flood heights may be increased by manmade or natural causes. This article does not imply that land outside the special flood hazard areas or uses permitted within such areas will be free from flooding or flood damages. This article shall not create liability on the part of Oak Island or by any officer or employee thereof for any flood damages that result from reliance on this article or any administrative decision lawfully made hereunder. 
(Amend. of 10-10-2017, Art. 3, § G) 
Sec. 18-552. - Penalties for violation. 
    Violation of the provisions of this article or failure to comply with any of its requirements, including violation of conditions and safeguards established in connection with grants of variance or special exceptions, shall constitute a class 1 misdemeanor pursuant to G.S. 143-215.58. Any person who violates this article or fails to comply with any of its requirements shall, upon conviction thereof, be fined not more than $100.00 or imprisoned for not more than 30 days, or both. Each day such violation continues shall be considered a separate offense. Nothing herein contained shall prevent Oak Island from taking such other lawful action as is necessary to prevent or remedy any violation.

The evaluation shall be prepared by a qualified North Carolina licensed engineer using standard engineering methods and models. 
    Flood zone means a geographical area shown on a flood hazard boundary map or flood insurance rate map that reflects the severity or type of flooding in the area. 
    Freeboard means the height added to the BFE to account for the many unknown factors that could contribute to flood heights greater than the height calculated for a selected size flood and floodway conditions, such as wave action, blockage of bridge openings, and the hydrological effect of urbanization of the watershed. The BFE plus the freeboard establishes the "regulatory flood protection elevation". 
    Functionally dependent facility means a facility which cannot be used for its intended purpose unless it is located in close proximity to water, limited to a docking or port facility necessary for the loading and unloading of cargo or passengers, shipbuilding, or ship repair. The term does not include long-term storage, manufacture, sales, or service facilities.

A LOMA is based on technical data showing that a property had been inadvertently mapped as being in the floodplain, but is actually on natural high ground above the base flood elevation. A LOMA amends the current effective flood insurance rate map and establishes that a specific property, portion of a property, or structure is not located in a special flood hazard area. 
(2)  Letter of map revision (LOMR). A revision based on technical data that may show changes to flood zones, flood elevations, special flood hazard area boundaries and floodway delineations, and other planimetric features. 
(3)  Letter of map revision based on fill (LOMR-F).

The actual start means either the first placement of permanent construction of a structure on a site, such as the pouring of slab or footings, the installation of piles, the construction of columns, or any work beyond the stage of excavation; or the placement of a manufactured home on a foundation. Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as clearing, grading, and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings, piers, or foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main structure. For a substantial improvement, the actual start of construction means the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of the building, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building. 
    Structure means a walled and roofed building, a manufactured home, or a gas, liquid, or liquefied gas storage tank that is principally above ground. 
    Substantial damage means damage of any origin sustained by a structure during any one-year period whereby the cost of restoring the structure to its before-damaged condition would equal or exceed 50 percent of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred. See definition of "substantial improvement". 
    Substantial improvement means any combination of repairs, reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, or other improvement of a structure, taking place during any one-year period for which the cost equals or exceeds 50 percent of the market value of the structure before the "start of construction" of the improvement. This term includes structures which have incurred "substantial damage," regardless of the actual repair work performed. The term does not, however, include either: 
(1)  Any correction of existing violations of state or community health, sanitary, or safety code specifications which have been identified by the community code enforcement official and which are the minimum necessary to assure safe living conditions; or 
(2)  Any alteration of a historic structure, provided that the alteration will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a historic structure and the alteration is approved by variance issued pursuant to section 18-585 of this article. 
    Technical bulletin and technical fact sheet means a FEMA publication that provides guidance concerning the building performance standards of the NFIP, which are contained in Title 44 of the U.S. Code of Federal Regulations at Section 60.3. The bulletins and fact sheets are intended for use primarily by state and local officials responsible for interpreting and enforcing NFIP regulations and by members of the development community, such as design professionals and builders. New bulletins, as well as updates of existing bulletins, are issued periodically as needed. The bulletins do not create regulations; rather they provide specific guidance for complying with the minimum requirements of existing NFIP regulations. 
It should be noted that technical bulletins and technical fact sheets provide guidance on the minimum requirements of the NFIP regulations. state or community requirements that exceed those of the NFIP take precedence. Design professionals should contact the community officials to determine whether more restrictive state or local regulations apply to the building or site in question. All applicable standards of the state or local building code must also be met for any building in a flood hazard area. 
    Temperature controlled means having the temperature regulated by a heating and/or cooling system, built-in or appliance. 
    Variance is a grant of relief from the requirements of this article. 
    Violation means the failure of a structure or other development to be fully compliant with the community's floodplain management regulations. A structure or other development without the elevation certificate, other certifications, or other evidence of compliance required in divisions 3 and 4 is presumed to be in violation until such time as that documentation is provided. 
    Water surface elevation (WSE) means the height, in relation to NAVD 1988, of floods of various magnitudes and frequencies in the floodplains of coastal or riverine areas. 
    Watercourse means a lake, river, creek, stream, wash, channel or other topographic feature on or over which waters flow at least periodically. Watercourse includes specifically designated areas in which substantial flood damage may occur.

(Amend. of 10-10-2017, Art. 5, § A) 
Sec. 18-612. - Specific standards. 
    In all special flood hazard areas where BFE data has been provided, as set forth in section 18-546, or section 18-614, the following provisions, in addition to the provisions of 18-611, are required: 
(1)  Residential construction. New construction and substantial improvement of any residential structure (including manufactured homes) shall have the reference level, including basement, elevated no lower than the "regulatory flood protection elevation", as defined in section 18-553 of this article. 
(2)  Nonresidential construction. New construction and substantial improvement of any commercial, industrial, or other nonresidential structure shall have the reference level, including basement, elevated no lower than the regulatory flood protection elevation, as defined in section 18-553 of this article. Structures located in zones A, AE, AH, AO, A99 may be floodproofed to the regulatory flood protection elevation in lieu of elevation provided that all areas of the structure, together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities, below the regulatory flood protection elevation are watertight with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water, using structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and the effect of buoyancy. For AO zones, the floodproofing elevation shall be in accordance with subsection 18-619(2). A registered professional engineer or architect shall certify that the floodproofing standards of this subsection are satisfied. Such certification shall be provided to the floodplain administrator as set forth in subsection 18-582(c), along with the operational plan and the inspection and maintenance plan. 
(3)  Manufactured homes. 
a.  New and replacement manufactured homes shall be elevated so that the reference level of the manufactured home is no lower than the regulatory flood protection elevation, as defined in section 18-553 of this article. 
b.  Manufactured homes shall be securely anchored to an adequately anchored foundation to resist flotation, collapse, and lateral movement, either by certified engineered foundation system, or in accordance with the most current edition of the State of North Carolina Regulations for Manufactured Homes adopted by the Commissioner of Insurance pursuant to G.S. 143-143.15. Additionally, when the elevation would be met by an elevation of the chassis 36 inches or less above the grade at the site, the chassis shall be supported by reinforced piers or engineered foundation. When the elevation of the chassis is above 36 inches in height, an engineering certification is required. 
c.  All enclosures or skirting below the lowest floor shall meet the requirements of subsection 18-612(4). 
d.  An evacuation plan must be developed for evacuation of all residents of all new, substantially improved or substantially damaged manufactured home parks or subdivisions located within floodprone areas. This plan shall be filed with and approved by the floodplain administrator and the local emergency management coordinator. 
(4)  Elevated buildings. Fully enclosed area, of new construction and substantially improved structures, which is below the lowest floor or below the lowest horizontal structural member in VE zones: 
a.  Shall not be designed or used for human habitation, but shall only be used for parking of vehicles, building access, or limited storage of maintenance equipment used in connection with the premises. Access to the enclosed area shall be the minimum necessary to allow for parking of vehicles (garage door) or limited storage of maintenance equipment (standard exterior door), or entry to the living area (stairway or elevator). The interior portion of such enclosed area shall not be finished or partitioned into separate rooms, except to enclose storage areas; 
b.  Shall not be temperature-controlled or conditioned; 
c.  Shall be constructed entirely of flood-resistant materials at least to the regulatory flood protection elevation; and 
d.  Shall include, in zones A, AE, AH, AO, A99 flood openings to automatically equalize hydrostatic flood forces on walls by allowing for the entry and exit of floodwaters. To meet this requirement, the openings must either be certified by a professional engineer or architect or meet or exceed the following minimum design criteria: 
1.  A minimum of two flood openings on different sides of each enclosed area subject to flooding; 
2.  The total net area of all flood openings must be at least one square inch for each square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding; 
3.  If a building has more than one enclosed area, each enclosed area must have flood openings to allow floodwaters to automatically enter and exit; 
4.  The bottom of all required flood openings shall be no higher than one foot above the higher of the interior or exterior adjacent grade; 
5.  Flood openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, or other coverings or devices, provided they permit the automatic flow of floodwaters in both directions; and 
6.  Enclosures made of flexible skirting are not considered enclosures for regulatory purposes, and, therefore, do not require flood openings. Masonry or wood underpinning, regardless of structural status, is considered an enclosure and requires flood openings as outlined above. 
e.  Shall, in coastal high hazard areas (zone VE), either be free of obstruction or constructed with breakaway walls, open wood latticework or insect screening, provided they are not part of the structural support of the building and are designed so as to breakaway, under abnormally high tides or wave action without causing damage to the elevated portion of the building or supporting foundation system or otherwise jeopardizing the structural integrity of the building. The following design specifications shall be met: 
1.  Material shall consist of open wood or plastic lattice, or insect screening; or 
2.  Breakaway walls shall meet the following design specifications: 
a.  Design safe loading resistance shall be not less than ten nor more than 20 pounds per square foot; or 
b.  Breakaway walls that exceed a design safe loading resistance of 20 pounds per square foot (either by design or when so required by state or local codes) shall be certified by a registered professional engineer or architect that the breakaway wall will collapse from a water load less than that which would occur during the base flood event, and the elevated portion of the building and supporting foundation system shall not be subject to collapse, displacement, or other structural damage due to the effects of wind and water loads acting simultaneously on all building components (structural and nonstructural). The water loading values used shall be those associated with the base flood. The wind loading values used shall be those required by the North Carolina State Building Code. 
f.  Property owners shall be required to execute and record a non-conversion agreement prior to issuance of a building permit declaring that the area below the lowest floor shall not be improved, finished or otherwise converted to habitable space; Oak Island will have the right to inspect the enclosed area. Oak Island will conduct annual inspections. This agreement shall be recorded with the Brunswick County Register of Deeds and shall transfer with the property in perpetuity. 
g.  Release of restrictive covenant. If a property which is bound by a non-conversion agreement is modified to remove enclosed areas below BFE, then the owner may request release of restrictive covenant after staff inspection and submittal of confirming documentation. 
(5)  Additions/improvements. 
a.  Additions and/or improvements to pre-FIRM structures when the addition and/or improvements in combination with any interior modifications to the existing structure are: 
1.  Not a substantial improvement, the addition and/or improvements must be designed to minimize flood damages and must not be any more non-conforming than the existing structure. 
2.  A substantial improvement, with modifications/rehabilitations/improvements to the existing structure or the common wall is structurally modified more than installing a doorway, both the existing structure and the addition must comply with the standards for new construction. 
b.  Additions to pre-FIRM or post-FIRM structures that are a substantial improvement with no modifications/rehabilitations/improvements to the existing structure other than a standard door in the common wall, shall require only the addition to comply with the standards for new construction. 
c.  Additions and/or improvements to post-FIRM structures when the addition and/or improvements in combination with any interior modifications to the existing structure are: 
1.  Not a substantial improvement, the addition and/or improvements only must comply with the standards for new construction consistent with the code and requirements for the original structure. 
2.  A substantial improvement, both the existing structure and the addition and/or improvements must comply with the standards for new construction. 
d.  Any combination of repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition or improvement of a building or structure taking place during a one-year period, the cumulative cost of which equals or exceeds 50 percent of the market value of the structure before the improvement or repair is started must comply with the standards for new construction. For each building or structure, the one-year period begins on the date of the first improvement or repair of that building or structure subsequent to the effective date of this article. If the structure has sustained substantial damage, any repairs are considered substantial improvement regardless of the actual repair work performed. The requirement does not, however, include either: 
1.  Any project for improvement of a building required to correct existing health, sanitary or safety code violations identified by the building official and that are the minimum necessary to assume safe living conditions. 
2.  Any alteration of a historic structure provided that the alteration will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a historic structure. 
(6)  Recreational vehicles. Recreational vehicles shall either: 
a.  Temporary placement. 
1.  Be on site for fewer than 180 consecutive days; or 
2.  Be fully licensed and ready for highway use. (A recreational vehicle is ready for highway use if it is on its wheels or jacking system, is attached to the site only by quick disconnect type utilities, and has no permanently attached additions.) 
b.  Permanent placement. Recreational vehicles that do not meet the limitations of temporary placement shall meet all the requirements for new construction. 
(7)  Temporary nonresidential structures. Prior to the issuance of a floodplain development permit for a temporary structure, the applicant must submit to the floodplain administrator a plan for the removal of such structure(s) in the event of a hurricane, flash flood or other type of flood warning notification.

Editor's note- Ord. of Mar. 10, 2009, deleted the former Art. V, §§ 18-651-18-662, and enacted a new Art. V as set out herein. The former Art. V pertained to stormwater management and derived from Ord. of 6-12-2001, ch. 4, §§ 1.0-12.0; Amend. of 7-12-2005; Amend. of 2-14-2006(1); Ord. of 11-13-2006. 

DIVISION 1. - GENERAL PROVISIONS 

Sec. 18-651. - Title. 
    This article shall be officially known as "The Phase II Stormwater Ordinance." It is referred to herein as "this article." 
(Ord. of 3-10-2009) 
Sec. 18-652. - Authority. 
    The Town of Oak Island is authorized to adopt this article pursuant to North Carolina law, including but not limited to article 14, section 5 of the Constitution of North Carolina; the charter of the Town of Oak Island; G.S. 143-214.7 and rules promulgated by the environmental management commission there under; Session Law 2004-163; ch. 160A, §§ 174, 185. Session Law 2007- S.B. 1967. 
(Ord. of 3-10-2009) 
Sec. 18-653. - Findings. 
It is hereby determined that: 
    Development and redevelopment alter the hydrologic response of local watersheds and increase stormwater runoff rates and volumes, flooding, soil erosion, stream channel erosion, nonpoint and point source pollution, and sediment transport and deposition, as well as reducing groundwater recharge; 
    These changes in stormwater runoff contribute to increased quantities of water-borne pollutants and alterations in hydrology that are harmful to public health and safety as well as to the natural environment; and 
    These effects can be managed and minimized by applying proper design and well-planned controls to manage stormwater runoff from development sites. 
    Further, the Federal Water Pollution Control Act of 1972 ("Clean Water Act") and Federal Phase II Stormwater Rules promulgated under it, as well as rules of the state environmental management commission promulgated in response to federal phase II requirements, compel certain urbanized areas, including this jurisdiction, to adopt minimum stormwater controls such as those included in this article. 
    Therefore, the Town of Oak Island establishes this set of water quality and quantity regulations to meet the requirements of the state and federal law regarding control of stormwater runoff and discharge. 
(Ord. of 3-10-2009) 
Sec. 18-654. - Purpose. 
(a)  General. The purpose of this article is to protect, maintain and enhance the public health, safety, environment and general welfare by establishing minimum requirements and procedures to control the adverse effects of increased post-development stormwater runoff and nonpoint and point source pollution associated with new development and redevelopment. It has been determined that proper management of construction-related and post-development stormwater runoff will minimize damage to public and private property and infrastructure; safeguard the public health, safety, and general welfare; and protect water and aquatic resources. 
(b)  Specific. This article seeks to meet its general purpose through the following specific objectives and means: 
(1)  Establishing decision-making processes for development that protects the integrity of watersheds and preserve the health of water resources; 
(2)  Requiring that new development and redevelopment maintain the predevelopment hydrologic response in their post-development state as nearly as practicable for the applicable design storm to reduce flooding and erosion, nonpoint and point source pollution and increases in stream or tidal creek temperature, and to maintain the integrity of stream channels, aquatic habitats and estuaries; 
(3)  Establishing minimum post-development stormwater management standards and design criteria for the regulation and control of stormwater runoff quantity and quality; 
(4)  Establishing design and review criteria for the construction, function, and use of structural stormwater BMPs that may be used to meet the minimum post-development stormwater management standards; 
(5)  Encouraging the use of better management and site design practices, such as the use of vegetated conveyances for stormwater and the preservation of green space, riparian buffers and other conservation areas to the maximum extent practicable; 
(6)  Establishing provisions for the long-term responsibility for and maintenance of structural and nonstructural stormwater BMPs to ensure that they continue to function as designed, are maintained appropriately, and pose no threat to public safety; 
(7)  Establishing administrative procedures for the submission, review, approval and disapproval of stormwater management plans, for the inspection of approved projects, and to assure appropriate long-term maintenance.

(Ord. of 3-10-2009) 
Sec. 18-663. - Applications for approval. 
(a)  Concept plan and consultation meeting. Before a stormwater management permit application is deemed complete, the stormwater administrator or developer may request a consultation on a concept plan for the post-construction stormwater management system to be utilized in the proposed development project. This consultation meeting should take place at the time of the preliminary plan of subdivision or other early step in the development process. The purpose of this meeting is to discuss the post-construction stormwater management measures necessary for the proposed project, as well as to discuss and assess constraints, opportunities and potential approaches to stormwater management designs before formal site design engineering is commenced. The town land use plan, open space ordinance and other relevant resource protection plans should be consulted in the discussion of the concept plan. 
To accomplish this goal, the following information should be included in the concept plan, which should be submitted in advance of the meeting: 
(1)  Existing conditions/proposed site plans. Existing conditions and proposed site layout sketch plans, which illustrate at a minimum: existing and proposed topography; perennial and intermittent streams; mapping of predominant soils from soil surveys (if available); boundaries of existing predominant vegetation; proposed limits of clearing and grading; and location of existing and proposed roads, buildings, parking areas and other impervious surfaces. 
(2)  Natural resources inventory. A written or graphic inventory of natural resources at the site and surrounding area as it exists prior to the commencement of the project. This description should include a discussion of soil conditions, forest cover, geologic features, topography, wetlands, and native vegetative areas on the site, as well as the location and boundaries of other natural feature protection and conservation areas such as natural heritage areas, lakes, ponds, floodplains, stream buffers and other setbacks (e.g., drinking water well setbacks, septic setbacks, etc.). Particular attention should be paid to environmentally sensitive features that provide particular opportunities or constraints for development and stormwater management. 
(3)  Stormwater management system concept plan. A written or graphic concept plan of the proposed post-development stormwater management system including: preliminary selection and location of proposed structural stormwater controls; low-impact design elements; location of existing and proposed conveyance systems such as grass channels, swales, and storm drains; flow paths; location of floodplain/floodway limits; relationship of site to upstream and downstream properties and drainages; and preliminary location of any proposed stream channel modifications, such as bridge or culvert crossings. 
(b)  Stormwater management permit application. The stormwater management permit application shall detail how post-development stormwater runoff will be controlled and managed and how the proposed project will meet the requirements of this article, including division 3, standards. All such plans shall be prepared by a qualified state-registered professional engineer, surveyor, soil scientist or landscape architect, and the engineer, surveyor, soil scientist or landscape architect shall perform services only in their area of competence, and shall verify that the design of all stormwater management facilities and practices meets the submittal requirements for complete applications, that the designs and plans are sufficient to comply with applicable standards and policies found in the design manual, and that the designs and plans ensure compliance with this article. A qualified state-registered professional engineer must design all structural stormwater treatment systems for projects requiring a stormwater management permit. 
The submittal shall include all of the information required in the submittal checklist established by the stormwater administrator. Incomplete submittals shall be treated pursuant to subsection 18-662(f). 
(c)  As-built plans and final approval. Upon completion of a project, and before a certificate of occupancy shall be granted, the applicant shall certify that the completed project is in accordance with the approved stormwater management plans and designs, and shall submit actual "as built" plans for all stormwater management facilities or practices after final construction is completed. 
The plans shall show the final design specifications for all stormwater management facilities and practices and the field location, size, depth, and planted vegetation of all measures, controls, and devices, as installed. The designer of the stormwater management measures and plans shall certify, under seal, that the as-built stormwater measures, controls, and devices are in compliance with the approved stormwater management plans and designs and with the requirements of this article. Final approval by the stormwater administrator shall occur before the release of any performance securities. 
(d)  Other permits. No certificate of compliance or occupancy shall be issued by the development services department without final as-built plans and a final inspection and approval by the stormwater administrator, except where multiple units are served by the stormwater practice or facilities, in which case the development services department may elect to withhold a percentage of permits or certificates of occupancy until as-built plans are submitted and final inspection and approval has occurred. 
(Ord. of 3-10-2009) 
Sec. 18-664. - Approvals. 
(a)  Effect of approval. Approval authorizes the applicant to go forward with only the specific plans and activities authorized in the permit. The approval shall not be construed to exempt the applicant from obtaining other applicable approvals from local, state, and federal authorities. 
(b)  Time limit/expiration. An approved plan shall become null and void if the applicant fails to make substantial progress on the site within one year after the date of approval. The stormwater administrator may grant a single, one-year extension of this time limit, for good cause shown, upon receiving a written request from the applicant before the expiration of the approved plan. 
In granting an extension, the stormwater administrator may require compliance with standards adopted since the original application was submitted unless there has been substantial reliance on the original permit and the change in standards would infringe the applicant's vested rights.

DIVISION 3. - STANDARDS 

Sec. 18-666. - General standards. 
    All development and redevelopment projects not exempt from the provisions of this article must consider low impact development (LID) practices to analyze the infiltration capacity and natural drainages of the site and develop a system of controls which mimic the existing natural hydrology and which cumulatively capture and treat the runoff from the first one and one-half inches of rainfall or for high density projects within one-half mile of class SA waters the difference in the stormwater runoff from all surfaces from the predevelopment and post development conditions for a one-year, 24-hour storm, whichever is greater. LID practices may include any combination of site design techniques, strategies, and BMPs to store, infiltrate, evaporate, retain, and detain runoff on the site to more closely replicate predevelopment runoff thereby limiting the increase in pollutant loads caused by development. An LID guidance manual and BMP evaluation tools are provided for guidance in the administrative manual (see subsection 18-662(d)(3). Wherever LID practices are not achievable or have not been demonstrated, the management measures controlling the runoff from the site shall comply with the low-density or high-density standards, whichever apply. All new development shall have a 50-foot-wide vegetative buffer and redevelopment activities a 30-foot-wide vegetative buffer. The width of the buffer is measured horizontally from the normal pool elevation of impounded structures, from the bank of each side of streams or rivers, and from the mean high waterline of tidal waters, perpendicular to the shoreline. A perennial or intermittent surface water shall be deemed present if the feature is approximately shown on either the most recent version of the soil survey map prepared by the Natural Resources Conservation Service of the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) or the most recent version of the 1:24,000 scale (7.5 minute) quadrangle topographic maps prepared by the United States Geologic Survey (USGS). An exception to this requirement may be allowed when surface waters are not present in accordance with the provisions of 15A NCAC 2B.0233(3)(a) or similar site-specific determination made using division-approved methodology. Areas defined as coastal wetlands under 15A NCAC 07H.0205, as measured landward from the normal high waterline, shall not be included in the overall project area to calculate impervious surface density. For all development and redevelopment, no grading, cutting or filling shall be commenced until erosion and sedimentation control devices have been installed in order to retain sediment on the site. Erosion control devices must be maintained during all phases of construction and after development. All development and redevelopment applications shall include an erosion and sedimentation control plan. For developments requesting fill over one foot, engineered stormwater retention measures, such as retention ponds or an underground infiltration system, and a soil stabilization plan is required.

(Ord. of 3-10-2009) 
Sec. 18-674. - Operation and maintenance agreement. 
(a)  In general. Prior to the conveyance or transfer of any lot or building site to be served by a structural BMP pursuant to this article, and prior to issuance of any permit for development or redevelopment requiring a structural BMP pursuant to this article, the applicant or owner of the site must execute an operation and maintenance agreement that shall be binding on all subsequent owners of the site, portions of the site, and lots or parcels served by the structural BMP. Until the transference of all property, sites, or lots served by the structural BMP, the original owner or applicant shall have primary responsibility for carrying out the provisions of the maintenance agreement. 
The operation and maintenance agreement shall require the owner or owners to maintain, repair and, if necessary, reconstruct the structural BMP, and shall state the terms, conditions, and schedule of maintenance for the structural BMP. In addition, it shall grant to the town a right of entry in the event that the stormwater administrator has reason to believe it has become necessary to inspect, monitor, maintain, repair, or reconstruct the structural BMP; however, in no case shall the right of entry, of itself, confer an obligation on the town to assume responsibility for the structural BMP. 
The operation and maintenance agreement must be approved by the stormwater administrator prior to plan approval, and it shall be referenced on the final plat and shall be recorded with the county register of deeds upon final plat approval. A copy of the recorded maintenance agreement shall be given to the stormwater administrator within 14 days following its recordation. 
(b)  Special requirement for homeowners' and other associations. For all structural BMPs required pursuant to this article and that are to be or are owned and maintained by a homeowners' association, property owners' association, or similar entity, the required operation and maintenance agreement shall include all of the following provisions: 
(1)  Acknowledgment that the association shall continuously operate and maintain the stormwater control and management facilities; 
(2)  Establishment of an escrow account, which can be spent solely for sediment removal, structural, biological or vegetative replacement, major repair, or reconstruction of the structural BMPs. If structural BMPs are not performing adequately or as intended or are not properly maintained, the town, in its sole discretion, may remedy the situation, and in such instances the town shall be fully reimbursed from the escrow account. Escrowed funds may be spent by the association for sediment removal, structural, biological or vegetative replacement, major repair, and reconstruction of the structural BMPs, provided that the town shall first consent to the expenditure; 
(3)  Both developer contribution and annual sinking funds shall fund the escrow account. Prior to plat recordation or issuance of construction permits, whichever shall first occur, the developer shall pay into the escrow account an amount equal to 15 percent of the initial construction cost of the structural BMPs. Two-thirds of the total amount of sinking fund budget shall be deposited into the escrow account within the first five years and the full amount shall be deposited within ten years following initial construction of the structural BMPs. Funds shall be deposited each year into the escrow account. A portion of the annual assessments of the association shall include an allocation into the escrow account. Any funds drawn down from the escrow account shall be replaced in accordance with the schedule of anticipated work used to create the sinking fund budget; 
(4)  The percent of developer contribution and lengths of time to fund the escrow account may be varied by the town depending on the design and materials of the stormwater control and management facility; 
(5)  Granting to the town a right of entry to inspect, monitor, maintain, repair, and reconstruct structural BMPs; 
(6)  Allowing the town to recover from the association and its members any and all costs the town expends to maintain or repair the structural BMPs or to correct any operational deficiencies. Failure to pay the town all of its expended costs, after 45-days' written notice, shall constitute a breach of the agreement. In case of a deficiency, the town shall thereafter be entitled to bring an action against the association and its members to pay, or foreclose upon the lien hereby authorized by the agreement against the property, or both. Interest, collection costs, and attorney fees shall be added to the recovery; 
(7)  A statement that this agreement shall not obligate the town to maintain or repair any structural BMPs, and the town shall not be liable to any person for the condition or operation of structural BMPs; 
(8)  A statement that this agreement shall not in any way diminish, limit, or restrict the right of the town to enforce any of its ordinances as authorized by law; and 
(9)  A provision indemnifying and holding harmless the town for any costs and injuries arising from or related to the structural BMP, unless the town has agreed in writing to assume the maintenance responsibility for the BMP and has accepted dedication of any and all rights necessary to carry out that maintenance.

(1)  Installed by the permit holder as required by the approved stormwater management plan; and/or 
(2)  Maintained by the owner as required by the operation and maintenance agreement. 
(b)  Amount. 
(1)  Installation. The amount of an installation performance security shall be the total estimated construction cost of the BMPs approved under the permit, plus 25 percent. 
(2)  Maintenance. The amount of a maintenance performance security shall be the present value of an annuity of perpetual duration based on a reasonable estimate of the annual cost of inspection, operation and maintenance of the BMPs approved under the permit, at a discount rate that reflects the jurisdiction's cost of borrowing minus a reasonable estimate of long-term inflation. 
(c)  Uses of performance security. 
(1)  Forfeiture provisions. The performance security shall contain forfeiture provisions for failure, after proper notice, to complete work within the time specified, or to initiate or maintain any actions which may be required of the applicant or owner in accordance with this article, approvals issued pursuant to this article, or an operation and maintenance agreement established pursuant to this article. 
(2)  Default. Upon default of the owner to construct, maintain, repair and, if necessary, reconstruct any structural BMP in accordance with the applicable permit or operation and maintenance agreement, the stormwater administrator shall obtain and use all or any portion of the security to make necessary improvements based on an engineering estimate. Such expenditure of funds shall only be made after requesting the owner to comply with the permit or maintenance agreement. In the event of a default triggering the use of installation performance security, the town shall not return any of the unused deposited cash funds or other security, which shall be retained for maintenance. 
(3)  Costs in excess of performance security. If the town takes action upon such failure by the applicant or owner, the town may collect from the applicant or owner the difference between the amount of the reasonable cost of such action and the amount of the security held, in addition to any other penalties or damages due. 
(4)  Refund. Within 60 days of the final approval, the installation performance security shall be refunded to the applicant or terminated, except any amount attributable to the cost (plus 25 percent) of landscaping installation and ongoing maintenance associated with the BMPs covered by the security. Any such landscaping shall be inspected one year after installation with replacement for compliance with the approved plans and specifications and, if in compliance, the portion of the financial security attributable to landscaping shall be released.

    When used in this article, the following words and terms shall have the meaning set forth in this section, unless other provisions of this article specifically indicate otherwise. 
    Built upon area (BUA). Impervious surface and partially impervious surface to the extent that the partially impervious surface does not allow water to infiltrate through the surface and into the subsoil. "Built-upon area" does not include a slatted deck; the water area of a swimming pool; a surface of number 57 stone, as designated by the American Society for Testing and Materials, laid at least four inches thick over a geotextile fabric; or a trail as defined in G.S. 113A-85 that is either unpaved or paved as long as the pavement is porous with a hydraulic conductivity greater than 0.001 centimeters per second (1.41 inches per hour). 
    Department. The state department of environment and natural resources. 
    Design manual. The stormwater design manual approved for use in phase II jurisdictions by the department and developed by the state division of water quality for the proper implementation of the requirements of the federal phase II stormwater program. All references herein to the design manual are to the latest published edition or revision. 
    Development. Any land-disturbing activity that increases the amount of built-upon area or that otherwise decreases the infiltration of precipitation into the soil. 
    Division. The division of water quality in the department. 
    High-density project. Any project that exceeds the low-density threshold for built-upon area. 
    Larger common plan of development or sale. Any area where multiple separate and distinct construction or land-disturbing activities will occur under one plan. A plan is any announcement or piece of documentation (including but not limited to a sign, public notice or hearing, sales pitch, advertisement, loan application, drawing, permit application, zoning request, or computer design) or physical demarcation (including but not limited to boundary signs, lot stakes, or surveyor markings) indicating that construction activities may occur on a specific plot. 
    Low-density project. For a project that is not located within one-half mile of and draining to class SA waters: the project is a low-density project if it has a built upon area of 24 percent or less. 
For a project that is located within one-half mile of and draining to class SA waters: the project is a low-density project only if it has a built upon area of 12 percent or less. CAMA-Jurisdictional wetlands (coastal marsh) will be excluded from impervious surface calculations. 
A project with an overall density at or below the relevant low-density threshold, but containing areas with a density greater than the overall project density, may be considered low density as long as the project meets or exceeds the requirements for low density development and locates the higher density in upland areas and away from surface waters and drainageways to the maximum extent practicable. 
    One-year, 24-hour storm. The surface runoff resulting from a 24-hour rainfall of an intensity expected to be equaled or exceeded, on average, once in 12 months and with a duration of 24 hours.

"Owner" shall include long-term commercial tenants; management entities, such as those charged with or engaged in the management of properties for profit; and every person or entity having joint ownership of the property. A secured lender not in possession of the property does not constitute an owner, unless the secured lender is included within the meaning of "owner" under another description in this definition, such as a management entity. 
    Redevelopment. Any development on previously-developed land, other than a rebuilding activity that results in no net increase in built-upon area and provides equal or greater stormwater control than the previous development. 
    Structural BMP. A physical device designed to trap, settle out, or filter pollutants from stormwater runoff; to alter or reduce stormwater runoff velocity, amount, timing, or other characteristics; to approximate the predevelopment hydrology on a developed site; or to achieve any combination of these goals. Structural BMP includes physical practices such as constructed wetlands, vegetative practices, filter strips, grassed swales, and other methods installed or created on real property. "Structural BMP" is synonymous with "structural practice," "stormwater control facility," "stormwater control practice," "stormwater treatment practice," "stormwater management practice," "stormwater control measures," "structural stormwater treatment systems," and similar terms used in this article. 
    Substantial progress. For the purposes of determining whether sufficient progress has been made on an approved plan, one or more of the following construction activities toward the completion of a site or subdivision plan shall occur: 
Obtaining a grading permit and conducting grading activity on a continuous basis and not discontinued for more than 30 days; or 
Installation and approval of on-site infrastructure; or 
Obtaining a building permit for the construction and approval of a building foundation.

(Ord. of 8-13-2002, § 2.0) 
Sec. 18-703. - Findings of facts. 
    The town council finds that the discharge of non-stormwater drainage to waters of the state and to the municipal storm drainage system could have significant adverse impact upon health, safety, and welfare of the community. More specifically: 
(1)  Illicit stormwater discharges carry pollutants into receiving water bodies, degrading water quality and effect in closures of shell fishing waters. 
(2)  A nutrient such as phosphorus or nitrogen accelerates eutrophication of receiving waters, adversely affecting flora and fauna. 
(3)  Improper connection to the storm drain system and to waters of the state adversely impacts quality of receiving waters. 
(4)  Septic tank discharges from non-compliant systems, washing machine discharges, and illegal dumping into the stormwater drains are examples of illicit discharges. 
(5)  The town must have the authority to deter and/or stop illicit discharges to stormwater drains and ditches. 
(6)  Substantial economic losses result from these adverse impacts on community waters. 
(7)  Illicit discharges to water bodies diminish their capacity to naturally process runoff nutrients, thereby harming flora and fauna. 
(8)  Increase of illicit discharge to waters can percolate into the soil, thereby decreasing groundwater quality. 
(9)  Improperly managed stormwater systems can decrease the quality of property and human life. 
(10)  Improperly managed stormwater drainage systems can interfere with the maintenance of optimum estuarine areas and biological productivity. 
(11)  Many future problems can be avoided if land is developed in accordance with an illicit stormwater discharge ordinance.

    No person shall discharge or cause to be discharged into the stormwater drain system or watercourses any materials, including but not limited to pollutants or waters containing any pollutants that cause or contribute to a violation of applicable water quality standards, other than stormwater. 
    The commencement, conduct or continuance of any illegal discharge to the stormwater drain system is prohibited except as described as follows: 
(1)  The following discharges are exempt from discharge prohibitions established by this article. 
a.  Rising ground water, 
b.  Uncontaminated pumped ground water, 
c.  Foundation or footing drains (not including active groundwater dewatering systems), 
d..  Crawl space pumps, 
e.  Other water source not containing pollutants. 
(2)  Discharges specified in writing by the town as being necessary to protect public health and safety. 
(3)  Dye testing is an allowable discharge, but requires a verbal notification to the town prior to the time of the test. 
(4)  The prohibition shall not apply to any non-stormwater discharge permitted under an NPDES permit, waiver, or waste discharge order issued to the persons and administered under the compliance with all requirements of the permit, waiver, or order and other applicable laws and regulations, and provided that written approval has been granted for any discharge to the stormwater drain system. 
Prohibition of illicit connections. 
    The construction, use, maintenance or continued existence of illicit connections to the stormwater drain system is prohibited. 
    This prohibition expressly includes, without limitation, connections made in the past, regardless of whether the connection was permissible under law or practices applicable or prevailing at the time of connection. 
    A person is considered to be in violation of this article if the person conveys non-stormwater to the stormwater drain system, or allows such a connection to continue. 
(Ord. of 8-13-2002, § 11.0) 
Sec. 18-712. - Monitoring of discharge. 
    This section applies to all properties that have stormwater discharges. 
Access to properties. 
(1)  The town shall be permitted to enter and inspect property subject to regulation under this article as often as may be necessary to determine compliance with this article.

Sec. 26-31. - Purpose and intent of article. 
(a)  In the recent past, there have been numerous incidents where persons or contractors undertaking excavation activities in or near public rights-of-way and utility lines have damaged underground utilities due to negligent or willful acts or omissions. 
(b)  The Underground Damage Prevention Act, G.S. 87-101 et seq., requires certain notice to utility owners by persons performing excavation activities. In addition, G.S. 87-104 imposes standards on excavations performed after appropriate notice to utility owners. In some instances, damage to underground utilities has resulted from a failure to comply with the provisions of the Underground Damage Prevention Act. 
(c)  The town is authorized by G.S. 160A-174 to adopt ordinances defining, prohibiting, regulating or abating acts, omissions, or conditions, detrimental to the health, safety, or welfare of its citizens. In addition, the town is authorized by G.S. 160A-296 to regulate digging in streets, sidewalks or alleys. 
(d)  It is in the interest of the general public health, safety and welfare to adopt an ordinance imposing certain standards on excavations in the vicinity of underground utilities and imposing civil penalties for the violation thereof.

(b)  No person shall undertake or make an excavation in any highway, public space or private easement of a utility owner in such a manner as to endanger, injure or damage any underground utility. For the purposes of this section, the failure to comply with G.S. 87-102 and G.S. 87-104 shall be considered endangerment of underground utilities. 
(c)  Any person excavating in any highway, public space or private easement of a utility owner shall take reasonable steps to protect any underground utility lines when excavating within 30 inches of either side of the outside edges of the marked location of a utility owner's underground utility as referenced in G.S. 87-101(5). This protection shall include hand-digging, air-jetting or vacuum excavation, or other means of safe excavation designed to avoid damage to the utility marked until the utility is exposed or is determined to be below the proposed excavation. Where a proposed excavation lies adjacent and/or parallel to an existing utility and within or partially within the tolerance zone, the existing utility shall be exposed by the methods in this subsection prior to beginning the excavation. Once the utility is exposed and the location markings are found to be correct, the excavation may proceed with mechanized equipment. 
(d)  Any person may assert as an affirmative defense to a violation of this section that a utility owner failed to identify the location of an underground utility after being notified in accordance with G.S. 87-102, or a utility owner otherwise failed to properly locate an underground utility after being so notified.

(5)  Except for the costs of installing oversized lines as provided for in subsection (b)(4) of this section, the developer shall be responsible for all costs associated with an extension to serve new development. 
(6)  For extensions undertaken by the town to serve existing developed property, assessments pursuant to G.S. 160A-216 et seq. shall be utilized and may be based on any of the alternatives specified by G.S. 160A-218. Benefited properties shall be responsible for all costs associated with the improvement except for those associated with the additional costs of oversized lines as provided for in subsection (b)(4) of this section. 
(c)  When the town annexes into an area where water or wastewater service is provided by another service provider or where the town allows a distribution or collection line extension into the town for the purpose of the provision of utility service by another provider, the mandatory connection policies of the other service provider shall apply in lieu of those of the town. Enforcement of any such connection policies shall be the sole responsibility of the service provider. In the case of annexation, the town assumes no obligation to provide duplicate water or wastewater service where such services are already in existence and being provided by another service provider or where law would otherwise prohibit competition for service. 
(Ord. of 4-10-2001(11), § 12-37) 
Sec. 30-73. - Additional extensions authorized. 
    The town may make or authorize extensions or connections to or from any improvements constructed at the expense of a developer without the permission of the developer. Construction of improvements at the expense of a developer shall not relieve such developer of the obligation to pay applicable fees under the town's water and sewer policies except as may be provided under this article. 
(Ord. of 4-10-2001(11), § 12-38) 
Sec. 30-74. - Reasons for extension refusal. 
    The town may refuse to extend or allow extension of service to property inside or outside of the corporate limits in situations where the town determines that extension of service is unreasonable or impracticable because: 
(1)  The cost of service extension is determined to be excessive in terms of the number of customers to be served or because of topographical, engineering, technical or other problems. 
(2)  The provision of service will adversely affect the supply of water to other customers or will adversely affect the town's sewage treatment facilities. 
(3)  Other good and sufficient reasons. 
(Ord. of 4-10-2001(11), § 12-39) 
Sec. 30-75. - Inspection by town. 
    All contracts and work related to connection or extension of the water and sewer systems of the town not performed by town forces, whether inside or outside of town, shall be subject to inspection by the town. Upon making application for extensions or connections to the town's water and sewer systems, the applicant agrees that the town possesses the right to inspect all necessary improvements or appurtenances thereto before such shall be connected to the systems of the town. The town shall be given notice to inspect before pipes are covered and connections made. The town may require any testing it deems appropriate to determine that work performed complies with approved specifications and plans with the expense of such testing being borne by the applicant or contractor. If, in the judgement of the director of utilities, there is a demonstrated lack of competent supervision or work quality by a contractor, the director may at his option: 
(1)  Halt work until approved supervision is obtained and the work is performed in accordance with town requirements and/or approved plans; or 
(2)  Provide constant inspection by town personnel at the expense of the applicant or contractor. 
Inspection of a project performed by the town does not consist of or imply supervision. The applicant of the contractor undertaking the improvement is solely responsible for ensuring that the project is completed in compliance with approved specifications and plans. The responsible party may be required to rearrange or redo any work to bring it into conformity with such approved plans and specifications. 
(Ord. of 4-10-2001(11), § 12-40) 
Sec. 30-76. - Extensions required within rights-of-way. 
    Water mains shall be extended only within the rights-of-way of publicly dedicated and opened streets. Sewer lines being constructed for direct service to adjoining properties shall also be located within such rights-of-way, except where topography or other reasons make this impracticable. In no case shall lines be extended across private property unless adequate permanent easements for such lines have been obtained. 
(Ord. of 4-10-2001(11), § 12-41) 
Sec. 30-77. - Connections to water and sewer systems from outside of corporate limits. 
    No connection of any water or sewer line or system outside of the town shall be made to any part of the town water or sewer system without the express authorization of the town council and under such terms as the council shall prescribe. 
(Ord. of 4-10-2001(11), § 12-42) 
Sec. 30-78. - Reservation of sewer capacity. 
    Subject to availability, sewer flow capacity can be reserved for future use. To pursue capacity reservation, an application showing the specific use and amount of calculated flow required must be submitted to the town for review and approval. At the time of approval, the applicant must pay the total applicable impact fees. If the development plans have not been approved and a permit issued by the town within 18 months from the date such capacity is available, the reservation will become null and void and the town retains the impact fees. At this time, the sewer flow capacity will be available for consideration of reallocation.

(Ord. of 10-12-1999, § 1) 
Sec. 30-103. - Fats, oils, and greases control. 
(a)  Scope and purpose. 
    To aid in the prevention of sanitary sewer blockages and obstructions from contributions and accumulation of fats, oils, and greases into said sewers system from industrial or commercial establishments, particular food preparation and serving facilities. 
(b)  Definitions. 
(1)  Fat, oils, and greases. Organic polar compounds derived from animal and/or plants sources that contain multiple carbon chain triglyceride molecules. These substances are detectable and measurable using analytical test procedures established in 40 CFR 136, as may be amended from time to time. All are sometimes referred to herein as "grease" or "greases". 
(2)  Grease trap or interceptor. A device for separating and retaining waterborne greases and grease complexes prior to the wastewater exiting the trap and entering the sanitary sewer collection and treatment system. These devices also serve to collect settable solids generated by and from food preparation activities, prior to the water exiting the trap and entering the sanitary sewer collection and treatment system. Grease traps and interceptors are sometimes referred to herein as "grease interceptors". 
(3)  Cooking establishments. Those establishments primarily engaged in activities of preparing, serving, or otherwise making available for consumption foodstuffs and that use one or more of the following preparation activities: cooking by frying (all methods), baking (all methods), grilling, sauteing, rotisserie cooking, broiling (all methods), boiling, blanching, roasting, toasting or poaching. Also included are infrared heating, searing, barbecuing, and any other food preparation activity that produces a hot non-drinkable food product in or on a receptacle that requires washing. 
(4)  Non-cooking establishments. Those establishments primarily engaged in the preparation of precooked foodstuffs that do not include any form of cooking. These include cold dairy and frozen foodstuffs preparation and serving establishments. 
(5)  Minimum design capability. The design features of a grease interceptor and its ability or volume required to effectively intercept and retain greases from grease-laden wastewaters discharged to the public sanitary sewer. 
(6)  User. Any person, including those located outside the jurisdiction limits of the town, who contributes, causes or permits the contribution or discharge of wastewater into the POTW including persons who contribute such wastewater from mobile sources such as those who discharge hauled wastewater. 
(c)  Grease interceptor maintenance, record keeping, and grease removal. 
(1)  Grease interceptors shall be installed by users as required by the public utilities director or his designee. Grease interceptors shall be installed at the user's expense, when such user operates a cooking establishment. Grease interceptors may also be required in non-cooking or cold dairy and frozen foodstuffs establishments when they are deemed necessary by the public utilities director for the proper handling of liquid wastes containing grease. No user shall allow wastewater discharge concentration from subject grease interceptors to exceed 325 milligrams per liter, as identified by EPA method 1664 or 275 milligrams per liter, as identified by EPA method 413. All grease interceptors shall be of the type designed and capacity approved by the public utilities director or his designee and shall be easily accessible for user cleaning and town inspections. All such grease interceptors shall be inspected, serviced and emptied of accumulated waste content as required in order to maintain minimum design capability or effective volume of the grease interceptor, but not less often than every 30 days. Users who are required to pass water through a grease interceptor shall: 
a.  Provide for a minimum hydraulic retention time of 24 minutes at actual peak flow or 12 minutes at the calculated theoretical peak flow rate as predicted by the Uniform Plumbing Code fixture criteria, between the influent and effluent baffles with 20 percent of the total volume of the grease interceptor being allowed for sludge to settle and accumulate, identified hereafter as a "sludge pocket". 
b.  Remove any accumulated grease cap and sludge pocket as required, but at intervals of not longer than 30 days at the users expense. Grease interceptors shall be kept free of inorganic solid materials such as grit, rocks, gravel, sand, eating utensils, cigarettes, shells, towels, rags, etc., which could settle into this pocket and thereby reduce the effective volume of the grease interceptor. 
c.  Accept the following conditions: If any skimmed or pumped wastes or other materials removed from grease interceptor are treated in any fashion onsite and reintroduced back into the grease interceptor as an activity of and after said onsite treatment, the user shall be responsible for the attainment of established grease numerical limit consistent with and contained in (c)(1) on all discharges of wastewater from said grease interceptor in the town sanitary sewer collection and treatment system. 
d.  Operate the grease interceptor in a manner so as to maintain said device such that attainment of the grease limit is consistently achieved. "Consistent" shall mean any wastewater sample taken from said grease interceptor shall be subject to terms of numerical limit attainment described in (c)(1). If an establishment desires, because of documented space constraints, an alternate to an out-of-building grease interceptor, the request for an alternative location shall contain the following information: 
1.  Location of town sewer main and easement in relation to available exterior space outside building. 
2.  Existing plumbing at or in a site that uses common plumbing for all services at that site. 
e.  Understand and agree that: The use of biological additives as a grease degradation agent is conditionally permissible, upon prior written approval by the public utilities director. Any establishment using this method of grease abatement shall maintain the trap or interceptor in such a manner that attainment of the grease wastewater discharge limit, as measured from the traps outlet, is consistently achieved. 
f.  Understand and agree that: The use of automatic grease removal systems is conditionally permissible upon prior written approval by the public utilities director, the lead plumbing inspector of the town and the Brunswick County Department of Health. Any establishment using this equipment shall operate the system in such a manner that attainment of the grease wastewater discharge limit, as measured from the unit's outlet, is consistently achieved. 
g.  Understand and agree that: The public utilities director reserves the right to make determinations of grease interceptor adequacy and need, based on review of all relevant information regarding grease interceptor performance, facility site and building plan review and to require repairs to, or modification or replacement of such traps. 
(2)  The user shall maintain written record of trap maintenance for three years. All such records will be available for inspection by the town at all times. 
(3)  No non-grease laden sources are allowed to be connected to sewer lines intended for grease interceptor service. 
(4)  Except as provided herein for a period of one year following adoption of this article, although installation of grease interceptors will be required to be installed, no enforcement actions will be taken under this section for failure to achieve limits on grease discharges from grease interceptors. If, during this one-year period an obstruction of a town sewer main(s) occurs that causes a sewer overflow the extent that an impact on the environment is realized and that said overflow or failure of the sanitary sewer collection system to convey sewage can be attributed in part or in whole to an accumulation of grease in the town's sewer main(s), the town will take appropriate enforcement actions, as stipulated in the town's sewer use ordinance, against the generator or contributor of such grease. 
(5)  Access manholes, with a minimum diameter of 24 inches, shall be provided over each chamber and sanitary fee. The access manholes shall extend at least to finished grade and be designed and maintained to prevent water inflow or infiltration. The manholes shall also have readily removable covers to facilitate inspection, grease removal, and wastewater sampling activities.

Sec. 30-144. - Basis for determination of surcharges. 
(a)  Charges and fees shall be based upon a minimum basic charge for each premises, computed on the basis of wastewater from a domestic premises with the following characteristics: 
BOD-250 mg/l 
Total suspended solids-250 mg/l 
Oil and grease-40 mg/l 
(b)  The charges and fees for all classification of users other than the domestic premises shall be based on the relative difference between the average wastewater constituents and characteristics of that classification as related to those of a domestic premises. 
(c)  The charges and fees established for permit users shall be based upon the measured or estimated constituents and characteristics of the wastewater discharge of that user which may include, but not be limited to, BOD, COD, oil and grease, chlorine demand and volume. 
(Ord. of 4-10-2001(12), § 4) 
Sec. 30-145. - Method of determining surcharges. 
    The charges for excesses of the constituents listed in section 30-144 will be based upon the "mass emission rate" of those constituents and determined thusly as follows: 
(1)  Mass emission rate, MER () equals MG by C by 8.34 
Where: MER is the mass emission rate in pounds of a particular constituent, and MG is the millions of gallons of wastewater discharged, and C is the concentration of mg/l of the particular constituent being charged for (as an example, BOD, COD, etc.), and 8.34 is equal to the number of pounds/one gallon of water.  
(2)  The amount of the charge in dollars will be calculated thusly as follows: 
Ao equals R by MER () where: 
Ao is equal to the amount of the charge in dollars, and 
R is equal to the rate of charge per pound of constituent, and 
MER () is equal to the pounds of a constituent. 
An example of surcharge: 
    Cannon's Corporation is a producer of canned fruits. They discharged 1,000,000 gallons of wastewater in the month of January. Analysis found that the wastewater had the following characteristics: BOD equals mg/l, TSS equals 950 mg/l. There were no other limitations exceeded in this example. There were 100 employees employed at the cannery. The limits of BOD and TSS are 250 mg/l. 
The MER of BOD is equal to: 
MERBOD = (400-250) by 8.34 by 1 MG = (150) by 8.34 by 1 = 1,121 pounds of BOD or 1.121 thousand pounds BOD  
If the charge for BOD is R equals $45.00/1,000 pounds BOD, then the total charge for BOD is equal to, as: 
Ao = R by MER Ao = $45.00 by 1.121 Ao = $50.45  
For TSS, the charge would be computed thusly: 
MERTSS - (950-250) by 8.34 by 1MG equals 700 by 8.34 by 1 equals 5,838 pounds TSS or 5.838 thousand pounds TSS 
At a charge of $45.00/thousand pounds, the charge for TSS equals 5.838 by $45.00 equals $262.71 
Total surcharge for January equals $50.45 + $262.71 equals $313.16 
(Ord. of 4-10-2001(12), § 5) 
Sec. 30-146. - Method of determining charge rates and user charge, and billing procedure. 
(a)  The town council will annually review the actual cost of operation and maintenance of the town's wastewater treatment plants and collection system, plus the cost to obtain wastewater treatment from other entities, and adjust the surcharge rates, the administrative minimum charge, if any, and the volume user rate (per 1,000 gallons) to reflect the true cost of constituent treatment. The adjustments, if any, will become effective at such time that a new published rate schedule is approved by council. The council may review these rates and/or minimum charges and adjust them accordingly at any time it deems adjustments are in the best interest of the town. All current sewer related rates, charges, fees, deposit amounts, etc., that would be applicable per section 30-143 shall be provided in an established rate schedule, as approved and amended by the town council from time to time. 
(b)  Each consumer shall be responsible for paying the current monthly availability fee, if one is established. An availability fee may be established to ensure sufficient revenue to fund the operation and maintenance of the town's water system, wastewater collection and treatment systems, and any minimum base costs that may be associated with obtaining wastewater treatment from other agencies. If established, in no instance will such availability fee be made exception to. In the case of multifamily structures, mixed-use structures, strip malls or shopping centers being serviced by a single meter, an availability fee shall be charged for each consumer/unit contained in the building. 
(c)  The billing procedure for sewer user charges shall be the same as for water charges with the bills for sewer figured in accordance with the town's current published rate schedule for sewer users, including any penalties or service charges as may be applicable. 
(Ord. of 4-10-2001(12), § 6; Ord. of 6-14-2005) 
Sec. 30-147. - Sampling procedures and analysis. 
(a)  All samples and determinations of wastewater characteristics shall be as representative of the waste discharge as possible. The costs of regular sampling and analysis will be included in the charges and fees. The town may take additional samples after a significant process change that significantly affects the quantity of strength of the wastewaters discharged. The frequency of sampling shall be as follows: 
Yearly Cumulative Flow 
(Million Gallons) Minimum Required 
Frequency of Tests 
for Surcharge Parameters Less than 1.0 0-1 per year 1.0 to 3.0 2 per year Over 3.0 4 per year  
More frequent sampling may be done at any time at the option of the town. 
(b)  Upon requests by the person concerned, the town shall make available split samples of the composite sample collected. If the person feels the results are not representative of his wastes, the town may resample at a cost to the person of $100.00 per day which will include sampling and analysis for BOD, TSS, COD, pH, chlorine demand, oil, grease and heavy metals, if necessary.

DIVISION 6. - WATER CONSERVATION STANDARDS[4] 

Footnotes: 
--- (4) --- 
Editor's note- An ordinance adopted May 29, 2003, pertaining to the water conservation standards, added provisions to the Code, but did not specify manner of codification. Therefore, at the discretion of the editor, said provisions have been included as div. 6, §§ 30-161-30-166 of ch. 30, art. II herein. 

Sec. 30-161. - Purpose. 
    These water conservation standards are enacted by the town for the purposes of: 
(1)  Reducing the rate of increase in overall water use through year-round water conservation practices that will help maximize the community's existing and planned water supply sources and help reduce seasonal peak day demands that result in the need for costly expansion of water treatment, storage, and transmission facilities. Such year-round practices shall include: 
a.  Reducing indoor water waste by encouraging the installation and maintenance of ultra-low flow toilets, faucet aerators, low-flow showerheads and similar devices, as well as other creative and commonsense indoor conservation practices. 
b.  Reducing irrigation and irrigation-related water waste without sacrificing landscape quality through the cultivation of lower water use plants; improved landscape design and planting practices; more efficient watering practices; and improved irrigation system design and maintenance. 
c.  Increasing the use of reclaimed wastewater and stormwater for irrigation and other uses that do not require water of potable quality. 
d.  Providing an orderly process for reducing community-wide water Demands during periods of drought or other naturally occurring causes of water shortages; and 
(2)  Providing an orderly process for reducing community-wide water demands during periods of water shortages due to natural disaster (other than drought), major OWASA facilities failure, or other unexpected and sudden loss of water supply, treatment, or distribution capacity that constitutes a water supply emergency. 
(Ord. of 5-29-2003, Art. I) 
Sec. 30-162. - Definitions 
    For the purpose of these standards, the following definitions shall apply unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning.

    Odd-numbered properties. Properties with street addresses that end in odd-numbered digits, or other properties so designated for the purposes of these Standards through special arrangements with OWASA. 
    Potable water. Treated water provided by OWASA that is suitable for drinking, cooking, and other domestic use. Water that is collected indoors in containers from indoor faucets or spigots that would otherwise be discharged into drainpipes while a user awaits the warming of the water for dishwashing, other washing, shaving, bathing, or showering is not considered to be potable water for the purposes of these standards. 
    Precipitation rate. The amount of water applied per unit of time, usually expressed in inches per hour. 
    Public right-of-way. The area of land owned or maintained by municipal, county, or state government primarily for the use of the public for the movement of people, goods, vehicles, or storm water. For the purposes of these standards, the public right-of-way shall include curbs, streets, sidewalks, and storm water drainage inlets, but shall not include adjacent landscaped areas that may also be located within the legally delineated public right-of-way.

    Runoff. Water which is not absorbed by the soil or landscape to which it is applied. Runoff occurs when water is applied too quickly (application rate exceeds infiltration rate), particularly if there is a severe slope. These standards do not apply to stormwater runoff which is created by natural precipitation rather than human-caused or applied water use. 
    Service area. The geographic area in which the town provides or is authorized to provide water and/or sewer service. 
    Shut-off nozzle. A device attached to the end of a hose that completely shuts off the flow, even if left unattended.

Any other circumstances, including service losses caused by equipment or facility failure, human error, deliberate act, weather, or other natural disaster, which constrain the town's water supply, treatment, or distribution capacity to less than that reasonably needed by its customers, shall constitute a Water Supply Shortage up to and including a water supply emergency, requiring immediate action by the town. 
(Ord. of 5-29-2003, Art. III) 
Sec. 30-166. - Required actions under water supply shortage or emergency conditions. 
    In the event of a water supply shortage, the town shall, using its best professional judgment, determine which of the following stages is the most appropriate response to the estimated level of risk. 
(1)  Water supply advisory. A water supply advisory shall represent an alert to the public of a potential shortage and notification that water use restrictions may be imposed if the water supply and/or demand conditions do not improve in the near future. In the event of a declared water supply advisory: 
No mandatory water use restrictions will be implemented. 
The town shall make extensive use of media releases, advertising, and other reasonable means of publicizing the water supply advisory and the need for immediate voluntary conservation. 
(2)  Water supply emergency. 
In the event of a water supply emergency, the following actions shall be taken upon the town's declaration of a water supply emergency: 
Town supplied potable water may not be used for any other outdoor purposes, except for emergency fire suppression or other activities necessary to maintain public health, safety, or welfare. 
The use of town supplied potable water for heating and/or cooling purposes shall be reduced in all but the most essential facilities to the extent allowable in consideration of indoor air quality Standards, weather conditions, and health and safety requirements. 
Water service may be discontinued or reduced to designated users or in designated portions of the town service area in order to preserve the availability of water for essential public health and safety requirements such as fire protections, clinics and other critical community needs.

(a)  The term "lot" as used in this section is defined as a parcel of land owned by one owner without regard to whether or not shown on any subdivision map as separate lots and without regard to how or when acquired, except that when as assessment is made on a per lot basis in a subdivision, the term "lot" shall apply to each separate subdivided lot or a combination of subdivided lots where a single building unit is constructed on a portion of all the lots. Provided, however, that when a lot in a subdivision is already served by a reuse water and the lots in the subdivision are assessed on a per lot basis, the lot so served shall not be assessed a greater amount than the amount which would be assessed against the lot on a linear foot basis after giving credit for the exemptions contained in this section. 
(b)  The exemptions provided for in §§ 30-239 and 30-240 shall apply only if the cost of the existing reuse water main has been assessed against the property for which a duplicating service is provided, or if the existing reuse water main, including major mains, was installed by a subdivider of property without cost to the town, or if the cost of the existing reuse water service main has been paid from community development funds and such mains are located within redevelopment areas as delineated pursuant to Article 22 of Chapter 160A of the General Statutes of North Carolina, as amended.

Sec. 32-76. - Tree and vegetation guidelines. 
    Vegetation plans shall comply with the following guidelines: 
(1)  Provide for the retention and protection of existing trees and the planting of new trees as follows: 
a.  For lots with available sewer, a minimum of one existing specimen tree shall be saved per 1,450 square feet of lot size except where a determination has been made that the retention of existing trees would interfere with essential site improvements. This determination will be made by the department of development services following consultations with the developer. Every effort will be made to retain and protect specimen trees. If retention is not a viable option, the minimum stocking level required will be dependent upon the number of specimen trees removed from the lot. One tree with a minimum caliper at breast height of two inches shall be planted for every specimen tree removed from the lot, up to five trees. Lots other than oceanfront properties shall have a minimum of two trees planted prior to completion of development. Oceanfront properties are excluded from the above requirements. Owners of oceanfront properties are encouraged to preserve existing specimen trees, vegetation, and dunes. However, a combination of trees and/or grasses will be planted to provide a planted area of 50 square feet for each 700 square feet of heated area for oceanfront lots. 
b.  For lots with no available sewer and a septic system will be used, a minimum of one existing specimen tree shall be saved per 1,625 square feet of lot size except where a determination has been made that the retention of existing trees would interfere with essential site improvements. This determination will be made by the department of development services following consultations with the developer. Every effort will be made to retain and protect specimen trees. If retention is not a viable option, the minimum stocking level required will be dependent upon the number of specimen trees removed from the lot. One tree with a minimum caliper at breast height of two inches shall be planted for every specimen tree removed from the lot, up to five trees. Lots other than oceanfront properties shall have a minimum of two trees planted prior to completion of development. 
(2)  Preserve and protect as much natural area on the site as is practicable. Where existing trees and shrubs are being preserved or replaced, applicants will provide continuous planted areas of at least 50 square feet for every 700 square feet of building area. 
(3)  Incorporate existing vegetation, natural areas, and specimen trees into required shoreline, wetland, and visual buffers where possible. 
(4)  Where vegetation is being replaced, applicants may select plant types from the list provided in Seacoast Plants of the Carolinas (University of North Carolina Sea Grant Program, Publication UNC-SG-73-06), "Trees for Oak Island," or other comparable resources. 
(5)  Applicants shall not completely clear shrubs and grasses in areas designated as preserved natural areas in vegetation plans without the approval of development services.

(Example: in each required peninsula one tree and six shrubs minimum.) 
a.  All plantings shall be reasonably distributed throughout the parking facility or adjacent to the facility; 
b.  All interior plantings shall be protected by raised concrete curbing or other devices such as wheel stops; 
c.  Consecutive parking spaces shall incorporate landscape peninsulas no more than ten spaces apart and at least on the ends of all parking rows. Peninsulas shall contain at least 100 square feet in area and at least eight feet in width, measured from back of curb/barrier to back of curb/barrier. 
d.  Lots less than 15,000 square feet shall meet a landscape standard of at least six percent of the gross area of a parking facility with vegetation selected from a list maintained by development services of one tree with a minimum caliper of three inches at breast height and four shrubs at least 18 inches high in at least three gallon pots per 1,800 square feet of parking facility. 
(c)  When a parking facility is within 50 feet of the public right-of-way, a perimeter planted strip shall be installed, consisting of a low buffer incorporated into the streetyard. 
(d)  The development services staff may waive all or part of the requirements of this section for any facility which is limited to periodic or intermittent use for vehicular parking, such as parking lots for churches or recreational facilities, provided the parking facility is completely covered by grass or otherwise presents a landscaped effect.

For example, if a development has five phases, the permits for Phases 2 through 5 would expire. 
4.4.2. If after some physical alteration to land or structures begins and such work is discontinued for a period of one year, then the zoning or special use permit authorizing such work shall immediately expire. However, expiration of the permit shall not affect the provisions of Section 4.5.

Successive extensions may be granted through a quasi-judicial proceeding for periods up to six months (for a total period not to exceed three years) upon the same findings. All such extensions may be granted without resort to the formal processes and fees required for a new permit. The UDO Administrator will notify the Town Council of all extensions.

4.5.1.1. No person (including successors or assigns of the person who obtained the permit) may make use of the land or structures covered under such permit except in accordance with all the terms and requirements of that permit; and 
4.5.1.2. The terms and requirements of the permit apply to and restrict the use of land or structures covered under the permit, not only with respect to all persons having any interest in the property at the time the permit was obtained, but also with respect to persons who subsequently obtain any interest in all or part of the covered property and wish to use it for or in connection with purposes other than those for which the permit was originally issued, so long as the persons who subsequently obtain an interest in the property had actual or record notice (as provided in subsection 4.5.2) of the existence of the permit at the time they acquired their interest. 
4.5.2. Whenever a special use or zoning permit is issued to authorize development (other than single-family or two-family residences) on a tract of land in excess of one acre, nothing authorized by the permit may be done until the record owner of the property signs a written acknowledgment that the permit has been issued so that the permit may be recorded in the Brunswick County Registry and indexed under the record owner' s name as grantor.

4.6.2.3. An application for any map change or amendment shall contain a description and statement of the present and proposed zoning regulation or district boundary to be applied, the name(s) and address(es) of the applicant(s), the owner of the parcel of land involved in the change if different from the applicant, and all adjacent property owners as shown on the Brunswick County tax listing.

4.6.3. Action by the Planning Board. 
Prior to consideration by the Town Council of the proposed zoning amendment, the Planning Board shall advise and comment on whether the proposed text amendment or map amendment is consistent with any comprehensive plan. The Planning Board shall provide a written recommendation to the Town Council that addresses plan consistency and other matters as deemed appropriate by the Planning Board, but a comment by the Planning Board that a proposed amendment is inconsistent with the comprehensive plan shall not preclude consideration or approval of the proposed amendment by the Town Council. In its deliberations, the Planning Board shall provide the public an opportunity to comment on consistency with the comprehensive plan. 
4.6.4. Action by the Town Council. 
Action to consider a rezoning petition, including the scheduling of a public hearing, will be at the discretion of the Town Council. 
4.6.4.1. Before an item is placed on the agenda to schedule a public hearing, the Planning Board's recommendation on each proposed zoning amendment must be received by the Town Council. If no recommendation is received from the Planning Board within 30 days from the date when submitted to the Planning Board, the petitioner may take the proposal to the Town Council without a recommendation from the Planning Board. However, the Planning Board may request the Town Council to delay final action on the amendment until such time as the Planning Board can present its recommendations. 
4.6.4.2. After receiving a recommendation from the Planning Board on a proposed amendment, the Town Council may proceed to vote on the proposed ordinance, refer it to a committee for further study, or take any other action consistent with its usual rules of procedure.

4.6.4.4. No member of the Town Council shall vote on any zoning map amendment or text amendment where the outcome of the matter being considered is reasonably likely to have a direct, substantial and readily identifiable financial impact on the member or his or her close family, business, and/or associational relationships.

4.6.4.5.1. A statement approving the zoning amendment and describing its consistency with an adopted comprehensive plan and explaining why the action taken is reasonable and in the public interest. 
4.6.4.5.2. A statement rejecting the zoning amendment and describing its inconsistency with an adopted comprehensive plan and explaining why the action taken is reasonable and in the public interest. 
4.6.4.5.3. A statement approving the zoning amendment and containing at least all of the following: 
4.6.4.5.3.1. A declaration that the approval is also deemed an amendment to the comprehensive plan. The Town Council shall not require any additional request or application for amendment to the comprehensive plan.

4.6.4.6.1. The Town Council shall not consider any representations made by the petitioner that, if the change is granted, the rezoned property will be used for only one of the possible range of uses permitted in the requested classification. Rather, the Town Council shall consider whether the entire range of permitted uses in the requested classification is more appropriate than the range of uses in the existing classification. 
4.6.4.6.2. The Town Council shall not regard as controlling any advantages or disadvantages to the individual requesting the change, but shall consider the impact of the proposed change on the public at large. 
4.6.5. Citizen Comments. 
Zoning ordinances may from time to time be amended, supplemented, changed, modified, or repealed. If any resident or property owner in the town submits a written statement regarding a proposed amendment, modification, or repeal to a zoning ordinance to the Clerk to the Board at least two business days prior to the proposed vote on such change, the Clerk to the Board shall deliver such written statement to the Town Council. If the proposed change is the subject of a quasi-judicial proceeding under G.S. 160A-388, the Clerk shall provide only the names and addresses of the individuals providing written comment, and the provision of such names and addresses to all members of the Board shall not disqualify any member of the Board from voting. 
4.6.6. Withdrawal of Application. 
An applicant may withdraw his or her application at any time by written notice to the UDO Administrator and may resubmit at a subsequent date in compliance with the submittal schedule contained herein.

4.10.1.3. The owner or other party shall have 30 days from receipt of the written notice within which to file an appeal. Any other person with standing to appeal shall have 30 days from receipt from any source of actual or constructive notice of the decision within which to file an appeal. 
4.10.1.4. The official who made the decision shall transmit to the Board of Adjustment all documents and exhibits constituting the record upon which the action appealed from is taken. The official shall also provide a copy of the record to the appellant and to the owner of the property that is the subject of the appeal if the appellant is not the owner. 
4.10.1.5. An appeal of a notice of violation or other enforcement order stays enforcement of the action appealed from unless the official who made the decision certifies to the Board of Adjustment after notice of appeal has been filed that because of the facts stated in an affidavit, a stay would cause immediate peril to life or property or because the violation is transitory in nature, a stay would seriously interfere with enforcement of the Ordinance. In that case, enforcement proceedings shall not be stayed except by a restraining order which may be granted by a court. If enforcement proceedings are not stayed, the appellant may file with the official a request for an expedited hearing of the appeal, and the Board of Adjustment shall meet to hear the appeal within 15 days after such a request is filed. Notwithstanding the foregoing, appeals of decisions granting a permit or otherwise affirming that a proposed use of property is consistent with the Ordinance shall not stay the further review of an application for permits or permissions to use such property; in these situations, the appellant may request and the Board of Adjustment may grant a stay of a final decision of permit applications or building permits affected by the issue being appealed. 
4.10.1.6. Subject to the provisions of subsection 4.10.1.4, the Board of Adjustment shall hear and decide the appeal within a reasonable time. 
4.10.1.7. The official who made the decision shall be present at the hearing as a witness. The appellant shall not be limited at the hearing to matters stated in the notice of appeal. If any party or the Town would be unduly prejudiced by the presentation of matters not presented in the notice of appeal, the Board of Adjustment shall continue the hearing. The Board of Adjustment may reverse or affirm (wholly or partly) or may modify the decision appealed from and shall make any order, requirement, decision, or determination that ought to be made. The Board of Adjustment shall have all the powers of the official who made the decision.

4.10.2.2. When unnecessary hardships would result from carrying out the strict letter of the UDO, the Board of Adjustment shall vary any of the provisions of the Ordinance upon a showing of all of the following: 
4.10.2.2.1. Unnecessary hardship would result from the strict application of the Ordinance. It shall not be necessary to demonstrate that, in the absence of the variance, no reasonable use can be made of the property. 
4.10.2.2.2. The hardship results from conditions that are peculiar to the property, such as location, size, or topography. Hardships resulting from personal circumstances, as well as hardships resulting from conditions that are common to the neighborhood or the general public, may not be the basis for granting a variance. 
4.10.2.2.3. The hardship did not result from actions taken by the applicant or the property owner. The act of purchasing property with knowledge that circumstances exist that may justify the granting of a variance shall not be regarded as a self-created hardship. 
4.10.2.2.4. The requested variance is consistent with the spirit, purpose, and intent of the Ordinance, such that public safety is secured and substantial justice is achieved. 
4.10.2.3 . No change in permitted uses may be authorized by variance. Appropriate conditions may be imposed on any variance, provided that the conditions are reasonably related to the variance. Any other ordinance that regulates land use or development may provide for variances consistent with the provisions of this subsection. 
4.10.2.4. The nature of the variance and any conditions attached to it shall be entered on the face of the zoning permit, or the zoning permit may simply note the issuance of the variance and refer to the written record of the variance for further information. All such conditions are enforceable in the same manner as any other applicable requirement of this Ordinance. 
4.10.3. Burden of Proof in Appeals and Variances. 
4.10.3.1. When an appeal is taken to the Board of Adjustment in accordance with Section 4.10.1, the UDO Administrator shall have the initial burden of presenting to the Board of Adjustment sufficient evidence and argument to justify the order or decision appealed from.

4.10.3.2. The burden of presenting evidence sufficient to allow the Board of Adjustment to reach the conclusions set forth in Section 4.10.2.2, as well as the burden of persuasion on those issues, remains with the applicant seeking the variance.

A temporary certificate of occupancy for a portion of a structure may be issued for a portion or portions of a building which may safely be occupied prior to final completion and occupancy of the entire building or for other temporary uses. A certificate of occupancy shall not be issued unless the proposed use of a building or land conforms to the applicable provisions of this Ordinance. If the certificate of occupancy is denied, the Building Inspector shall state in writing the reasons for refusal and the applicant shall be notified of the refusal. A record of all certificates shall be kept on file in the office of the Building Inspector for a period of time in accordance with the North Carolina Department of Cultural Resources requirements (G.S. 132-8), and copies shall be furnished upon request to any persons having a proprietary or tenancy interest in the building or land involved. 
For all developments, excluding single-family residential uses, prior to the issuance of a certificate of occupancy by the Building Inspector, a final zoning inspection shall be conducted to ensure that the approved plan has been followed and all required improvements have been installed to Town standards.

The UDO Administrator may receive comments from other persons or agencies before making its final recommendations. 
5.7.4.1.3. After the UDO Administrator determines that the preliminary plat meets the requirements of this Ordinance, it shall be submitted to the Planning Board for review and recommendation to the Town Council. The Planning Board shall forward its recommendation to the Town Council within 45 days after first consideration by the Planning Board. If the Planning Board fails to act within the 45-day period, the subdivider may appeal directly to the Town Council. The Town Council shall consider the preliminary plat as presented to or reviewed and revised by the Planning Board at its next regularly scheduled meeting and approve, approve with conditions, or disapprove the plan.

The form of any extension shall remain at the election of the developer. 
5.7.4.6.3. The amount of the performance guarantee shall not exceed 125 percent of the reasonably estimated cost of completion at the time the performance guarantee is issued. Any extension of the performance guarantee necessary to complete required improvements shall not exceed 125 percent of the reasonably estimated cost of completion of the remaining incomplete improvements still outstanding at the time the extension is obtained. 
5.7.4.6.4. The performance guarantee shall only be used for completion of the required improvements and not for repairs or maintenance after completion. 
5.7.4.6.5.

5.7.4.7. Transfer of Lots in Unapproved Subdivision Plats. Any person who, being the owner or agent of the owner of any land located within the jurisdiction of the Town, thereafter subdivides his land in violation of applicable Town ordinances or transfers or sells land by reference to, exhibition of, or any other use of a plat showing a subdivision of the land before the plat has been properly approved under applicable Town ordinances and recorded in the office of the Brunswick County Register of Deeds, shall be guilty of a Class 1 misdemeanor, unless specifically stated otherwise. The description by metes and bounds in the instrument of transfer or other document used in the process of selling or transferring land shall not exempt the transaction from this penalty. The Town may bring an action for injunction of any illegal subdivision, transfer, conveyance, or sale of land, and the court shall, upon appropriate findings, issue an injunction and order requiring the offending party to comply with the subdivision ordinance. Building permits required pursuant to G.S. 160A-417 may be denied for lots that have been illegally subdivided. In addition to other remedies, the Town may institute any appropriate action or proceedings to prevent the unlawful subdivision of land, to restrain, correct, or abate the violation, or to prevent any illegal act or conduct. 
5.7.5. Procedure for Plat Recordation. 
After the effective date of this Ordinance, no subdivision plat of land within the Town's jurisdiction shall be filed or recorded until it has been submitted to and approved by the appropriate agencies, and until this approval is entered in writing on the face of the plat by the Chairperson or head of that agency. All publicly dedicated improvements must be accepted by the Town Council contingent upon final plat recordation or acceptance of an approved performance bond. If improvements are not complete as the expiration of a guarantee is approaching, the performance guarantee shall be extended, or a new performance guarantee issued, for an additional period until such required improvements are complete. 
A plat shall not be filed or recorded by the Brunswick County Register of Deeds of any subdivision located within the Town's jurisdiction that has not been approved in accordance with this Ordinance, nor shall the Clerk of Superior Court order or direct the recording of a plat if the recording would be in conflict with the requirements of this Ordinance. 
5.7.6. Issuance of Permits and Conveyance of Subdivision Lots. 
Zoning permits and building permits may be issued by the Town of Oak Island for the erection of any building on any lot within a proposed subdivision prior to the final plat of said subdivision being approved in a manner as prescribed by this Ordinance and recorded at the Register of Deeds office, provided an improvements permit has been issued by the Brunswick County Health Department, if required. A certificate of occupancy may not be issued until the final plat has been approved and recorded. 
After the effective date of this Ordinance, it shall be illegal for any person being the owner or agent of the owner of any land located within the territorial jurisdiction of this Ordinance, to subdivide his land in violation of this Ordinance or to transfer or sell land by reference to, exhibition of, or any other use of a plat showing a subdivision of the land before the plat has been properly approved under the terms of this Ordinance. 
The description by metes and bounds in the instrument of transfer or other document used in the process of selling or transferring land shall not exempt the transaction from this penalty. The Town Council, through its attorney or other official so designated, may enjoin an illegal subdivision, transfer, or sale of land by action for injunction. Further, violators of this Ordinance shall be subject, upon conviction, to fine and/or imprisonment as provided by G.S. 14-4. Civil penalties may be issued in accordance with Section 1.8. 
5.7.7. School Site Reservation. In accordance with G.S. 160A-372, if the Town Council and the Brunswick County Board of Education have jointly determined the specific location and size of any school sites to be reserved in accordance with the Town of Oak Island Comprehensive Plan, staff shall immediately notify the Board of Education in writing whenever a sketch plan for a subdivision is submitted which includes all or part of a school site to be reserved. The Board of Education shall promptly decide whether it still wishes the site to be reserved. If the Board of Education does wish to reserve the site, the subdivision shall not be approved without such reservation. The Board of Education shall then have 18 months beginning on the date of final approval of the subdivision within which to acquire the site by purchase or by initiating condemnation proceedings. If the Board of Education has not purchased or begun proceedings to condemn the site within 18 months, the developer may treat the land as freed of the reservation. 
5.7.8. Dedication of Land for Park, Recreation, and Open Space. 
In accordance with G.S. 160A-372, a developer may provide funds to the Town whereby the Town may acquire recreational land or areas to serve the development or subdivision, including the purchase of land that may be used to serve more than one subdivision or development within the immediate area. All funds received by the Town pursuant to this paragraph shall be used only for the acquisition or development of recreation, park, or open space sites, including shoreline public access. Any formula enacted to determine the amount of funds that are to be provided under this paragraph shall be based on the value of the development or subdivision for property tax purposes. A combination or partial payment of funds and partial dedication of land is acceptable when the governing body of the Town determines that this combination is in the best interests of the citizens of the area to be served. Refer to Article 10, Part VI.

In the creation of the respective districts, careful consideration is given to the peculiar suitability of each and every district for the particular regulations applied thereto, and the necessary, proper, and comprehensive groupings and arrangements of various uses and densities of population in accordance with a well-considered comprehensive plan for the physical development of the area. 
The purposes of establishing the zoning districts are: 
 To implement adopted plans; 
 To promote public health, safety, and general welfare; 
 To provide for orderly growth and development; 
 To provide for the efficient use of resources; 
 To facilitate the adequate provision of services. 
(Ord. of 10-9-2018)  
SECTION 6.2 - INTERPRETATION. 
Zoning districts have uses specified as permitted by right, special uses, and uses permitted with supplemental regulations.

(Ord. of 10-9-2018)  
SECTION 6.3 - PRIMARY ZONING DISTRICTS. 
For the purposes of this Ordinance, the Town of Oak Island, North Carolina is hereby divided into the following primary zoning districts: 
6 .3.1. R-20 Low Density Residential District. 
The R-20 district is established to provide areas for the preservation and development of residential neighborhoods and for lower density residential development. The predominant use of the land in the R-20 district is for low density, single-family dwellings and their customary accessory uses. 
6.3.2. R-9 Medium Density Residential District. 
The R-9 district is established to provide areas for the preservation and development of residential neighborhoods and for medium density residential development. The predominant use of the land in this district is for medium density, single-family dwellings and their customary accessory uses. 
6.3.3. R-7 Medium Density Residential District. 
The R-7 district is established to provide areas for the preservation and development of residential neighborhoods and for medium density residential development. The predominant use of the land in this R-7 district is for medium density, single-family dwellings, two-family dwellings and their customary accessory uses. 
6.3.4. R-6 Residential District. 
The R-6 district is established to provide areas for the preservation and development of residential neighborhoods and for higher density residential development. The principal uses in the R-6 district include single-family residences and their customary accessory uses. 
6.3.5. R-6MF Higher Density Residential District. 
The R-6MF district is established to provide areas for the preservation and development of residential neighborhoods and for higher density residential development with a range of housing types. The principal uses in this R-6MF district include larger sized single-family residences, multifamily residences, and other compatible uses. Multifamily dwellings are allowed subject to a determination that they are compatible with surrounding development, that adequate facilities are available, and that they are compatible with the overall purposes of this R-6MF district. 
6.3.6. R-6MH Higher Density Residential District. 
The R-6MH district is established to provide areas for the preservation and development of residential neighborhoods and for residential development with a range of housing types. The principal uses in this R-6MH district include single-family residences, manufactured housing, tiny homes and their customary accessory uses. 
6.3.7. O&I Office and Institutional District. 
The purpose of the office and institutional district (O&I) is established to provide standards for low-intensity office and institutional uses in close proximity to residential areas in order to ensure compatibility with adjacent development types. The office and institutional district (O&I) is intended to act as a transition zone between the more intense commercial zones and developed or developing residential areas. 
6.3.8. R-MU Residential Mixed Use Special Use District. 
The R-MU district will accommodate both non-residential and residential uses with at least 70 percent of the developed area being residential. The non-residential development should serve a localized/limited area. Horizontal mixed use will be preferred. The development should be pedestrian-oriented with significant open space areas. The residential mixed use land use sector should have a minimum impact on adjacent areas. The transportation impacts should be less than the impact from a commercial mixed use development. The Residential Mixed Use land use sector should include non-residential uses which are intended to serve the development and portions of the Town. 
6.3.9. C-MU Commercial Mixed Use Special Use District. 
The C-MU district will allow for the concentration of commercial, service, and residential uses that serve the entire community and region. The district will encourage a mix of high intensity, pedestrian-oriented uses compatibly designed and arranged around a compact core(s). The provision of open space should be an important part of the development. Both vertical and horizontal mixed use should be allowed. Non-residential land use should occupy at least 60 percent of the developed area. Office and institutional usage is recommended as a buffer/transition between lower and higher density land uses. 
6.3.10. CB Community Business District. 
The CB business district is established as a zone in which the use of the land is for commercial and service uses for the surrounding urban market area. 
6.3.11. CR Commercial Recreation District. 
The purpose of this CR recreation district shall be to provide for, protect, and encourage a grouping of beachfront enterprises providing accommodations and recreation to persons wishing to lodge near the strand or participate in the various water sports available to them. 
6.3.12. C-LD Commercial Low Density District . 
Districts in this C-LD category are intended primarily to be located in outlying areas, adjacent to a major thoroughfare, with yards and other provisions for reducing conflicts with adjacent residential uses, and with substantial setbacks to reduce marginal friction on adjacent major thoroughfares. This C-LD district will serve requirements of residential neighborhoods for commercial facilities and the requirements of highway-oriented tourist businesses. 
6.3.13. OS Open Space District. 
The purpose of this OS open space district is to preserve and protect the areas of environmental concern as identified by G.S. 113A-113 and 15 NCAC 7H.0200 and other environmentally sensitive areas as may be identified by the Town Council. The OS district allows for low impact uses as specified in Section 6.5. 
6.3.14. AD Airport District. 
The purpose of this district is to ensure that the airport is protected from incompatible uses and that uses surrounding the facility are compatible with expansion of airport operations. Travel trailers and campers may be situated within the airport district for temporary use by those conducting business with the airport and for emergency and special event purposes; provided however said trailers and campers shall not be used as a dwelling for more than 90 days as defined by section 18-32 of the Oak Island Code of Ordinances. Travel trailers and campers must be properly tagged and roadworthy and must be relocated in the event of inclement hazardous weather conditions where they could be forcibly moved by natural forces. Observation and playground areas are permissible within an airport in the (AD) zoning district. Structures and trailers may be situated within the airport district for airport business and emergency and special event availability. This allows full access to power and sewer and does not allow access to anything like a trailer or RV park to the public. 
6.3.15. ID Industrial District. 
The ID Industrial District is established as a district in which the principal use of land is for industries which can be operated in a relatively clean and quiet manner and which will not be obnoxious to adjacent residential or business districts. The regulations are designed to prohibit the use of land for heavy industry, which should be properly segregated, and to prohibit any other use that would substantially interfere with the development of industrial establishments in the district. 
6.3.16. PUD Planned Unit Development Special Zoning District. 
The PUD district allows a large site to be developed with a mixture of land uses according to an approved overall site plan. For example, a large tract may be developed with a mix of single-family and multi-family housing, with part of the site also devoted to commercial and office uses. The PUD district allows for greater flexibility in dimensional standards (such as lot sizes and setbacks) upon approval of an overall master plan for the entire development. The district does not require a rigid separation of different land uses. Uses are limited to the uses identified in the Table of Uses and Activities; uses and conditions will be established at the time the district is developed. All of the site specific standards and conditions, including a site plan are incorporated into the zoning district regulations for the PUD. Approval of the site plan establishes all zoning requirements for the subject property. A PUD district shall not be less than five acres in area. 
(Ord. of 10-9-2018, Amend. of 11-13-2018)  
SECTION 6.4 - OVERLAY ZONING DISTRICT. 
6.4.1. PCO Beach/Private Club Overlay District.

SECTION 8.14 - NOTES TO THE ZONING DISTRICT DEVELOPMENT STANDARDS. 
8.14.1. All lots created after the adoption of this Ordinance must satisfy the minimum square footage requirements. 
8.14.2. Corner lots on the island that are contiguous to major water bodies shall have an eight-foot corner side yard setback and no additional flexibility per Section 8.14.12. 
8.14.3. Fireplaces may extend up to 24 inches into required yard setbacks. New elevators, mobility or cargo lifts on existing residential structures may encroach up to 5½ feet into the required rear setback, or up to 5½ feet into the required front setback. The Board of Adjustment will review variance requests for proposed elevators, mobility, or cargo lifts in any other areas of existing residential structures to determine if the addition meets the General Statute required findings of fact. 
8.14.4. If a lot is contiguous to two streets (corner lots), the front lot line shall be the shortest of the two street sides. For through lots or double frontage lots, the side for which the street number is assigned is considered the front yard. 
8.14.5. The minimum lot width must be maintained from the front lot line to the front yard setback. Between the front yard setback and the rear lot line, the lot width may be reduced if the minimum lot area requirements are met. This requirement shall apply to all lots including triangular shaped lots. The front yard of a triangular shaped lot which is contiguous to two streets shall be measured from the point of the triangle which is contiguous to the intersection of two streets. 
8.14.6. Construction of the principal structure shall not be permitted in the pole or stem portion of a flag lot unless the width of the pole or stem portion of the lot meets the minimum front yard width for the applicable zoning district. 
8.14.7. Uncovered decks and porches attached to a principal structure and mechanical equipment, such as wells and air conditioning/heating units, which services the principal structure may be located in side yard provided such uses shall not be less than five feet from any lot line. This provision does not allow the encroachment of these uses into front and corner lot yard setbacks. This provision does not include covered decks, covered porches, or covered sunrooms. No encroachment into utility easements is permitted. 
8.14.8. Ordinary projections of sills, belt courses, cornices, buttresses, ornamental features, and eaves are allowed to project into setback areas, provided such projections do not exceed 24 inches. Open or enclosed fire escapes, outside stairways, balconies, and other necessary unenclosed projections may extend no more than 3½ feet into a required setback. 
8.14.9. Accessory buildings shall not extend beyond the front edge of the principal building or beyond the minimum front building line, whichever is greater, except on flag lots, where pools may be allowed beyond the front edge of the principal building on the water side. Accessory buildings and uses shall not encroach into any utility easement. No parcel may contain more than two accessory buildings, unless the property is greater than three quarters of an acre then an additional accessory structure up to four is permitted. Only two accessory structures are permitted to be side-by-side and any third or fourth accessory structure shall be a minimum of 15 feet from any other accessory structures. No parcel may contain more than two accessory buildings. The combined square footage of the accessory buildings shall not exceed ten percent of the total lot area. The maximum building height shall be 20 feet. 
8.14.10. Private shelters, oceanfront. Oceanfront lots that would otherwise be considered unbuildable for residential use due to the inability to meet the required setbacks, and not presently built upon may construct an oceanfront shelter. The maximum size of the structure footprint shall not exceed 200 square feet. No utilities other than water for foot showers are allowed. The structure must meet the setback requirements for the district in which it is located and the applicant must be able to secure necessary CAMA permitting. No oceanfront shelter shall exceed 20 feet in height. 
8.14.11. Front and rear yard setbacks for lots adjacent to Davis Canal, the Intracoastal Waterway, the Atlantic Ocean, or other public trust waters shall be determined in accordance with the illustrations in Figures 1A and 1B. 
 
8.14.12. Flexible Setbacks. The allowable building area on each lot or parcel may be moved toward one side lot line and either the rear lot line or the front street line a distance of up to 25 percent of the required setback for the zoning district for the purpose of preserving natural areas and/or specimen trees. This section does not increase the maximum permitted length and width of the allowable building area. Such setback or yard modifications must be approved by the Development Services staff in writing prior to construction beginning. Setback adjustments must be notated on a field survey which delineates the natural and/or specimen tree(s). Recordation is required for flexible setbacks as allowed in this section. 
8.14.13. The footprint of structures which are within six inches (0.5 feet) of the required side yard setback distance and front or rear yard setback distance shall be considered compliant with the requirements of this Ordinance if the de-minimis encroachment was done in error demonstrated by conflicting surveys. Regardless of any allowances, any expansion of an existing principal structure cannot be outside the allowable setback. 
8.14.14. Flag lots may only be allowed in order to access public trust waters. 
(Ord. of 10-9-2018)  
ARTICLE 9. - NONCONFORMING SITUATIONS 
 
SECTION 9.1 - INTENT. 
Upon the effective date of this Unified Development Ordinance, and any amendment thereto, preexisting structures or lots of record and existing and lawful uses of any building or land which do not meet the minimum requirements of this Unified Development Ordinance for the district in which they are located or which would be prohibited as new development in the district in which they are located shall be considered as nonconforming. It is the intent of this article to permit these nonconforming uses to continue until they are removed, discontinued, or destroyed, but not to encourage such continued use, and to prohibit the expansion of any nonconformance. 
(Ord. of 10-9-2018)  
SECTION 9.2 - NONCONFORMING LOTS OF RECORD. 
Any lot of record or structure existing at the time of the adoption of this Unified Development Ordinance, which has dimensions which do not meet the requirements of this Unified Development Ordinance, shall be subject to the following exceptions and modifications: 
9.2.1. Lot Not Meeting Minimum Lot Size Requirements. 
Except as provided in Section 2.10, vacant, unimproved lots of a nonconforming square footage which have been previously approved or authorized by prior subdivision regulations or actions of the Town Planning Board or Town Council may be built upon if such improvements are otherwise in compliance with all current setbacks, access and environmental health regulations. 
9.2.2. Yard Requirements Modified. 
The footprint of structures which are within six inches (0.5 ft) of the required side yard setback distance and front or rear yard setback distance shall be considered compliant with the requirements of this Ordinance if the de-minimis encroachment was done in error demonstrated by conflicting surveys. Regardless of any allowances any expansion of an existing principal structure cannot be outside the allowable setback. 
9.2.3. Enlargement of Nonconforming Structures. 
Any building which is nonconforming solely because of its encroachment in a required yard area may be improved in any lawful manner that does not further encroach in that yard. 
9.2.4. Recreational Campgrounds and Recreational Vehicle Parks. 
Recreational campgrounds and recreational vehicle parks existing on the date of the adoption of this Ordinance shall come into compliance with the regulations specified in Section 7.24, within 12 months of the adoption of this Ordinance in order to continue operation. A certificate of compliance shall be issued by the UDO Administrator after verifying that the regulations contained in Section 7.24 have been met. After issuance of the certificate of compliance, the subject property shall be periodically inspected to ensure continued compliance with the regulations contained in this Ordinance. 
(Ord. of 10-9-2018)  
SECTION 9.3 - NONCONFORMING USES. 
A nonconforming use is a use of land, buildings, or structures that was lawfully established prior to the effective date of this UDO, or any amendment thereto, but which does not conform to the regulations for the zoning classification in which it is located. Nonconforming uses may be continued subject to the limitations noted herein. For purposes of determining whether a right to continue a nonconforming situation is lost pursuant to this section, all buildings, activities, and operations maintained on a lot are generally to be considered as a whole. For example, the failure to rent one apartment in a nonconforming apartment building or one space in a nonconforming manufactured home park for 365 days shall not result in a loss of the right to rent that apartment or space thereafter so long as the apartment building or manufactured home park as a whole is maintained in conjunction with a conforming use, discontinuance of a nonconforming use for the required period shall terminate the right to maintain it thereafter. 
9.3.1. Expansions. 
No nonconforming use shall be extended, expanded, enlarged, or moved to occupy a different or greater area of land, buildings, or structures than was occupied by such use at the time it became nonconforming; provided, however, a nonconforming use may be extended throughout any parts of a building which were specifically designed and arranged for such use at the time it became nonconforming. 
9.3.2. No building or structure devoted to a nonconforming use shall be enlarged, extended, reconstructed, moved, or structurally altered unless such building or structure is thereafter devoted to a conforming use; provided, however, such building or structure may be enlarged or extended upon the granting of a variance from the Board of Adjustment, which variance shall not be granted unless the Board of Adjustment makes each of the following findings of fact in addition to the findings included in Section 4.10.2: 
9.3.2.1. The proposed enlargement or extension shall be less than ten percent of the building or structure gross enclosed floor area in relation to the existing building or structure. 
9.3.2.2. The proposed enlargement or extension shall not increase the intensity of the nonconforming use, which is to say, it will not result in an increase in dwelling units for a residential use nor in gross floor area for a nonresidential use. 
9.3.2.3. The proposed enlargement or extension is designed so that it will not render the use of the property any less compatible that it is in its existing circumstances. 
9.3.2.4. The authorization of such proposed enlargement or extension does not harm or reduce the public health, safety, or welfare. 
9.3.5. Where a nonconforming use ceases for 365 consecutive days, then the use shall not be re-established or resumed, and any subsequent use of the land or structure shall conform to the requirements of this UDO. Vacancy and non-use of the building or structure, regardless of the intent of the owner, shall constitute discontinuance under this provision. 
9.3.6. When a structure or operation made nonconforming by this UDO is vacated or discontinued, the 365-day period for purposes of this section begins to run on the day the property is vacated or the use discontinued. 
9.3.7. Where a building or structure devoted to a nonconforming use is damaged to the extent of 75 percent or more of its current appraised valuation as determined by the current Brunswick County real property tax assessment, such building or structure, if restored, shall thereafter be devoted to conforming uses. 
(Ord. of 10-9-2018)  
SECTION 9.4 - REPAIR, MAINTENANCE, AND RECONSTRUCTION. 
9.4.1. Minor repairs to and routine maintenance of property where nonconforming situations exist are permitted and encouraged. Major renovation, i.e., work estimated to cost more than 75 percent of the appraised valuation as determined by the current county real property tax assessment of the structure to be renovated may be done only in accordance with a zoning permit issued pursuant to this section. 
9.4.2. If a structure located on a lot where a nonconforming situation exists is damaged to an extent that the costs of repair or replacement would not exceed 75 percent of the Brunswick County tax value or the appraised valuation by a North Carolina licensed appraiser of the damaged structure, then the damaged structure may be repaired or replaced only in accordance with a zoning permit issued pursuant to this section. This subsection does not apply to structures used for single-family residential purposes, which structures may be reconstructed pursuant to a zoning permit just as they may be enlarged or replaced as provided in subsection 9.3. 
9.4.3. The UDO Administrator shall issue a permit authorized by this section if he finds that, in completing the renovation, repair or replacement work: 
9.4.3.1. No violation of Section 9.3 will occur; and 
9.4.3.2. The permittee will comply to the extent reasonably possible with all provisions of this UDO permit conditions applicable to the existing use, (except that the permittee shall not lose his right to continue a nonconforming use). 
9.4.4. Residential structures removed from a V-zone due to FIRM map revisions that are damaged greater than as described in Section 9.4.2 above may be restored to their original footprint and height, but may not be enlarged or expanded and must meet all other local, state, and federal regulations. 
9.4.5. Multi-family structures damaged as described in Section 9.4.2 above may be restored to their original footprint and density, but may not be enlarged or expanded. Multi-family structures completely destroyed may be rebuilt to their original footprint and density, but may not be expanded or enlarged. 
(Ord. of 10-9-2018)  
SECTION 9.5 - CHANGE IN USE OF PROPERTY WHERE A NONCONFORMING SITUATION EXISTS. 
9.5.1. A change in the use of property (where a nonconforming situation exists) that is sufficiently substantial to require a new zoning or special use permit under this UDO may not be made except in accordance with subsection 9.5.2 through 9.5.4 and the other requirements of this Ordinance. However, this requirement shall not apply if only a sign permit is needed. 
9.5.2. If the intended change in use is to a principal use that is permissible in the district where the property is located, and all of the other requirements of this Ordinance applicable to that use can be complied with, permission to make the change must be obtained in the same manner as permission to make the initial use of a vacant lot. Once conformity with this Ordinance is achieved, the property may not revert to its nonconforming status. 
9.5.3. If the intended change in use is to a principal use that is permitted in the district where the property is located, but all of the requirements of this Ordinance applicable to that use cannot reasonably be complied with, then the change is permissible, if the Board of Adjustment issues a variance authorizing the change in accordance with Section 4.10.2. This permit may be issued if the Board of Adjustment finds, in addition to any other permits that may be required by this Ordinance, that: 
9.5.3.1. The intended change will not result in a violation of Section 9.3; and 
9.5.3.2. All of the applicable requirements of this Ordinance that can reasonably be complied with will be complied with. Compliance with a requirement of this Ordinance is not reasonably possible if, among other reasons, compliance cannot be achieved without adding additional land to the lot unless under common ownership where the nonconforming situation is maintained or moving a substantial structure that is on a permanent foundation. Mere financial hardship caused by the cost of meeting such requirements, as paved parking does not constitute grounds for finding that compliance is not reasonably possible. However, the UDO Administrator may conclude that compliance is not reasonably possible if the cost (financial and otherwise) of compliance is substantially disproportional to the benefits of eliminating nonconformity. In no case may an applicant be given permission pursuant to this subsection to construct a building or add to an existing building if additional nonconformities would thereby be created. 
9.5.4. If the intended change in principal nonconforming use is to another principal use that is also nonconforming in the district where the property is located, then the change in nonconforming use is permissible if the Board of Adjustment issues a permit authorizing the change. The Board of Adjustment may issue the permit if it finds, in addition to other findings that may be required by this Ordinance, that: 
9.5.4.1. The use requested is one that is permissible in some zoning district with either a zoning or special use permit; and 
9.5.4.2. All of the conditions applicable to the permit authorized in subsection 9.5.3 of this section are satisfied; and 
9.5.4.3. The proposed development will have less of an adverse impact on those most affected by it, except for the applicant, and will be more compatible with the surrounding neighborhood than the use in operation at the time the permit is applied for. 
An existing nonconforming use shall be discontinued within 60 days of the date of approval of a change in nonconforming use. Subsequent to that time, such existing use shall become unlawful. 
(Ord. of 10-9-2018)  
SECTION 9.6 - ABANDONMENT AND DISCONTINUANCE OF NONCONFORMING SITUATIONS. 
9.6.1. If the principal activity on property where a nonconforming situation other than a nonconforming use exists is (i) discontinued for a consecutive period of 365 days, or (ii) discontinued for any period of time without a present intention of resuming that activity, then that property may thereafter be used only in conformity with all of the regulations applicable to the preexisting use unless the entity with authority to issue a permit for the intended use issues a permit to allow the property to be used for this purpose without correcting the nonconforming situations. The zoning permit may be issued if the permit-issuing authority finds that eliminating a particular nonconformity is not reasonably possible (i.e., cannot be accomplished without adding additional land to the lot where the nonconforming situation is maintained or moving a substantial structure that is on a permanent foundation). The permit shall specify which nonconformities need not be corrected. 
9.6.2. For purposes of determining whether a right to continue a nonconforming situation is lost pursuant to this section, all of the buildings, activities, and operations maintained on a lot are generally to be considered as a whole. For example, the failure to rent one apartment in a nonconforming apartment building for 365 days shall not result in a loss of the right to rent that apartment or space thereafter so long as the apartment building as a whole is continuously maintained. But if a nonconforming use is maintained in conjunction with a conforming use, discontinuance of a nonconforming use for the required period shall terminate the right to maintain it thereafter. 
9.6.3. When a structure or operation made nonconforming by this Ordinance is vacant or discontinued at the effective date of this Ordinance, the 365-day period for purposes of this section begins to run on the effective date of this Ordinance.  
SECTION 9.7 - COMPLETION OF NONCONFORMING PROJECTS. 
9.7.1. All nonconforming projects on which construction was begun at least 365 days before the effective date of this Ordinance as well as all nonconforming projects that are at least 25 percent completed in terms of the total expected cost of the project on the effective date of this Ordinance may be completed in accordance with the terms of their permits, so long as these permits were validly issued and remain unrevoked and unexpired. If a development is designed to be completed in stages, this subsection shall apply only to the particular phase under construction. 
9.7.2. Except as provided in subsection 9.7.1, and except to the extent that a developer has a vested right as set forth in Section 4.7, all work on any nonconforming project shall cease on the effective date of this Ordinance, and all permits previously issued for work on nonconforming projects shall be revoked unless the developer requests an appeal to the Board of Adjustment to overturn the UDO Administrator's decision. An appeal shall stay any revocation. The UDO Administrator shall issue such a permit if he/she finds that the applicant has in good faith made substantial expenditures or incurred substantial binding obligations or otherwise changes his position in some substantial way in reasonable reliance on the Ordinance as it existed before the effective date of this Ordinance and thereby would be unreasonably prejudiced if not allowed to complete his project as proposed. In considering whether these findings may be made, the UDO Administrator shall be guided by the following, as well as other relevant considerations: 
9.7.2.1. All expenditures made to obtain or pursuant to a building, zoning, sign, or special or conditional use permit that was validly issued and that remains unrevoked shall be considered as evidence of reasonable reliance on the land use law that existed before this Ordinance became effective. 
9.7.2.2. Except as provided in subdivision 9.7.2.1, no expenditures made more than 365 days before the effective date of this Ordinance may be considered as evidence of reasonable reliance on the land use law that existed before this Ordinance became effective. An expenditure is made at the time a party incurs a binding obligation to make that expenditure. 
9.7.2.3. To the extent that expenditures are recoverable with a reasonable effort, a party shall not be considered prejudiced by having made those expenditures. For example, a party shall not be considered prejudiced by having made some expenditures to acquire a potential development site if the property obtained is approximately as valuable under the new classification as it was under the old. 
9.7.2.4. To the extent that a nonconforming project can be made conforming and that expenditures made or obligations incurred can be effectively utilized in the completion of a conforming project, a party shall not be considered prejudiced by having made such expenditures. 
9.7.2.5. A person shall be considered to have acted in good faith if the person (i) had actual knowledge of a proposed change in the Ordinance affecting the proposed development site which could not be attributed to him, or (ii) should have known of the proposed change in the Ordinance. 
9.7.2.6. Even though a person had actual knowledge of a proposed change in the land use law affecting a development site, the UDO Administrator may still find that he acted in good faith if he did not proceed with his plans in a deliberate attempt to circumvent the requirements of the proposed Ordinance. The UDO Administrator may find that the developer did not proceed in an attempt to avoid requirements of the proposed Ordinance if he/she determines that (i) at the time the expenditures were made it was not clear that the proposed Ordinance would prohibit the intended development, and (ii) the developer had legitimate business reasons for making expenditures. 
9.7.2.7. In deciding whether a permit should be issued under this section, the UDO Administrator shall not be limited to either denying a permit altogether or issuing a permit to complete the project (or phases, sections, or stages thereof) as originally proposed or approved. Upon proper submission of plans by the applicant, the UDO Administrator may also issue a permit authorizing a development that is less nonconforming than the project as originally proposed or approved but that still does not comply with all the provisions of the Ordinance making the project nonconforming. The UDO Administrator shall not allow the nonconforming project to be constructed or completed in a fashion that is larger or more extensive than is necessary to allow the developer to recoup and obtain a reasonable rate of return on the expenditures he has made in connection with that nonconforming project. 
9.7.3. When it appears from the developer's plans or otherwise that a project was intended to be or reasonably could be completed in phases, stages, segments, or other discrete units, the developer shall be allowed to complete only those phases or segments with respect to which the developer can make the showing required under subsection 9.7.2 and obtain permits. In addition to the matters and subject to the guidelines set forth in subdivisions 9.7.2.1 through 9.7.2.7, the UDO Administrator shall, in determining whether a developer would be unreasonably prejudiced if not allowed to complete phases or segments of a nonconforming project, consider the following in addition to other relevant factors: 
9.7.3.1. Whether any plans prepared or approved regarding incompleted phases constitute conceptual plans only or construction drawings based upon detailed surveying, architectural, or engineering work. 
9.7.3.2. Whether any improvements, such as streets or utilities, have been installed in phases not yet completed. 
9.7.3.3. Whether utilities and other facilities installed in completed phases have been constructed in such a manner or location or on such a scale, in anticipation of connection to or interrelationship with approved but incompleted phases, that the investment in such utilities or other facilities cannot be recouped if such approved but incompleted phases are constructed in conformity with existing regulations. 
9.7.3.4. The UDO Administrator shall not consider any application for the permit authorized by subsection 9.7.2 that is submitted more than 60 days after the effective date of this Ordinance. The UDO Administrator may waive this requirement for good cause shown, but in no case may it extend the application deadline beyond one year. 
(Ord. of 10-9-2018)  
SECTION 9.8 - AUTHORIZATION OF NONCONFORMING PROJECTS. 
Whenever an amendment to this Ordinance becomes effective after an application for a development permit is submitted but before the permit is issued, and the effect of the amendment is to render the proposed development nonconforming in some respect, then the applicant may choose to proceed with the development under the previous requirements or under the amended requirements. 
(Ord. of 10-9-2018)  
SECTION 9.9 - NONCONFORMING SIGNS. 
9.9.1. Subject to the remaining restrictions of this section, nonconforming signs that were otherwise lawful on the effective date of this article may be continued. 
9.9.2. No person may engage in any activity that causes an increase in the extent of nonconformity of a nonconforming sign. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, no nonconforming sign may be enlarged or altered in such a manner as to aggravate the nonconforming condition; nor may illumination be added to any nonconforming sign. 
9.9.3. A nonconforming sign may not be moved or replaced except to bring the sign into complete conformity with this article. 
9.9.4. If a nonconforming sign is destroyed by natural causes, it may not thereafter be repaired, reconstructed, or replaced except in conformity with all the provisions of this Ordinance, and the remnants of the former sign structure shall be cleared from the land. For purposes of this section, a nonconforming sign is destroyed if damaged to an extent that the cost of repairing the sign to its former stature or replacing it with an equivalent sign equals or exceeds the value (tax value if listed for tax purposes) of the sign damaged. 
9.9.5. The message of a nonconforming sign may be changed so long as this does not create any new nonconformity (for example, by creating an off-premises sign under circumstances where such a sign would not be allowed). 
9.9.6. Subject to other provisions of this section, nonconforming signs may be repaired and renovated so long as the cost of such work does not exceed within any 12-month period 75 percent of the value (tax value if listed for tax purposes) of such sign or appraised tax value of a replacement. 
9.9.7 Any sign that does not conform with the regulations set forth in section 10.25.2 shall be brought into conformance with section 10.25.2 within six months after the date of the notice of nonconformity.

10.2.2.2. Existing Development. When there is a change from an existing use to a new use which requires additional parking and the new use requires ten or more parking spaces. 
10.2.2.3. Expansion of Structure. When there is an expansion of an existing structure by greater than 25 percent of the gross floor area and that use requires ten or more additional parking spaces. 
10.2.2.4. Reconstruction of Structure. When there is damage or destruction to an existing structure beyond 50 percent of its assessed value, the reconstruction must conform to the new construction standards of this section. 
10.2.2.5. Expansion of Parking Facility. When there is an expansion of the parking facility by a minimum of ten percent of the parking with a minimum of ten total spaces. 
(Ord. of 10-9-2018)  
SECTION 10.3 - TREE RESOURCE MANAGEMENT. 
Tree resource management regulations shall apply to all protected trees for both new and existing development in accordance with the Town of Oak Island Tree Management Program. No building permit or certificate of occupancy shall be issued for any improvements upon a property where the provisions of the Tree Management Program have not been complied with. 
(Ord. of 10-9-2018)  
SECTION 10.4 - STREET YARD REQUIREMENTS. 
Street yards are required for all commercial, industrial, and multi-family residential development with eight or more parking spaces. 
10.4.1. Minimum Standards. 	 

The minimum depth of all street yards shall be 7.5 feet. For every 50 linear feet of frontage, or fraction thereof, the street yard shall contain a minimum of two Shade Trees and six Intermediate Shrubs. Newly installed plant material shall be evenly distributed, where possible. 
 
10.4.2. Tree Credits.

Said land shall be used for no other purpose so long as no other adequate provisions of parking space meeting the requirements of this Article have been made for the principal use. In such cases, the applicant for a permit for the principal use shall submit with the application for a certificate of occupancy an instrument duly executed and acknowledged which subjects said land to parking use in connection with the principal use for which it is made available. Such instrument shall become a permanent record and be attached to the certificate of occupancy application. In the event such land is ever used for other than off-street parking for the principal use for which is it encumbered and no other off-street parking space meeting the terms of this Article is provided for the principal use, the certificate of occupancy for such principal use shall become void. Nothing in this section shall be construed as discouraging individual informal arrangements between commercial and other nonresidential uses that would provide for shared or overflow parking for special events, daytime or nighttime use or other similar situation while one of the uses is not in operation provided the minimum standards of this Article are met for each individual use and no traffic congestion or other safety concerns result.

10.19.7.2.1. The proposed use is directed primarily toward pedestrian trade existing in the area; and 
10.19.7.2.2. The character of existing development or properties within 400 feet prohibit the acquisition or lease of land for parking; and 
10.19.7.2.3. That one parking space for each three full-time employees shall be provided. An exception to this standard may be granted for mixed use developments as provided in this section. 
10.19.7.3. If any point on a property line on which the required off-street parking is located is within a 1,500-foot radius of a multi-family development, the Board of Adjustment may grant a variance which allows a 50 percent reduction in the required off-street parking.

PART IV. - SIGN REGULATIONS 
 
SECTION 10.22 - PURPOSE AND INTENT. 
The purpose and intent of this Part is to support and complement the various land uses allowed in Oak Island by the adoption of policies and regulations concerning the placement of signs. 
10.22.1. The Oak Island Town Council does hereby find and declare the outdoor placement of signs to be a legitimate use of private property but that the erection of signs should be controlled and regulated in order to promote the health, safety, welfare and convenience and enjoyment of travel on and protection of the public investment in streets and roads in Oak Island and to promote the reasonable, orderly and effective display of such signs, displays and devices. Signs can obstruct views, distract motorists, displace alternative uses for land, and pose other problems that legitimately call for regulation. The purpose of this section is to regulate the size, color, illumination, movement, materials, location, height, and condition of all signs placed on private property for exterior observation, thus ensuring the protection of property values, the character of the various neighborhoods, the creation of a convenient, attractive and harmonious community, protection against destruction of or encroachment on historic convenience to citizens and encouraging economic development. This section allows adequate communication through signage while encouraging aesthetic quality in the design, location, size, safety, and purpose of all signs. This section must be interpreted in a manner consistent with the First Amendment guarantee of free speech. If any provision of this section is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, such finding shall not affect the validity of other provisions of this section which can be given effect without the invalid provision. 
10.22.2. A sign placed on land or on a building for the purpose of identification, protection or directing persons to a use conducted therein must be deemed to be an integral but accessory and subordinate part of the principal use of land or building. Therefore, the intent of this article is to regulate signs in order to ensure they are appropriate to the land, building or use to which they are appurtenant and are adequate for their, intended purpose while balancing the individual and community interests identified in subsection 10.22.1 of this section. 
10.22.3. These regulations are intended to promote signs that are compatible with the use of the property to which they are appurtenant, landscape and architecture of surrounding buildings, are legible and appropriate to the activity to which they pertain, are not distracting to motorists, and are constructed and maintained in a structurally sound and attractive condition. 
10.22.4. These regulations distinguish between portions of the town designed for primarily vehicular access and portions to the town designed for primarily pedestrian access. 
10.22.5. These regulations do not regulate every form and instance of visual communication that may be displayed anywhere within the jurisdictional limits of the town. Rather, they are intended to regulate those forms and instances that are most likely to meaningfully affect one or more of the purposes set forth above. 
10.22.6. These regulations do not entirely eliminate all of the harms that may be created by the installation and display of signs. Rather, they strike an appropriate balance that preserves ample channels of communication by means of visual display while still reducing and mitigating the extent of the harms caused by signs. 
10.22.7. Severability. 
Section 1.4, Severability applies to this Part IV, Sign Regulations, and is incorporated into this Part by reference.

10.23.3.3. Uses admonitions such as stop, go, slow, danger, etc., which might be confused with traffic directional signs or signals. 
10.23.4. Setbacks. 
All signs that require a permit shall be setback at least ten feet from any property line. In the case a structure is erected to the property line, a wall sign shall be erected flush to the building and no lower than eight feet above sidewalk grade. Unless specifically exempted herein, signs that do not require a permit shall be located entirely within the property lines and situated so no traffic hazards are created. 
10.23.5. Unlawful Signs. 
In case any sign shall be installed, erected, or constructed in violation of any of the terms of this section, the code enforcement official shall notify by first class mail, return receipt requested or by written notice served personally, the owner of lessee thereof to alter such signs so as to comply with this Ordinance and to secure the necessary permit therefore, or to remove the sign. If such order is not complied with in ten days of receipt, the code enforcement official shall remove such sign at the expense of the owner or lessee thereof. Refer to Section 1.8.

SECTION 10.61 - STREETS. 
10.61.1. Type of Street Required. 
All subdivision lots shall abut on a public or private street as specified in Section 10.60. Subdividers are required to provide street rights-of-way, street pavement widths, and street cross sections to adequately serve the lots in the proposed subdivision. The streets shall be consistent with the following design principles: 
10.61.1.1. The street system shall discourage generation of excessive through traffic in the subdivision. 
10.61.1.2. Rights-of-way and pavement widths shall be determined by the traffic carried or anticipated to be carried by the street. 
10.61.1.3. Access to adjoining property shall be considered in planning for the street system. 
10.61.1.4. Sidewalks shall be provided in accordance with Section 10.61.7.2. 
10.61.1.5. Where cul-de-sacs are used, they shall be as short as feasible. 
All proposed public streets within the corporate limits of the Town shall be dedicated to the town; all proposed public streets in the town's extraterritorial jurisdiction shall be dedicated to the state. All streets shall be built to the standards of the state department of transportation. Streets not dedicated to the town which are not eligible for acceptance into the state highway system because there are too few lots or residences shall, nevertheless, be built in accordance with the standards necessary to be put on the state highway system. A written maintenance agreement with the provisions for the future maintenance of the street shall be included with the final plat. The Planning Board may require installation of either bikepaths, bike lanes, or shared roadway facilities for bikes in the subdivision where there are transportation and/or recreational benefits from such installation. In its review of sidewalks and bikeways, the Planning Board may require possible connections to the town's existing sidewalk and bikeway systems. 
10.61.2. Subdivision Street Disclosure Statement. 
Where streets are to be dedicated to the public but have not yet been accepted, by a public entity, a statement explaining the status of the street shall be included with the final plat. Such statement shall explain that the property and/or lot owners are ultimately responsible for the upkeep and maintenance of all streets until such time that the streets are assumed for maintenance by a public entity. 
10.61.3. Half Streets. 
The dedication of half streets of less than the state requirement at the perimeter of a new subdivision shall be prohibited. If circumstances render this impracticable, adequate provision for the concurrent dedication of the remaining half of the street shall be furnished by the subdivider. Where there exists a half street in an adjoining subdivision, the remaining half shall be provided by the proposed subdivision. However, in circumstances where more than 60 feet of right-of-way is required, a partial width right-of-way, not less than 60 feet in width, may be dedicated when adjoining undeveloped property is owned or controlled by the subdivider; provided, however, that the width of the partial dedication is such as to permit the installation of such facilities as may be necessary to serve abutting lots. When the adjoining property is subdivided, the remainder of the full required right-of-way shall be dedicated. 
10.61.4. Marginal Access Streets. 
Where a tract of land to be subdivided adjoins an arterial street, the subdivider shall be required to provide reverse frontage on a minor street for the lots to be developed adjacent to the arterial. Where reverse frontage is established, private driveways shall be prevented from having direct access to the arterial. In the case of a minor subdivision proposed to front onto an arterial street, the UDO Administrator may regulate access by requiring that: 
10.61.4.1. Access be limited to a minor street, when available. 
10.61.4.2. An alternative access design, such as joint driveways, be used to achieve the intent of this provision. Shared driveways may only serve two lots. The centerline of the shared driveway must be located on the side lot line of the two lots being provided access by the shared driveway. 
10.61.5. Nonresidential Streets.

SECTIONS 10.7110.74 - RESERVED FOR FUTURE USE.  
PART VII. - FLOOD DAMAGE PREVENTION REGULATIONSCOASTAL REGULAR PHASE  
Division I. - Statutory Authorization, Findings of Fact, Purpose, and Objectives 
 
SECTION 10.75 - STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION. 
The Legislature of the State of North Carolina has in Part 6, Article 21 of Chapter 143; Parts 3, 5, and 8 of Article 19 of Chapter 160A; and Article 8 of Chapter 160A of the North Carolina General Statutes, delegated to local governmental units the responsibility to adopt regulations designed to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare. Therefore, the Town Council of Oak Island, North Carolina, does ordain as follows. 
(Ord. of 10-9-2018)  
SECTION 10.76 - FINDINGS OF FACT. 
10.76.1. The flood prone areas within the jurisdiction of Oak Island are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life, property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures of flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety, and general welfare. 
10.76.2. These flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains causing increases in flood heights and velocities and by the occupancy in flood prone areas of uses vulnerable to floods or other hazards. 
(Ord. of 10-9-2018)  
SECTION 10.77 - STATEMENT OF PURPOSE. 
It is the purpose of Part VII, Flood Damage Prevention Regulations to promote public health, safety, and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions within flood prone areas by provisions designed to: 
10.77.1. Restrict or prohibit uses that are dangerous to health, safety, and property due to water or erosion hazards or that result in damaging increases in erosion, flood heights or velocities; 
10.77.2. Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities that serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction; 
10.77.3. Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural protective barriers, which are involved in the accommodation of flood waters; 
10.77.4. Control filling, grading, dredging, and all other development that may increase erosion or flood damage; and 
10.77.5. Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers that will unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands. 
(Ord. of 10-9-2018)  
SECTION 10.78 - OBJECTIVES. 
The objectives of Part VII, Flood Damage Prevention Regulations are to: 
10.78.1. Protect human life, safety, and health; 
10.78.2. Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects; 
10.78.3. Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public; 
10.78.4. Minimize prolonged business losses and interruptions; 
10.78.5. Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities (i.e. water and gas mains, electric, telephone, cable and sewer lines, streets, and bridges) that are located in flood prone areas; 
10.78.6. Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of flood prone areas; and 
10.78.7. Ensure that potential buyers are aware that property is in a Special Flood Hazard Area. 
(Ord. of 10-9-2018)  
Division II. - General Provisions 
 
SECTION 10.79 - LANDS TO WHICH PART VII APPLIES. 
Part VII, Flood Damage Prevention Regulations shall apply to all Special Flood Hazard Areas within the jurisdiction, including extraterritorial jurisdictions (ETJs) if applicable, of Oak Island. 
(Ord. of 10-9-2018)  
SECTION 10.80 - BASIS FOR ESTABLISHING THE SPECIAL FLOOD HAZARD AREAS. 
The Special Flood Hazard Areas are those identified under the Cooperating Technical State (CTS) agreement between the State of North Carolina and FEMA in its Flood Insurance Study (FIS) dated June 2, 2006, for Brunswick County and associated DFIRM panels, including any digital data developed as part of the FIS, which are adopted by reference and declared a part of this Ordinance. Future revisions to the FIS and DFIRM panels that do not change flood hazard data within the jurisdictional authority of Oak Island are also adopted by reference and declared a part of this Ordinance. Subsequent Letter of Map revisions (LOMRs) and/or Physical Map Revisions (PMRs) shall be adopted within three months. 
(Ord. of 10-9-2018)  
SECTION 10.81 - ESTABLISHMENT OF FLOODPLAIN DEVELOPMENT PERMIT. 
A Floodplain Development Permit shall be required in conformance with the provisions of this Ordinance prior to the commencement of any development activities within Special Flood Hazard Areas determined in accordance with the provisions of Section 10.80 of this Ordinance. 
(Ord. of 10-9-2018)  
SECTION 10.82 - COMPLIANCE. 
No structure or land shall hereafter be located, extended, converted, altered, or developed in any way without full compliance with the terms of this Ordinance and other applicable regulations. 
(Ord. of 10-9-2018)  
SECTION 10.83 - ABROGATION AND GREATER RESTRICTIONS. 
This ordinance is not intended to repeal, abrogate, or impair any existing easements, covenants, or deed restrictions. However, where this Ordinance and another conflict or overlap, whichever imposes the more stringent restrictions shall prevail. 
(Ord. of 10-9-2018)  
SECTION 10.84 - INTERPRETATION. 
In the interpretation and application of the Flood Damage Prevention Regulations, all provisions shall be: 
10.84.1. Considered as minimum requirements; 
10.84.2. Liberally construed in favor of the governing body; and 
10.84.3. Deemed neither to limit nor repeal any other powers granted under State statutes. 
(Ord. of 10-9-2018)  
SECTION 10.85 - WARNING AND DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY. 
The degree of flood protection required by these regulations are considered reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on scientific and engineering consideration. Larger floods can and will occur. Actual flood heights may be increased by man-made or natural causes. These regulations do not imply that land outside the Special Flood Hazard Areas or uses permitted within such areas will be free from flooding or flood damages. These regulations shall not create liability on the part of Oak Island or by any officer or employee thereof for any flood damages that result from reliance on these regulations or any administrative decision lawfully made hereunder. 
(Ord. of 10-9-2018)  
SECTION 10.86 - PENALTIES FOR VIOLATION. 
Violation of the provisions of these regulations or failure to comply with any of its requirements, including violation of conditions and safeguards established in connection with grants of variance or special exceptions, shall constitute a Class 1 misdemeanor pursuant to G.S. 143-215.58. Any person who violates this Ordinance or fails to comply with any of its requirements shall, upon conviction thereof, be fined not more than $100.00 or imprisoned for not more than 30 days, or both. Each day such violation continues shall be considered a separate offense. Nothing herein contained shall prevent Oak Island from taking such other lawful action as is necessary to prevent or remedy any violation.

The Finished Construction Elevation Certificate certifier shall provide at least two photographs showing the front and rear of the building taken within 90 days from the date of certification. The photographs must be taken with views confirming the building description and diagram number provided in Section 10.75. To the extent possible, these photographs should show the entire building including foundation. If the building has split-level or multi-level areas, provide at least two additional photographs showing side views of the building. In addition, when applicable, provide a photograph of the foundation showing a representative example of the flood openings or vents. All photographs must be in color and measure at least three inch. Digital photographs are acceptable. 
10.88.3.2. Floodproofing Certificate. If non-residential floodproofing is used to meet the regulatory flood protection elevation requirements, a Floodproofing Certificate (FEMA Form 086-0-34), with supporting data, an operational plan, and an inspection and maintenance plan are required prior to the actual start of any new construction. It shall be the duty of the permit holder to submit to the Floodplain Administrator a certification of the floodproofed design elevation of the reference level and all attendant utilities, in relation to mean sea level. Floodproofing certification shall be prepared by or under the direct supervision of a professional engineer or architect and certified by same. The Floodplain Administrator shall review the certificate data, the operational plan, and the inspection and maintenance plan. Deficiencies detected by such review shall be corrected by the applicant prior to permit approval. Failure to submit the certification or failure to make required corrections shall be cause to deny a floodplain development permit. Failure to construct in accordance with the certified design shall be cause to withhold the issuance of a Certificate of Compliance/Occupancy. 
10.88.3.3. If a manufactured home is placed within Zone A, AE, AH, AO, A99 and the elevation of the chassis is more than 36 inches in height above grade, an engineered foundation certification is required in accordance with the provisions of Section 10.93.3.2.

SECTION 10.93 - SPECIFIC STANDARDS. 
In all Special Flood Hazard Areas where Base Flood Elevation (BFE) data has been provided, as set forth in Section 10.80 or Section 10.94, the following provisions, in addition to the provisions of Section 10.92, are required: 
10.93.1. Residential Construction. 
New construction and substantial improvement of any residential structure (including manufactured homes) shall have the reference level, including basement, elevated no lower than the regulatory flood protection elevation, as defined in Appendix A of this Ordinance. 
10.93.2. Non-Residential Construction. 
New construction and substantial improvement of any commercial, industrial, or other non-residential structure shall have the reference level, including basement, elevated no lower than the regulatory flood protection elevation, as defined in Appendix A of this Ordinance. Structures located in A, AE, AH, AO, A99 Zones may be floodproofed to the regulatory flood protection elevation in lieu of elevation provided that all areas of the structure, together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities, below the regulatory flood protection elevation are watertight with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water, using structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and the effect of buoyancy. For AO Zones, the floodproofing elevation shall be in accordance with Section 10.99.2. A registered professional engineer or architect shall certify that the standards of this subsection are satisfied. Such certification shall be provided to the Floodplain Administrator as set forth in Section 10.88.3, along with the operational plan and the inspection and maintenance plan. 
10.93.3. Manufactured Homes. 
10.93.3.1. New and replacement manufactured homes shall be elevated so that the reference level of the manufactured home is no lower than the regulatory flood protection elevation, as defined in Appendix A of this Ordinance.

10.93.4.4.2.2. Breakaway walls that exceed a design safe loading resistance of 20 pounds per square foot (either by design or when so required by State or local codes) shall be certified by a registered professional engineer or architect that the breakaway wall will collapse from a water load less than that which would occur during the base flood event, and the elevated portion of the building and supporting foundation system shall not be subject to collapse, displacement, or other structural damage due to the effects of wind and water loads acting simultaneously on all building components (structural and non-structural). The water loading values used shall be those associated with the base flood. The wind loading values used shall be those required by the North Carolina State Building Code. 
10.93.4.5. Property owners shall be required to execute and record a non-conversion agreement prior to issuance of a building permit declaring that the area below the lowest floor shall not be improved, finished or otherwise converted to habitable space (30 CRS points); Oak Island will have the right to inspect the enclosed area (30 CRS points). Oak Island will conduct annual inspections (30 CRS points). This agreement shall be recorded with the Brunswick County Register of Deeds and shall transfer with the property in perpetuity. 
10.93.4.6. Release of restrictive covenant. If a property which is bound by a non-conversion agreement is modified to remove enclosed areas below BFE, then the owner may request release of restrictive covenant after staff inspection and submittal of confirming documentation. 
10.93.5. Additions/Improvements. 
10.93.5.1. Additions and/or improvements to pre-FIRM structures when the addition and/or improvements in combination with any interior modifications to the existing structure are: 
10.93.5.1.1. Not a substantial improvement, the addition and/or improvements must be designed to minimize flood damages and must not be any more non-conforming than the existing structure. 
10.93.5.1.2. A substantial improvement, with modifications/rehabilitations/ improvements to the existing structure or the common wall is structurally modified more than installing a doorway, both the existing structure and the addition must comply with the standards for new construction.

Additions to pre-FIRM and post-FIRM structures that are a substantial improvement with no modifications/rehabilitations/improvements to the existing structure other than a standard door in the common wall shall require only the addition to comply with the standards for new construction. 
10.93.5.3. Additions and/or improvements to post-FIRM structures when the addition and/or improvements in combination with any interior modifications to the existing structure are: 
10.93.5.3.1. Not a substantial improvement, the addition and/or improvements only must comply with the standards for new construction consistent with the code and requirements for the original structure. 
10.93.5.3.2. A substantial improvement, both the existing structure and the addition and/or improvements must comply with the standards for new construction. 
10.93.5.4. Any combination of repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition or improvement of a building or structure taking place during a one year period, the cumulative cost of which equals or exceeds 50 percent of the market value of the structure before the improvement or repair is started must comply with the standards for new construction. For each building or structure, the one year period begins on the date of the first improvement or repair of that building or structure subsequent to the effective date of this Ordinance. If the structure has sustained substantial damage, any repairs are considered substantial improvement regardless of the actual repair work performed. The requirement does not, however, include either: 
10.93.5.4.1. Any project for improvement of a building required to correct existing health, sanitary or safety code violations identified by the building official and that are the minimum necessary to assume safe living conditions. 
10.93.5.4.2. Any alteration of a historic structure provided that the alteration will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a historic structure.

Any group housing and services program for two or more unrelated adults, by whatever name it is called, that makes available, at a minimum, one meal a day and housekeeping services and provides personal care services directly or through a formal written agreement with one or more licensed home care or hospice agencies. Settings in which services are delivered may include self-contained apartment units or single or shared room units with private or area baths. There are three types of assisted living residences: adult care homes, adult care homes that serve only elderly persons, and multi-unit assisted housing with services. As used in this definition, elderly person( means: (i) any person who has attained the age of 55 years or older and requires assistance with activities of daily living, housing, and services; or (ii) any adult who has a primary diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease or other form of dementia who requires assistance with activities of daily living, housing, and services provided by a licensed Alzheimer's and dementia care unit. 
(1)  Adult care home. An assisted living residence in which the housing management provides 24-hour scheduled and unscheduled personal care services to two or more residents, either directly or for scheduled needs, through formal written agreement with licensed home care or hospice agencies. Some licensed adult care homes provide supervision to persons with cognitive impairments whose decisions, if made independently, may jeopardize the safety or well-being of themselves or others and therefore require supervision. Medication in an adult care home may be administered by designated trained staff. Adult care homes that provide care to two to six unrelated residents are commonly called family care homes. Adult care homes include halfway houses and drug rehab facilities. 
(2)  Multi-unit assisted housing with services. An assisted living residence in which hands-on personal care services and nursing services which are arranged by housing management are provided by a licensed home care or hospice agency through an individualized written care plan. The housing management has a financial interest or financial affiliation or formal written agreement which makes personal care services accessible and available through at least one licensed home care or hospice agency. The resident has a choice of any provider, and the housing management may not combine charges for housing and personal care services. All residents, or other compensatory agents, must be capable, through informed consent, of entering into a contract and must not be in need of 24-hour supervision. Assistance with self-administration of medications may be provided by appropriately trained staff when delegated by a licensed nurse according to the home care agency's established plan of care.
