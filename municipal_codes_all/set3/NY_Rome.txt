PREFACE 
    This Code constitutes a complete recodification of the general and permanent ordinances of the City of Rome, New York. 
    Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the 1966 Code, as supplemented through May 22, 1996, and ordinances subsequently adopted by the common council. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this Code, the reader can locate any section of the 1966 Code, as supplemented, and any subsequent ordinance included herein. 
    The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order, and the various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Notes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state law have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this Code. 
Chapter and Section Numbering System 
    The chapter and section numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and local government codes. Each section number consists of two parts separated by a dash. The figure before the dash refers to the chapter number, and the figure after the dash refers to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the second section of chapter 1 is numbered 1-2, and the first section of chapter 6 is 6-1. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter, and at the same time new sections can be inserted in their proper place by using the decimal system for amendments. For example, if new material consisting of one section that would logically come between sections 6-1 and 6-2 is desired to be added, such new section would be numbered 6-1.5. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject. The next successive number shall be assigned to the new article or division. New chapters may be included by using one of the reserved chapter numbers. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. 
Page Numbering System 
    The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the volume. The number to the right of the colon represents the number of the page in that portion. In the case of a chapter of the Code, the number to the left of the colon indicates the number of the chapter. In the case of an appendix to the Code, the letter immediately to the left of the colon indicates the letter of the appendix. The following are typical parts of codes of ordinances, which may or may not appear in this Code at this time, and their corresponding prefixes:

Indexes 
    The indexes have been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the indexes themselves which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which the user is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
    A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up-to-date. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited, and the affected page or pages will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
    Keeping this publication up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. As revised pages are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
Acknowledgments 
    This publication was under the direct supervision of Alyce W. Whitson, Supervising Editor, and Jody Wilson, Editor, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida. Credit is gratefully given to the other members of the publisher's staff for their sincere interest and able assistance throughout the project. 
    The publisher is most grateful to Gregory J. Amoroso, Corporation Counsel, Jeanette D. Reid, City Clerk, and the other members of the city staff, for their cooperation and assistance during the progress of the work on this publication. It is hoped that their efforts and those of the publisher have resulted in a Code of Ordinances which will make the active law of the city readily accessible to all citizens and which will be a valuable tool in the day-to-day administration of the city's affairs.

    Section 2. All Ordinances and Local Laws of a general and permanent nature enacted on or before March 25, 1998, and not included in the Code or recognized and continued in force by reference therein, are repealed. 
    Section 3. The repeal provided for in section 2 hereof shall not be construed to revive any Ordinance or Local Law or part thereof that has been repealed by a subsequent Ordinance or Local Law that is repealed by this Local Law.

Each act of violation and each day upon which any such violation shall occur shall constitute a separate offense. The penalty provided by this section, unless another penalty is expressly provided, shall apply to the amendment of any Code section, whether or not such penalty is reenacted in the amendatory Local Law or Ordinance. In addition to the penalty prescribed above, the City may pursue other remedies such as abatement of nuisances, administrative adjudication, injunctive relief and revocation of licenses or permits.

(1)  Goods and services procured and awarded on the basis of best value are those that the board of estimate determines to optimize quality, cost, and efficiency, among responsive and responsible bidder or offers. 
(2)  Where possible, the determination shall be based on an objective and quantifiable analysis of clearly described and documented criteria as they apply to the rating of bids or offers. 
(3)  The criteria may include, but shall not be limited to, any or all of the following: cost of maintenance; proximity to the contractors; longer product life; product performance criteria; and quality of craftsmanship. 
(e)  Documentation.

Said documentation shall be made available to the public and members of the board of estimate and contract at such time that the board of estimate and contract agenda is published. 
(f)  Purchasing policy; savings; construction. Any inconsistent provision of the city's purchasing policy, as adopted or amended prior to the effective date of this local law, shall be deemed superseded and supplemented by the provisions of this local law so as to incorporate this local law therein. If any part or provision of this local law or the application hereof to any person or circumstance be adjudged invalid by any court of competent jurisdiction, such judgment shall be confined in its operation to the part or provision or application directly involved in the controversy in which such judgment shall have been rendered and shall not affect or impair the validity of the remainder of this local law or the application thereof to other persons or circumstances, and the city common council hereby declares that it would have passed this local law or the remainder hereof had such invalid application or invalid provision been apparent or omitted. Any reference to a state statute or code shall include the future amendment or recodification of such statute or code and the references herein are for convenience and construction purposes only. 
(g)  Supersession and effective date. All ordinances, local laws, and parts thereof inconsistent with this local law are hereby superseded only to the extent necessary to give effect to the provisions of this local law. This local law shall take effect immediately.

The application shall be signed by the owner of the property where the work is to be performed or an authorized agent of the owner.

(j)  Revocation or suspension of building permits. If the code enforcement officer determines that a building permit was issued in error because of incorrect, inaccurate or incomplete information, or that the work for which a building permit was issued violates the Uniform Code or the Energy Code, the code enforcement officer shall revoke the building permit or suspend the building permit until such time as the permit holder demonstrates that: 
(1)  All work then completed is in compliance with all applicable provisions of the Uniform Code and the Energy Code; and

(3)  Structures unfit for human occupancy ("unfit"). A structure is unfit for human occupancy whenever such structure is unsafe, unlawful or, because of the degree to which the structure is in disrepair or lacks maintenance, is insanitary, vermin or rat infested, contains filth and contamination, or lacks ventilation, illumination, sanitary or heating facilities or other essential equipment required by this Code, or because the location of the structure constitutes a hazard to the occupants of the structure or to the public.

(b)  If the building inspector finds that there is actual and immediate danger of failure or collapse so as to endanger life, such notice shall also require the building, structure, or portion thereof to be vacated forthwith and not reoccupied until the specific repairs and improvements are completed, inspected and approved by the building inspector. The building inspector shall cause to be posted at each entrance to such building a notice stating: "this building is unsafe and its use and occupancy has been prohibited by the building inspector." Such notice shall remain posted until the required repairs are made or demolition is completed. It shall be unlawful for any person or his agent or servant to remove such notice without the written permission of the building inspector or for any person to enter the building except for the purpose of making the required repairs or of demolishing the building. 
(c)  In an emergency which, in the opinion of the building inspector, involves imminent danger to human life or health, the building inspector shall promptly cause such building, structure, or portion thereof to be made safe or removed. For this purpose he may at once enter such structure or land on which it stands or abutting land or structures, with such assistance and at such cost as may be necessary.

The examination for the certificate of competency shall take place twice during each year, with one scheduled in January and the other in June, and shall be of such character as to fairly test the fitness and qualifications of the applicant for the trade, business or calling of plumbing. Applications for examination will be reviewed at any regular meeting of the board to determine whether the applicant meets the requisite qualifications. The names and standing of all persons examined shall be formally entered on the records of the board. 
(1)  Applications for examination. All applications shall be properly completed, acknowledged and filed with the secretary. The applicant must state under oath in his/her own handwriting their full name, residence, including street and street number, his/her citizenship, the name of the parties/firms/corporations in whose service he/she has been and their business or employment during the five years immediately preceding the date of application, as well as the number of years during which he/she has been engaged in the trade, business or calling of plumbing.

Acceptable forms of payment include money order, cashier's check or a business check. All checks are to be made payable to the city.

The board will review and report to the applicant(s) within 30 days of receiving the application as to whether approval is granted for a special testing date. If the board approves the additional examination date, the applicant will be notified of the approval and the date scheduled for the examination and must submit an examination fee as set forth in Appendix B-Fee Schedule of this Code prior to the test date. If the board denies the request for a special examination date, the application will be held until the next regularly scheduled testing date so long as the candidate(s):

The renewal period shall commence upon the expiration date of the current license, including those renewal applications received after the expiration of the current one-year license period.

Upon the license being listed as inactive by the board, the license holder shall refrain from any further active plumbing work or any plumbing business. 
(1)  For those plumbing licenses issued after the year 2000, a continuous period of ten years or more in an inactive status will render the certificate of competency null and void. Therefore, prior to the reactivation of the license, the holder must apply and successfully complete an examination for a certificate of competency. 
(f)  Suspension or revocation of license for noncompliance. Any holder of a license required under the provisions of this article who is found by the board, after a hearing, to be operating or working in violation of the provisions of this article shall have the license suspended until the requirements of this article are met, or revoked.

The notice shall allege the facts constituting the noncompliance. The notice shall further contain a time and place for a hearing to be held before the board. At the time and place of the hearing designated in the notice, the CEO and/or plumbing inspector or his/her designee shall present all relevant evidence as to the existence of a violation of this article and as to the appropriate remedy.

(2)  Administrative penalties. The board, upon a finding that the license holder failed to comply with the provisions of this article, shall have the authority to order the following in regards to discipline for said noncompliance: 
(i)  Suspension of license. For the first offense, in no case shall the suspension be less than 15 days; for a second offense within ten years of the first offense, the suspension shall be for a minimum of 60 days; and for three or more offenses within ten years of the first offense, the minimum suspension period shall be six months. During a suspension period, the license shall be considered null and void. After the termination of a period of suspension, the license shall be valid and effective provided that any renewal fees that have become due on the license are paid in full; or 
(ii)  Revocation. If the penalty of revocation is imposed, said revocation shall be for a period of not less than six months and no more than one year. After the termination of the revocation period, there must be an application made, along with the requisite fee for a regularly scheduled examination for a certificate of competency, before the reissuance of a license pursuant to the provisions of subsection 14-301(c) herein. 
(3)  Nothing in this section shall prohibit the CEO or plumbing inspector from referring any violation for prosecution pursuant to the provisions of section 1-15 of this Code and/or section 55 of the New York State General City Law, or any superseding provision thereto. A conviction or plea of guilty in a court of competent jurisdiction for a violation of this article and/or any applicable provision of state law shall be presumptive evidence of a failure to comply.

Editor's note- Ord. No. 8807, adopted Feb. 13, 2013, changed the title of Div. 2 from "Fire alarms" to "Emergency alarms". 
Cross reference- Fire prevention and protection, ch. 30. 

Sec. 22-51. - Purpose. 
    It is the purpose of this division to protect and promote the health, safety and general welfare of the residents of the city by reducing the number of avoidable alarms to emergency agencies. Avoidable alarms contribute to ineffective utilization of public safety manpower and equipment. In addition, avoidable alarms require emergency responses which may contribute to a high accident rate and delayed responses to genuine emergencies. This division seeks to ensure that police, ambulance and fire communication facilities will be available to dispatch fire, ambulance and police personnel for actual emergencies and to alleviate the nuisance of audible alarms to the community. Another purpose of this division is to provide the city with the names of responsible people to contact for activation of an alarm. This division is enforceable for the following structures: places of assembly, businesses, industry, institutions, mercantile, residential and storage. 
(Code 1966, § 15-52) 
Sec. 22-52. - Definitions. 
    The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this division, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this section, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning: 
    Alarm business means any individual, partnership, corporation or other entity engaging in the business of selling, leasing, maintaining, servicing, repairing, altering, replacing, moving or installing any alarm system. 
    Alarm system means a device or assembly of equipment which emits a signal that is: 
(1)  Intended to alert persons inside or outside a premises to the existence of a hazard or emergency; 
(2)  Intended to alert emergency agencies by automatically dialing an emergency agency; or 
(3)  Connected to a private answering point for the purpose of reporting such alarms to emergency agencies. 
    Alarm user means any person in control of any building, structure or facility wherein an alarm system is maintained, except when the alarm system is a proprietary system. 
    Automatic dialing device means a device that is interconnected to a telephone line and that is programmed to select a predetermined telephone number and transmit by voice message or code signal an emergency indicating a need for emergency response. 
    Avoidable alarm means the activation of an alarm system through mechanical failure, malfunction, improper installation, or the negligence of the owner, user, custodian or lessee of an alarm system or of his employees or agents or through any other cause, which through direct connection to an emergency agency or which through notification of an emergency agency by a private answering point or automatic dialing device or which through notification to an emergency agency by any other second party or means indicates that an emergency situation exists requiring an emergency response within the city when, in fact, an emergency situation does not exist. An avoidable alarm does not include alarms activated by violent conditions of nature, such as lightning, hurricanes, tornadoes, earthquakes, or any other similar cause beyond the control of the user of an alarm system. Activation of an alarm system under any circumstances in which the activator reasonably believes that an emergency exists is not an avoidable alarm. 
    Central station means a fire detection system that is under the control and guidance of an outside agency that specializes in watch services. The alarm, in addition to alerting building occupants, will register in the central watch station. The watch service will then notify the local fire department. 
    Control loop means a continuous loop of single conductor wire, on which municipal alarm boxes are installed. This control loop is similar to a telegraph loop, in that it carries an electrical impulse that is initiated by a municipal alarm box and sent to the central fire station. These wires may be buried under ground or may be aerial on telephone poles. 
    Emergency agency means any fire department, police department or other law enforcement agency, ambulance company, or other agency summoned to respond to an emergency situation; and the emergency communications center. 
    Local alarm system means a signaling system which, when activated, causes an audible signaling device to be activated inside the premises within which the system is installed. 
    Municipal or auxiliary system means a fire detection system that ties a local alarm system into the fire department system. It will transmit the alarm directly to the fire department at the same time that the occupants of the building are notified. 
    Primary trunk line means a telephone line serving an emergency agency or the department that is designated to receive emergency calls, to include, but not be limited to, the police and fire departments. 
    Private answering point means a business that offers the service of receiving emergency signals, of monitoring such signals, and of relaying them to an emergency agency. 
    Proprietary system means an alarm system sounding or recording alarm and supervisory signals at a control center located within the premises protected by the alarm, which is not intended to alert persons outside of the premises on which the alarm system is located of a possible hazard and not intended to alert an emergency agency; the control center being under the supervision of the proprietor of the protected premises. If a proprietary system includes a signal line connected directly or by means of an automatic dialing device to an emergency agency or to a private answering point or to a local alarm system, it, thereby, becomes an alarm system, as defined in this section. 
    Water flow alarm means a sounding device activated by water flow detector or alarm check valve and arranged to sound an alarm which will be audible in all living areas over background noise levels with all intervening doors closed.

However, all other sections of this division shall apply to such systems including the payment of authorized fees. 
(b)  The sections of this division may be waived by the chief of police in declared emergency situations for a period not to exceed the term of the declared emergency.

(2)  The address of the premises upon which the alarm system is or will be located. 
(3)  The type of alarm system for which the permit is sought.

Upon receipt of a properly executed application, an investigation of the facts on the permit application shall be conducted by the fire department for all fire alarm systems and by the police department for all intrusion/theft/robbery alarms. If the investigation reveals that the requirements of this section have been met and the applicant's system would not then be in violation of this section, the city shall issue an alarm user permit to the applicant. Alarm user permits shall not be transferable and shall be maintained on the premises where the alarm system is located. Copies of all issued permits shall be filed with both the police department and the fire department. 
(e)  Duration. 
(1)  Alarm system user permits extend indefinitely, until such time as the permit holder either changes his or her alarm system or discontinues the use thereof. 
(2)  All alarm system permit holders shall be required to notify the office of the city clerk of any changes to the application and the information contained therein in a prompt fashion. 
(f)  False alarms. If an emergency agency records two or more false alarms within a permit year for any alarm system: 
(1)  The fire chief, if a fire alarm system is involved, or the police chief, if an intrusion/theft/robbery alarm system is involved, shall notify the alarm user and the alarm business providing service or inspection to the user by certified mail of such fact and shall direct that the user submit a report to the appropriate chief within ten days of receipt of the notice describing actions taken or to be taken to discover and eliminate the cause of false alarms or why any such alarm should not be classified as an avoidable alarm. Such notice shall also inform the user that avoidable alarms, greater than two in number, will be subject to a user fee, as listed in the schedule of fees in appendix B to this Code, for each such avoidable alarm. Payment of such fees shall be upon renewal of an alarm system permit or within 30 days of notice of any other alarm user permit. 
(2)  If the alarm user submits a report as directed, the chief shall determine if the actions taken will prevent the occurrence of false alarms. If he or she determines that the action will prevent the occurrence of false alarms, he or she shall notify the alarm user and the relevant alarm business in writing that the permit will not be revoked at that time and that, if one more false alarm occurs within the permit year, the permit will be summarily revoked, subject to the procedure described in subsection (f)(3). The chief shall also notify the user of the number of alarms he or she has determined to be avoidable alarms and of the user's right to a hearing on the classification of the alarms, provided more than four alarms have been found. The user shall exercise such right by filing with the chief a written request for a hearing within ten days of the date of the chief's notice that he or she has determined the user to have incurred in excess of four avoidable alarms. 
(3)  If no report is submitted or if the chief determines that the actions taken or to be taken will not prevent the occurrence of false alarms, the chief shall give notice by certified mail to the user that the permit will be revoked without further notice on the tenth day after the date of the notice, providing that the user does not file, within that period, a written request for a hearing. The chief shall also include notice of the number of alarms he or she has determined to be avoidable alarms, of the user's right to a hearing on the classification of alarms, provided that more than four have been found, and the manner of requesting such, as provided in this subsection. 
(4)  If a hearing is requested, written notice of the time and place of the hearing shall be served on the user by the appropriate chief by certified mail at least ten days prior to the date set for the hearing, which date shall not be more than 21 or less than ten days after the filing of the request for hearing. 
(5)  The hearing shall be before the chief of police or his or her designee, the corporation counsel or his or her designee, and the president of the common council. The alarm user shall have the right to present written and oral evidence, subject to the right of cross examination. If the committee determines that four or more false alarms have occurred in a permit year and that the user has not taken actions which will prevent the occurrence of false alarms, the committee shall issue written findings to that effect and an order revoking the user's permit. If the user has presented the issue by the filing of the required written request, the committee shall also determine the number of avoidable alarms which have occurred during the permit year and the amount of the additional avoidable alarm fee then accrued. Judicial review of the determinations of the committee may be had only pursuant to article 78 of the New York State Civil Practice Law and Rules. 
(6)  An alarm user shall immediately discontinue use of the alarm system upon being notified by certified mail of the revocation of a permit pursuant to subsection (f)(2), (3) or (5). 
(7)  An alarm user whose permit is revoked may reinstate the permit by submission of proof that modifications have been made to the alarm system to reduce the number of avoidable alarms, and by payment of an excessive use fee, which is listed in the schedule of fees in appendix B to this Code, together with the fees for the accrued number of avoidable alarms in excess of four. If another avoidable alarm occurs during the life of the permit, the permit shall be subject to summary revocation. In such a case, the revocation shall be effective on the third day following the mailing, by certified mail, of a notice of revocation by the fire chief or police chief, as appropriate.

Secs. 24-61-24-74. - Reserved. 
ARTICLE II. - EMPIRE ZONE DEVELOPMENT PLAN 

Sec. 24-75. - Overview. 
    The Rome Empire Zone's Development Plan (ZDP) complements the efforts of the city, the Rome Industrial Development Corporation (RIDC), the Rome Main Streets Initiative, Mohawk Valley Economic Development Growth Enterprises Corporation (MVEDGE), the Oneida County Industrial Development Agency (OCIDA) and the Griffiss Local Development Corporation (GLDC). These multiple stakeholders offer and/or coordinate a myriad of economic development tools within the Rome Empire Zone's three targeted areas, the West Rome Industrial Park (WRIP), the city's central business district (CBD), and the Griffiss Business & Technology Park (GBTP). 
    Strategic analyses. 
    City of Rome Comprehensive Master Plan (2004) This document, which is located at http://www.romenewyork.com/planning.html, was the result of nearly two years of work by municipal officials, local business owners, residents, and outside consultants to craft strategy for planned investments in human, technological, educational, financial and physical infrastructure with the goals of achieving increasing employment, economic opportunity, and quality job creation. It represents a broad modernization of Rome's municipal building codes and zoning ordinances, downtown infrastructure and community social amenities in order to create "neighborhoods of choice", which contain mixed-income families, economic and cultural diversity, sound physical structures, a clean and attractive environment and a well-maintained infrastructure. 
The service sector, including retail sales, professional, technical, and financial services have overtaken manufacturing as the core of New York State's regional economy. Commercial globalization has meant that many Rome businesses may expand their trade from local and regional to national and international clients. 
The comprehensive master plan includes three components: 1) a community profile, 2) an action plan, and 3) an updated city zoning ordinance, which can be found at http://www.rome-ny.gov/organization.asp?orgid=6. The action plan identified tax base enhancement, development of a stronger commercial center, and an expansion of commercial and retail uses in general. Downtown revitalization and waterfront development were identified as high priorities for the city as well as a clearer vision for the continuing development of the GBTP, especially after the relocation of the Oneida County Airport by the end of 2006. Seven specific goals were established to facilitate the action plan. They are: 
 Stable tax base from commercial, employment and industrial sectors; 
 Business friendly community through implementation of a technology-oriented economic development strategy; 
 Pursuit of a forward-looking workforce strategy based upon local employment in growing sectors of technology-based businesses, education, healthcare, and professional services; 
 Quality housing of choice for residents of all ages and backgrounds; 
 Development of a 21st century municipal infrastructure; 
 Promoting an atmosphere for quality recreation, health care and arts/cultural organizations; 
 Combining rich urban amenities to sustain rising property values. 
    Downtown assessment by the National Trust for Historic Preservation's National Main Street Center (2002)-City of Rome Main Street Initiative. 
In 2002, the National Trust for Historic Preservation's Main Street Center completed the downtown assessment that provided observations, recommendations and target areas for business development in Rome's downtown commercial corridors. At the same time, Rome was designated one of 12 state pilot "quality communities". Using $75,000.00 in quality communities program funding, Rome received technical assistance from the Main Street Center to initiate a Main Streets program complete with a board of directors and a paid coordinator. The Main Streets program offers a strategy for downtown renewal, focusing on four main points to create sustainable urban development: design; organization; promotion; economic restructuring. The approach's self-help process involves building partnerships and utilizing existing assets to institute effective change. The Rome EZ [empire zone] focuses on the economic restructuring component of this strategy and encompasses much of the downtown commercial corridors designated under the Main Streets program. 
The trust's National Main Streets program, which is found at http://www.mainstreet.org/content.aspx?page=3&section=2, encompasses a four-point approach for development, with local committees in 1) organization, 2) promotion, 3) design, and 4) economic restructuring. According to the Main Streets Center, a city's central business district often accounts for as much as 30 percent of the city's jobs and 40 percent of its tax base. The Main Streets program offers a strategy for downtown renewal, focusing on four main points to create sustainable urban development: design; organization; promotion; economic restructuring. The approach's self-help process involves building partnerships and utilizing existing assets to institute effective change. RIDC will use empire zone programs to focus on the economic restructuring component of this strategy and offer reduced investment thresholds to stimulate business development in the downtown commercial corridors contained within the Rome EZ [empire zone]. 
    City urban design plan and downtown design guidelines (2002). During 2005-2006, the city partnered with the New York State Department of Transportation and the Department of State's Division of Coastal Resources to complete Rome's first urban design plan and downtown design guidelines in an effort to accomplish the following goals in Rome's three downtown commercial corridors (North-South James St., East-West Dominick St., East-West Erie Blvd.) in order to establish a beautiful pedestrian-friendly environment: 
 Spur commercial business investment in the downtown corridors 
 Build on recent economic and community development successes 
 Capture tourism/recreation from the Fort Stanwix National Monument and the Erie Canal 
 Work with existing groups in all areas of development 
 Engage public participation in all areas of development 
    Overall economic development strategy for the Oneida-Herkimer County Region, prepared by the firm of Deloitte & Touche Fantus Consulting (1997). This study remains the cornerstone of Mohawk Valley EDGE's (Economic Development Growth Enterprises Corporation) economic development plan for Oneida and Herkimer county. This document cited the importance of the city in assisting targeted businesses to locate at the GBTP and recommended concurrent development actions in the following six targeted areas: 
 Growing area businesses; 
 Nurturing high-tech for the future; 
 Education and labor force development; 
 Business attraction; 
 Tourism and the arts 
The financial incentives offered by the Rome Empire Zone are critical components of these development strategies and help encourage commercial development and revitalization of economically depressed historic business districts as well as the traditional industrial and commercial growth centers at the WRIP and the GBTP. Rome's Empire Zone conforms to criteria contained in General Municipal Law, § 958. 
(L.L. No. 1 of 2007(§ I), 1-10-07) 
Sec. 24-76. - Goals and strategies. 
    Within the city, RIDC undertakes many of the same economic development issues that Mohawk Valley EDGE oversees and coordinates in Oneida and Herkimer Counties. RIDC, however, not only assists manufacturers, but also service, professional, and retail firms within the city. In light of these realities, the economic development goals of the Rome Empire Zone are: 
    Goal #1: Revitalize aging and/or vacant industrial/manufacturing sites with new light industrial, manufacturing, and service/professional firms; provide incentives for existing manufacturing and service/professional firms for expansion and growth (Primarily areas #1 and 2-WRIP and CBD) 
Development strategies specific to this goal (annually reviewed). 
 Identify, develop, and strengthen strategic industry clusters; 
 Assist with attraction of firms and primary supply chain firms within those strategic industry clusters to build commercial infrastructure; 
 Work with collaborators to identify and target new businesses which will add significant job creation and capital investment to enhance the zone. 
Performance measures specific to this goal. 
 Provide technical assistance for new and existing manufacturers undergoing job creation and business expansion/location projects; 
 Coordinate redevelopment efforts with the city; 
 Collaborate to acquire new public and private financing streams for economic redevelopment efforts. 
    Goal #2: Nurture and enhance new and existing high technology firms; encourage emerging technologies having "intellectual" rather than physical production (Primarily area #3-GBTP). 
Development strategies specific to this goal (annually reviewed). 
 Transfer acreage from the Oneida County Empire Zone at the GBTP to maximize empire zone incentives for new manufacturing and industrial sites throughout Oneida County;  Collaborate with all public and private stakeholders in building relationships with the AFRL and the Griffiss Institute for high-tech business development. 
Performance measures specific to this goal. 
 Collaborate with economic development stakeholders for business attraction and retention; 
 Conduct business visitations as proactive strategies for changing economic and business development needs. 
    Goal #3: Assist redevelopment of vibrant downtown commercial corridors with retail and commercial firms tailored to enhance consumer traffic, cultural appreciation, tourism, and recreational activity (Primarily area #2-CBD) 
Development strategies specific to this goal (annually reviewed). 
 Provide zone capital credits to qualifying community development and child care projects; 
 Collaborate with all public/private entities to fill vacant commercial space on downtown corridors; 
 Use the Main Streets urban design plan for guidance on commercial uses and locations. 
Performance measures specific to this goal. 
 Collaborate with the Main Streets Alliance to tailor job creation and capital investment thresholds for small retail and commercial development in targeted downtown corridors; 
 Collaborate with the REACH Center to encourage and locate entrepreneurial projects. 
General development strategies for all areas (strategically reviewed or three-year interval). 
 Maximize highest economic value of empire zone property depending on type of applicant firm, location, facility, and existing infrastructure. New business/construction will be based on best use and reuse potential; 
 Utilize local academic institutions to develop targeted workforce development programs for retraining displaced workers and provide new and expanding businesses with a technically skilled workforce; 
 Provide technical assistance, outreach, and marketing activities/materials to maximize program awareness and access to incentives by new and existing certified firms. 
General performance measures 
 Certify new commercial firms; provide assistance with forms and contacts/referrals; 
 Provide accessibility to and marketing of program services and incentives; 
 Provide referrals for appropriate financial and location assistance services; 
 Refer to SBDC and/or SCORE for technical assistance with business planning; 
 Collaborate with other local and regional economic development organizations for regional development. 
    These strategies are designed to maximize the financial incentives offered to qualifying as well as currently certified businesses through the New York State Empire Zones program; business loan and grant programs, or other nonfinancial technical assistance programs offered by, but not limited to, the City, the Rome Main Streets Alliance, Working Solutions, Mohawk Valley Community College (MVCC), RIDC, and the Oneida County Industrial Development Agency (OCIDA) further enhance the incentive package. Specific qualifications for these programs are often unique, but the geographical boundaries of the Rome EZ have been revised to ensure maximum value for each included business as well as provide attractive incentives for new business locations within its boundaries. As a result, Rome's new and existing businesses can often utilize multiple public financial incentive and technical assistance programs in addition to accessing traditional commercial financing from eight local financial institutions. 
    The Rome EZ markets itself through site visits, face-to-face counseling, e-mail or telephone contact as well as provides informational forums, presentations, and press releases for public consumption. Further, the Rome EZ has made a concerted effort to educate professional business organizations such [as] accountants, attorneys, developers, and real estate brokers on the benefits of EZ certification. RIDC's website, www.romeny.org, contains information on the Rome EZ that can be used by interested parties from outside the area. This site is closely linked to the city's official website, www.rome-ny.gov, and the Rome Area Chamber of Commerce's site, www.romechamber.com. 
    Expected outcomes. Rome Empire Zone incentives will function as a catalyst for qualifying businesses to locate and expand within each separate and contiguous area; the additional payroll generated by job creation at these zone-certified businesses provides additional discretionary income toward boosting retail and commercial sales within the area. RIDC's goal is to assist the city and the Main Streets Alliance with developing an appropriate mix of retail and commercial businesses to multiply the level of discretionary spending and capital turnover through the use of grants, loans, and property tax forgiveness. 
The Rome EZ also collaborates with MV EDGE, RIDC, and the city toward achieving full build-out of the GBTP as well as maintain the vibrancy of the WRIP by providing incentives such as loans, property tax abatements, or creative leasing arrangements to maintain a firm's longterm viability. RIDC is also the city's representative to the Regional Economic Development Planning Organization and works very closely with that organization on economic development projects, loans, and economic development grant applications. 
(L.L. No. 1 of 2007(§ II), 1-10-07) 
Sec. 24-77. - Target areas/infrastructure development. 
    The Rome Empire Zone has designated 1,279.9 acres of its allotted two square miles, or 1,280 acres, as outlined in attachment 1. The mapping goals are to include as much previously designated EZ acreage as possible as well as the necessary natural features (i.e. parts of the Mohawk River and New York State Barge Canal) and transportation infrastructure to clearly identify the Rome EZ's three separate and internally-contiguous areas as mandated under the investment zone format of the empire zones program. 
    Two United States Census tracts within the city were determined to be eligible under General Municipal Law, § 958(a). Those requirements stipulate that eligible U.S. Census tracts must contain: 1) a minimum of 2,000 inhabitants, and 2) a minimum poverty rate of 20 percent, and 3) a minimum unemployment rate of 8.867 percent. The U.S. Census tracts within the city that meet these requirements are #360650223 and #360650225. Five contiguous U.S. Census tracts which contain designated Rome Empire Zone acreage are tracts #360650218, #360650219, #360650220, #360650226, and #360650228. One other U.S. Census tract, #360650227.02, contains designated Rome Empire Zone acreage but is neither eligible nor contiguous to either of the two eligible U.S. Census tracts within the city. 
    Area #1: West Rome Industrial Park (105.0 acres)-Attachment 2. This contiguous area has been restructured to include acreage deemed desirable for light manufacturing development and reduced by acreage anticipated for future retail development along the Rome-Taberg (New York State Rte. 69) corridor. Retail development will be enhanced by the recently-completed reconstruction of the Rte. 49/Rte. 46 intersection immediately to the east of this area. Portions of Success Drive were added in this area for continuity and one retail business was grandfathered, due to its inclusion within the Rte. 46/49/69 retail corridor as well as the impracticality of using excessive acreage for inclusion. Previously certified mixed commercial acreage along the Rte. 46/49/69-Erie Boulevard West corridor has been removed from the Rome EZ due to their probable future retail development. Another property, the Erie Canal Village (and New York State Bike Trail) was removed due to lack of development and the need for acreage to cover higher impact development elsewhere. 
Short-term development goals for this area are to maintain full commercial occupancy by providing incentives for firms entering this area through business acquisition or buyout and to assist existing firms looking for expansion capital or other nonfinancial forms of technical assistance. A major longterm concern is that the Rite-Aid distribution center, the largest individual firm located in area #1, may relocate. If this relocation occurs, the longterm goal of the Rome EZ will be to collaborate toward the redevelopment of the vacant 275,000 square-foot facility for future light industrial or manufacturing uses. 
    Area #2: Central Business District (605.8 acres)-Attachment 3. This contiguous area includes the downtown portions of Erie Boulevard (east and west), Dominick Street (east and west), and James Street (north and south). Numerous retail businesses along these thoroughfares were either deleted or grandfathered in mixed commercial/residential zones for the sake of conserving acreage as well as conforming to the strategic development plans of the city. The Rome EZ is working closely with the Main Streets program to assist downtown revitalization and enhance the individuality of each Main Street business corridor. This is being accomplished not only through extending EZ incentives to a limited number of new retail establishments, but also by including virtually all the main corridor store frontage in the revised Zone to lend support to Main Street grant funding efforts. 
Significant acreage was retained in the Erie Canalfront, former General Cable, and East Dominick Street areas to accommodate potential recreational/tourism and/or light industrial development. The city is attempting to build a municipal sports complex-park near the city's Erie Canal waterfront, which will stimulate recreational activity as well as spur further economic development along the East Dominick Street corridor. The concept for an East Rome Industrial Park is also still under consideration, depending upon the final location outcome of the sports complex and any other tourism-related Erie Canalfront development. 
The Rome EZ is working with the Rome Community Brownfields Restoration Corporation (RCBRC) to assist with the redevelopment of the former Rome Cable site, which is also located within the CBD. Three zone-certified businesses currently occupy about one-fourth of the facility; efforts are ongoing to further renovate the facility and entice additional tenants. 
Acreage was added to cross the Erie Canal in order to join existing certified businesses on Martin Street and Greenfield Road on the south side of the canal with the majority of the CBD, which is on the north side of the canal. Additional acreage was also added; there is potential for further industrial and/or commercial development on two open sites as well as in certain existing vacant or partially-occupied buildings. 
Businesses committed to renovating or rehabilitating vacant manufacturing and retail sites within the CBD will be given high priority for certification, especially if those businesses intend to locate within specific targeted commercial corridors. Real estate development projects will also be considered for certification, but the project must clearly and directly result in job creation or building/land reuse or rehabilitation. Businesses targeted for inclusion in the CBD are small retail, service, or professional businesses as well as those that provide supply chain services for industrial or manufacturing businesses. These types of businesses may be traded or nontraded, though traded firms with significant job creation are ideal. The B/C ratio matrix provides for a two-point reduction in the threshold necessary for certification of traded commercial/professional firms to recognize the wealth that these firms bring to Rome. 
Empire zone capital credits have been approved for the REACH Center, a facility designed to incubate and encourage entrepreneurial arts, cultural, and historical enterprises, [and] will also help foster increased tourism and consumer traffic in the CBD. Businesses locating within this facility may be included for certification based upon their unique cultural niche and tourism value. 
The Rome EZ has also provided a letter of support to the New York State Canal Corporation for an Erie Canal Greenway Grant, which supports the Rome EZ's goal to increase tourism and the arts within its boundaries. Another result of obtaining this grant would be to help foster a culturally vibrant community, which is becoming an increasing effective recruitment tool for economic development. RCBRC, OCIDA, and Rome Up and Running have also collaborated with the city to apply for $5,000,000.00 in funding under the first round of proposals for the RestoreNY program; specific components of that proposal impacting the Rome EZ concern funding for: 1) demolition of approximately 240,000 square feet of the former Rome Cable site, 2) assist with renovation of the REACH Center, 3) renovate commercial property on 420 N James St., and 4) remove a 6.7-acre concrete pad. Each of these projects will represent a significant enhancement within the CBD for commercial development. 
Along with the city, the Rome Main Streets Alliance is an integral stakeholder in the redevelopment of the CBD. The Rome EZ will collaborate in whatever way possible to facilitate redevelopment in the designated Main Street corridors. The current boundaries of the Rome EZ have been drawn to accommodate sites along North James Street, which is well on the way toward economic rejuvenation. The potential for EZ benefits in this area has already been used to leverage grant funding leading to the redevelopment of infrastructure as well as building redevelopment. 
Short-term Rome EZ goals for this area are to: 1) continue with the redevelopment of the former Rome Cable facility complex through infusion of additional capital from grants, legislative member items, as well as direct capital investment from additional manufacturing tenants, 2) certify more professional, service or retail businesses in downtown Main Streets targeted commercial corridors that will reoccupy currently vacant buildings as well as complement the developing commercial flavor of the immediate neighborhood, and 3) work with the city toward redevelopment of the historic canalfront district as well as the manufacturing sites surrounding the vacant General Cable complex. Each of these goals involves direct collaboration with various local public and/or private agencies to facilitate technical assistance and provide access to incentives. 
Long-term redevelopment goals for the CBD will entail: 1) NYS Brownfield program determination and subsequent redevelopment of the General Cable complex, perhaps through the auspices of RCBRC, which has been established to administer such projects, 2) further collaboration with the Main Street Alliance and the REACH Center, and 3) maintain transparency with the city's comprehensive action plan. Potential public funding sources for reaching these goals may be attained through the RestoreNY program, other New York State or local grant programs and/or the city; these sources can be used to leverage additional private investment and commercial tenants. Each of these strategic investment goals involve indirect Rome EZ support for funding and business attraction/development; the Rome EZ is positioned to become a direct participant once strategic initiatives become specific projects. 
    Area #3: Griffiss Business & Technology Park (569.1 acres)-;Attachment 4. Major changes in acreage were made to this area, with 156.1 acres. added in the aviation gateway and Enterprise Way areas (attachment 5). This acreage transfer was made not only to consolidate the Rome EZ for continuity, but also to allow the Oneida County EZ to certify other high value industrial and manufacturing sites within Oneida County. The new Oneida County Empire Zone is retaining 86.6 acres of previously-certified EZ land in the GBTP as one of their seven separate areas. The five existing EZ-certified businesses transferred to the Rome EZ will be able to access enhanced investment zone benefits for the remainder of their benefit periods. The Rome EZ will also be able to offer investment zone incentives to the open development sites contained in this parcel to further enhance the full commercial occupancy of the GBTP. 
The Rome EZ also added acreage near the Floyd Avenue gate of the GBTP as well as acreage in the Enterprise Way, Dart Circle, and Skyline Summit areas (attachment 5) of the park. These additions reflect further location refinement of developable sites as well as an incorporation of the development plans of the Griffiss Local Development Corporation, which is entrusted with the actual development of the entire park acreage and existing facilities. 
Firms targeted for inclusion in this area will be primarily traded businesses that will provide stable and high paying jobs; complement existing industry clusters in cybersecurity, U.S. Defense Department and Homeland Security contracts, aviation, and finance/accounting; enhance growth in the city's existing business infrastructure; or entice complementary manufacturers, technology, or professional/commercial relocation or startup firms. The areas of the park having the most short-term potential for growth are the Skyline Summit and Campus Green areas; utilities and infrastructure in the Skyline Summit area have recently been completed and there is significant ongoing construction of class A office space in the campus green area. 
Short- and longterm goals for the GBTP are for the Rome EZ to work with existing firms in order that they remain competitive as well as assist new firms locate in the park as a result of any business turnover of current commercial occupants. Primary development should occur with manufacturing or service/professional firms in the strategic high technology industry cluster, primarily firms involved with information technology and security, cybersecurity, aeronautics, or other related areas. Other manufacturers may be targeted for the GBTP based upon synergies with local infrastructure and transportation logistics. 
Infrastructure development. The city has benefited from numerous New York State Department of Transportation projects; the main bridges connecting the GBTP with Black River Boulevard (Chestnut Street) and with the Utica-Rome Expressway (Rte. 825-the Griffiss Parkway) have been rebuilt and strengthened to accommodate heavier truck traffic and additional vehicle traffic. The Utica-Rome Expressway also represents a recent upgrade to the transportation system surrounding the GBTP in that a direct, limited access east/west route now exists for eastbound traffic from Rome to Utica and exit 31 on the New York State Thruway. Exits 32 (Westmoreland) and 33 (Verona) also are easily reached within ten minutes from downtown Rome. Rome is also less than 30 minutes from Syracuse, which provides access to Interstate Route 81, a major north/south artery to Canada or to U.S. Appalachian states. 
The West Rome Industrial Park (Area #1) as well as the Rte. 69-Erie Boulevard West commercial/retail corridor will benefit from the recent widening and adjustment of the thoroughfare which include additional traffic lanes, turn lanes, new sidewalks and simplified signals/intersections. These improvements were made to speed up traffic flow as well as accommodate longer and heavier truck traffic out of the West Rome Industrial Park as well as spur easier access to the city's Erie Boulevard retail corridor and downtown business district. The Oneida County Airport will be moved to the GBTP by the end of 2006, along with the closing and subsequent re-development of the former airport site (Town of Whitestown) into a business park to be included within the Oneida County Empire Zone. This relocation will not only spur cargo, freight, and further commercial development at the Park, but will also hasten the development of complimentary service, hospitality and professional businesses within the City of Rome. 
The new Rome Free Academy, which serves as the public high school of the city as well as portions of the towns of Lee, Western, Annsville, and Verona, has been completed at the GBTP. This new facility has technological state-of-the-art classrooms as well as spacious new facilities to house over 1,800 students in grades nine through 12. The Skyline Summit area of the GBTP (across the Griffiss Parkway from RFA) will continue to be upgraded for development with the addition in 2006 of water, sewer and electric infrastructure to support a mid-size business park as well as a hospitality center in anticipation of the relocation of the Oneida County Airport. 
The Marinus-Willet Center, completed in 2005, is located next to the Fort Stanwix National Monument and is the focal point of local tourism by providing not only historical exhibits depicting the Rome area's importance to the development of Central New York, the Erie Canal, and the American Revolution, but also providing information concerning Rome current tourist and recreational attractions. 
Recent NYS DOT improvements to the Erie Boulevard West corridor and the Dominick Street intersection on that corridor have been completed; these improvement will aid commercial traffic as well as increased consumer flow. Currently, a project is under way to rebuild the Floyd Avenue corridor leading to the GBTP; when completed, all current access points to the GBTP will be updated for increased traffic loads and volume. Future NYS DOT plans call for the improvement of the James Street-Erie Boulevard intersection next to the Marinus-Willet Center in order to bring the intersection to one level and to streamline traffic patterns between Erie and Black River Boulevards as well as to make the Dominick Street connection (between East and West) more accessible. Black River Boulevard is also slated for future renovation as well as construction of a fourth access road to the GBTP. 
    Previously designated acreage/grandfathered firms. Every effort was made to include as many previously-certified businesses as possible, but a significant number of businesses were grandfathered (31 businesses). Businesses were grandfathered according to their specific location in relation to their nearest contiguous area and the current zoning ordinance in each business' immediate area. These two factors are deemed of greatest influence to determine the acreage necessary to include an outlying business and the probability that there may be further EZ-eligible economic expansion in the immediate area. 
A significant amount of acreage was removed by the deletion of Erie Canal Village, where little appreciable capital investment/job creation has been made or is anticipated in the near future. Acreage was also deleted from the southwest corner of the former Rome Cable site due to its environmental and drainage problems that preclude viable economic development. 
    Regionally significant projects. The Rome ZAB will consider applications from businesses outside the Rome Empire Zone boundaries as regionally significant projects (RSPs) under General Municipal Law, § 957(d). After amending the zone boundaries to accommodate the project location, certification of the firm undertaking the project will contain a cost benefit analysis reflecting the lowest applicable benefit/cost ratio from the certification threshold matrix. 
A small number of specific sites outside of the Rome Empire Zone (but within the city) are being considered for locating regionally significant projects. Priority is being given toward making those areas "shovel-ready" sites through the installation of appropriate utilities, securing access to major thoroughfares, and providing clean environmental phase I studies. These areas were not included in the Rome EZ due to mapping constraints or by an issue involving timely utility or infrastructure improvement(s) that would limit the short-term availability of a site for commercial development; none of these sites warranted inclusion as a fourth contiguous area for this second reason. 
(L.L. No. 1 of 2007(§ III), 1-10-07) 
Sec. 24-78. - Target industries/businesses. 
    Historically, the wire and metal manufacturing industries have thrived in the Rome area. Unfortunately, many old, outdated and abandoned manufacturing sites have resulted in the wake of business restructurings in these industries with two of the largest involving General Cable and Rome Cable Corporations. Rome EZ incentives have helped turn a portion of these abandoned sites into opportunities for new businesses such as PAR Government Systems, Rome Research Corporation, and Owl Wire & Cable, Inc. to begin new research and development/manufacturing operations. Additionally, New York State DEC brownfields designation has been received for the Rome Cable site, with environmental studies having been completed and partial remediation already under way. The Rome Community Brownfields Restoration Corporation (RCBRC) was formed to oversee these projects, with Rome Industrial Development Corporation (RIDC), the administrative entity of the Rome EZ, also providing the same services for RCBRC. 
    Other manufacturing businesses that could potentially benefit from the use of Rome's existing brownfield sites are being researched and contacted, with a number of firms currently negotiating terms for relocation to Rome. With almost 300,000 square feet of available manufacturing/distribution/office space still remaining vacant at the former Rome Cable facility, the city, RIDC, and RCBRC continue to treat redevelopment of this site with the highest priority. 
    The vacant General Cable site, parts of Revere Copper Products, Inc. (south of East Dominick Street and the Erie Canalfront district) are other high-priority areas for light industrial, manufacturing, and commercial development. The Rome EZ has included these areas in order to work with either RCBRC and/or the city to increase the marketability of existing facilities capable of renovation as well as entice entrepreneurs with innovative development plans. It is also anticipated the New York State Brownfields designation will eventually be attained for many of the abandoned industrial sites that are not salvageable and require environmental remediation. 
    Strategic industry clusters. The Rome EZ will target traded firms, which are considered traded if they market 60 percent or more of their products and/or services beyond the immediate geographical area. Applicant firms will meet this threshold for certification if they market 60 percent or more of their goods/services at the time of application or will market 60 percent or more of their goods/services within two years of certification outside of the city. 
The ZAB concurs with the analysis of strategic industry clusters that was done by Mohawk Valley EDGE as part of their 2004 Annual Business Development Plan for Oneida County; the results are germane to Rome and especially to the GBTP. The plan was also developed in conjunction with the Metropolitan Development Authority (MDA) from information included in their Essential New York Initiative (2004) from information compiled by the consulting firm of Cushman & Wakefield, Inc. as contained in their Investment Attraction Campaign Targeting New Jersey-Based Companies (2004). 
From these documents, the ZAB has concurred with the listing of primary and secondary strategic industry clusters as: 
 Finance and insurance back-office operations; 
 Wire and metals manufacturing; 
 Data security/software/homeland security; 
a.  Instrument manufacturing; 
b.  Electronic component manufacturing; 
c.  Telecom equipment manufacturing. 
 Distribution and logistics; 
 Aviation-related services; 
 Nanotechnology. 
Strategic industries can mean those that are at risk for leaving the city due to competitive pressures within their respective industries or favorable business climates in other locations. All types of NYS manufacturers are especially stressed due to labor, tax, and capital investment issues in New York State. The ZAB is committed to retain as much of our existing manufacturing base as possible and will also target all existing manufacturers located within the Rome EZ in order to retain jobs and commercial infrastructure. Likewise, the vacant and underutilized manufacturing infrastructure that still exists in the downtown areas will remain targeted for manufacturing redevelopment, pursuant to the city's comprehensive action plan. 
The CBD is home to the two largest brownfield areas in Rome; parts of the former Rome Cable Co. complex is currently under redevelopment by RCBRC, while a small portion of the former General Cable complex is owned by the city. Manufacturers in the wire and/or metal industries are obvious choices for targeted firms, but any form of manufacturing will be targeted, so long as the logistical and environmental challenges of the site are either remediated or acceptable to the firm. The Rome EZ is collaborating with RCBRC, RIDC, Mohawk Valley EDGE, OCIDA, and the city to facilitate redevelopment of these sites with new manufacturing or other community development projects. 
At the GBTP, the Rome EZ will target manufacturing and traded service/professional firms in the Skyline Summit and Dart Circle areas where there are now 21 greenfield sites; firms in the information technology, cybersecurity, and back-office services are anticipated as the primary tenants/owners of those sites. By early 2007, the GBTP will house the Griffiss Airpark, which will further spur aviation-related businesses as well as spur the location/relocation of additional business operational hubs that are dependent upon convenient air transport. 
Other labor-intensive firms, such as back office operations and call centers, rely on an available and technically skilled workforce; these types of firms can be at risk due to high labor overhead costs in New York State. The ZAB considers expansion and diversification of educational opportunities paramount to increasing the skill level of Rome's workforce, which will help keep and attract labor intensive firms in the city. Collaborations among various workforce development programs and local academia must be strengthened; the ZAB is working with local firms to help facilitate new training programs and services for Rome's existing commercial and industrial infrastructure. 
    Targeted businesses. In the WRIP, the ZAB has targeted the sustainability and viability of each existing business and to encourage in whatever way it can, the maintenance or expansion of employment at those businesses. The Rome EZ's major collaborator is RIDC due to their ownership of three significant shell buildings and their involvement in the future relocation of the Rite Aid distribution center, RIDC is best able to facilitate future redevelopment. As firms may "turn over" from time to time, the Rome EZ will collaborate to target compatible manufacturing and traded service/professional firms to replace them. 
The ZAB will target service/professional and retail businesses within the downtown commercial corridors of the CBD. Those firms will be expected to fill existing market voids, create new market niches, redevelop vacant facilities within distressed and/or underserved areas, support expanded tourism and recreational activities, or provide services within the supply chain of existing manufacturers. 
Targeted retail categories identified through demographic data supplied by Claritas are: 1) Entertainment- or tourism-related, 2) Food/beverage establishments (nonrestaurant and nonalcoholic), 3) Household-related services and supplies, and 4) personal-care businesses. 
Due to the existing building infrastructure, small owner-operated niche or boutique-style retail businesses as well as ethnic cafes, artisan shops, and entertainment venues can fulfill the commercial, cultural, and tourism goals of the Rome EZ. Firms locating in the GBTP will be targeted through the collaboration of Mohawk Valley EDGE, GLDC, OCIDA, and the Rome EZ. Those firms may fit any of the strategic industry clusters, with specific firms being targeted primarily at the discretion of the Rome EZ's collaborative partners. 
Tourism-based or healthcare-support service firms may also be targeted within the GBTP. The applicant firm must be appropriately zoned for the area, classified as either tourism-based or healthcare-support services, fill a specific community need within the city, and meet or exceed all three quantitative certification thresholds as established by the ZAB. 
(L.L. No. 1 of 2007(§ IV), 1-10-07) 
Sec. 24-79. - Business development assistance and zone administration. 
    The city passed a resolution on November 24, 1998, authorizing RIDC to administer the Rome Empire Zone; further, RIDC was authorized to enter into annual contracts with the state for administrative funding allocations for their services. The current RIDC deputy director serves as the Rome Empire Zone Coordinator; as the Rome Empire Zone Coordinator, this individual is managed by the Rome ZAB, but, in all other duties, is supervised by the Executive Director of RIDC. 
    Foreign trade zones. The West Rome Industrial Park (area #1) and the Griffiss Business and Technology Park (area #3) are foreign trade zones, which are licensed by the foreign trade zone board to offer special customs procedures. These procedures allow/expedite domestic activity involving foreign items to take place prior to any formal Customs entry requirements. Duty-free treatment is accorded items which are subsequently exported and duty payment is deferred on items sold domestically, which helps "even the playing field" between foreign and domestic producers in competitive markets. 
    Oneida County Industrial Development Agency. The OCIDA provides taxable and tax-exempt financing options for eligible bond projects located within Oneida County, with preference given to those located within county empire zones. The IDA bonding capabilities are and will be presented to empire zone businesses as a financing mechanism. Manufacturing and industrial applicants are generally eligible for OCIDA assistance, while retail and commercial applicants often do not meet the eligibility criteria. 
Local tax incentives available through OCIDA to eligible businesses located within the Rome Empire Zone include: 
 PILOT (payment-in-lieu-of-taxes) agreements; 
 TIF (tax increment financing) agreements; 
 State sales and use tax exemptions; 
 Mortgage tax exemption. 
    Mohawk Valley Economic Development District. Incentives are available to qualifying businesses through the US SBA 504 loan program; MVEDD often works in concert with RIDC to provide gap or working capital financing to complete a loan package where conventional commercial lenders fall short in meeting clients' needs. Often a US SBA 7(a) program loan guarantee is used to further offset the primary lender's risk exposure. 
    Mohawk Valley Economic Development Growth Enterprises. MV EDGE offers three loan programs to assist new and expanding manufacturing, industrial, wholesale, technology, service (non-professional), and nonretail businesses. They are: 
Job development loan fund. Must support job growth; up to 35 percent of total project costs with loan ranging between $25,000.00 to $250,000.00; interest rate is fixed at 85 percent of the U.S. prime interest rate at closing; and 
Micro-enterprise assistance program. Must create job opportunities for low- and moderate-income individuals; can provide gap financing; up to 40 percent of total project costs; loans range from $2,500.00 to $25,000.00; funds provided in addition to job development program funding; and 
Rural business and agri-business assistance program. Provides financing outside of traditional commercial channels; must meet all guidelines of HUD for the small cities program; up to 40 percent of total project costs; loans range from $5,000.00 to $50,000.00. 
    City of Rome. The city offers a 485-b real property tax abatement program, which exempts 50 percent of real property taxes of eligible businesses in the first year of the program, with such exemption decreasing by five percent annual increments for the remaining nine years of eligibility until full taxable value is reached. Tax exemptions under this program are granted only upon application by the owner to the local tax assessor within one year of the date of completion of construction or improvements to the real property. This program is available for eligible applicants on the assessed value of real property which is constructed, altered, or improved for the purpose of commercial, business, or industrial activity. These tax exemptions are available on county, city, town, and school district taxes. Exemptions are granted during the ten-year period so long as all eligibility requirements are met by the applicant. 
    The city has two funding programs available for new and expanding businesses. 
    Facade improvement program. Provides financial and technical design assistance to businesses and property owners in targeted business district areas for improvements to the exterior of their buildings. Depending on the location of the property, applicants could be eligible for up to 90 percent of the project cost to a maximum award of $25,000.00. 
    Rome Entrepreneur Assistance Program (REAP). The REAP program, formerly known as the job addition/retention (JAR) program, assists businesses in getting established or expanding. 
  REAP downtown. Project must locate or expand a microenterprise in the Main Streets program target area, providing a service or creating a job in the target area. Approved projects are eligible for up to 75 percent reimbursement of the project cost, with a maximum of $5,000.00. 
  REAP industrial/manufacturing. Project must locate or expand an industrial or manufacturing business within an appropriately zoned area in the city, and create a job. Approved projects are eligible for up to 25 percent reimbursement of the project cost, with a maximum of $10,000.00. 
  REAP citywide. Project must locate or expand a microenterprise within an appropriately-zoned area in the city, and create a job. Approved projects are eligible for up to 75 percent reimbursement of the project cost, with a maximum of $2,500.00. 
    Rome Industrial Development Corporation. Rome Industrial Development Corporation (RIDC) assists new and expanding businesses in the city with location assistance, site selection and financing for qualified applicants. RIDC also coordinates the delivery of various value-added business services including business plan development, specialized business skill(s) training, one-on-one counseling, and longterm mentoring in conjunction with a variety of community economic development partners including, but not limited to, the Rome Chamber of Commerce, Rome Main Streets Alliance, Mohawk Valley Small Business Development Center (SBDC), Mohawk Valley Community College's Center for Community and Economic Development (CCED), Working Solutions of Rome, Mohawk Valley Service Corps of Retired Executives (SCORE), and the Women's Business Center of New York State. 
RIDC works with local commercial banks, the city, MVEDD, MV EDGE, New York Business Development Corporation (NYBDC), the state-wide zone capital credit corporation, and the U.S. Small Business Administration (Syracuse office) to structure financing packages appropriate for all types of businesses ranging from microenterprises to multinational corporations. For small-scale loans and as subrogated lenders in larger financing packages, RIDC uses four loan funds, including: 
RIDC general fund. Unrestricted use within the city; generally limited to loans less than $10,000.00; or 
Community reinvestment fund. For use within the city for either fixed asset or working capital loan; funding must be deemed necessary or appropriate as well as result in a gain of jobs for low- and moderate-income residents (HUD funding through the community development block grant program); or 
Commercial district loan fund. Limited for use within defined commercial corridors (service delivery region) of the downtown area; can be used for small fixed asset and/or working capital loans; funds come through Empire State Development and must be used in businesses with 50 or fewer FTE employees; or 
U.S. SBA Microloan Fund. Limited to non-real estate expenditures within a service delivery region encompassing the Cities of Rome and Sherrill as well as ten townships of central and western Oneida County; total maximum project cost must be less than $25,000.00; funds are loaned in aggregate from the U.S. Small Business Administration with RIDC acting as an intermediary lender in reapportioning those funds in smaller quantities to qualified businesses. 
The city's codes officer is one of the first individuals brought into a business development scenario so that any issues pertaining to permits and codes are handled expeditiously. The Oneida County Industrial Development Agency is located at the GBTP and is easily accessible for larger bonding and commercial development needs; the OCIDA has been instrumental in not only partially funding the redevelopment of the Rome Cable site, but is also instrumental in resolving property tax and ownership issues arising from the development and redevelopment of targeted industrial areas. 
RIDC works as the conduit among the various development agencies within Rome to assure that the appropriate services are available when and where needed. Besides local financial institutions, RIDC works with the New York Business Development Corporation, the U.S. SBA (microloan packages), and the Mohawk Valley Economic Development District (for coordinating 7(a) and 504 loan packages) so that there are always options available for all types and sizes of businesses. EZ incentives often play a key role in these packages from the standpoint of assuring public and private investing agencies of ongoing state financial assistance, which will facilitate positive loan decisions. 
(L.L. No. 1 of 2007(§ V), 1-10-07) 
Sec. 24-80. - Human resources development/training. 
    Working Solutions maintains a "one stop" center in Rome, which offers a wide variety of workforce development services that are consolidated and integrated for easier access by job seekers and employers. Professionals from many state and local, public, and human services agencies are available to assist businesses and job seekers maximize available workforce resources. A department of labor employer services staff person (shared with Madison County) is also available to assist with empire zone applications and worker certifications. The Working Solutions' Rome "one stop" center is located at the MVCC Rome Academic Building, Suite #1, 1101 Floyd Avenue, and at www.working-solutions.org. 
Workforce development services available at this location include job search assistance, career and training information, supports to employment, vocational rehabilitation, financial aid and scholarship assistance, hiring incentives, and access to the services of almost two dozen Working Solutions partner organizations.

(L.L. No. 1 of 2007(§ VI), 1-10-07) 
Sec. 24-81. - Community development. 
    Community development projects eligible for Rome EZ capital credits are limited to projects in any of the following areas: 
 Child care programs serving zone residents and businesses; or 
 Direct support of economic development and/or business/commercial revitalization activities; or 
 Business development activities of local development corporations. 
    The Rome EZ evaluates applications for community development projects on the basis of qualitative fit within the economic development strategy of the city. In the case of child care projects, the Rome EZ will evaluate the impact the project will have on the ability of local workers to take and hold jobs within the Rome EZ. Such factors as accessibility, affordability and capacity are keys to determine the amount and applicability of credits. The application will be evaluated on fundamental financial and business management principles as well as the qualitative factors used for the recommendation of any certification application. 
    Projects involving direct economic or business development activities will be evaluated on the same factors listed above in addition to the specific outcomes expected in the way of economic and business development activities. Such outcomes may include, but not be limited to, numbers of businesses created or assisted, jobs created by existing businesses, economic impact to specific areas of the Rome EZ, with special emphasis on areas with high vacancy and unemployment rates (i.e. eligible census tracts). 
    All donations must be at least $500.00 from any individual, corporation or other for-profit business entity to be eligible to receive zone capital credits under an approved Rome EZ community development project. 
    The Rome EZ area has a number of licensed and certified child care providers that offer the following services: 
 Family child care; 
 School age programs; 
 Group family care; 
 Preschool programs; 
 General child care centers. 
(L.L. No. 1 of 2007(§ VII), 1-10-07) 
Sec. 24-82. - Certification/cost-benefit analysis. 
    Enhancing the economic climate of the zone. The Rome ZAB will base its certification decision upon information supplied by the applicant business in the certification application, business plan, or other information obtained through the due diligence of the zone coordinator (and/or others) as well as the results of the benefit/cost ratio, which will be calculated upon receipt of the business' certification application. 
In order for a business to be certified, each of the following three quantitative certification thresholds must be met. The applicant business must: 
 Meet or exceed the certification thresholds as established in this section for job creation and/or capital investment pursuant to the applicant firm's physical location within the Rome EZ and relative to their status as either a new or existing business; and 
 Meet or exceed the established B/C ratio certification threshold for their business type and traded/nontraded status, if applicable; and 
 Demonstrate that the applicant firm currently derives, or will derive within a period of two years from date of local certification approval, at least 50 percent of its business revenues from goods or services that are physically shipped or delivered to customers or clients outside of the Utica-Rome MSA. Manufacturers may also be considered as traded if they market at least 30 percent of their total production to another manufacturer(s) that derives at least 50 percent of their business revenues outside the Utica-Rome MSA. 
The ZAB may consider businesses for certification that do not meet or exceed the benefit/cost certification threshold for their business type and status if the applicant firm can demonstrate to the satisfaction of the ZAB that their business represents a community need that only they can serve and/or that there will be considerable job growth in the near future. Also, the applicant's certification should also enhance the future economic climate of the zone. Any nonquantifiable factors taken into consideration by the ZAB and zone certifying officer must include reference toward any one or more of the following: 1) the applicant firm's positive impact on an area that has high commercial vacancy rates and/or is characterized by blight and disinvestments; 2) the applicant firm's part of a strategic industry cluster or supply chain; or 3) the applicant firm's anticipated use of zone capital credits. 
The zone coordinator and/or zone certifying officer shall not submit any ZAB-approved certification application to Empire State Development or execute any certificates of eligibility for businesses that have real estate taxes or fees in arrears to any taxing jurisdiction in the city; taxes/fees may include municipal real property taxes, payments in lieu of tax (PILOT and/or TIF) agreements, school district taxes, special assessment district taxes, etc. If an applicant has an approved payment plan in place with any applicable taxing jurisdiction to bring taxes current, the zone coordinator may request a written, signed, copy of the plan and, if satisfied in its efficacy, sign off on compliance for zone certification. The zone coordinator may then submit an application for empire zone certification to the zone certifying officer or submit a certificate of eligibility for execution. No certification applications will be processed for businesses that are in current violation of any local criminal or municipal laws and ordinances. 
The Rome Empire Zone Coordinator will use current city zoning ordinances to determine a specific business's eligibility for certification within the Rome Empire Zone. In instances where a business requests a use or area variance from the city, the business will need to provide proof that the city has granted such variance before an application for certification will be deemed complete. 
All certification applications are submitted by the zone coordinator to the applications committee, which reviews all submitted certification applications for completeness and eligibility under the city empire zone ZDP. A recommendation will be made to the ZAB; if a submitted application is deemed to be incomplete by the applications committee, it will be returned to the zone coordinator for further action. 
If any application is deemed complete, but not compatible with the Rome EZ Development Plan, the ZAB shall reject that application. All applications approved by the ZAB will be submitted to the zone certifying officer for approval and, if approved, sent to the empire zones program associate for final review/approval. 
    Cost-benefit analysis. The cost-benefit analysis (CBA) will be used as a quantitative tool in the certification process. The interim 15:1 certification threshold has been adjusted to reflect the relative levels of strategic importance for manufacturing and professional/commercial firms in the Rome EZ. A historic analysis of the benefit/cost ratios of Rome's currently certified businesses that have received New York State EZ incentives over the 2003-2005 period has shown that manufacturers add approximately one and a half as much economic benefit as professional/commercial firms and three times as much economic benefit as retailers. 
Figure 1: Historic B/C Ratios 
(2006 Rome EZ certified firms receiving incentives) 
Manufacturing Service/Professional Retail n=30 n=17 n=18 314:1 68:1 119:1 actual 87:1 55:1 30:1 w/o outliers * *  Firms with greater than () 95% of actual average  
An additional analysis featuring all benefit/cost ratios calculated for firms since the advent of the CBA also shows an average projected B/C ratio of 11.08:1 for all firms (n=17) with specific average CBA calculations based on type of firm as presented in figure 2 below. 
Figure 2: Cost Benefit Analysis B/C Ratios 
Manufacturing Service/Professional Retail n=5 n=8 n=4 80:1 13:1 11:1 actual 8:1 13:1 11:1 w/o outliers * *  Firms with greater than () 95% of actual average  
Applicant businesses considered as "manufacturers" in the benefit/cost matrix must be principally engaged in the production of tangible goods and/or services through processing, assembling, refining, mining, extracting, farming, etc. or meet the standards of Public Authorities Law § 3102-e in regards to "emerging technologies". This definition specifically includes intellectual as well as physical products in order to better incorporate the output of our strategic technical national defense and cybersecurity industry cluster. Manufacturers of all kinds are considered targeted businesses by the Rome EZ; traded status will not be considered. The historical economic worth of manufacturers to the Rome EZ shown in figure 1 indicate that manufacturers generate approximately 50 percent more value than service/professional firms and 300 percent more value than retail firms. Manufacturers, especially those new to Rome, also tend to qualify for more EZ incentives than do nonmanufacturers. The local basis for this assertion comes from figure 2, which shows that the average manufacturer's cost benefit analysis has been 8:1, so the certification threshold for all manufacturers, traded or non-traded, has been established at 10:1. 
Applicant businesses considered as "service/professional" in the benefit/cost matrix provide either tangible or intangible services to other commercial business entities. To be deemed eligible for certification, all service/professional firms must have at least two-thirds of their business performed for other firms in strategic industry clusters or are an integral part of the vendor supply chain of a strategic industry cluster(s). Traded service/professional firms will be subject to a lower B/C certification threshold ratio than nontraded firms due to the greater economic multiplier generated from bringing net income into Rome; when taken in proportion to the historic B/C ratios shown for these types of firms versus manufacturers and retailers (figure 1), the 12:1 certification threshold is within reason when compared with the previous cost benefit analyses done by this zone (figure 2). Nontraded service/professional firms will continue to be subject to the established 15:1 certification threshold. 
Applicant businesses considered as "retail" in the benefit/cost matrix provide goods, wares, or merchandise through individual end-user sale to other commercial business entities or consumers. Retail applicant businesses are assumed to be nontraded; the established certification benchmark will be maintained for all retail firms, unless other mitigating factors pertain to a specific applicant firm with a lower B/C ratio. 
These certification thresholds are summarized in figure 3, where each type of business is listed, along with any traded/nontraded threshold differences.

Eligible businesses locating within the following targeted commercial corridors must invest a minimum of $10.00 dollars in fixed assets/square foot of commercial usage in order to be considered for certification. Locations within the following commercial corridors qualify under this guideline: 
 East Dominick Street from Fort Stanwix National Monument to Nock Street; 
 West Dominick Street from Fort Stanwix National Monument to Arsenal Street; 
 North James Street from Fort Stanwix National Monument to Turin/Bloomfield Street; 
 South James Street from Fort Stanwix National Monument to Ridge Street. 
All other locations within the Rome Empire Zone must be improved with a minimum of $10.00 in fixed assets/square foot of commercial usage totaling at least $10,000.00. 
The Rome Empire Zone's job creation certification thresholds for areas #1 and #2 can be achieved through any of the following options: 1) Creation of at least two (2) FTEs (may be combination of full- and/or part-time employees) for any startup business; or 2) At least a 25 percent increase in FTEs above the average of the last three years (or years in business) of full-time employment equivalent for any existing business; or 3) Creation of at least one FTE (may be combination of full- and/or part-time positions) per $10,000.00 of fixed asset investment. Within area #3, job creation thresholds are based upon increases over the previous five years' (or years in business) average employment as follows: 
 10% growth if the business' three-year average is < 50 employees; 
 7% growth if the business' three-year average is between 50 and 250 employees; 
 5% growth if the business' three-year average is > 250 employees 
All created jobs must pay at least 135 percent of the currently established New York State minimum wage and, if necessary, must directly supply or provide access to appropriate workforce training opportunities. Applicant firms that require professional licenses, certificates or other forms of demonstrated professional expertise of new hires are exempt from this requirement. The zone coordinator and zone administrative board will consider whether certification will result in the transfer of employment from an existing business enterprise to similar employment with the business seeking certification. If that is determined to be the case, any transferred jobs will not be considered as 'new' jobs on the applicant firm's certification application. 
An applicant firm may be certified under a job/business retention threshold if it can document a need for empire zone incentives under each of the following criteria: 
 A decline of at least 25 percent or more in net business income over the previous 12-month period, or most recent fiscal year; and 
 A loss of at least 25 percent (minimum of one FTE) over the firm's previous three-year average employment. 
The applicant must agree to rehire the established base FTE positions lost plus at least one additional FTE (may be a combination of full- and/or part-time employees) within 12 months of their local certification approval. 
An applicant firm may be certified under a business acquisition threshold if the applicant firm can document a financial need for empire zone incentives to facilitate the acquisition. The acquired firm must be under an imminent threat for total liquidation or relocation of its workforce outside of the Utica-Rome MSA. The applicant must agree to retain at least 75 percent of the existing jobs of the acquired firm (FTE equivalent) prior to acquisition. 
Five previously certified businesses in the Oneida County EZ were transferred to the Rome EZ under a transfer agreement. They are: 1) Goodrich Corporation, 2) Empire Aero Center, Inc., 3) MGS Manufacturing, Inc., 4) Rome Research Corp., and 5) 394 Hanger Road Corporation. These firms all have locations at the GBTP which were included in the Rome EZ by means of a boundary amendment made effective on June 13, 2006. 
(L.L. No. 1 of 2007(§ VIII), 1-10-07) 
Sec. 24-83. - Program performance evaluation. 
    Compliance. The Rome EZ will monitor business compliance through annual review and follow-up on job creation and capital investment as reported in the business annual report (BAR) of each certified business. Rome EZ-certified businesses that have not performed to their proposed empire zone commitments as contained in their certification applications will be contacted to determine the reasons for their failure to proceed with projected investment and/or job creation and will have the opportunity, through written request, to maintain their empire zone-certified status. If the zone administrative board declines such a request, the firm may be decertification [decertified] by the New York State Empire Zones program. 
Capital investment and/or job creation must commence within six months of local approval for certification; the zone coordinator will monitor completion of promised capital investment and/or job creation. Waivers for these deadlines can only be granted through written ZAB approval prior to expiration of the original deadline. 
Information gathered and analyzed from each certified business' BAR will be used for zone evaluation and compliance purposes. Additional information may be requested from certified businesses to substantiate any external industry and economic forces that have negatively impacted the certified business and have resulted in less than anticipated job creation and/or capital investment levels. The Rome Empire Zone also reserves the right to physically inspect any Rome Empire Zone-certified business at any time to ascertain material facts concerning compliance. Such inspection may include review of tax returns, accounting ledgers, or other financial materials. Data and statistical analyses will be done on an annual basis as part of the internal performance review of the zone and be reported annually to the ZAB by the zone coordinator; pertinent information may also be included in the ZAR under section 24-76, Goals and strategies. 
    Decertification. The Rome ZAB will adhere to section 11.9 of the Empire Zone Regulations, Revocation of certification, for business decertifications. The Rome Empire Zone Coordinator in conjunction with the Rome ZAB Chairman will provide written notification to any business, which is deemed in default of its Rome Empire Zone obligations and will recommend appropriate action to the ZAB. The business so notified will have the right to provide written and/or oral testimony at a meeting of the ZAB at a time and date set by the ZAB. Such testimony must legitimately make a case to demonstrate that the decreased level of business activity can be attributed to a drop in general economic conditions or conditions specific to its industry, and that these conditions have forced a down-scaling or abandonment of the job creation or capital investment within the zone. The ZAB has the final authority to amend any business' certification requirements. 
Grounds for decertification may include, but are not limited to, the following circumstances (paraphrased from page C-1 of the NYS Empire Zones Regulations): 
 The business made material misrepresentations of fact on its application for certification that would constitute grounds for noncertification. 
 The business failed to disclose material facts that would constitute grounds for noncertification. 
 The business failed to construct, expand, rehabilitate or operate its facility in accordance with the representations contained in its application for certification. 
 The business use of the certified property has changed from the represented use on the certification application. 
 The business failed to create new employment, prevent loss of employment, or make promised capital improvements as outlined in its application for certification provided that such failure(s) was/were not due to economic circumstances beyond the business' control or could not be anticipated with due diligence. 
 The business failed to submit an annual business annual report (BAR) within the prescribed time for such reports or has failed to supply materials requested by the empire zone coordinator, or designee, when due. 
 The business has failed to comply or maintain compliance with city zoning and/or 
 Building codes infractions (unless grandfathered by municipal legislation). 
    Reporting. Information will be included in the Rome EZ Zone Annual Report to document quantifiable job creation and capital investment achievements by new and existing Rome EZ certified businesses as well as a qualitative description of various business activity indicators within the Rome EZ such as the following: 
 New jobs created; 
 Jobs/businesses retained; 
 Private capital investment (as a result of leveraged public money); 
 New businesses created, expanded or retained; 
 Types of new, expanded or retained businesses; 
 Infrastructure improvements; 
 Others. 
The zone annual report will describe current year accomplishments and illustrate how they complement the Rome Empire Zone Development Plan's strategies for targeted areas and business clusters. The narrative descriptions supplied with each new business application will also detail how that particular business fits within the development strategy of the ZDP. 
The ZDP will be annually reviewed concurrently with the preparation of the zone annual report. When necessary, the ZDP will be amended to reflect current, longitudinal, or expected changes in local economic conditions as well as reflect regional and/or state changes in markets, incentives, opportunities or other factors influencing subsequent economic development in the city. 
This strategic review should be an outgrowth of the annual performance accomplishments as detailed in the ZAR. Development goals and goal-specific strategies incorporated in section 24-76 will be used as a template and referenced in the ZAR for discussing achievement of annual performance metrics. Long-term zone performance measures may be addressed in any particular ZAR or as proposed revisions to either the ZDP or the Rome EZ boundaries. 
    Zone performance metrics. The Rome EZ works with a number of economic development partners in the Mohawk Valley and often collaborates on projects involving business expansion and location/relocation within the Rome EZ. It is the intention of the Rome EZ to be involved at the earliest possible time in order to assess the project's eligibility, provide information on available incentives, and assist with timely certification applications to maximize potential incentives. Referral and collaboration are key factors relative to evaluation of any of the Rome EZ's development goals and strategies. The ZAB will annually review all goal-specific strategies for each area and illustrate aone performance in those specific areas and/or strategies using any appropriate performance metrics from the following generic areas: 
    Technical assistance. 
 Number of firms/individuals assisted with general empire zone questions, program materials, problems, or other forms of firm-specific technical assistance; 
 Collaboration with other entities in new economic development initiatives/projects/programs particular to the Rome EZ or directly related to the economic vitality within the Rome EZ; 
 Internal Rome EZ metrics for longitudinal trend analysis, longterm B/C ratio matrix adjustments, or specific goal/strategy evaluation; 
a.  Number of targeted businesses certified/year 
b.  Percent of businesses within manufacturing, service/professional, and retail sectors split by traded/non-traded status 
c.  Percent certified businesses accessing incentives 
d.  Zone-wide B/C ratio split for manufacturers, service/professional, and retail sectors 
    Capital investment. 
 Dollars of grant funding secured, through letters of support, collaboration and/or direct application; 
 Number and amount of financing packages developed with public and/or private sources; 
 Infrastructure improvements made in the zone; 
 Redevelopment of unused, vacant, or brownfield areas; 
    Workforce development. 
 Number and description of technical training and certification programs initiated, expanded, or maintained; 
 Number and description of professional development seminars/curriculums offered by local academic institutions; 
 Number of targeted worker certifications and local employment placements. 
Outreach and education. 
 Current brochures, website content, and other program materials; press releases and/or media contacts; 
 Number and description of seminars/presentations concerning incentives, program updates, and policies/procedures; 
 Business visitation program; 
a.  Certified firms -Contact at least once per year. 
b.  Noncertified firms -Contact by referral or as necessary 
Longterm EZ performance measures are strategic and are reviewed as necessary to provide transparency in the face of future economic realities within the city and the Rome EZ. Logistically, this evaluation may result in proposed changes to the ZDP and/or a boundary amendment. The ZAB will evaluate: 
 Current City of Rome Comprehensive Action Plan and/or other local/regional planning documents and development strategies; 
 Examination of the nature and type(s) of operational and strategic collaborations with local, regional, and State agencies; 
 The current makeup of the zone in order to assess past short term achievement(s) of established goals; 
 Economic and other geopolitical trends or forecasts that may influence the future operation of the Rome EZ.

Chapter 44 - PUBLIC SAFETY 
ARTICLE I. - IN GENERAL 

Secs. 44-1-44-25. - Reserved. 
ARTICLE II. - SEX OFFENDER RESIDENCY RESTRICTIONS 

Sec. 44-26. - Legislative intent. 
    The City of Rome Common Council finds as follows and adopts such finding as its legislative history for the provisions hereinafter enacted: 
(a)  Sex offenders, as that term is defined at Corrections Law, article 6-C, pose a significant threat to the health and safety of the community; 
(b)  According to recent criminal statistics, more than two-thirds of the victims of sex offenders are children and sex offenders pose a significant threat to the health and safety of children whose age and inexperience makes them particularly vulnerable to the heinous and reprehensible acts of sex offenders; and 
(c)  The rate of recidivism for sex offenders is high and programs designed to treat and rehabilitate these types of offenders have been largely ineffective. Limiting the frequency of contact between registered sex offenders and areas where children are likely to congregate reduces the opportunity and temptation, and can minimize the risk of repeated acts against minors; and 
(d)  It is the intention of the City of Rome Common Council to exercise its authority pursuant to article IX, §§ 2(c)(i) and (ii)(10) of the New York State Constitution; §§ 10(ii)(a)(12) and (d)(3) of the Municipal Home Rule Law; General City Law, § 20(13); and Rome City Charter, title A, § 25(15) and any other applicable or successor law, presently in existence or hereinafter enacted, to protect and safeguard the lives and well-being of the community, and especially children from registered sex offenders while children schools, playgrounds, parks and other areas where children may congregate; and 
(e)  This legislation is the most narrowly tailored means of limiting, to the fullest extent possible, the opportunity for registered sex offenders to approach or otherwise come in contact with children in places where children would naturally congregate, and that the protection of our residents is a compelling governmental interest; and 
(f)  By enactment of this or any other legislation, the City of Rome Common Council understands that it cannot completely remove the threat posed to or guarantee the safety of minors, or assure the public that registered sex offenders will comply with the mandate of this article. This legislation is intended to create a civil, nonpunitive regulatory scheme in order to protect minors to the extent possible under the circumstances and not as a punitive measure of any kind; and 
(g)  This legislation is rationally related to and will serve to protect the health, safety and welfare of the community and, especially, that of children.

Sec. 46-98. - Report of complaint. 
(a)  Informal procedure. The city encourages employees who believe they are subjected to unlawful discrimination or harassment to clearly and promptly notify the offender that the offender's behavior is unwelcome. If for any reason an employee does not wish to confront the offender directly or if such a confrontation does not successfully end the unlawful discrimination or harassment, the employee should notify the personnel director who may, if the individual so requests, talk to the alleged offender on the individual's behalf or arrange a mediation between the individual and the alleged offender with a third party acceptable to both. The personnel director will endeavor to treat the matter with the degree of confidentiality that the reporting employee requests. There may be instances in which an employee seeks to discuss matters with the personnel director. The city encourages such discussions. However, the city shall retain final authority to determine when action beyond those contemplated by the informal procedures is necessary to address the alleged unlawful discrimination or harassment. 
(b)  Formal procedure. An employee must take all reasonable steps to stop or prevent unlawful harassment or discrimination. If the reporting individual does not wish to pursue the informal procedure or if the informal procedure does not result in a discontinuance of the harassing or discriminating conduct, the following steps shall be followed: 
(1)  Notification. An employee who believes to have been subjected to unlawful discrimination or harassment should report the incident to the personnel director. The alleged offender shall be notified by the personnel director of the pendency of an investigation. Upon receipt of a report of unlawful discrimination or harassment, the personnel director shall immediately notify the corporation counsel of the complaint and the allegations contained therein. If the employee believes that the employee's personnel director is involved in the unlawful conduct or that such personnel director will not initiate a formal investigation according to this policy, that employee may initiate a formal investigation of the alleged unlawful discrimination or harassment by delivering a written statement to the corporation counsel, the commissioner of public works, the commissioner of public safety or the city treasurer. If all of the above individuals are of the same gender, the personnel director shall designate an additional city officer of the opposite gender to receive written statements and conduct investigations pursuant to this policy. The name and title of said city officer shall be kept on file in the personnel director's office and in the office of the city clerk. 
(2)  Description of misconduct. An accurate record of the objectionable behavior is necessary to resolve a formal complaint of unlawful discrimination or harassment. All formal complaints of unlawful discrimination or harassment shall be reduced to writing by either the complainant or the individual designated to receive such complaints. 
(3)  Time for reporting complaint. While the city has chosen not to impose a time limitation for the reporting of unlawful discrimination or harassment complaints, prompt reporting of complaints is strongly encouraged, as it allows for rapid response and resolution of objectionable behavior or conditions for the complainant and any other affected employees. 
(4)  Protection against retaliation. The city will not retaliate against an employee who makes a report of unlawful discrimination or harassment, nor will the city permit any employee to do so. Retaliation is a very serious violation of this article and should be reported immediately. Any employee found to have retaliated against an individual for reporting unlawful discrimination or harassment will be subject to disciplinary action for misconduct in accordance with Civil Service Law, § 75 and any pertinent collective bargaining agreement.

Any allegation of unlawful discrimination and/or harassment brought to the attention of the personnel director, the corporation counsel, the commissioner of public works, the commissioner of public safety or the city treasurer, or the additional city official designated pursuant to section 46-98(b)(1), shall be promptly investigated. Confidentiality shall be maintained throughout the investigatory process to the extent practical and appropriate under the circumstances. 
(b)  Identification of investigators. Complaints made to the personnel director shall be initially investigated by the personnel director, unless it is determined that the investigation should be conducted by another individual. In addition, any of the following individuals may be asked to participate in or review the investigation: the supervisor of the individual involved, the department head and the corporation counsel. Complaints made to the corporation counsel, the commissioner of public works, the commissioner of public safety or the city treasurer, or the additional city official designated pursuant to section 46-98(b)(1), shall be investigated by said individual and persons duly appointed by said individual. 
(c)  Investigation process.

(Ord. No. 9296A , 9-12-18) 
Sec. 62-3. - Applicability and classifications. 
    No person may divide, consolidate, or otherwise alter the boundaries of any lot within the city except in compliance with these regulations. No permits will be issued by the city authorizing the building on, occupancy of, or improvement of any lot not on record until the requirements of this chapter have been fully met and an approval of the subdivision issued and the final plat recorded with the county. This chapter regulates three types of subdivision: 
(1)  Administrative subdivision. 
a.  Purpose. To further the purpose of these subdivision regulations, as described in section 62-1, the purpose of the administrative subdivision process is to provide a simple approval process for lot line adjustments. 
b.  Applicability. An administrative subdivision involves the consolidation of, or change in boundary between, existing adjoining lots. A conservation features inventory is not required. 
(2)  Minor subdivision. 
a.  Purpose. To further the purpose of these subdivision regulations, as described in section 62-1, the purpose of the minor subdivision process is to provide a simplified approval process for simple lot divisions that do not require infrastructure improvements and generally occur in areas already developed. 
b.  Applicability. A minor subdivision is the division of a single lot into no more than four lots, which front on an existing public or private right-of-way, are served by existing municipal facilities, and do not involve the dedication of land. 
(3)  Major subdivision. 
a.  Purpose. To further the purpose of these subdivision regulations, as described in section 62-1, the purpose of the major subdivision process is to provide an approval process that assesses the impact of larger lot divisions that may require infrastructure improvements. 
b.  Applicability. A major subdivision involves any of the following actions. A conservation features inventory of previously undeveloped land or land previously in agricultural use, per section 62-6, is required to determine whether the major subdivision must follow conservation design subdivision standards. 
1.  The division of a single lot into five or more lots. 
2.  Any division of land that involves construction of new public or private rights-of-way, the extension of municipal facilities, or the dedication of land for public rights-of-way, parks, or other public purposes. 
(4)  Sustainable designs. 
a.  Conservation subdivision design. 
1.  Purpose. Conservation subdivision design is an evaluation and design process intended to reduce the overall impact of developments, particularly in the outside district, and create better site layout to reduce the effects of development to the existing natural land features and habitat. Utilizing conservation design promotes smart growth practices and sustainable development practices. 
2.  Applicability. Section 62-6 describes the triggers for conservation design and conservation design standards. 
b.  Cluster Subdivision Design. 
1.  Purpose. Cluster subdivision is an optional subdivision process intended to preserve natural and scenic qualities while allowing for smaller lot sizes while maintaining the lot count as calculated under the minimum lot size of the district, which normally would not be achievable through conventional development. Cluster subdivision allows for smaller lot development with access to common open space, both natural and improved, which is an asset that can enhance property values as well as quality of life. A traditional subdivision layout is required along with the cluster subdivision layout for planning board review. A conservation features inventory of previously undeveloped land or land previously in agricultural use, per section 62-6, should be utilized in the planning and design of the cluster subdivision. 
2.  Applicability. Section 62-6 describes how cluster subdivision may be used at the applicant's option.

Sec. 62-5. - Subdivision development standards. 
(a)  Public facility requirement. Land proposed for subdivision must be served adequately by essential public facilities and services. Land will not be approved for subdivision unless and until public facilities exist or provision has been made for water facilities, wastewater facilities, drainage facilities, and transportation facilities necessary to serve the proposed development, whether such facilities are located within the land being platted or outside of the site. 
(b)  Conformance to plans. Proposed land division and public improvements must be consistent with the comprehensive plan and any applicable public facilities and capital improvements plans. 
(c)  Water. All platted lots must be connected to a public water system or properly permitted to ensure water for health and emergency purposes, including adequate fire protection. 
(d)  Wastewater. All platted lots must be served by public sewer system or an alternate approved means of wastewater collection and treatment. 
(e)  Streets. All streets must provide a safe, convenient and functional system for vehicular and pedestrian circulation and, when appropriate, bicycle circulation. All streets must be appropriate for the traffic characteristics and impacts of the proposed development. All rights-of-way must meet city right-of-way standards. 
(f)  Drainage. Drainage improvements must accommodate potential runoff from upstream drainage areas and designed to prevent overloading the capacity of the downstream drainage system. This may require the phasing of development, the use of control methods such as retention, detention, or pumping systems, and/or the construction of off-site drainage improvements to mitigate the impacts of the proposed development. All developments must meet the stormwater management requirements of the zoning code and green infrastructure stormwater management methods are encouraged. Best management practices as outlined by the NYS DEC must be utilized. 
(g)  Phasing. Phasing of development or improvements may be required as part of subdivision approval to maintain current levels of service for existing public services and facilities or for other reasons based upon protecting the health, safety, and welfare of residents. Subdivided undeveloped and tree cleared lots that create a negative effect on the health and wellbeing of the surrounding neighborhoods or wildlife communities must be avoided through phasing; no exceptions are allowed. 
(h)  Lot configuration. 
(1)  Lot width and area, and all setback lines, must conform to all requirements of the zoning district standards of the zoning code. The following exceptions apply: 
a.  If the subdivision is a conservation design, it is subject to the regulations of conservation design. 
b.  If the subdivision is a cluster design subdivision, it is subject to the regulations of cluster design. 
(2)  All lots must front directly upon and take access from a public road. 
(3)  Every lot created by subdivision must be substantially similar in shape to those lots on the same block, unless the contours of an adjacent street or previously established lot render such shape impractical. Every lot or parcel of land that is subdivided must contain a relatively straight boundary line between each lot. Side lot lines must be approximately at right angles or radial to the street line. 
(4)  Through lots and flag lots must be avoided, except where needed to overcome specific disadvantages of topography and orientation. 
(i)  Infrastructure requirements. 
(1)  Sanitary sewer. 
a.  Public sanitary sewer is required for all subdivisions within the inside district. Septic systems are permitted only within the outside district. 
b.  The location of sanitary sewers must be approved by the city engineer. Whenever possible, they should be located within the parkway. 
c.  Where sanitary sewer is provided, sewer service lines must be installed to serve all lots planned for development within the subdivision at the time they are constructed. Sewer service lines must extend to the lot line and the preferred location is the low side of the lot. 
(2)  Water supply. 
a.  Where a connection to a public water system is present at the boundary of the subdivision, water distribution facilities, including fire hydrants, must be installed to serve all properties within the subdivision, in addition to any additional requirements for public sewer in state law. 
b.  Where a connection to a public water system is present, it must be extended for and throughout the entire subdivision in such a manner that each lot planned for development within a subdivision is serviced by means of a connection to the water system within its own frontage. 
(3)  Utilities. 
a.  If outside of a right-of-way that will be deeded over to the city, easements must be provided for utility services including, but not limited to, sanitary sewer, storm sewer, water, gas, telecommunication, cable television, and electric. The location of a utility easement is determined by the city engineer. Utility services should be clustered within a single easement when practical. 
b.  Underground utility is required unless specific site conditions make the installation of underground utilities impractical. 
(4)  Stormwater. 
a.  All developments must meet the stormwater management requirements of the zoning code. 
b.  Storm drainage improvements consisting of storm sewers and/or open channels must adequately drain the area being developed and also all of that area which naturally drains through the area being developed. The design of drainage improvements must be coordinated with present and probable future improvements so as to form part of an integrated system. Appropriate grading may be required. 
c.  Where the character or topography of the land in a subdivision is such that it is impossible or impractical to place streets so that they carry off the surface water, the appropriate easements along lot lines must be provided and improved, where necessary, to carry off surface water in open channels or storm sewers. 
d.  All publicly dedicated drainage easements must be approved by the city engineer. 
(5)  Right-of-way design. 
a.  All rights-of-way must meet city right-of-way standards. 
b.  The plat must indicate that the city engineer will take responsibility for maintaining the rights-of-way after final acceptance. 
c.  The subdivider must furnish and erect all necessary traffic control and directional signs, including street signs, as designated by the city engineer. All signs must be of a type approved by the city engineer. 
d.  Shoulders are required along all streets not provided with curbs and gutters. Green infrastructure design is encouraged for shoulders. Curbs and shoulders must be designed to meet the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO) standards. 
e.  All street construction must meet city standards. 
f.  Streets will not be accepted by the city engineer until all construction detailed in the plans is completed. It is the responsibility of the subdivider to consult with the city engineer before the work has begun to afford the city engineer an opportunity to inspect the work as construction progresses. 
(Ord. No. 9296A , 9-12-18) 
Sec. 62-6. - Conservation and cluster subdivision designs. 
(a)  Conservation features inventory-General. 
(1)  A conservation features inventory (CFI) must be included in an application for any major subdivision of previously undeveloped land or land previously in agricultural use. 
(2)  The CFI must be submitted prior to the preliminary plat. If the CFI indicates that 20 percent or more of the total land area on-site has significant natural resources, conservation design is required. Review and verification of whether or not conservation design is required will be conducted by the planning department, which has the ability to consult with other city staff and/or the ability to hire outside consultants for the review at the applicant's expense. 
(3)  The CFI must include the entirety of the subject area. For context, it is encouraged to show any CFI features on adjacent land within 250 feet of the subject area. If this area is not included a 250-foot buffer of adjacent land may still be considered in review of the application. 
(b)  Conservation features inventory-Required elements. A CFI must address each element of this section, including statements that such resources are not present. 
(1)  Streams and floodplains. 
a.  The CFI must show all streams and drainage courses, and floodplains as shown on FEMA flood insurance rate maps or more current sources of information. 
b.  Topographic maps must be used to determine the presence of streams and drainage courses. If engineering studies provide the basis for topographic or flood plain information, they must be approved by a professional engineer. 
(2)  Steep slopes. The CFI must show existing slopes greater than 15 percent. Slopes between 15 percent to 30 percent must be distinguished from slopes greater than 30 percent. 
(3)  Sensitive soils. The CFI must show sensitive soils as identified on any soil survey prepared for a government body. Soil limitations on development must be noted on the CFI. Severe soil limitations must also be noted and described, which are defined as having one or more of the following characteristics as identified below: 
a.  Seasonal high water table. 
b.  Subject to flood hazard. 
c.  Poor drainage. 
d.  Wetland/hydric soil conditions. 
e.  High shrink/swell potential. 
f.  Shallow depth to bedrock. 
g.  Excessive slopes. 
h.  High susceptibility to erosion. 
(4)  Wetlands. 
a.  The CFI must show all wetlands as defined by the federal Clean Water Act. 
b.  U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service National Wetlands Inventory Maps, NYS DEC wetlands maps, and other sources required by the city may be used to identify wetlands. 
c.  If wetlands are present, a wetlands assessment must be submitted prior to consideration of a preliminary plat as required by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, or the NYS DEC. The name and address of the individual who conducted the wetland assessment shall be indicated on the development project plan. 
d.  Wetlands must be shown on the CFI by a line denoting the boundary of wetlands or a note stating that no wetlands exist on the site. 
e.  If the applicant is considering development that will impact or remove wetlands, a report must be submitted explaining the functional value of wetlands and measures proposed to mitigate any loss of wetlands, as required by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and/or the NYS DEC. 
(5)  Woodlands. The CFI must show woodlands indicated by the most current aerial photos from the county or other available sources. Woodlands are areas of trees whose combined canopies cover a minimum of 80 percent of an area of one acre or more. Such areas must be delineated by a circumferential line extending to the outer perimeter of the tree canopies. Tree varieties and range of size must be indicated. 
(6)  Threatened and endangered species. The CFI must show generally the habitat and location of flora and fauna designated as rare, threatened, endangered, in need of conservation, or listed as watch list species, as determined by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, NYS DEC, or other sources required by the city, known to exist on the property proposed for development. 
(7)  Existing wildlife. A general description of existing wildlife seen or known to exist on the subject property must be set forth in a note on the CFI. The note must address potential wildlife management problems (e.g., displacement, residential interactions, road crossings, movement corridors) related to the proposed development. 
(8)  Cultural and historic resources. Any cultural or historic resources identified by the state office of parks, recreation and historic preservation, and the city, and any other known or identified cultural or historic resources. 
(c)  Conservation design standards. 
(1)  Intent. The conservation design is intended to guide development so that it locates and coordinates areas for development where the conservation of natural features is prioritized, and provides common open space areas for passive and/or active recreational use by residents of the development and, where appropriate, the larger community. 
(2)  General requirements. 
a.  Lots must be configured to minimize the loss of natural resources, including wetlands, water bodies, woodlands, and historical resources. 
b.  The development must preserve scenic natural views, including views from roadways. 
c.  If agricultural uses are being maintained within the development, lots must be configured in a manner that maximizes the usable area remaining for such agricultural uses with appropriate buffers between agricultural uses and residential structures. 
(3)  Development standards. 
a.  Lots must be arranged in a manner that protects areas of conservation value identified in the CFI, and facilitates pedestrian and bicycle circulation throughout the development. 
b.  For lots without public sewer or water, wells and septic systems may be located within no more than 30 percent of the required common open space, provided that necessary easements are provided for maintenance of these facilities. 
c.  The permitted residential density for the development as a whole is calculated as follows: 
1.  First, determine the maximum residential density of the underlying district by dividing the area of the entire development site by the minimum lot area required for a detached single-family dwelling of the underlying district. If other city ordinances require a larger lot size when there is no public sewer and/or water available, such lot sizes are used in the calculation. 
2.  Second, increase the resulting density by 25 percent. Fractions are rounded to the nearest whole number. 
d.  There are no required lot area or lot width standards for residential development in a conservation design. However, such lot sizes and the development as a whole are still subject to city ordinances and approvals if no public sewer and/or water available. Other dimensional standards, such as setbacks, height, and coverage, are those of the R-3 district for the dwelling type. 
e.  Residential dwellings must be clustered according to the following standards. 
1.  Each residential cluster is limited to no more than 25 dwellings. 
2.  Residential clusters should be located a minimum of 150 feet apart lot line to lot line, separated by greenbelts or other natural features. The greenbelts may include bike paths or hiking trails, no development is permitted within these separation areas. 
3.  Residential clusters must be located to minimize negative impacts on the natural, scenic, and cultural resources of the site. 
4.  Residential clusters must be sited to achieve the following goals: 
A.  Minimize disturbance to natural areas. Clear-cutting is prohibited. 
B.  Prevent downstream impacts due to runoff through adequate on-site stormwater management practices. 
C.  Protect scenic views of open land from adjacent roads to the extent practical. 
5.  Whenever possible, open space must connect with existing or potential open space on adjoining parcels and local or regional recreational trails. 
6.  Whenever possible, fragmentation of woodland areas and other natural ecosystems must be avoided. Contiguous swaths of undisturbed or restored habitat should be preserved to create corridors for the movement of wildlife and natural resources, and to promote biodiversity. 
f.  There must be a perimeter buffer yard around the entire conservation design development of no less than 50 feet. No development is permitted in this perimeter buffer yard, which must remain landscaped with no structures. This perimeter buffer yard may be included in the required percentage of open space if undivided and restricted in perpetuity from future development. Vehicle access points to the development and connections to pedestrian and bicycle circulation are permitted within this perimeter buffer yard. 
(4)  Required common open space. Forty percent of the land area in a conservation design must be maintained as active or passive common open space, as described in section 62-11. 
(5)  Sample calculation. The following calculations and accompanying graphics illustrate how conservation design standards are applied. A conventional residential subdivision is compared to one designed in accordance with the conservation design standards, which allows for a residential density bonus of 25 percent per item c. above. 
Conventional residential subdivision in the RR district 
Lot area minimum (single-family detached): One acre 
Development site size: 40 acres-One unit per acre, based upon minimum lot size: 40 units 
40 acres minus ten percent for infrastructure (roads, etc.): 36 acres 
36 acres/one acre minimum lot area = 36 units 
No preserved open space 

Conservation design residential subdivision in the RR district 
Lot area minimum (single-family detached): One acre 
Development site size: 40 acres-One unit per acre, based upon minimum lot size: 40 units

(Code 1966, § 271/2-30) 
Sec. 66-37. - Exemptions from use tax. 
    The following uses of property shall not be subject to the compensating use tax imposed under this article: 
(1)  a. 
The use of property used by the purchaser in this city prior to December 1, 1980. 
b.  The additional tax of one-quarter percent imposed in section 66-28 effective for the period beginning September 1, 1990, and ending August 31, 2000, in respect to the use of property used by the purchaser in this city prior to September 1, 1990. 
(2)  The use of property purchased by the user while a nonresident of this city, except in the case of tangible personal property which the user, in the performance of a contract, incorporates into real property located in the city. A person while engaged in any manner in carrying on in this city any employment, trade, business or profession shall not be deemed a nonresident with respect to the use in this city of property in such employment, trade, business or profession. 
(3)  The use of property or services upon the sale of which the purchaser would be expressly exempt from the taxes imposed under subsections 66-28(1) through (3).

(6)  a. 
The use of property or services to the extent that a retail sales tax or a compensating use tax was legally due and paid thereon, without any right to a refund or credit thereof, to any municipal corporation in this state or any other state or jurisdiction within any other state, but only when it is shown that such other state or jurisdiction allows a corresponding exemption with respect to the sale or use of tangible personal property or of any of the services upon which such a sale or compensating use tax was paid to this state and any of its municipal corporations, except as provided in subsection (6)b of this section. 
b.  To the extent that a compensating use tax imposed by this article and the compensating use tax imposed by Tax Law, art. 28 are at a higher aggregate rate than the rate of tax imposed in any other state or jurisdiction within any other state, the exemption provided in subsection (7)a of this section shall be inapplicable and the taxes imposed by this article and by Tax Law, art. 28 shall apply to the extent of the difference between such aggregate rate and the rate paid in such other state or jurisdiction. Where a retail sales tax or a compensating use tax was legally due and paid to any municipal corporation in this state, without any right to a refund or credit thereof, with respect to the sale or use of tangible personal property or any of the services subject to sales or compensating use tax, if the use of such property or services is then subject to the compensating use tax imposed by this article and such tax is at a higher rate than the rate of tax imposed by the first municipal corporation, the tax imposed by this article shall also apply but only to the extent of the difference in such rates.

(Code 1966, § 271/2-31) 
Sec. 66-38. - Refunds or credits based on proof of certain uses. 
(a)  Subject to the conditions and limitations provided for in this section, a refund or credit shall be allowed for a tax paid pursuant to subsection 66-28(1) or section 66-30 on: 
(1)  The sale or use within this city of tangible personal property if the purchaser or user, in the performance of a contract, later incorporates that tangible personal property into real property located outside this city; 
(2)  The sale or use of tangible personal property purchased in bulk, or any portion thereof, which is stored and not used by the purchaser or user within this city if that property is subsequently reshipped by such purchaser or user to a point outside this city for use outside this city; 
(3)  The sale to or use by a contractor or subcontractor of tangible personal property if that property is used by him solely in the performance of a preexisting lump sum or unit price construction contract; 
(4)  The sale or use within this city of tangible personal property, not purchased for resale, if the use of such property in this city is restricted to fabricating such property, including incorporating it into or assembling it with other tangible personal property, processing, printing or imprinting such property and such property is then shipped to a point outside this city for use outside this city; or 
(5)  The sale to or use by a veterinarian of drugs or medicine if such drugs or medicine are used by such veterinarian in rendering services, which are exempt pursuant to subsection 66-32(f), to livestock or poultry used in the production for sale of tangible personal property by farming or if such drugs or medicine are sold to a person qualifying for the exemption provided for in subsection 66-32(a)(6) for use by such person on such livestock or poultry. For the purposes of subsection (a)(3) of this section, the term "preexisting lump sum or unit price construction contract" shall mean a contract for the construction of improvements to real property under which the amount payable to the contractor or subcontractor is fixed without regard to the costs incurred by him in the performance thereof, and which was irrevocably entered into prior to the effective date of the ordinance from which this section derives or the enactment of a law increasing the rate of tax imposed under this article; or resulted from the acceptance by a governmental agency of a bid accompanied by a bond or other performance guaranty which was irrevocably submitted prior to such date. Where the tax on the sale or use of such tangible personal property has been paid to the vendor, to qualify for such refund or credit, such tangible personal property must be incorporated into real property as required in subsection (a)(1) of this section, reshipped as required in subsection (a)(2) of this section or used in the manner described in subsections (a)(3) through (5) of this section within three years after the date such tax was payable to the state tax commission by the vendor pursuant to Tax Law, § 1137. Where the tax on the sale or use of such tangible personal property was paid by the applicant for the credit or refund directly to the state tax commission, to qualify for such refund or credit, such tangible personal property must be incorporated into real property as required in subsection (a)(1) of this section, reshipped as required in subsection (a)(2) of this section or used in the manner described in subsections (a)(3) through (5) of this section within three years after the date such tax was payable to the state tax commission by such applicant pursuant to Tax Law, art. 28. With respect to a sale or use described in subsection (a)(3) of this section, the purchaser or user shall be entitled to a refund or credit of the amount of the taxes imposed by this article if enacted later than the date of such contract or bid, or of the amount reflecting an increase in the rate of tax enacted later than such date, as the case may be, but only to the extent that all such sales and use taxes paid on such sale or use under the aggregate statewide and local taxes imposed under Tax Law, art. 28 and by authority of Tax Law, art. 29 exceeded an amount computed by applying against such sale or use the aggregate of the rates of statewide and local sales and use taxes that were in effect at the time such contract was entered into or such bid was submitted. 
(b)  Subject to the conditions and limitations provided for in this subsection, a refund or credit shall be allowed for a tax paid pursuant to subsection 66-28(1) or section 66-30 on the sale to or use by an omnibus carrier described in this subsection of any omnibus and of parts, equipment, lubricants, motor fuel, diesel motor fuel, maintenance, servicing or repair purchased and used in the operation of any such omnibus by such carrier. Any such omnibus carrier must provide local transit service in this state and operate pursuant to a certificate of public convenience and necessity issued by the commissioner of transportation of this state or by the Interstate Commerce Commission of the United States or pursuant to the contract, franchise or consent between such carrier and a city having a population of more than 1,000,000 inhabitants, or any agency of such city. The amount of such refund or credit shall be determined by first computing the local transit service percentage which shall be the proportion that such carrier's vehicle mileage in local transit service in this state in the calendar year immediately preceding the end of the quarterly return period, prescribed by Tax Law, § 1136, to which such refund or credit relates bears to such carrier's total mileage operated in this state in such year. An omnibus carrier which was not engaged in local transit service in the preceding calendar year shall determine such percentage with respect to its first four quarterly returns filed pursuant to Tax Law, § 1136 by using the proportion that such carrier's vehicle mileage in local transit service in this state in the first three months of such operation bears to such carrier's total mileage operated in this state in such period. The amount of the refund or credit allowable on the local tax paid on such purchases or uses then shall be determined in accordance with the following: If the local transit service percentage is as follows, the refund or credit is: 
(1)  Less than ten percent: none. 
(2)  Ten percent: ten percent of such tax. 
(3)  Greater than ten percent but less than 70 percent: ten percent plus the product of 1.5 times each whole percent in excess of ten percent of such tax. 
(4)  70 percent or more: 100 percent of such tax. 
For the purposes of this subsection, the terms "local transit service," "vehicle mileage" and "total mileage operated" shall be as defined by rule or regulation of the state tax commission, and records satisfactory to the tax commission shall be maintained by the carrier. An application for a refund or credit pursuant to this subsection must be filed with such commission within the time provided by Tax Law, § 1139(a). Such application shall be in such form as the tax commission may prescribe. Where an application for credit has been filed, the applicant may immediately take such credit on the return which is due coincident with or immediately subsequent to the time that he files his application for credit. However, the taking of the credit on the return shall be deemed to be part of the application for credit and shall be subject to the provisions in respect to applications for credit in Tax Law, § 1139(e). 
(c)  A refund or credit equal to the amount of sales or compensating use tax imposed by Tax Law, art. 28 and under this article and paid on the sale or use of tangible personal property shall be allowed the purchaser where such property is later used by the purchaser in performing a service subject to tax under subsections 66-28(3)a through (3)c and (3)e or under section 66-30 and such property has become a physical component part of the property upon which the service is performed or has been transferred to the purchaser of the service in conjunction with the performance of the service subject to tax or if a contractor, subcontractor or repairman purchases tangible personal property and later makes a retail sale of such tangible personal property, the acquisition of which would not have been a sale at retail to him but for the last sentence of subsection (2) of the definition of retail sale in subsection 66-27(b). An application for the refund or credit provided for in this subsection must be filed with the tax commission within the time provided by Tax Law, art. 1139(a). Such application shall be in such form as the tax commission may prescribe. Where an application for credit has been filed, the applicant may immediately take such credit on the return which is due coincident with or immediately subsequent to the time that he files his application for credit. However, the taking of the credit on the return shall be deemed to be part of the application for credit. The procedure for granting or denying such application for a refund or credit and review of such determinations shall be as provided in Tax Law, § 1139(e).

All of the provisions of Tax Law, art. 28 relating to or applicable to the administration and collection of the taxes imposed by that article shall apply to the taxes imposed by this article, including Tax Law, §§ 1101, 1106(e), 1107, 1118(b), 1119 and 1131 through 1147, together with any amendment thereto, with the same force and effect as if those provisions had been incorporated in full into this article except as otherwise provided in Tax Law, § 1250.

    Upon Local Law No. H(6)A of 2004, adopted by the city common council on Nov. 10, 2004, setting forth the establishment of the business investment exemption within the city taking effect, the common council expressly repeals the empire zone tax exemption and, upon the effective date of the business investment exemption, the city assessor shall not grant empire zone exemptions for real property taxes or ad valorem levies by the city. However, any empire zone exemption granted to an eligible property which is in effect prior to the effective date of Local Law No. H(6)A of 2004, shall continue for such period of time as may be remaining in the applicable exemption term as if said exemption had not been repealed. Additionally, the repeal of the empire zone exemption shall in no way affect those areas of the city designated as "empire zones" by the New York State Commissioner of Economic Development ("commissioner") and/or the Rome Common Council and any property located therein shall continue to be entitled to such other business incentives and/or credits, other than real property tax exemption, as may be provided by the state and/or any other municipal entity.

The result shall be the new exemption base. The exemption shall thereupon be recomputed to take into account the new exemption base, notwithstanding the fact that the assessor receives the certification of the change in level of assessment after the completion, verification and filing of the assessment roll. In the event the city assessor does not have custody of the roll when such certification is received, the city assessor shall certify the recomputed exemption to the city treasurer, and the city treasurer is hereby directed and authorized to enter the recomputed exemption certified by the city assessor on the roll. The assessor shall give written notice of such recomputed exemption to the property owner, who may, if he or she believes that the exemption was recomputed incorrectly, apply for a correction in the manner provided by New York State Real Property Tax Law, Article 5, or any amended or superceding law thereto.

(4)  Alternate parking space becomes available in the immediate vicinity of the residence. 
(5)  The common council rescinds its declaration that the area is a congested area. 
(h)  Whether alternate parking space has become available for a particular permit holder shall be determined by the commissioner of public works, who shall notify the commissioner of public works of the location of the alternate space and the congested area or portion thereof which the alternate parking space shall serve. The issuing officer shall then notify all permit holders residing within the congested area or portion thereof for whom alternate space has become available that the alternate space exists, and the issuing officer shall thereby revoke the curb-to-sidewalk parking permit held by the notified residents.

(Code 1966, § 30-166; Ord. No. 7595, 8-14-02) 
Sec. 74-206. - Limited wastewater discharges. 
(a)  No person shall discharge or cause to be discharged into the public sewer system or into a natural outlet the following described substances: materials, waters, or wastes, if it appears likely in the opinion of the commissioner of public works that such wastes are likely to harm the public sewers, sewage treatment process, or equipment; to have an adverse effect on the receiving stream, or to otherwise endanger life, health or property, or constitute a nuisance. In forming his/her opinion as to the acceptability of these wastes, the commissioner of public works will give consideration to such factors as the quantities of subject wastes in relation to flows and velocities in the sewers, materials of which the sewer is constructed, the nature of the sewage treatment process, capacity of the sewage treatment plant, degree of treatability of wastes in the sewage treatment plant and other factors which are pertinent in the opinion of the commissioner of public works. The substances limited are as follows: 
(1)  Any liquid or vapor having a temperature higher than one hundred fifty (150) degrees Fahrenheit (sixty-five (65) degrees Celsius) or in such quantities that the temperature at the treatment works influent exceeds one hundred four (104) degrees Fahrenheit (forty (40) degrees Celsius). If, in the opinion of the commissioner of public works, lower temperatures of such wastes could harm either the sewers, sewage treatment process, or equipment; have an adverse effect on the receiving stream; or could otherwise endanger life, health or property or constitute or contribute to a nuisance, the commissioner of public works may prohibit such discharges. 
(2)  Any water or waste containing fats, wax, grease, or oils, whether emulsified or not, in excess of one hundred (100) mg/l. 
(3)  Any waste containing any substance that may precipitate, solidify, or become appreciably viscous at temperatures between forty (40) degrees Fahrenheit (fourteen (14) degrees Celsius) and one hundred (100) degrees Fahrenheit (thirty-eight (38) degrees Celsius). 
(4)  Any water or wastes containing metals and similar objectionable or toxic substances that exceed the limits specified as follows: 
Parameter Discharge Limit 
(mg/l) Arsenic 0.22 Cadmium 0.11 Chromium 2.77 Copper 1.30 Cyanide 1.20 Lead 1.10 Mercury 0.2 Nickel 1.90 Silver 0.43 Zinc 2.6  
The method and type of sampling shall be determined by the commissioner of public works based on the industry's type of operation. Users with multiple discharge outfalls shall not combine wastewater streams to report on wastewater characteristics. The limits may be amended from time to time as such amendment is deemed necessary by the commissioner of public works to protect the POTW, life or health. 
(5)  Any water or wastes that contain phenolics in excess of one-tenth parts per million by weight, or other taste- or odor-producing substances in such concentrations exceeding limits established by the commissioner of public works. 
(6)  Any radioactive wastes or isotopes of such half-life or concentrations as may exceed limits established by the commissioner of public works in compliance with applicable state, federal, or other public agencies having jurisdiction. 
(7)  Quantities of flow, concentrations or both, which constitute a slug. 
(8)  Materials which cause: 
a.  Unusual concentrations of inert suspended solids or dissolved solids such as but not limited to sodium chloride and sodium sulfate. 
b.  Unusual concentrations of wastes which are defined as wastes which exceed the characteristics of normal sewage. 
(b)  When the effluent characteristics of an industrial or commercial discharge exceed the maximum permissible limits and/or exceed the characteristics of normal sewage stated in subsection (a), the acceptability of such waste will be left to the engineering judgment of the commissioner of public works. If in the judgment of the commissioner of public works the admission of such wastewaters will not cause a violation of the SPDES permit or infringe upon a reasonable reserve of hydraulic-, organics-, or solids-handling capability of the city's facilities, a high strength permit to admit such wastes to the authority's facilities may be granted. The granting of admission of such wastes may require a permittee to not exceed an allocation in pounds or concentration determined by the commissioner. The commissioner reserves the right to change allocation if changes in hydraulic, organics, or solids handling infringe upon a reasonable reserve and/or SPDES violations occur. However, the commissioner of public works may require payment of a surcharge and/or additional permit fees for capital, operating and maintenance costs associated with conveyance and treatment of such waste.

Sec. 74-207. - Noncompliance. 
(a)  No person shall discharge or cause to be discharged to a trunk sewer, either directly or indirectly, any waste that creates a stoppage, plugging, breakage, any reduction in sewer capacity or any other damage to sewers. Sewerage maintenance expenses caused by such a discharge or any other expenses attributable thereto will be charged to the discharger by the commissioner of public works. 
(b)  Any refusal to pay the maintenance expenses, as stated in subsection (a) of this section duly authorized by the commissioner of public works shall constitute a violation of this article. 
(c)  Whenever the commissioner of public works determines that wastewaters discharged or proposed to be discharged to the city POTW may have a deleterious effect upon the system or sewers, processes, equipment or receiving waters or may otherwise create a hazard to life or constitute a public nuisance or may exceed the concentration limits prescribed for normal strength sewage, the city may: 
(1)  Reject the application for a permit to discharge the wastewater to the sewer; 
(2)  Require pretreatment and any other applicable requirements promulgated pursuant to section 307 of PL 92-500 as well as the most current state-mandated pretreatment requirements; 
(3)  Require control over the quantities and rates of discharge; 
(4)  Require surveillance and monitoring necessary to determine compliance with applicable pretreatment requirements; 
(5)  Require the development of compliance schedules and submission of attendant reports necessary to ensure compliance; 
(6)  Modify or revoke the discharge permit; 
(7)  Terminate sewer and water services; and 
(8)  Immediately halt any discharge of pollutants which poses an imminent and substantial endangerment to the health and welfare of persons or the environment.

The commissioner of public works shall require an SIU to establish an abatement time schedule to comply with any changes in the industrial wastewater permit. 
(c)  The commissioner of public works reserves the right to terminate or modify any permit issued under this article upon violation of any of the sections of this article or a permit term or condition as follows: 
(1)  After informal notice to the discharger in an emergency situation to immediately halt an industrial discharge which reasonably appears to present imminent endangerment to the health or welfare of persons. 
(2)  After the industrial user is notified and given an opportunity to respond in a nonemergency situation to halt or prevent an industrial discharge which presents or may present an endangerment to the environment or threatens to interfere with the satisfactory operation of the POTW. 
(d)  The commissioner of public works shall not issue a permit for any class of connection to the city's POTW unless there is sufficient capacity, not legally committed to other users, in the wastewater sewers and treatment facilities to convey and adequately treat the quantity of wastewater which the requested connection will add to the system. The commissioner of public works may permit such a connection if there are legally binding commitments to provide the needed capacity. 
(Code 1966, § 30-178) 
Sec. 74-241. - Permit transfer. 
    Wastewater discharge permits are issued to a specific user for a specific operation. A wastewater discharge permit shall not be reassigned or transferred or sold to a new owner, new user, different premises, or a new or changed operation.

(b)  Any discharger whose industrial wastewater discharge permit has been revoked shall immediately stop all discharge of any liquid carried wastes covered by the permit to any public sewer that is tributary to a sewer or sewer system of the city. The commissioner of public works may disconnect or permanently block from such system the industrial connection of any discharger whose permit has been revoked, if such action is necessary to ensure compliance with the order of revocation. 
(c)  Before any further discharge of industrial wastewater may be made by the discharger, he must apply for a new permit for industrial wastewater discharge, pay all charges that would be required upon initial application together with all delinquent fees, charges and such other sums as the discharger may owe to the city. Costs incurred by the city in revoking the permit and disconnecting the industrial sewer shall be paid for by the discharger before issuance of a new permit. 
(Code 1966, § 30-182) 
Sec. 74-245. - Prohibited waste discharges. 
    In most cases under this article, the concentration or amounts of any particular constituent which will be judged to be excessive or unreasonable cannot be foreseen, but will depend on the results of technical determination and action of regulatory agencies. A partial list of these constituents appear in division 5 of this article. However, as new regulations and requirements are promulgated by federal and state authorities, they too will become part of this article. 
(Code 1966, § 30-183) 
Sec. 74-246. - Pretreatment of industrial wastewater. 
(a)  Generally. Industrial users shall provide necessary waste treatment as required to comply with this article and shall achieve compliance with all federal categorical pretreatment standards within the time limitations as specified by the federal pretreatment regulations or specified in the permit, whichever is sooner. Any facilities required to pretreat wastes to a level acceptable to the city shall be provided, operated, and maintained at the user's expense. Detailed plans showing the pretreatment facilities and operating procedures shall be submitted to the commissioner of public works for review, and shall be acceptable to the commissioner of public works before construction of the facility. The review of such plans and operating procedures will in no way relieve the user from the responsibility of modifying the facility as necessary to produce an effluent acceptable to the commissioner of public works under this article. Any subsequent changes in the pretreatment facilities or method of operation shall be reported to and shall be acceptable to the commissioner of public works prior to the user's initiation of the changes. 
(b)  Compliance date report. Within 90 days following the date for final compliance with applicable pretreatment standards or, for a new source, following commencement of the introduction of wastewater into the POTW, any user subject to pretreatment standards and requirements shall submit to the commissioner of public works a report indicating the nature and concentration of all pollutants in the discharge from the regulated process which are limited by pretreatment standards and requirements and the average and maximum daily flow for these process units in the user facility which are limited whether the applicable pretreatment standards or requirements are being met on a consistent basis and, if not, what additional O&M or pretreatment is necessary to bring the user into compliance with the applicable pretreatment standards or requirements. This statement shall be signed by an authorized representative of the industrial user and certified to by a qualified professional. 
(c)  Periodic compliance report. 
(1)  Any user subject to a pretreatment standard, after the compliance date of such pretreatment standard or, for a new source, after commencement of the discharge into the POTW, shall submit to the commissioner of public works during the months of June and December, unless required more frequently in the pretreatment standard or by the commissioner of public works, a report indicating the nature and concentration of pollutants in the effluent which are limited by such pretreatment standards. In addition, this report shall include a record of all daily flows which during the reporting period exceeded the average daily reported flow. At the discretion of the commissioner of public works and in consideration of such factors as local high or low flow rates, holidays, budget cycles, etc., the commissioner of public works may agree to alter the months during which the reports are to be submitted. 
(2)  The commissioner of public works may impose mass limitations on users which are using dilution to meet applicable pretreatment standards or requirements, or in other cases where the imposition of mass limitations are appropriate. In such cases, the report required by subsection (c)(1) of this section shall indicate the mass of pollutants regulated by pretreatment standards in the effluent of the user. These reports shall contain the results of sampling and analysis of the discharge, including the flow and the nature and concentration, or production and mass where requested by the commissioner of public works of pollutants contained therein which are limited by the applicable pretreatment standards. The frequency of monitoring shall be prescribed in the applicable pretreatment standard. All analyses shall be performed in accordance with procedures established by the administrator pursuant to the Federal Clean Water Act, section 304(g) of the act and contained in 40 CFR 136 and amendments thereto or with any other test procedures approved by the administrator. Sampling shall be performed in accordance with the techniques approved by the administrator. 
(d)  Reporting requirements. Within 180 days after the effective date of a categorical pretreatment standard, or 180 days after the final administration decision made upon a category determination submission under 40 CFR 403.6(a)(4), whichever is later, existing industrial users subject to such categorical pretreatment standards and currently discharging to or scheduled to discharge to a POTW shall be required to submit to the commissioner of public works a baseline monitoring report in accordance with 40 CFR 403.12(b). 
(Code 1966, § 30-184) 
Sec. 74-247. - Control manhole. 
(a)  The commissioner of public works shall require to be provided and operated, at the industrial user's own expense, monitoring facilities to allow inspection, sampling, and flow measurement of the building sewer and internal drainage systems. The monitoring facility should normally be situated on the user's premises, but the commissioner of public works may, when such a location would be impractical or cause undue hardship on the user, allow the facility to be constructed in the public street or sidewalk area and located so that it will not be obstructed by landscaping or parked vehicles. 
(b)  There shall be ample room in or near such sampling manhole or facility to allow accurate sampling and preparation of samples for analysis. The facility, sampling, and measuring equipment shall be maintained at all times in a safe and proper operating condition at the expense of the user. 
(c)  Whether constructed on public or private property, the sampling and monitoring facilities shall be provided in accordance with the commissioner of public works's requirements and all applicable local construction standards and specifications. Construction shall be completed within 90 days following written notification by the commissioner of public works. 
(Code 1966, § 30-185) 
Sec. 74-248. - Industrial wastewater sampling, analysis and flow measurements. 
(a)  Monthly measurements of flow rates, flow volumes, BOD, phosphorus, chlorine demand and suspended solids for use in determining the annual industrial waste treatment charges and such measurements of other constituents deemed necessary by the commissioner of public works shall be made on all industrial wastewater discharges. All sampling, analysis and flow measurements of industrial wastewater shall be performed by an independent laboratory or by a laboratory of an industrial discharger, approved by the commissioner of public works. If performed by the city sewer personnel, an appropriate charge shall be paid by the discharger requesting the tests. Prior to submittal to the commissioner of public works of data developed in the laboratory of an industrial discharger, the results shall be verified by an authorized representative of the industrial user. 
(b)  All waste analysis shall be conducted in accordance with the appropriate procedure contained in EPA's Methods of Analysis of Water and Wastes, 1971 or most recent edition, or Standard Methods. If no appropriate procedure is contained therein, the standard procedure of the industry, or a procedure judged satisfactory by the commissioner of public works, shall be used to measure waste constituents. Any independent laboratory or discharger performing tests shall furnish the required test data or information on the test methods or equipment used, if requested to do so by the commissioner of public works. 
(c)  Upon demonstration by a user that the characteristics of the wastewater discharged by that user are consistent, the commissioner of public works may reduce the frequency as may be required by the city other than in this article, except in no case shall the frequency of monitoring be less than annual for the determination of compliance with pretreatment standards.

Sec. 74-250. - Required notice of change in volume or character of wastes. 
    Any industrial user who is connected to the city POTW and is discharging wastes thereto and who changes the volume or character significantly shall notify the commissioner of public works 15 days prior to the commencement of any alteration or construction that will result in a significant change in the volume or character of this discharge. The industrial user is required to reapply for a permit to identify change in volume or character of wastes. Notification of discharge under emergency conditions and spillage of wastewater not in accordance with standards shall be made as required in this article. 
(Code 1966, § 30-188) 
Sec. 74-251. - Accidental discharges. 
(a)  Each industrial user shall provide protection from accidental discharge of prohibited materials or other substances regulated by this article. Facilities to prevent accidental discharge of prohibited material shall be provided and maintained at the owner's or user's own cost and expense. Detailed plans showing facilities and operating procedures to provide this protection shall be submitted to the commissioner of public works for review, and shall be approved by the commissioner of public works before construction of the facility. Any user who commences contribution to the POTW after the effective date of the ordinance from which this article derives shall be permitted to introduce pollutants into the system for 90 days until accidental discharge procedures have been approved by the commissioner of public works. Review and approval of such plans and operating procedures shall not relieve the industrial user from the responsibility to modify the user's facility as necessary to meet the requirements of this article. If an accidental discharge occurs, it is the responsibility of the user to immediately telephone and notify the POTW of the incident. The notification shall include location of the discharge, the type of waste, the concentration and volume, and corrective actions. 
(b)  Within five days following an accidental discharge, the user shall submit to the commissioner of public works a detailed written report describing the cause of the discharge and the measures to be taken by the user to prevent similar future occurrences. Such notification shall not relieve the user of any expense, loss, damage, or fish kills, or any other damage to person or property nor shall such notification relieve the user of any fines, civil penalties, or other liability which may be imposed by this article or other applicable law. 
(c)  A notice shall be permanently posted on the user's bulletin board or other prominent place advising employees whom to call if an accidental discharge occurs. Employers shall ensure that all employees who may cause an accidental discharge to occur are advised of the emergency notification procedure. 
(Code 1966, § 30-189) 
Sec. 74-252. - Measuring, recording and sampling devices. 
    All meters and all other measuring and sampling devices installed or required to be used under this article and a discharge permit shall be readily accessible to the commissioner of public works. The owner of the property upon which any such measuring, recording or sampling device is installed shall pay for and shall remain responsible for its maintenance and accuracy. All repairs and calibrations thereto shall be made at the owner's cost, whether such repairs are made necessary by ordinary wear and tear or by other causes. These repairs shall be made within a reasonable time. After proper notification, the city can undertake such repairs, and the bills for the repairs shall be due and payable at that time and shall be collected in the same manner and shall be subject to the same penalties as are the bills for repairs of water meters. Energy for continuous operation, as required, shall be provided and paid for by the property owner. Flow record charts shall be changed by the user as required, shall be marked to show the time and totalizer register reading at the time of change, and shall be available to the commissioner of public works upon request. 
(Code 1966, § 30-190) 
Sec. 74-253. - Excessive discharge. 
    Except when expressly authorized to do so by an applicable categorical pretreatment standard, no user shall ever increase the use of process water or in any other way attempt to dilute a discharge as a partial or complete substitute for adequate treatment to achieve compliance with a categorical pretreatment standard under this article. The city may, from time to time, impose mass limitations on users who are using dilution to meet categorical pretreatment standards or in other cases where the imposition of mass limitations is appropriate. 
(Code 1966, § 30-191) 
Sec. 74-254. - Pretreatment standards. 
    In compliance with Public Laws 84-660 and 92-500 of the Water Pollution Control Act and amendments hereto, this article adopts and uses as a guide the national pretreatment standards and the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) pretreatment guidelines. The city recognizes that in some cases these pretreatment standards may not be sufficient to protect the operation of its POTW treatment plant or may make it unable to comply with the terms of its SPDES permit. In such cases, the city reserves the right to impose more stringent pretreatment standards, than those specified in the EPA regulations. 
(Code 1966, § 30-192) 
Sec. 74-255. - Special agreements. 
(a)  Nothing in this article shall be construed as preventing any special agreement or arrangement between the city and any user of the POTW whereby wastewater of unusual strength or character is accepted into the POTW and specifically treated, if required, subject to any payment or user charges, as may be applicable. 
(b)  In entering into such a special agreement the city shall consider whether the wastewater will: 
(1)  Pass through the POTW or cause interference; 
(2)  Endanger the public municipal employees; 
(3)  Cause POTW violation of the SPDES permit; 
(4)  Interfere with any purpose stated in section 74-62; and 
(5)  Prevent the equitable compensation to the city for wastewater conveyance and treatment, and sludge management and disposal. 
(c)  No discharge which violates the federal pretreatment standards will be allowed under the terms of such special agreements. 
(d)  Special agreements shall not be binding, if it is subsequently shown that such agreed wastewater discharges cause violations contained within this article. 
(e)  All requests for a special agreement shall be made in writing to the commissioner of public works. The written request shall contain all the reasons for characteristics, volumes, etc., of the wastewater proposed to be discharged to the city's POTW. 
(f)  The city shall retain the sole discretion to approve or disapprove all proposals for special agreements. These agreements shall, in addition, be subject to periodic review and testing. The city may, at its discretion and for reasonable cause, terminate these agreements at any time upon reasonable notice.

    In the absence of special circumstances, assessments against abutting property owners benefited by the extension of water and sewer lines shall be made pursuant to the Charter in the amounts and manner computed and set forth in this article. 
(Code 1966, § 30-78) 
Sec. 74-427. - General policy. 
(a)  Water mains. Whenever a water main is extended pursuant to a petition from one or more property owners, the water main shall be extended to the most distant property line of the lot or land of the most distant petitioner, unless such extension would not be in the best interest of the city. 
(b)  Sewer mains. Whenever a city sewer main is extended pursuant to a petition from one or more property owners, the sewer main shall be extended to the most distant property line of the lot or land of the most distant petitioner, unless such extension would not be in the best interest of the city. 
(Code 1966, § 30-78.1) 
Sec. 74-428. - Water lines in area included in corporation tax district. 
(a)  Water lines may be extended in the area included in the corporation tax district, upon a petition of the owners of a majority of the foot frontage abutting the street in which the line is to be laid. If the common council authorizes the installation of the water line extension, all the owners of the abutting property fronting on the street shall be assessed and shall pay a charge equal to the following: 25 percent of the full cost of construction, divided by the total assessable foot frontage of expansion (total foot frontage of expansion less city's share thereof, if any), prorated by the abutting property owner's foot frontage. The city shall bear the balance of the cost including that attributable to street intersections, sides of corner lots served from lines in other streets and the additional cost resulting from the installation of pipe larger than eight inches. If a nonpetitioning property owner is the owner of 50 percent or more of the front footage in an area in the inside corporation district where such an extension is requested and that property owner refuses to sign the petition, the petitioning property owners may execute an agreement with the city providing that they will assume that nonpetitioning property owner's share of the cost of the extension per front foot in accordance with such charge. However, if such nonpetitioning property owner or his successors later wishes to tap the line, such request will be granted only upon payment of such charge per front foot fee, which amount shall be duly reimbursed to the original petitioning property owners paying that share. The alternative procedure may apply where there is a property owner who owns 50 percent or more of the adjoining property who refuses to petition. 
(b)  Notwithstanding subsection (a) of this section, no water line extension shall be accomplished unless such extension has been found to be in the best interest of the city by the board of estimate and contract and has been approved by the common council.

Sec. 74-429. - Sewer lines in area included in corporation tax district. 
(a)  Sewer lines may be extended in the area included in the corporation tax district, upon a petition of the owners of a majority of the foot frontage abutting the street in which the line is to be laid. If the common council authorizes the installation of the sewer line extension, all the owners of the abutting property fronting on the street shall be assessed and shall pay a charge equal to the following: 25 percent of the full cost of construction, divided by the total assessable foot frontage of expansion (total foot frontage of expansion less city's share thereof, if any), prorated by the abutting property owner's foot frontage. The city shall bear the balance of the cost including that attributable to street intersections, sides of corner lots served from lines in other streets, manholes, and the additional cost resulting from the installation of pipe larger than eight inches. If a nonpetitioning property owner is the owner of 50 percent or more of the front footage in an area in the inside corporation district where such an extension is requested and that property owner refuses to sign the petition requesting the extension, the petitioning property owners may execute an agreement with the city providing that they will assume that nonpetitioning property owner's share of the cost of the extension per front foot in accordance with such charge. However, if such nonpetitioning property owner or his successors later wishes to tap the line, such request will be granted only upon payment of such charge per front foot fee, which amount shall be duly reimbursed to the original petitioning property owners paying that share. The alternative procedure may apply where there is a property owner who owns 50 percent or more of the adjoining property who refuses to petition. 
(b)  However, if a petition is received from owners of abutting property fronting on a street which have had sewer lines extended in the corporation tax district requesting that certain portions of their frontage be eliminated from the charge per front foot, on the grounds that their property is designated a wetland area and cannot be built on, as designated by law, the common council shall have the option of eliminating so much of the front footage as determined by the common council from the charge per front footage. The common council, however, shall also have the right, upon written petition of those property owners who have had a certain amount of their front footage eliminated or reduced from the per front footage charge, based on the wetlands designation, to reinstitute the front footage charge to those property owners when and if the wetlands designation on the property affected is either reduced or eliminated, thereby allowing construction of structures. 
(c)  Notwithstanding subsections (a) and (b) of this section, no sewer line extension shall be accomplished unless such extension has been found to be in the best interest of the city by the board of estimate and contract and has been approved by the common council.

(1)  Twenty-five percent of the full cost of construction, only if the following conditions are met: 
i.  The approved plans demonstrate that the water and sewer utilities to be extended meet city specifications, the water usage shall be metered, and that the subdivision include a minimum of five lots, which said lots meet the minimum lot size and density requirement for the applicable zoning district; and 
ii.  Prior to commencing the extension work, the developer acknowledges and agrees in writing that building permits for each lot must be received within one year of completion of work associated with the extension, or, in the event no building permit(s) is/are to be issued within one year of completion of the extension, the city assessor shall assess each lot according to his/her normal procedure to account for the increase in value attributed to said extension(s). The developer shall be solely responsible for the real property taxes associated with the increase assessment, until such time that the individual lot(s) are sold. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing contained herein shall preclude a developer from applying for and receiving the tax exemption provided for in this Code at section 66-119. 
For purposes of this section, the completion date of the extension work shall be determined by the commissioner of DPW or his designee and forwarded to the code enforcement office and the assessor's office. 
In the event the developer opts to pay 25 percent of the cost of an extension, the city shall bear the remaining 75 percent of the cost including that attributable to street intersections, sides of corner lots served from lines in other streets, manholes, and the additional cost resulting from the installation of pipe larger than eight inches. 
or 
(2)  The full cost of installation and to provide security to guarantee payment of the construction costs therefor, by posting with the city a surety bond issued by a surety company of national standing, the form and content thereof and the issuing company to be subject to approval of the corporation counsel. 
(b)  Where the extension of the sewer and water laterals to service a subdivision shall extend to provide service to properties outside of the boundaries of the subdivision and not serviced by the city, the developer shall provide to the city treasurer, upon the completion of the work, the total lineal foot of frontage of the project and the total cost per lineal foot of frontage. Frontage shall be certified by the commissioner of public works. The actual cost per lineal foot shall be determined by the city treasurer, by dividing the actual cost of construction by the actual number of lineal feet of frontage on both sides of such extension. A record of the cost per lineal foot shall be kept in the office of the city treasurer. If any property owner who owns property outside of the subdivision wishes to connect into the extension, he shall be charged and shall pay to the city treasurer an amount equal to the actual cost of the extension per lineal foot of frontage, times the number of lineal feet owned by the property owner fronting on the extension, plus seven percent per annum or pursuant to section 321 of the Charter based on the interest requirements of any bonds. The amount shall be retained by the city treasurer in a special fund and shall be distributed by him to the developer at least once each year. 
(c)  The term for which future connecters into the sewer or water extension shall be obligated to reimburse the developer for their share of the cost of the utility extension shall not exceed a period of ten years from the date on which the utilities are officially approved and accepted by the city.

Sec. 74-432. - Corner lots. 
    Under this article, corner property already served from an existing sewer or water line in a street other than that to be improved by an extension shall not be counted in determining the total front footage or a majority thereof, and the property shall be exempt subject to the limitations of section 321(6a) of the Charter. 
(Code 1966, § 30-82) 
Sec. 74-433. - Special assessment of trunk sewer lines. 
    Where the common council has deemed it necessary to construct or extend trunk sewer lines in the inside corporation line and where such has not been requested by the petition of the owners of a majority of the foot frontage abutting the street in which the line is to be laid as required by section 74-429, only those abutting property owners who elect to connect to the trunk sewer line shall be assessed on a per front foot basis as provided in section 74-429 at the time of their connection. The common council may, within its discretion, refuse to allow neighboring property owners to hook on to trunk sewer extensions. The assessment on a front foot basis shall be in addition to any and all other permits and charges required by the applicable sections of this Code.

ARTICLE VII. - BACKFLOW PREVENTION 

Sec. 74-501. - Legislative intent. 
    The purpose of this article is to safeguard potable water supplies from potential contamination by preventing backflow from a private water user's system into the public water system. It is the intent of this article to recognize that there are varying degrees of hazard and to supply the principal that the degrees of protection should be commensurate with the degrees of hazard. Further, it is the intent of the City of Rome, New York, to comply with the requirements of New York State Sanitary Code, Part 5, section 5-1.31, and any amendment or superseding laws thereto, which said section mandates the requirement that the supplier of water protect its water system in accordance with procedures acceptable to the commissioner of health. These mandated requirements are as set forth in the Cross-Connection Control Manual published by the New York State Department of Health (NYSDOH) and to that extent, the terms, conditions and provisions of the New York State Sanitary Code, Part 5, section 5-1.31, and any amendment or superseding law thereto, and the Cross-Connection Control Manual are incorporated in this article by reference as if more fully stated and shall be kept on file with the City of Rome Clerk's Office.

    [The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this article, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this section, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning:] 
    Air gap separation means a physical break between a supply pipe and a receiving vessel. The air gap shall be at least double the diameter of the supply pipe, measured vertically above the top rim of the vessel, in no case less than one inch. 
    Approved check valve means a check valve that seals readily and completely. It must be carefully machined to have free-moving parts and assured water tightness. The face of the closure element and valve seat must be bronze composition, or other non-corrodible material which will seat tightly under all prevailing conditions of field use. Pins and bushings shall be of bronze and other non-corrodible, non-sticking material, machined for easy dependable operation. The closure element shall be internally weighted or otherwise internally equipped to promote rapid and positive closure in all sizes where this feature is obtainable. 
    Approved double check valve assembly means two single independently-acting check valves, consisting of a tightly closing shut-off valve located at each end of the assembly and suitable test connections. This device must be approved as a complete assembly. 
    Approved reduced pressure zone device means a minimum of two independently acting check valves together with an automatically operated pressure differential relief valve located between the two check valves and properly located test cocks. In case of leakage of either check valve, the differential relief valve, by discharging to the atmosphere, shall operate to maintain the pressure between the checks at less than supply pressure. This device must also be approved as a complete assembly. 
    Approved water supply means any water supply approved by the New York State Department of Health. 
    Auxiliary supply means any water supply on or available to the premises other than the approved public water supply.

(Ord. No. 8820, 4-10-13) 
Sec. 74-503. - Requirements. 
(a)  Where protection is required. The water system shall be required to maintain a degree of protection commensurate with the degree of hazard regardless of whether the hazard is immediate or potential. This may include but not be limited to the presence and use of water boilers for heating systems. To that extent, the Cross Connection Control Manual published by NYSDOH shall be used as a guide to determine where protection is required. It shall be the responsibility of the water user to provide and maintain such required protection devices, and such devices shall be of a type acceptable to the New York State Department of Health. 
(b)  Type of protection. The protective device required shall depend on the degree of hazard as tabulated below. 
(1)  At the service connection to any premises where there is an auxiliary water supply handled in a separate piping system with no known cross contamination, the public water supply shall be protected by an approved reduced pressure zone device. 
(2)  At the service connection to any premises on which a substance that would be objectionable (but not necessarily hazardous to health) if introduced into the public water supply is handled so as to constitute a cross connection, the public water supply shall be protected by an approved double check valve assembly. 
(3)  At the service connection to any premises on which a substance of unusual toxic concentration or danger to health is or may be handled but not under pressure, the public water supply shall be protected by an air gap separation or an approved reduced pressure zone backflow prevention device. If an air gap is installed, it shall be located as close as practicable to the water meter, and all piping between the water meter and receiving tanks shall be entirely visible. A reduced pressure zone device when installed shall be located as close as possible to the property line. 
(4)  At the service connection to any premises on which any material dangerous to health is or may be handled under pressure, the public water supply shall be protected by an air gap separation. The air gap shall be located as close as practicable to the water meter and shall be accessible. 
(5)  At the service connection to any sewage treatment plant or sewage pumping station, the public water supply shall be protected by an air gap separation. The air gap shall be located as close as practicable to the water meter and all piping between the water meter and receiving tanks shall be entirely visible. If these conditions cannot be reasonably met, the public water supply shall be protected by an approved reduced pressure zone backflow prevention device and it shall be located as close as possible to the property line. 
(c)  Frequency of inspection of protective devices. It shall be the duty of the water user on any premises on which backflow protective devices are installed to have inspections by a NYS Department of Health certified backflow prevention device inspector made at least once a year, or more often in instances where successive inspections indicate repeated failure. Devices shall be repaired, overhauled or replaced at the expense of the water user whenever the devices are found to be defective. These tests shall be performed by a qualified backflow prevention device tester, and all test results will be provided to the water user within 72 hours after the test is made. Records of such tests, repairs, and overhaul shall also be kept and made available to the water users and the local health department upon request. 
(d)  Inspection after installation. The CEO or plumbing inspector shall make an inspection of the initial installation of any backflow protective devices required pursuant to this article to ensure compliance with this Code and the Cross Connection Control Manual. Devices shall be repaired, overhauled or replaced at the expense of the water user if the devices are found to be defective by the CEO or plumbing inspector. The fee for such inspection is set forth in Appendix B-Fee Schedule to this Code.

Sec. 74-504. - Penalties and recourse for non-compliance. 
(a)  No water service connection to any premise shall be installed or maintained by the water user, unless the water supply is protected as required by this Local Law and such other applicable local, state and federal laws, rules and regulations. 
(b)  If any facility served by a water system denies a water department person access to its premises for the purposes of determining if protection to the public water system is necessary, the following consequences applies: (Since great risk may be present) the City will require the installation of prevention devices designed for maximum risk, with the requirement that the number of devices installed shall equal the number of service lines. 
(c)  The following penalties shall be applicable for a violation of this Local Law: 
(1)  Failure to install the appropriate backflow prevention device within a prescribed time frame after the first notice: $350.00; 
(2)  Failure to install the appropriate backflow prevention device within a prescribed time frame after a second notice: $750.00;

ii.  Blockface is measured as that portion of a block or tract of land facing the same side of a single street and lying between the closest intersecting streets. 

(b)  Build-to dimensions. 
i.  A build-to line (BTL) is a set building line on a lot, located parallel to the applicable lot line, where the structure must be located. The building facade must be located on the build-to line. Facade articulation, such as window or wall recesses and projections are not counted as the building façade line, which begins at the applicable façade wall. 
ii.  A build-to zone (BTZ) is the area on a lot, located parallel to the applicable lot line, where a structure must locate within the minimum and maximum range of setback provided. The building facade must be located within the build-to zone. Facade articulation, such as window or wall recesses and projections are not counted as the building façade line, which begins at the applicable façade wall. 
iii.  A build-to percentage specifies the percentage of the building facade that must be located within a build-to line or build-to zone, as a percentage of the lot width. Facade articulation, such as window or wall recesses and projections, do not count against the required build-to percentage. 




(c)  Building height. 
i.  Building height is measured as the vertical distance measured from the established grade at the curb or, if no grade has been officially established at the curb, measured from the average level of the finished ground surface across the front of the building to: 
a.  The highest point of the roof for flat roofs or decorative mansard roofs. 
b.  To the deck line of mansard roofs. 
c.  To the mean height between eaves and ridge for gable, hip, and gambrel roofs.

iii.  A story is measured as that portion of a building included between the surface of any floor and the surface of the floor next above it, or if there be no floor above it, then the space between any floor and the ceiling next above it. 
iv.  A half-story is measured as that portion of a building between a pitched roof and the uppermost full story, said part having a ceiling height of seven feet or more for an area not exceeding one-half the floor area of said full story, and in which space not more than two-thirds of the floor area is finished off as rooms. 

(d)  Grade. 
i.  The elevation at which the finished surface of the surrounding lot intersects the walls or supports, or a building or other structure. If the line of the intersection is not reasonably horizontal, the finished grade in computing height of buildings and other structures or for other purposes will be the average elevation of all finished grade elevations around the periphery of the building, except that the finished grade cannot be higher than one-half of the floor to ceiling height. 
ii.  Highest adjacent grade means the highest natural elevation of the ground surface, prior to construction, next to the proposed walls of a structure. 

(e)  Gross floor area (GFA). The sum of the gross horizontal areas of the several floors of a building, including interior balconies, mezzanines, and basements, but excluding exterior balconies and attics. All horizontal dimensions of each floor area are measured to the exterior face of walls of each such floor, including the walls of roofed porches having more than one wall. 
i.  More specifically in computing the gross floor area, the following is included:

i.  Impervious surface coverage is a measure of intensity of land use that represents the portion of a site that is occupied by structures, pavement, and other impervious surfaces that do not allow for the absorption of water into the ground. Maximum impervious surface of a lot is calculated as the percentage of all impervious surface area against the total area of the lot. 
ii.  When pervious paving is used, it is calculated at a reduced percentage of impervious coverage, as follows unless another calculation is decided upon by the codes enforcement officer: 
a.  Pervious concrete and open grid paving systems are calculated as 50 percent impervious surface, provided that no barrier to infiltration is installed beneath the material. Open grid pavers must be installed on a sand base, without an impervious liner, to qualify. 
b.  Other types of pervious surfaces, such as permeable pavers, porous asphalt, or gravel-crete, are credited based upon field performance data and coefficients of permeability provided by the manufacturer. 
(g)  Lighting.

The following describes the types of lot configurations: 
i.  An interior lot is a lot other than a corner or through lot, bounded by two interior side lot lines. 
ii.  A corner lot is a lot situated at the junction of, and abutting on, two or more intersecting streets. 
iii.  A through lot is a lot which fronts upon two parallel streets, or which fronts upon two streets which do not intersect at the boundaries of the lot. 
iv.  A flag lot has two distinct parts: 
a.  The flag, which is the only building site and is generally located behind another lot. 
b.  The pole, which connects the flag to the street, and provides the only street frontage for the lot and at any point is less than the minimum lot width for the zone. 

(i)  Lot area. The total area within the boundaries of a lot, excluding any street right-of-way, usually defined in square feet or acres. No part of the area within a public right-of-way is included in the computation of lot area 
(j)  Lot coverage. That portion of the lot that is or may be covered by principal buildings and accessory structures. 
(k)  Lot depth. The distance measured from the front lot line to the rear lot line. For lots where the front and rear lot lines are not parallel, the lot depth is the depth calculated at the deepest part of the lot. 
(l)  Lot line. A line of record bounding a lot, as indicated on an approved, filed, and recorded subdivision plat, which divides one lot from another lot or from a public or private street or any other public or private space and includes: 
i.  A front lot line is the lot line separating a lot from a street right-of-way. The front lot line of a corner lot is the shortest street lot line of a corner lot abutting a street. A front lot line for a through lot is both lot lines that abut a street. 
ii.  A rear lot line is the lot line opposite and most distant from the front lot line, or in the case of triangular or otherwise irregularly shaped lots, an assumed line at least ten feet in length entirely within the lot, parallel to and at a maximum distance from the front lot line. 
iii.  On a corner lot, the corner side lot line is perpendicular or approximately perpendicular to the front lot line and is the longer street abutting lot line of a corner lot. 
iv.  On an interior lot, the interior side lot line is perpendicular or approximately perpendicular to the front lot line and abuts the adjacent lot. 
v.  A street lot line is any lot line separating a lot from a street right-of-way. 

(m)  Lot width. 
i.  For regular lots, lot width is the horizontal distance between the side lot lines measured at right angles to its depth along a straight line parallel to the required front setback, build-to line, or farthest build-to line comprising a build-to zone. 
ii.  For cul-de-sac lots, on those lots with a curved front lot line, lot width is measured as follows: 
a.  A line is drawn at the midpoint of the lot between the side lot lines, extending from the front lot line to the rear lot line. 
b.  Where the required front setback intersects the midpoint line at a right angle, a line is drawn perpendicular to the midpoint line. 
c.  Lot width is determined as the length of the line between side lot lines. 
d.  Where the side lot lines angle to increase width towards the rear, the required lot width measured at the required setback is 75 percent of the lot width required by the zoning district. 
iii.  For flag lots, lot width is measured at the required front setback as defined in this section. 

(n)  Sign dimension measurement. 
i.  Calculation of sign area. 
a.  For signs on a background, the entire area of the background is calculated as sign area, including any material or color forming the sign face and the background used to differentiate the sign from the structure against which it is mounted. Sign area does not include any supports or bracing. 
b.  For signs consisting of channel letters or freestanding logos, the sign area is calculated as the total area of each square, circle, rectangle, or triangle, or combination thereof, that encompasses each individual letter or logo. Sign area does not include any supports or bracing. 


c.  Window area for the purpose of calculating maximum window sign area is calculated as a continuous surface until divided by an architectural or structural element. Mullions are not considered an element that divides window area. Window signs printed on a transparent film and affixed to the interior or exterior of a windowpane or glass door are calculated as individual letters or logos, provided that the portion of the transparent film around the perimeter of the individual letters or logos maintains 100 percent transparency of the window. 

ii.  Measurement of sign height. For ground signs, sign height is measured as the vertical distance measured from the base of the sign to the highest point of the sign, including any decorative elements. 

iii.  Measurement of vertical clearance. For building-mounted signs, vertical clearance is measured as the vertical distance measured from the ground directly below the sign to the lowest point of the sign. 

iv.  Determination of number of sign faces. If the interior angle between two sign faces is 45 degrees or less, the sign area is computed as the area of one face only. If the angle between two sign faces is greater than 45 degrees, the total sign area is computed as the sum of the areas of the two faces. 

v.  Sign setback. A required sign setback is measured from the applicable lot line to the closest point of the sign. 

(o)  Sight triangle. A sight triangle is located at the intersection of the street or alley right-of-way, access easement, and/or driveway pavement, is measured at a line joining the points at a distance as follows: 
i.  Five feet from the point of the intersection of driveways and the lot line, as measured along the lot line and edge of driveway pavement. 
ii.  For intersections forming a 90 degree angle, 15 feet down each street measured along the right-of-way. 
iii.  For intersections forming an angle greater than 90 degrees, 15 feet down each street measured along the right-of-way, minus two feet for each 20 degrees or fraction thereof the angle exceeds 90 degrees. 
iv.  For intersections forming an angle less than 90 degrees, 15 feet down each street measured along the right-of-way, plus two feet for each 20 degrees or fraction thereof the angle is less than 90 degrees. 

(p)  Yards and setbacks. 
1.  General definitions. 
a.  A yard is the open space area between the building line, of a principal building and the adjoining lot lines, exclusive of facade articulation, such as window or wall recesses and projections. 
b.  A required setback is the required minimum distance a principal building must be located from a lot line, which is unoccupied and unobstructed by any projections of a principal building, unless permitted by this code. 
i.  A build-to zone or build-to line is considered a required setback. 
ii.  In the case of a build-to line it is where the principal building must be located. 
iii.  In the case of a build-to zone, it is the defined area (defined by minimum and maximum build-to lines) where the principal building must be located. 
c.  A setback may be equal to or lesser than a yard. 
d.  A setback is located along the applicable lot line for the minimum depth specified by the zoning district in which such lot is located. 
2.  Front yard and front setback. The front yard and front setback extend the full width of the lot between side lot lines measured perpendicular to the front lot line.

b.  Front setback. A front setback is the required minimum distance per the zoning district that a principal building must be located from the front lot line. 
c.  A front setback is measured from the right-of-way line. 
d.  Front setbacks on irregular lots are subject to the additional provisions: 
i.  On a lot with a radial (curved) front lot line, the required front setback, as measured from the right-of-way line follows the curve of the lot line. 
ii.  For flag lots, the front yard and setback is measured from the rear lot line of the lot that separates the flag portion of the lot from the street. 
e.  Front setback averaging. The average of the front setback of the adjacent lots on either side of a lot may be used to establish the required front setback. Averaging is based on the two adjacent lots or, in the case of a corner lot, two neighboring lots on the same blockface. In the case of a lot configuration where only one lot is available for averaging, the required front setback is that of the adjacent lot. 

3.  Interior side yard and interior side setback. The interior side yard and interior side setback extend along the interior side lot line between the front and rear yard or setback, measured perpendicular to the interior side lot line. 
a.  Interior side yard. An interior side yard is located between a principal building line and the interior side lot line.

ARTICLE VIII. - GB GRIFFISS BUSINESS REDEVELOPMENT DISTRICT 

Sec. 80-8.1. - Applicability. 
    Where the GB district contains regulations that conflict with the regulations of the zoning ordinance, the regulations of the GB district control. Where the GB district does not provide specific regulations, the applicable regulations of the zoning ordinance apply. 
(Ord. No. 9301A , 9-26-18) 
Sec. 80-8.2. - Purpose. 
    The GB Griffiss Park redevelopment district is intended to address the Griffiss Business and Technology Park within the city. The purpose of the district is to support the high quality, state-of-the-art business and technology center, within a work environment that blends operational efficiency with a pleasing atmosphere. In order to address the different functional and aesthetic character areas within the Griffiss Business and Technology Park, the GB district is divided into a series of sub-districts with tailored dimensional standards, permitted uses, and design and development standards. These sub-districts are: 
(a)  GB-RL Rome Lab/R&D/office campus sub-district. The GB-RL sub-district is designed to promote the expansion of Rome Lab and augment the cyber ecosystem. This area should support continued use and viability of remaining Department of Defense functions, mixed-use housing development along the Floyd Avenue corridor to attract and retain talent to the community. It will be the visual focus of the Griffiss Business and Technology Park and function as the epicenter of commerce. Architecturally attractive buildings will front on main thoroughfares. Brooks Road and Floyd Avenue will be developed as an urban pedestrian scale corridor with a strong visual emphasis placed on building facades, street planting, decorative paving, ornamental lighting and other streetscape amenities. 
Ample parking lots for office use are provided in back-lot locations, screened from pedestrian areas by the Brooks Road and Floyd Avenue buildings. This zone strongly prefers green infrastructure practices to reduce runoff, improve groundwater quality, shade paved surfaces, and enhance the workplace setting. Tree-lined streets, trails, and sidewalks are envisioned to create a pedestrian friendly live-work environment. 
(b)  GB-FI flex industrial development sub-district. The GB-FI sub-district is reserved for high tech and light industrial uses. Design consideration should be given to the overall aesthetic character of the Griffiss Business and Technology Park, the transition areas surrounding the Rome Lab/R&D/office campus, and general areas of public view. Large parcels are encouraged. Subdivisions should maximize parcel size and flexibility. 
(c)  GB-HT high technology corporate development sub-district. B-HT sub-district is the gateway site of the Griffiss Business and Technology Park. The design intent for this sub-district is to create a high profile, high quality, high technology business complex that capitalizes on the site's excellent visibility, superior access, and world-class infrastructure. Emphasis should be placed on the development of a corporate campus/complex where office, hi-tech manufacturing, research and development, and industrial suppliers are co-located. The site should not be subdivided unnecessarily, especially where other sites throughout the park could accommodate a less integrated project. The area should be used for advanced manufacturing corporate campus development, but may also be utilized for Class A office development. 
(d)  GB-MG Mohawk Glen development sub-district. The GB-MG sub-district is intended to support the reuse and expansion of existing support facilities and to provide new opportunities for training, recreation, health/wellness, and child care development. 
(e)  GB-SC service campus sub-district. One of the important assets of the Griffiss Business and Technology Park is the existing service and support facilities centrally located along Brookley/Geiger Road. Existing facilities include a childcare center, outdoor recreation fields, VA hospital, dormitories, special needs housing, a public high school, and a dental office. The intent of the GB-SC sub-district is to aid in the reuse and expansion of these facilities to support other park activities and provide new opportunities for education, training, recreation, and limited commercial development. Supporting facilities that enhance marketability of the entire redevelopment program should be encouraged to locate within this area. 
(f)  GB-CV conservation recreation sub-district. The GB-CV sub-district delineates certain open areas of value to the public within the park, represented in their natural, undeveloped, or unbuilt condition. It is recognized by the city that the principal use of these open areas is and ought to be the development, management, and utilization of the natural resources that exist in these areas. In order that this value be maintained and this use encouraged, a zoning sub-district is established to protect and enhance the natural resources, natural amenities, natural habitats of wildlife, watershed areas, public recreation areas, and the public health, safety and welfare by reducing the hardship and financial burdens imposed upon the city by the wanton destruction of resources, and the improper and wasteful use of open land and wooded areas. It is further the intent of this district to permit compatible uses and structures only at a low density and low impact as an added guarantee of compatibility with surrounding conservation. 
(g)  GB-TH technology heights sub-district. The GB-TH sub-district is intended to accommodate cyber security and information assurance firms (and similar uses) including large corporate firms, as well as smaller contractors and entrepreneurial startups. Continued focus should be placed on attracting IT and cyber security firms by leveraging the existing cyber security workforce, as well as the tremendous assets of the AFRL-Rome and the Griffiss Institute. Limited retail and commercial businesses are allowed in this zone as an accessory use to support a dynamic professional environment, for example, cafes, employer-sponsored daycare, or commissary. 
(Ord. No. 9301A , 9-26-18) 
Sec. 80-8.3 - Uses. 
(a)  Permitted uses and performance standards-General. 
i.  All uses must comply with all laws, statutes, regulations, and ordinances promulgated by the City of Rome, Oneida County, New York State, U.S. Government, or any other controlling jurisdictions. 
ii.  Uses which are considered "high hazard" as defined in part 700 of the state building code are permitted only in the manufacturing complex, light industrial, or heavy industrial sub-districts, and such use must be specifically approved by the planning board. 
iii.  Uses that exceed any of the standards contained in the zoning ordinance are permitted only within the GB-FI sub-district, and such uses must be specifically approved by the planning board. 
iv.  Uses that may interfere with airfield operations must be specifically approved by the Federal Aviation Administration. 
(b)  Use table. Table 80-8-1: GB district use matrix identifies the principal and temporary uses allowed within each subdistrict of the GB Griffiss Park Redevelopment District. P indicates that the use is permitted in the district. S indicates that the use is a special use in the district and requires special use approval. If a cell is blank, the use is not allowed in the district. In the case of temporary uses, a T indicates the temporary use is allowed in the district and may require approval of a temporary use permit.

(Ord. No. 9301A , 9-26-18) 
Sec. 80-8.5. - Design and development standards. 
(a)  Design standards. These design standards are intended to result in unified, harmonious and high quality architecture throughout the Griffiss Business and Technology Park without inhibiting the imaginative work of architectural designers and the individuality and propriety of tenant businesses. 
    Design methods are encouraged which tend to minimize the large-scale visual impact of buildings and create a complex of buildings compatible with the pedestrian scale of the streetscape. Developers and designers are encouraged to explore the creative possibilities on individual sites while seeking to maintain an architectural consistency with the basic patterns and elements throughout the Griffiss Business and Technology Park. 
    All buildings should be modern and progressive in design and concept while maintaining a quiet conservatism to avoid overshadowing surrounding architecture. Buildings should reflect and utilize the technology of today. 
i.  Sidewalks. 
a.  Sidewalk systems within a development parcel must be provided to meet the circulation requirements of on-site users. Sidewalks must provide safe, aesthetically pleasing, and all-weather efficient means of on-site movement and must be integrated into the overall architectural and site design concept. 
b.  Pedestrian facilities must comply with ADA standards. 
c.  Differentiation in paving materials and installation of architectural bollards is encouraged to delineate pedestrian uses from vehicular uses and to enrich the aesthetic character of the site. 
d.  Sidewalks must be installed on site regardless of its interconnectivity or lack thereof with the park wide sidewalk system. 
ii.  Site design criteria. 
a.  Entrance drives must be clearly visible and intuitively located to the first time visitor. 
b.  Passive solar design is encouraged. 
c.  Conflict between service vehicles, automobiles, and pedestrians should be minimized. 
d.  Main building entries must be emphasized by accent features including: 
(1)  Ceremonial entry porte-cochere. 
(2)  Plazas. 
(3)  Decorative planters and landscape plantings. 
(4)  Architectural walls. 
e.  Architecture and site development must be coordinated and unified. 
f.  Each phase of a development project should be able to attain a standalone visual unity. 
iii.  Building massing and form. 
a.  All buildings must have a horizontal appearance. Horizontal bands and facia must be used to minimize the vertical appearance of structures. 
b.  Building walls must be designed to create pedestrian scale exterior spaces by utilizing smaller wall segments, landscaping, wall texture and shadow lines. 
c.  Architectural design or signage which draws excessive attention from surrounding roadways is not acceptable. 
d.  Any structure that may interfere with airfield operations must be approved by the Federal Aviation Administration. 
iv.  Materials. 
a.  Building exterior wall materials. 
(1)  One primary material should be used. Materials which express permanence, substance, timelessness, and restraint are required. 
(2)  Materials should be sufficiently durable to guarantee low maintenance, stability and a reasonable life span. 
(3)  Materials must be consistent, or blend with existing materials in adjacent areas of the park. 
(4)  Pre-engineered buildings featuring predominantly metal painted exteriors are strongly discouraged except in the industrial development districts. 
(5)  Exposed drainage pipes on building fronts are not permitted, except if specifically approved by the planning board. 
(6)  Highly reflective surfaces that create hazardous glares for motorist and aircraft operators are discouraged. 
b.  Building roofs. 
(1)  When flat roof areas can be viewed from above, roof-mounted equipment should be installed in a neat and compact fashion and be of a color which blends with the visual background. 
(2)  Sloped roofs should be constructed of a traditional roof material. Corrugated metal, fiberglass, and asphalt are not allowed unless specifically approved by the planning board. 
(3)  Building parapets should be of such a height to screen roof-mounted mechanical equipment. If parapets cannot provide adequate screening, an unobtrusive screening device designed to appear integral with the building architecture may be used. Such screening devices must be constructed of durable materials and finished in a texture and color scheme consistent with the architectural character of the building. 
v.  Colors and textures. 
a.  Simple and consistent texture patterns are encouraged. 
b.  Color variations should be minimized. 
c.  Accent colors may be used to express corporate identity. 
(b)  Development standards. 
i.  GB-RL sub-district. 
a.  Architectural and site development/redevelopment should maintain an attractive visual quality compatible with the overall design character of the Griffiss Business and Technology Park. 
b.  Design consideration should be given to the visual attractiveness of development sites. Parking, storage, service and loading areas, mechanical and electrical equipment, utilities, and fuel storage facilities should be screened from public view by architecture, landform, and vegetation. Landscaping should be used to create a distinctive working environment and to enrich portions of the site visible to the public. 
c.  Pedestrian ways should be paved, lighted and tree lined to provide for and encourage pedestrian movement from place to place. 
d.  All exterior on-site utilities, including but not limited to drainage systems, sewers, gas lines, water lines, and electrical, telephone, and communications wires and equipment, must be installed and maintained underground. The intersection of the parkway and Brooks Road is the entry and primary civic space for the Rome Lab/R&D/office campus. 
e.  Sites facing Brooks Road and the parkway are reserved for office, R&D, and complementary high-profile commercial uses that will benefit from a high quality front door and contribute to the overall quality of the park. 
f.  A "build-to-line" requirement is established along Brooks Road. "Build-to-line" refers to the point within the parcel to which a building should be aligned, with the intent of establishing a consistent edge to the street and avoiding extensive setbacks where buildings are isolated and disconnected from the pedestrian street. Where existing buildings do not comply with the desired build-to-lines, landscape material can help maintain the pedestrian environment and landscaped pedestrian corridors will connect streets and building entrances. Any renovation or new construction should comply with the build-to-line. Building materials and the design of facades abutting the build-to-line should reflect a pedestrian scale environment. 
g.  Primary buildings, whenever possible, should front on Brooks Road. New buildings along Brooks Road should be a minimum of two stories in height, but may be a maximum of five stories in height.

(Ord. No. 9301A , 9-26-18) 
Sec. 80-8.10. - Landscape standards. 
(a)  Objectives. Landscaping is a design element that plays an important role in creating the park-like setting of the Griffiss Business and Technology Park. The intent of these landscape guidelines is to establish design criteria that create a distinctive working environment and unifies the site landscape with site architecture as well as the overall aesthetic character of the park. The park encourages the use of ornamental and shade trees as the primary landscape features, and discourages the use of groundcovers and formal planting beds. The intent is to maximize the ecosystem benefits provided by tree canopy and reduce the maintenance burden on building owners and park maintenance staff. 
(b)  Landscape maintenance. 
i.  Maintenance of unimproved sites. Undeveloped sites must be maintained in a clean and neat appearance. 
ii.  Maintenance of improved sites. 
a.  Planted areas should be watered, fertilized, and pruned on a regular basis to maintain a neat and orderly appearance. Formal lawns must be maintained at a minimum height of two inches and a maximum height of five inches. All sites must be kept clean and should remain free of trash, debris, and brush. 
b.  All dead or dying plant materials must be replaced on a timely basis to maintain the designed intent of the approved planting plan. 
(b)  Landscaping requirements. 
i.  Landscaping within the public right-of-way. 
a.  The public road corridors form the primary access into the park, and as such, landscape treatment is critical to establish the desired image of the Griffiss Business and Technology Park. Consequently, improvements within these corridors are subject to the highest level of regulation. 
b.  Landscape development within the public right-of-way will include sidewalks, street trees, lighting, signage, grading, and site entries. The streetscapes at intersections are to be treated with elements of enriched paving, lighting and accent planting. 
(1)  Parkway-Main entries to the Rome Lab/R&D/office campus areas at Brooks Road, the industrial area at Ellsworth Road, and the manufacturing complex area at Hangar Road will be emphasized by the use of distinctive paving, tree planting, signage and lighting. 
(2)  Local streets-Standard lighting, street trees, signage and sidewalks will be installed. 
c.  All landscape maintenance will be provided by the property owners. 
d.  Landscape within the right-of-way will be installed as a continuous linear system. Demolition of portions of this system will be necessary at vehicular access points during construction of the site access drives. It is the responsibility of individual property owners to reconstruct any grading, tree planting, paving, and streetscape amenities disturbed during construction. 
ii.  Landscaping within setback areas. 
a.  Development within the required setback areas is dependent on the needs of individual property owners and tenants and thus is provided a greater degree of flexibility than within the public right-of-way. Landscape guidelines within these areas primarily concern parking areas, building fronts and entries, and rear and side property line buffering. 
b.  Landscape treatment within the front yard should focus around building facades visible from surrounding streets as well as entry areas. The use of ornamental planting, lighting, signage and other site amenities is encouraged to enrich front yard areas and building entries. 
c.  It is intended that landscape development within the side and rear yard setback area result in a distinct sense of enclosure and informality while remaining subordinate to the right-of-way and front yard landscaping. Berming is encouraged to reduce the visibility of parking lot, service, loading, storage and maintenance areas from off-site locations. 
iii.  Parking lots. See article XV for parking lot landscape requirements. 
(c)  Approved plant materials. See urban plantings list on file at the city. 
i.  Other site plantings. The intent of landscaping within individual sites is to create visually pleasing and imaginative settings that are unified and harmonious with the overall character of the Griffiss Business and Technology Park. Landscape designers are encouraged to be creative in the selection of plant materials. The following should be considered in selection of plant materials: 
a.  Maintenance requirements should be an important consideration. 
b.  Materials must be consistent, or blend with existing materials in adjacent areas of the park with the exception of plants intended to serve as a visual accent. 
c.  Plant size, color, texture, and form should be used to enhance wildlife corridors and plant pollination strategies. 
d.  Plant selection should consider complementary materials with differing periods of spring flower and fall color to maximize seasonal variation. 
(Ord. No. 9301A , 9-26-18)

E.  Regulations pertaining to subareas. The following regulations shall apply to property within each corresponding subarea. 
Subarea A-Mixed Use Commercial and Residential. 
    The northern area is defined by +30-acre parcel fronting Floyd Avenue and the Mohawk River (north of the electrical transmission right-of-way), and includes the Floyd Avenue commercial corridor from just west of the Mohawk River bridge stretching to Griffiss Business and Technology Park; where the plan prescribes mixed-uses including commercial, residential, and recreation. The multi-story buildings on the 30 acre parcel should front on Floyd Avenue, extending the existing commercial corridor and paying close attention to the streetscape aesthetic. Proposed buildings should extend along the Woodhaven entrance drive as much as practical to pull the streetscape aesthetic interior to the site. The western building should, ideally, interact with the Mohawk River, engaging the public riverfront and trail. Commercial activities should be encouraged to spill outside the building by providing semi-private patios and outdoor spaces that maximize the interplay of humans and nature. Pedestrian connections and outdoor amenities are vital components of any site plan proposed for the northern section. 

    The multi-family housing in this area should be laid out with a walkable concept including pedestrian connections to the Mohawk River Trail and the proposed commercial uses. 
Subarea B-Single-Family Residential. 

    The central area, between the overhead electrical transmission lines and the realigned Park Drive, provides for flexibility to potential developers. This subarea provides a balance between the community's desire for single-family housing with the desire for natural or open space areas and trails. This subarea allows for flexibility to subdivide or sell acreage as the market demands. The style of this development within this subarea should include small lots consistent with lot sizes in the adjacent neighborhoods. Sidewalks and trail spurs must be included to enhance pedestrian and bicycle connectivity and accessibility for the mobility impaired. 
Subarea C-Mid-Density Campus. 
    The southern area, southeast of Park Drive, is comprised of moderate density residential allowing for townhomes and apartments. This area could be proposed as a senior living community or be open to a broad spectrum of residents. Uses could include low maintenance properties, access to sidewalks and trails, safe and well-lit open spaces, and accessibility to minor conveniences (i.e., coffee shop, small retail). Sidewalks and trails should connect within and to the adjacent neighborhoods. 
Subarea Buffer and Open Space. 
    The buffer and open space areas shall be owned and controlled by the City of Rome. This subarea should include augmenting the urban canopy and preserving the continuity of natural areas. Further this subarea should provide circulation for non-motorized users and act as a "greenbelt."

Nothing prohibits excavation incidental to construction of a driveway, private road, walk, wall, or building, or part of one or accessory to, where required building permits have been issued and where the excavation occurs on the same or contiguous parcel as the construction. In cases of a real estate subdivision, the cut and fill of on-site soils are expected to be in balance and not hauled off the building site, except as provided below. Provisions must be made to restore an effective cover crop to any area of land from which topsoil has been removed or covered with fill within the first growing season following the start of such operation. 
b.  In the case of grading in conjunction with an approved subdivision or site plan where an NYS DEC mining permit is not required and where 100 cubic yards or less of soil is to be removed from the site, a grading permit is required, which must be issued by the codes enforcement officer. 
ii.  General farming exception. Nothing prohibits excavation for the purpose of moving topsoil, soil, or earth from one location to another location on the same or contiguous parcel for grading, improving, or draining the land, provided that the excavation is necessary for, or accessory to, farming operations. 
iii.  Sewage disposal and underground storage tanks. Nothing prohibits excavation for sewage disposal systems or underground storage tanks. 
iv.  Fire and farm pond exception. Nothing prohibits construction of private fire and farm ponds with a tributary drainage area of less than one square mile, farm ditches, and fire ponds. However, construction must meet all criteria required by the NYS DEC concerning classified waterways. 
v.  Mines less than 100 cubic yards. The extraction and removal off-site of less than 100 cubic yards within 12 consecutive months does not require a permit. 
(e)  District location restriction. An NPH district is prohibited within a wetlands area designated by the state environment conservation department (DEC) or the United States Army Corps of Engineers or in an area that has been designated a critical environmental area (CEA). 
(f)  Requirements and procedures for rezoning. 
i.  An application for rezoning to an NPH district must be made in accordance with the provisions of this article and the zoning amendment requirements of this code. 
ii.  Approval by the state of a permit for a use allowed in the NPH district does not constitute approval by the city for a map amendment. 
iii.  The process for compliance with the State Environmental Quality Review (SEQRA), Environmental Conservation Law and regulations as required by this code for the proposed rezoning is independent of that which is required in accordance with an application to the state for a permit to operate a specific use in the NPH district. The common council will serve as lead agency under SEQRA with respect to the application for rezoning. Notwithstanding any other provisions of the City Code to the contrary, including provisions setting time limitations for the taking of actions, the common council is not required to take any action with respect to an application for the establishment of an NPH district if an application is not complete; provided, however, that nothing in this subsection may be construed to require the city to take action merely because an application is complete. An application for rezoning is complete upon the earlier of: 
a.  The date that the common council, as lead agency, determines that a draft environmental impact statement (DEIS) must be dispensed with and the negative declaration is issued upon finding that the proposal will not significantly affect the environment. 
b.  The date that a DEIS has been filed and accepted by the lead agency as satisfactory in scope and content. 
iv.  An application for amendment, together with a metes and bounds description of the parcels for which rezoning is sought, must be submitted by the applicant to the city clerk. The applicant must furnish the city with a copy of the application for any permits that the applicant plans to submit to NYS DEC. 
v.  The city clerk must transmit the application to the common council, which will determine whether or not it will entertain the application for rezoning. The council's decision not to entertain the request for rezoning is not subject to the SEQRA process (6 NYCRR 617.3(d)). In the event that the common council determines that it will entertain the application, it will refer the application, environmental assessment form, and all other supporting documentation filed by the applicant to the planning board for its recommendation as to the classification of the action under SEQRA. 
vi.  Upon receipt of the classification recommendation of the planning board, the common council must conduct a coordinated review of the application for SEQRA purposes. After making a determination of significance, and after determining the application is complete, the common council must refer the application to the planning board. 
vii.  Any applicant seeking to rezone an area to the NPH district has the burden of demonstrating to the satisfaction of the common council that the criteria specified herein have been met. Prior to the city incurring any extraordinary costs necessary for its deliberations and chargeable to the applicant, the planning board or the common council must advise the applicant of said costs and obtain the applicant's agreement to bear such costs. In addition, the applicant must procure and provide other data, such as surveys and maps, which may be required. The applicant must also furnish the planning board with all information in his/her possession that might affect its decision. 
(g)  Review criteria for rezoning. 
i.  The planning board, before making its recommendation, and the common council, before making its determination, must assess the effect of the proposed rezoning on the general health, safety, and welfare of residents. 
ii.  The city's determination must consider, but not be limited to, the following: 
a.  Impact on local traffic. 
b.  Aesthetic and natural environment of the area and surrounding areas. 
c.  Impact upon groundwater, residential, or commercial water supply, drainage, nearby wetlands, and nearby critical environmental areas. 
d.  Impact on contiguous landowners. 
e.  The character and compatibility with surrounding land uses before, during and after the proposed operations. 
f.  Proposed buffers, setbacks from adjoining landowners, hours of operations and operational procedures to lessen dust, noise and visual impact. 
iii.  The planning board and the common council must also consider whether the proposed rezoning would result in an operation with: 
a.  Setbacks closer than: 100 feet from roads and 250 feet from property lines; 500 feet from occupied structures; 1,000 feet from existing homes, schools, playgrounds, or public gathering places; and 500 feet from a designated wetland or critical environmental area. An owner-occupied residential structure within a NPH District applicant is exempt from the setback requirements. 
b.  Sand or gravel processing equipment within 1,000 feet of any non-owner-operator residence, school, playground, or public gathering place. 
iv.  The NPH district is intended to be the land use zoning classification for proposed operations only during the period of time when such uses are in operation. After completion of said operations, including reclamation efforts for a mining use, or non-use for a one-year period, the district must revert back to the pre-application land use district. 
v.  If an application for rezoning of a parcel of land to an NPH district is denied, reapplication for same parcel cannot be entertained for a one-year period from the date of disapproval. 
(h)  Special permit requirement. Before granting a special use permit for a proposed use within an NPH district, the board of appeals must determine that: 
i.  All lands to be covered by the permit are owned, leased, rented, or otherwise controlled by the applicant. 
ii.  The proposed use will not endanger the stability of adjacent structures nor constitute a detriment to public health, safety, or welfare by reason of excessive dust, noise, traffic, or other conditions before, during or after operation. 
iii.  The operation will not substantially encircle any residential or other use without the written consent of the owners and residents. 
iv.  The operation will not adversely affect any wetland, watercourse, or residential, commercial, or municipal water supply or sewage disposal system. 
v.  The operation will not adversely affect any valuable environmental, cultural, or historic features in the area. 
vi.  Whether screening is required in such a manner as to screen all activities from public view to the extent feasible. 
vii.  No NPH district operation-related activities will be conducted within: 
a.  One thousand feet of any residence. 
b.  One thousand feet of any school, playground, or public gathering place. 
c.  Five hundred feet of any designated wetlands as determined by NYSDEC. 
d.  One hundred feet of any right-of-way. 
e.  Two hundred and fifty feet of any property line or boundary. 
viii.  The slope of material in such topsoil, sand gravel, clay, and other earth cannot exceed the normal angle of repose of such material. 
ix.  No mining or other mine-related activities will be conducted on Sundays or holidays, nor between the hours of 7:00 p.m. and 7:00 a.m. on Mondays through Saturdays. Further restrictions may be placed on the permit, as may be deemed in the best interest of the public as determined by the board of appeals. 
x.  Appropriate transportation facilities, including roads and bridges, exist, or can be economically provided, to safely transport natural products mined within the city. 
(i)  Additional special use permit requirements. 
i.  The board of appeals may impose conditions on a special use in its issuance of a special permit that, in its opinion, are reasonable and necessary to promote the health, safety, and welfare of the community, including preservation of the general character of the neighborhood in which the use is located. By the way of illustration and not limitation, such a condition could restrict the hours of operation of any special use. 
ii.  If the board of appeals determines that proposed change or modification to an existing special use is substantial, the board of appeals must hold a public hearing as if for a new special use. A change or modification will be deemed substantial if the proposal significantly changes the use, design, character, or potential impacts of the existing lot or structure. 
iii.  The board of appeals may require an annual report for any special use to ensure that the use is in compliance with all applicable requirements and conditions of approval. 
iv.  Upon a determination by the board of appeals that there are sufficient grounds to warrant a review, the board of appeals may initiate a review of the operation of any special use and may call for a public hearing to determine whether the use is in compliance with applicable standards and conditions. Findings of noncompliance will result in the property owners being required to submit a compliance schedule unless the board of appeals determines there is a cause for emergency action. Any further violations will result in revocation of the special use permit. 
(j)  Reclamation standards and requirements for mining operations. Before issuing a special use permit, the board of appeals must find that the reclamation plan meets the following standards and requirements. 
i.  Drainage and water resource protection. All final site drainage must be designed, sloped, revegetated, or treated by other measures so that drainage patterns, including volume and outflow points, will be the same as before the mining occurred, unless an alteration of patterns would improve drainage in the surrounding area. Measures must be specified to prevent erosion and sedimentation of wetlands, watercourses, and ponds, and an erosion and sedimentation control plan recommended by the Federal Soil Conservation Service (SCS) must be approved by the board of appeals. The pre-mining quality of any underlying aquifer must be preserved. 
ii.  Slopes. No slope may be left with a grade steeper than one foot vertical on three feet horizontal for gravel or its normal repose slope for other minerals. 
iii.  Reclamation material. All restoration material used in the final grading of the site must be free from refuse or toxic contaminants and must be compacted as much as is practical, such as by installation in layers. Stumps, boulders, and nontoxic debris generated by any mining operation must be removed from the site and disposed of or buried and covered with a minimum of two feet of soil. 
iv.  Soil cover. Final soil depths and types must be appropriate for the expected reuse specified in the application. Subsoil and topsoil must be respread over the excavated area to a minimum depth of one foot six inches of topsoil and six inches of subsoil. If the original soil depth was less than one foot, restoration must be to a minimum of the original depth. This restored soil must be treated with lime and fertilizer and seeded with a grass or legume mixture prescribed by the Federal Soil Conservation Service. 
v.  Revegetation. Revegetation of the site to control dust and erosion and to restore the natural character is required. The operator must maintain the vegetation for two growing seasons to ensure viability. Standards and specifications for revegetation must be in accordance with recommendations of the Federal Soil Conservation Service approved technical guides for actual area seeding. 
vi.  Bonding for reclamation. The board of appeals must require the permit holder to post a bond in an amount at least sufficient to cover the costs of the reclamation plan. 
(k)  Grading permits. 
i.  The codes enforcement officer is authorized to issue a grading permit for the removal of not more than 100 cubic yards of fill in conjunction with an approved subdivision or site plan where a permit is not required pursuant to the Mined Land Reclamation Law. Separate permits for a single lot must not total more than 100 cubic yards within any ten-year period. Where more than 100 cubic yards are to be removed, a special use permit is required. No excavation of soil, natural products, or rock may adversely affect natural drainage or the structural stability or safety of adjoining buildings or lands. Excavations must not create objectionable dust or noise nor create any kind of noxious or injurious substance or cause a public hazard. 
ii.  No finished slope may be created with holes or hills, or which slopes down from any adjoining property steeper than one foot vertical or two feet horizontal, and no fill or embankment may be created which slopes upward from any adjacent property lines steeper than one foot vertical to three feet horizontal, unless an adequate retaining wall is constructed in accordance with plans prepared by a professional engineer licensed to practice in New York State.

(Ord. No. 9301A , 9-26-18) 
Sec. 80-11.7. - Designated main streets. 
    Designated main streets have specific design standards to ensure a higher level of design quality, as well as context-sensitivity within the city's key "main street" corridors, consistent with the recommendations of the city's "Main Streets Program Design Guidelines" and "Storefront Design Manual." The goals are to improve the visual quality of the city's "main street" corridors, preserving and enhancing the city's unique urban character, improving walkability and pedestrian safety, encouraging economic development, and retaining the visual character and character-defining features of existing historic buildings within the district. 
(a)  Commercial building façade standards. 
i.  New construction must maintain consistency with existing development through designs that are of a similar scale and proportion to adjacent buildings. 
ii.  New construction must acknowledge existing building widths by providing a division of the façade into visible building increments or modules no larger than the average width of existing buildings on the block. 
iii.  Where a block is defined by a continuous street frontage, any proposed new building or infill construction must maintain such continuous street wall by building from side lot line to side lot line, unless access is required for rear yard parking. 
iv.  Street abutting building facades must provide a building entrance no less than once every 50 feet. 
(b)  Commercial building fenestration standards. 
i.  If located in a C-1 or C-3 district, the ground floor of the front façade must maintain a transparency of 60 percent measured between two and 14 feet in height from grade. 
ii.  If located in a C-2 district, the ground floor of the front façade must maintain a transparency of 40 percent measured between two and 14 feet in height from grade. 
iii.  A bulkhead or knee-height wall a minimum of 18 inches and a maximum of 36 inches in height is required along any street abutting façade to provide a definable base and give visual weight to required ground floor glazing. 
(c)  Site design. 
i.  Parking may be located along the side or to the rear of the building. Parking is prohibited between the front building façade and front lot line. 
ii.  When parking is located adjacent to a building, a continuation of the street wall must be created through the use of a solid masonry wall designed to complement the building, or combination of landscape and an open decorate fence as follows: 
a.  A solid masonry wall must be between three and four feet in height. An open, decorative feature may be included in the design of such a wall, and may extend up to a maximum height of five feet. A masonry wall must employ the same quality materials required of the primary building. 
b.  An open decorative fence must be between four and six feet in height, and must be constructed of high-quality durable material such as wrought iron. 
c.  New construction within a designated main street district must be built at the lot line; a zero foot front build-to line is required to enhance the strong pedestrian-oriented sense of place. Corner lot buildings also require a zero foot build-to line at the corner lot line. 
(d)  Residential design standards. New single-family detached, two-family, and single-family attached dwellings, and any additions to such structures, must be constructed to be generally compatible with other existing dwellings on the same block frontage within 200 feet. This requirement is satisfied by constructing the dwelling so that at least four of the following features are similar to the majority of other dwellings within 200 feet on the block frontage (both sides of the street): 
i.  Roof style and overhang (e.g., gable, mansard, hip, A-frame, or flat). 
ii.  Garage orientation and access (e.g., attached/front loaded, attached/side-loaded, or detached/alley-loaded) 
iii.  Building massing (e.g., ranch with attached garage, two-story with attached garage, bungalow) 
iv.  Floor area: 
a.  Single-family dwelling. The floor area of the proposed dwelling unit shall be no less than 80 percent and not more than 145 percent of the average floor area of other single-family dwelling units, as indicated in the city tax assessor's records, within 200 feet of the subject lot, including single-family dwelling units along both sides of the street of the same block. 
b.  Two-family dwelling. The floor area of the proposed dwelling unit shall be no less than 80 percent and not more than 145 percent of the average floor area of other two-family dwelling units, as indicated in the city tax assessor's records, within 200 feet of the subject lot, including two-family dwelling units along both sides of the street of the same block. 
v.  Front porches (existence of). 
vi.  Exterior building material. 
vii.  Pattern of window and door openings (e.g., central door and four windows; offset door and three windows).

i.  Purpose. It is recognized that there are some uses that, because of their very nature, have serious objectionable operational characteristics when several of them are concentrated under certain circumstances that produce a deleterious effect upon adjacent areas. Special regulation of these uses is necessary to ensure that adverse effects will not contribute to the blighting or downgrading of the surrounding neighborhood. The primary reason for regulation is to prevent a concentration of these uses in any one area that could create adverse neighborhood effects. 
ii.  Location restrictions. Adult entertainment businesses are prohibited within: 
a.  One thousand feet of any residential zoning district or any single-family, two-family, or multi-family dwelling at the time such adult entertainment business is established, including structures devoted to both residential and commercial or business purposes. 
b.  One thousand feet of any preexisting public or private school. 
c.  One thousand feet of any preexisting place of worship or other religious facility or institution. 
d.  One thousand feet of any preexisting public park. 
e.  The distance provided hereinabove shall be measured by following a straight line, without regard to intervening buildings, from the nearest point of the property parcel upon which the adult entertainment business is to be located to the nearest point of the parcel of property or the land use district boundary line from which the adult entertainment business is to be located.

(aa)  Wireless telecommunications. 
i.  Purpose. The city recognizes the increased need and demand for wireless communications transmitting facilities. Often these facilities require the construction of a communications tower. The intent of these provisions is to protect the city's interest in siting telecommunications facilities in a manner consistent with sound land use planning by: 
a.  Minimizing visual effects of facilities through careful design, siting, and vegetative screening. 
b.  Avoiding potential damage to adjacent properties from tower failure through engineering and careful siting of tower structures. 
c.  Maximizing use of any existing towers, buildings, and structures. 
d.  Allowing wireless service providers to meet their technological and service objectives for the benefit of the public. 
ii.  Required approvals. 
a.  Lease approval. On municipal or government owned property, a telecommunications facility is permitted upon execution of a lease with the municipality or the government entity and upon the issuance of a building permit. For any property owned by the city, all leases must be approved by a majority vote of the common council and must address relevant issues of safety, height, aesthetics, setbacks, future expansions of the facility, and colocation. A telecommunications facility on municipal or government-owned property does not require review or approval from the planning board. 
b.  Site plan approval-Standard site plan. In the I-G and WR districts, installation of telecommunications antennas and supporting facilities that do not include the construction of a new tower is permitted upon standard site plan approval from the planning board, per section 80-19.4, and upon the issuance of a building permit. 
c.  Expanded site plan approval. Installation of a new telecommunications tower in the I-G and WR districts, and installation of telecommunications towers, antennas, and supporting facilities of any kind in all other zoning districts requires expanded site plan approval from the planning board, per section 80-19.4, and upon the issuance of a building permit. 
iii.  Development standards. 
a.  Setbacks. All telecommunications towers must be set back from all adjacent property lines a sufficient distance to safeguard the general public and/or adjacent property. In the absence of any evidence supporting a greater or lesser setback distance, a setback of the tower from any adjacent residential property line equal to the tower height and a setback of at least 50 feet from any other adjacent property line is deemed adequate. The required setbacks may be decreased in those instances when the applicant has submitted plans for a tower designed to minimize damage to adjacent property in the event of a structural failure. Supporting facilities and guy anchors must comply with the minimum setback requirements of the underlying district. 
b.  Safety. 
(1)  A road turnaround and two parking spaces must be provided to assure adequate emergency and service access. 
(2)  All towers and guy anchors, if applicable, must be enclosed by a fence not less than six feet in height or otherwise sufficiently secured to protect them from trespassing or vandalism. 
(3)  The applicant must comply with all applicable state and federal regulations including, but not limited to, FAA and FCC regulations. 
c.  Height. 
(1)  Towers. The height regulations otherwise applicable in the underlying district do not apply to towers, provided that the applicant submits sufficient information to justify the proposed height as the minimum necessary to achieve its coverage objectives. 
(2)  Building-mounted antennas. Telecommunications antennas mounted on buildings or structures may be no higher than 60 feet from the ground or the building height, whichever is less, unless the applicant submits sufficient information to justify a greater height as the minimum necessary to achieve its coverage objectives. 
d.  Design and siting. 
(1)  The planning board may require that the tower be designed and sited so as to avoid, if possible, application of Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) lighting and painting requirements, it being generally understood that tower should not be artificially lighted, except as required by the FAA. 
(2)  Telecommunications towers, antennas, and supporting facilities must be situated in a manner that minimizes their proximity and visibility to residential structures. 
(3)  Every effort is made to conceal telecommunications towers, antennas, and supporting facilities within or behind architectural features to limit its visibility from public ways and residential uses while still allowing it to perform its designated function. 
(4)  Telecommunications antennas mounted on a roof must be stepped back from the front facade in order to limit their impact on the building's silhouette. 
(5)  The telecommunications antennas mounted on a building must blend in with the existing building's architecture and, if over five square feet, must be painted or shielded with material that is consistent with the design and materials of the building. 
(6)  Antenna and supporting electrical and mechanical equipment must be of a neutral color that is identical to or closely compatible with the colors of the supporting structure so as to make the antenna and related equipment as visually unobtrusive as possible. 
(7)  A tower must be either blue/gray in color, have a galvanized finish or be colored appropriately to the extent that the tower is as unobtrusive as possible, unless otherwise required by the FAA. Accessory facilities should maximize use of building materials, colors, and textures designed to blend with the natural surroundings. 
(8)  No tower must contain any signs except signs displaying contact information and safety instructions. Such signs must not exceed five square feet in surface area. 
e.  Landscape and screening. The planning board may require reasonable landscaping consisting of trees or shrubs to screen the base of the tower and accessory structures to the extent possible from adjacent residential property. Existing trees and vegetation must be preserved to the maximum extent possible. 
iv.  Preference for municipal or government-owned sites. All telecommunications towers, antennas, and supporting facilities erected, constructed or located within the city must comply with the following requirements. A proposal for the facility will not be approved unless the planning board finds that the antenna planned for the proposed facility cannot be accommodated on an existing structure located on municipal or government owned property within a one-mile radius of the proposed facility due to one or more of the following: 
a.  The antenna would exceed the structural capacity of the existing structure, as documented by a qualified professional engineer, and the municipality or government entity has refused to reinforce, modify, or replace the structure to accommodate the planned or equivalent antenna. 
b.  The antenna would cause interference materially impacting the usability of other existing antennae at the structure as documented by a qualified professional engineer and the interference cannot be prevented at a reasonable cost. 
c.  Existing structures within the search radius cannot accommodate the antenna at a height necessary to function reasonably as documented by a qualified professional engineer. 
d.  Other reasons that make it infeasible to locate the antenna upon an existing structure. 
v.  Colocation requirements. A proposal for a tower will not be approved unless the planning board finds that the antenna planned for the proposed tower cannot be accommodated on an existing tower or structure within a one-mile radius of the proposed tower due to one or more of the following:

(n)  Home occupations. 
i.  Purpose. Accessory home occupations are activities accessory to uses in the household living category. Home occupations have special regulations to ensure that they will not be a detriment to the character and livability of the surrounding neighborhood. The regulations ensure that the accessory home occupation remains subordinate to the residential use, and that the residential viability of the dwelling is maintained. The regulations recognize that many types of jobs can be done in a home with little or no effect on the surrounding neighborhood. 
ii.  Type A and type B home occupations. There are two types of home occupations, type A and type B, defined as follows: 
a.  Type A. A type A home occupation is one where the residents use their home as a place of work, where no employees or customers come to the site. Examples include, but are not limited to, artists, crafts people, and writers. Type A home occupations also provide an opportunity for a home to be used as a business address but not as a place of work. 
b.  Type B. A type B home occupation is one where the residents use their home as a place of work, and either one employee or customers come to the site consistent with the regulations of this section. Examples include, but are not limited to, counseling, tutoring, legal, medical, accounting, and hair cutting and styling. 
iii.  Permitted districts. Type A and type B home occupations are allowed as follows: 
a.  Only type A home occupations are allowed in the R-1 district. Type B home occupations are prohibited in the R-1 district. 
b.  Type A or type B home occupations are allowed in dwellings in all other districts. 
iv.  Types of home occupations. 
a.  The intent of these regulations is to establish performance standards for all home occupations rather than to limit the allowed uses to a specific list. Uses that comply with the standards of this section are allowed by-right unless specifically prohibited in item b below. 
b.  The following uses are prohibited: 
(1)  Any type of repair or assembly of vehicles or equipment with internal combustion engines, such as autos, motorcycles, scooters, snowmobiles, outboard marine engines, lawn mowers, chain saws, and other small engines, or of large appliances, such as washing machines, dryers, and refrigerators, or any other work related to automobiles and their parts is prohibited. 
(2)  Accessory home occupations may not serve as headquarters or dispatch centers where employees come to the site and are dispatched to other locations. 
v.  Home occupation regulations. The following apply to all home occupations: 
a.  Outdoor Activities. 
(1)  All activities must be in completely enclosed structures. 
(2)  Exterior storage or display of goods or equipment is prohibited. 
b.  Appearance of structure and site. The dwelling and site must remain residential in appearance and characteristics. Internal or external changes that make the dwelling appear less residential in nature or function are prohibited. Examples of such prohibited alterations include construction of parking lots, paving of required setbacks, or adding commercial-like exterior lighting. 
c.  Signs. One sign of a maximum of six square feet is allowed on the property and may be attached to the exterior or placed in the window of the residence or accessory structure, or placed within the front setback, mounted on an architectural post not to exceed four feet in height, or a monument sign not to exceed four feet above grade in the front setback. No sign may interfere with vision clearance on adjoining public rights-of-way. 
d.  Hazardous substances. Hazardous substances are prohibited, except at the consumer commodity level. 
e.  Noise. The maximum noise level for a home occupation is 50 dba. Noise level measurements are taken at the property line. Home occupations that propose to use power tools must document in advance that the home occupation will meet the 50 dba standard. 
f.  Vehicles. No more than one vehicle may be used in association with the home occupation. The maximum size of vehicle used in association with the home occupation is a light truck. 
g.  Deliveries. Truck deliveries or pick-ups of supplies or products associated with the home occupation are allowed at the home only between 8:00 a.m. and 5:00 p.m. Vehicles used for delivery and pickup may not include heavy trucks. 
vi.  Additional regulations for type B home occupation. The following additional regulations apply to type B home occupations: 
a.  Hours. Customers may visit the site only during the hours of 7:00 a.m. to 9:00 p.m. 
b.  Nonresident employees. One nonresident employee is allowed in a type B home occupation provided no customers come to the site at any time. Home occupations that have customers coming to the site at any time may not have nonresident employees. For the purpose of this section, the term "one nonresident employee" includes an employee, business partner, co-owner, or other person affiliated with the home occupation. The term "one nonresident employee" does not allow employee shifts, with each shift staffed by a different employee, even when only one nonresident employee is at the site at any one time. Variances to this section are prohibited. 
c.  Customers. Only five customers or clients may visit the site in a day. 
d.  Retail sales. Retail sales of goods must be entirely accessory to any services provided on the site, such as hair care products sold as an accessory to hair cutting. 
e.  Number of type B home occupations. More than one type B home occupation per dwelling unit is prohibited.

vi.  In addition, in order to maintain livestock, a certain square footage of the lot must be maintained as open space and dedicated to the livestock, in accordance with the following standards. These standards will be used as the basis by the codes enforcement officer for establishing a standard for any animal not included in the table. Lots of 20 or more acres are not subject to this standard. The standards are cumulative; for example, in order to keep one horse and one cow, 50,000 square feet of open space dedicated to the livestock is needed. These standards are not used to determine lot area but rather to determine how much area on a lot must be maintained as open space for the livestock's use. 
a.  Equines, llamas, and alpacas: 25,000 square feet for first horse + 12,250 square feet for each additional animal.

The vibration caused by construction activity, permitted blasting, moving vehicles, trains, and aircraft are exempt from this section. 
(e)  Glare. There must be no direct or sky-reflected glare, whether from floodlights or from high-temperature processes such as combustion or welding or otherwise, so as to be visible at the lot lines. This restriction does not apply to signs otherwise permitted by the provisions of this code. 
(f)  Smoke. Smoke is measured at the point of emission and cannot exceed 20 percent visual opacity. 
(g)  Odors. No emission is permitted of odorous gases or other odorous matter in such quantities as to be readily detectable at the property line of the zone lot from which they are emitted without instruments. 
(h)  Other forms of air pollution. No emission of fly ash, dust, fumes, vapors, gases and other forms of air pollution are permitted which can cause any damage to health, to animal, vegetation, or other forms of property, or which can cause any excessive soiling. Dust and other types of air pollution, borne by the wind from sources, such as storage areas, yards, roads, conveying equipment and the like, within lot boundaries, must be kept to a minimum by appropriate landscape, screening, sheltering, paving, fencing, wetting, collecting, or other acceptable means.

ARTICLE XIV. - OFF-STREET PARKING AND LOADING 

Sec. 80-14.1. - General application. 
(a)  Existing facilities. 
i.  The existing number of off-street vehicle, bicycle, and loading spaces may not be reduced below the minimum requirements of this code. If the number of existing spaces is already less than the requirements of this article, it may not be further reduced. 
ii.  If a building permit was lawfully issued prior to the effective date of this code, and if substantial construction has begun within 90 days of the issuance of a permit, the number of off-street vehicle, bicycle, and loading spaces is that required by building permit and supersedes the requirements of this code. 
(b)  New construction. The construction of a new principal building must provide all required parking unless the site is eligible for a parking exemption or other parking flexibility allowed by this article. 
(c)  Change in use. When the existing use of a structure or land is changed to a new use, parking and bicycle spaces must be provided as required for the new use, except as described below: 
i.  No additional vehicle and bicycle parking spaces are required if the change in use would result in an increase of spaces of less than ten percent. This also applies to a simultaneous change in use of a group of uses on the same lot which together result in a need for an increase in vehicle and bicycle parking spaces of ten percent or more. The ten percent increase is calculated by dividing the number of additional spaces required by the number of spaces required before the increase. 
ii.  The change in use is eligible for a parking exemption per section 80-14.10. 
iii.  Shared parking is provided per section 80-14.12. 
(d)  Change in intensity of use. Whenever the intensity of a use is increased based on an increase in the number of dwelling units, floor area, seating capacity, or other unit of measurement used to calculate the number of required number of vehicle and bicycle parking spaces, additional spaces must be provided for that increase, except as described below: 
i.  Whenever there is an increase in the intensity of a use that creates a need for additional vehicle and bicycle parking spaces of ten percent or more, the additional spaces are required. No additional vehicle and bicycle parking spaces are required if the increase in intensity would result in an increase of spaces of less than ten percent. This also applies to a simultaneous increase in intensity of a group of uses on the same lot which together result in a need for an increase in vehicle and bicycle parking spaces of ten percent or more. The ten percent increase is calculated by dividing the number of additional spaces required by the number of spaces required before the increase. 
ii.  An increase in the intensity of a use is eligible for a parking exemption per section 80-14.10. 
iii.  Shared parking is provided per section 80-14.12. 
(e)  Provision of additional spaces and parking maximums. The establishment of additional off-street parking, bicycle, or loading facilities above the minimum required by this code is not prohibited unless specifically limited by parking maximums. 
(f)  Use of parking facilities. 
i.  The sale, repair, or dismantling or servicing of any vehicles, equipment, materials, or supplies, or the display of goods in off-street parking areas is prohibited, unless otherwise permitted by this code. 
ii.  The property owner is responsible for ensuring that parking and loading facilities are only used by tenants, employees, visitors, or other authorized persons. 
iii.  Space allocated to any off-street loading space may not be used to satisfy the requirement for any off-street vehicle or bicycle parking space or access aisle or portion thereof. Conversely, the area allocated to any off-street vehicle or bicycle parking space may not be used to satisfy the replacement for any off-street loading space or portion thereof. 
(g)  Required plans. Building permits will not be issued until there is an approved plan identifying required vehicle and bicycle parking and loading facilities in accordance with this article. 
(h)  Unlawful removal. It is unlawful to discontinue prior approved required vehicle and bicycle parking and loading facilities without establishing alternate facilities that meet the requirements of this article. Vehicle and bicycle parking and loading facilities meeting the requirements of this article must be maintained as long as the use they serve is in existence. 
(Ord. No. 9301A , 9-26-18) 
Sec. 80-14.2. - Computation of requirements. 
    This section describes how the number of vehicle, bicycle, and loading spaces are calculated based upon the requirements of this article. The total number of required vehicle and bicycle parking and loading spaces is based upon the requirements for the principal use or uses located on the lot. 
(a)  Where multiple uses with different parking requirements occupy the same structure or lot, the required vehicle and bicycle parking and loading spaces is the sum of the requirements for each use computed separately, unless otherwise permitted by this code. 
(b)  A fraction of less than one-half is disregarded, and a fraction of one-half or more is counted as one parking or loading space. 
(c)  For uses where patrons or spectators occupy benches, pews or open floor areas used for service, each 48 linear inches of benches, pews, or permanent seating areas, or five square feet of open floor areas used for seating is counted as one seat for the purpose of determining the requirement for the required number of spaces. 
(Ord. No. 9301A , 9-26-18) 
Sec. 80-14.3. - Required off-street vehicle and bicycle parking spaces. 
(a)  General requirements. 
i.  Except as otherwise provided in this code, the minimum and maximum number of off-street vehicle and bicycle parking spaces to be provided for each use is listed in table 80-14-1: off-street vehicle and bicycle parking requirements. If a space is blank, that indicates that there is no minimum required and/or no maximum limitation. 
ii.  Table 80-14-1 lists parking requirements for each use. In some cases, uses that are considered part of a generic use category are listed with specific vehicle parking requirements. These specific uses are listed only for the purposes of this section and do not indicate whether such uses are permitted or special uses within any district. Certain uses listed within the districts are not listed in table 80-14-1 and therefore do not have vehicle parking requirements. 
iii.  Certain uses listed within table 80-14-1 are required to provide bicycle parking spaces. Of those uses required to provide bicycle spaces, some are also required to provide long-term spaces, where bicycles will be left for longer periods of time and require a safe and weatherproof storage area. The required number of long-term spaces is shown as a percentage of the required total bicycle spaces. All other required bicycle spaces must be designed as short-term spaces, which are areas where bicycles will be left for short stops, requiring a high degree of convenience. 
iv.  In all cases where bicycle parking is required, a minimum of two bicycle spaces must be provided. After the first 25 required bicycle parking spaces are provided, additional bicycle parking spaces may be provided at a 50 percent reduction. There is no maximum number of bicycle spaces required. 
v.  Where bicycle parking space requirements indicate "Over 10,000 sf GFA" or other number threshold, this means that bicycle spaces are required only for structures over a certain gross floor area. When this threshold applies, bicycle parking space requirements are calculated on the basis of the entire gross floor area. 
vi.  Motorcycle and scooter parking may be substituted for up to four automobile spaces or five percent of the required parking spaces, whichever is less. 
(b)  Provision of car- and bike-share facilities. 
i.  Spaces within parking lots and structures may include designated parking spaces for car-share facilities. A car-share facility is a membership-based car-sharing service that provides automobile rental to members, billable by the hour or day, and is not considered a vehicle rental establishment. Spaces reserved for car-share facilities may count toward minimum parking requirements of this code. 
ii.  Spaces within parking lots and structures may include designated areas for bike-share facilities. A bike-share facility provides bicycle rentals to the public and it is not considered a vehicle rental establishment. When a minimum of 15 bicycles are provided for rental, such bike-share facilities may substituted for up to four automobile spaces or five percent of the required parking spaces, whichever is less. 
(c)  Provision of electric vehicle charging stations. Spaces within parking lots and structures may include designated parking spaces for electric vehicle charging. Spaces reserved for electric vehicle charging count toward minimum parking requirements of this code but do not count toward any parking maximums. 
(d)  Multi-tenant retail center parking calculation. A multi-tenant retail center is defined as a group of three or more separate commercial establishments, primarily retail, but also including personal service, restaurant, office, and similar non-residential uses, that is planned, owned, and/or managed as a single property. The two main configurations of multi-tenant retail centers are large shopping centers and strip centers. 
i.  Multi-tenant retail centers under 20,000 square feet in gross floor area require a minimum of one parking space per 500 square feet of gross floor area, rather than calculation by the individual uses. 
ii.  Multi-tenant retail centers of 20,000 square feet or more in gross floor area are subject to a parking maximum of one parking space per 250 square feet of gross floor area, rather than calculation by the individual uses. In addition, multi-tenant retail centers of 20,000 square feet or more in gross floor area require one bicycle space per 2,500 square feet of gross floor area. 
iii.  Multi-tenant retail centers are subject to a maximum parking limitation of 125 percent of the required minimum parking.

(a)  Off-street loading spaces must be provided for any use that distributes or receives materials or merchandise by trucks or other commercial vehicles in accordance with table 80-14-2: off-street loading requirements. In the case of multi-tenant developments, required loading spaces are calculated on the basis of each individual tenant. For example, if only one commercial tenant of a multi-tenant development is over 10,000 square feet, only one loading space is required; if all tenants are under 10,000 square feet, no loading is required. 
(b)  Structures that are 50 years of age or older as of the effective date of this code and do not currently have any loading areas are exempt from off-street loading requirements. 
(c)  No structure is required to provide more than five loading spaces.

Sec. 80-14.5. - Location of vehicle parking spaces. 
(a)  Residential uses. 
i.  All required off-street vehicle parking spaces for residential uses and the residential component of mixed-use developments must be located on the same lot as the structure. 
ii.  For single-family (detached and attached) and two-family dwellings, required vehicle parking spaces are permitted in private driveways, but must not encroach onto the public right-of-way. 
iii.  Tandem vehicle parking is permitted for residential uses. All tandem spaces must be assigned to the same dwelling unit. 
iv.  Single-family (attached and detached) and two-family dwellings are permitted one paved parking pad, subject to the following: 
a.  Parking pads are limited to a maximum of 400 square feet in aggregate. 
b.  The maximum impervious surface requirement for the lot may not be exceeded to accommodate a parking pad. Parking pads may be constructed of a permeable surface. 
c.  Parking pads must be accessed by the driveway. 
d.  Parking pads are permitted in any yard. Parking pads must be located a minimum of three feet from any interior side or rear lot line. When located in the front yard and corner side yard they must be directly attached to the main driveway; however, they are not permitted to encroach into the required front or corner side setback. 
(b)  Non-residential uses. 
i.  Vehicle parking for a non-residential use may be located on the same lot or within 500 feet of the use served. The maximum 500-foot distance restriction does not apply to valet parking services. However, valet parking services must provide evidence of a lot reserved for vehicle parking. 
ii.  In the I district, required parking is fulfilled by all parking areas on the campus, including non-contiguous areas. In these districts, the 500-foot distance restriction does not apply on the campus. 
(Ord. No. 9301A , 9-26-18) 
Sec. 80-14.6. - Design of parking facilities. 
(a)  Dimensions of vehicle parking spaces. 
i.  Off-street vehicle parking space dimensions must meet the standards of figure 14-1. All vehicle parking spaces must have a minimum vertical clearance of seven feet six inches. 
ii.  Motorcycle and scooter parking spaces must measure at least four feet in width by eight feet in length and must be identified or designated through the use of signs or pavement markings.

1 Two-way traffic. 
(b)  Circulation requirements for off-street vehicle parking areas. 
i.  Each off-street vehicle space must open directly upon an aisle or driveway of adequate width to provide access to a vehicle parking space. All off-street parking facilities must provide access in a manner that least interferes with traffic movement. For all uses except single-family detached and two-family dwellings, the parking area must be designed so that the driver of the vehicle proceeds forward into traffic rather than backs out. 
ii.  All required off-street parking facilities must have vehicular access from a street, alley, driveway, or cross-access easement. 
iii.  Parking areas should be designed to utilize 90 degree parking if possible and orient parking rows perpendicular to the building to enhance pedestrian safety. 
iv.  Clearly delineated crosswalks of paving, brick paver, bituminous brick pattern stamping, or painted striping must connect landscaped areas and parking lot islands to building entrances to improve safe passageway for pedestrians. Curb cuts must be included on landscaped areas or islands where such crosswalks are located. 
v.  All parking lots must comply with the "ADA Accessibility Guidelines for Buildings and Facilities" regulations issued by federal agencies under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and section 1106 of the Building Code of New York State for the amount and design of accessible vehicle parking spaces required in parking lots and structures. 
(c)  Striping. Off-street parking areas must be marked by painted lines a minimum of four inches in width and maintained in clearly visible condition. Signs or markers should be used as necessary to ensure efficient and safe circulation within the lot. Vehicle parking spaces for handicapped persons must be identified with the appropriate sign and visible at all times of the year, regardless of plant growth or similar conditions. 
(d)  Curbing and wheel stops. Wheel stops or curbing are required when a parking space abuts a pedestrian walkway, landscape area, or fences. Breaks in curbing may be provided to allow for drainage into landscape areas to absorb stormwater. 
(e)  Surfacing. All parking lots must be surfaced with a durable all-weather material, such as asphalt, concrete, turfstone, or other product, as approved by the codes enforcement officer or, if site-plan review is required, by the planning board. Pervious paving may be allowed, subject to permission by the codes enforcement officer or, if site-plan review is required, by the planning board. 
(f)  Drainage. Off-street parking facilities must be drained to eliminate standing water and prevent damage to abutting property and/or public streets and alleys. All drainage must comply with the requirements of this code for stormwater management. 
(g)  Maintenance. Off-street parking areas must be maintained in a clean, orderly, and dust-free condition at the expense of the owner or lessee. 
(h)  Lighting. Parking lot lighting not exceeding 24 feet in height is required to provide safe access for pedestrians. Outdoor lighting and aerial-mounted floodlighting must be shielded from above in such a manner that the bottom edge of the shield is below the light source. Said lighting must be shielded so that the direct illumination is confined to the property boundaries of the light source. Ground-mounted floodlighting or light projection above the horizontal plane is prohibited between midnight and sunrise. A plan for proposed lighting must be submitted to the codes enforcement officer for review and approval prior to final site plan approval. 
(i)  Landscape and screening. All parking lots must be landscaped and screened in accordance with article XV. 
(j)  Hydraulic lifts. All hydraulic lifts must be located within a parking structure. 
(k)  Turnaround space. Dead end parking lots are prohibited. A turnaround space is required and the minimum depth and width of such turnaround space must be nine feet and designated with signs stating "No Parking." 
(Ord. No. 9301A , 9-26-18) 
Sec. 80-14.7. - Driveway design. 
(a)  Single-family detached and two-family dwelling driveways. 
i.  A residential driveway that provides access to a detached or attached garage is limited to a maximum width of 12 feet. A driveway apron, the width of the garage, as measured from the garage walls, is permitted to extend for a distance (depth) of 25 feet as measured perpendicular from the garage doors before tapering back at an angle of no more than 45 degrees to the required driveway width for access to the additional spaces. If the distance from the additional depth to the lot line is 15 feet or less, tapering is not required. 
ii.  A residential driveway may be located three feet from any interior side or corner side lot line, unless a shared driveway is established per item iii., below. 
iii.  A residential driveway may be shared by adjacent lots. This shared driveway location is only allowed if agreed to by the owners of each lot, and the agreement is recorded as a shared driveway servitude on each plat of survey. 
iv.  Single-family detached and two-family dwellings are permitted to construct driveways that consist of two concrete wheel strips, each of which is at least 18 inches wide and at least 20 feet long. Space between wheel strips must be planted with turf or groundcover; gravel is prohibited. 
v.  Residential driveways must be surfaced with a durable all-weather material, such as asphalt, concrete, turfstone, or other product. Pervious paving may be allowed, subject to permission by the codes enforcement officer or, if site-plan review is required, by the planning board. Gravel is prohibited. 

(b)  Single-family attached and multi-family dwellings, and non-residential driveways. 
i.  All parking lots must be surfaced with a durable all-weather material, such as asphalt, concrete, turfstone, or other product. Pervious paving may be allowed, subject to permission by the codes enforcement officer or, if site-plan review is required, by the planning board. Gravel is prohibited. 
ii.  With the exception of loading berths, driveways are limited to a maximum width of 12 feet for one-way drives, and a maximum of 24 feet for two-way drives. 
(c)  Driveways in the outside district. The driveways providing ingress and egress to lots in the outside district served by gravel roadways may be surfaced with gravel. However, any driveway providing ingress/egress to a residential property in the outside district served by a hard surface roadway must consist of a hard surface for, a minimum, from the roadway and of the first 15 feet from the lot line into the property. 
(d)  Cross-access easements. 
i.  Adjacent non-residential uses, including mixed-use development, with dedicated parking areas are encouraged to provide a cross-access drive to allow circulation between sites. Property owners are encouraged to pursue cross-access with adjacent property owners at the time of development. If cross-access is provided, the codes enforcement officer may require that the property owner provide proof that adjacent property owners have been contacted in writing regarding the provision of cross-access. 
ii.  Joint use driveways and cross-access easements must incorporate site design features to make it visually obvious that the abutting properties are tied together. 
iii.  Pursuant to this section, property owners who establish cross-access easements must: 
a.  Record an easement allowing cross-access to and from properties served by the joint use driveways and cross-access easement.

Sec. 80-14.8. - Design of bicycle parking spaces. 
(a)  Location. 
i.  The bicycle parking area must be convenient to building entrances and street access, but may not interfere with normal pedestrian and vehicle traffic. Bicyclists must not be required to travel over stairs to access parking. 
ii.  When required to provide bicycle spaces, certain uses are also required to provide long-term spaces, where bicycles will be left for longer periods of time and require a safe and weatherproof storage area. The required number of long-term spaces is shown as a percentage of the required total bicycle spaces in table 80-14-1. All other required bicycle spaces must be designed as short-term spaces, which are areas where bicycles will be left for short stops, requiring a high degree of convenience. Nothing in this code prevents the provision of additional bicycle spaces in excess of that required; long-term spaces are required only in the amount calculated by the minimum number of spaces in table 80-14-1, not of the total number of short-term spaces, which may exceed that required by the table. 
iii.  Short-term bicycle parking spaces must be located no more than 50 feet from the principal building entrance and at the same grade as the sidewalk or an accessible route. The property owner may make arrangement with the codes enforcement officer to place required bicycle parking spaces in the public right-of-way so long as a minimum of five feet of clearance is maintained in the pedestrian way and the bicycle spaces are located within 50 feet of the lot. Required bicycle parking spaces may be located in the public right-of-way, with approval from the codes enforcement officer, if one or more of the following conditions are met: 
a.  The use does not provide vehicle parking on-site. 
b.  The addition of bicycle parking on the site would reduce the number of parking spaces below that required by this code. 
c.  Bicycle parking spaces in the right-of-way are shared by uses located on the same blockface. In such cases, the number of bicycle spaces required is cumulative of that required by all uses sharing such spaces. 
iv.  Long-term bicycle parking spaces must be located in a covered area that is easily accessible from the public-right-of-way and building entrances. 
v.  Required bicycle parking for residential uses may be provided in garages, storage rooms, and other resident-accessible, secure areas. Spaces within dwelling units or on balconies do not count toward satisfying bicycle parking requirements. 
(b)  Design. 
i.  Required bicycle spaces must provide each bike space within a row of bicycle parking a minimum of two feet in width by six feet in length, with a minimum vertical clearance of seven feet. Each required bicycle parking space must be accessible without moving another bicycle. There must be an aisle at least five feet wide between each row of bicycle parking to allow room for bicycle maneuvering. 
ii.  The area devoted to bicycle parking must be surfaced as required for vehicle parking areas. 
iii.  All long-term bicycle parking spaces must be located indoors or fully covered, such as by the use of an overhang or covered walkway, weatherproof outdoor bicycle lockers, or an indoor storage area. Where bicycle parking is not located within a building or locker, the cover design must be of permanent construction, designed to protect bicycles from rainfall, snow, and inclement weather, and with a minimum vertical clearance of seven feet. 
iv.  Bicycle parking racks must permit the bicycle frame and one wheel to be locked to the rack and support the bicycle in a stable position. Structures that require a user-supplied locking device must be designed to accommodate U-shaped locking devices. All lockers and racks must be securely anchored to the ground or a structure to prevent the racks and lockers from being removed from the location. 
v.  If required bicycle parking facilities are not visible from the street or principal building entrance, signs must be posted indicating their location. 


(Ord. No. 9301A , 9-26-18) 
Sec. 80-14.9. - Design of off-street loading spaces. 
(a)  Location. All off-street loading spaces must be located on the same lot as the use served. No off-street loading spaces may project into a public right-of-way. No off-street loading space is permitted in a front yard. 
(b)  Dimensions. 
i.  All required off-street loading spaces must be a minimum of 12 feet in width, a minimum of 35 feet in length, exclusive of aisle and maneuvering space, and have a minimum vertical clearance of 15 feet. 
ii.  Structures that are 50 years of age or older and maintain loading spaces that do not comply with the dimensions of this section are deemed legally conforming in terms of loading space dimensions. If new loading spaces are constructed, such spaces may be designed to match the dimensions of existing spaces rather than the requirements of this section. 
(c)  Surfacing. All off-street loading spaces must be paved with a durable, all-weather material or pervious paving that can support anticipated loads. 
(d)  Drainage and maintenance. 
i.  Off-street loading facilities must be drained to eliminate standing water and prevent damage to abutting property and/or public streets and alleys. All drainage must comply with the requirements of this code for stormwater management. 
ii.  Off-street loading areas must be maintained in a clean, orderly, and dust-free condition at the expense of the owner or lessee. 
(e)  Access. Each required off-street loading space must be designed with adequate means of vehicular access to a street or alley and in a manner that will minimize interference with traffic movement. 
(f)  Lighting. Parking lot lighting must meet the exterior lighting standards of section 80-14.6(h). 
(g)  Landscape and screening. All parking lots must be landscaped and screened in accordance with article XII. 
(Ord. No. 9301A , 9-26-18) 
Sec. 80-14.10. - Parking exemptions. 
(a)  Applicability. When a use is exempt from vehicle parking requirements by this article, bicycle parking is exempted as well. If a use that is exempt from vehicle parking voluntarily provides parking, bicycle parking, as required by this article, is required. 
(b)  Exemptions from parking requirements. 
i.  Non-residential uses of 2,500 square feet or less of gross floor area in the commercial districts are exempt from all off-street vehicle parking requirements. Non-residential uses of 2,500 square feet of gross floor area or less located within a multi-tenant retail center are not eligible for this exemption and must provide the required parking. 
ii.  Existing structures as of the effective date of this code that currently do not provide any parking due to lack of sufficient space on the lot to accommodate parking are exempt from all off-street vehicle parking requirements regardless of any change in use or intensity or use. Once the principal building is demolished, this exemption is no longer valid. In addition, if the lot area is expanded (e.g., the adjoining lot is purchased), this exemption is no longer valid. 
iii.  In the C-3 district no off-street vehicle parking is required, but bicycle parking is necessary. 
(Ord. No. 9301A , 9-26-18) 
Sec. 80-14.11. - On-street parking credit permission. 
(a)  In the commercial districts, on-street parking spaces located along the front or corner side property line may be counted toward required off-street parking spaces for commercial uses. New on-street parking spaces may also be created to count toward required off-street parking but must be located along the corner side or front lot line, and must be accessible 24 hours a day. 
(b)  Where on-street parking spaces are unmarked, the number of parking spaces is calculated by dividing the length of the on-street parking area located parallel to property line of the property under consideration divided by 18, where a fraction of less than one-half is disregarded, and a fraction of one-half or more is counted as one space. 
(c)  Where on-street parking spaces are marked, each marked space counts as one required parking space, including any space where at least 50 percent of the width is located along the lot line of the property under consideration. 
(d)  Any subsequent change in the availability of on-street parking used to meet off-street parking requirements requires proof that the minimum parking requirements, per this section, have been met. When on-street parking is made unavailable, the use has 90 days from that date to accommodate all required off-street parking. 
(Ord. No. 9301A , 9-26-18) 
Sec. 80-14.12. - Shared parking. 
(a)  Off-street parking spaces for separate uses may be provided collectively if the aggregate number of spaces provided is not less than the sum of the spaces required in table 80-14-3: shared parking calculation. Multi-tenant retail centers are not eligible for shared parking. Mixed-use developments, multi-use office parks, and similar types of development, and property owners that establish cross-access easements are all eligible for shared parking. 
(b)  Table 80-14-3 is applied in the following manner: 
i.  The required number of spaces for each use is calculated according table 80-14-1. 
ii.  The required number of spaces for each use is then applied to the percentages for each timeframe according to the appropriate land use category in table 80-14-3 to determine the number of required spaces. This is done for each timeframe category. 
iii.  The numbers are summed for within each timeframe and the highest sum total in a timeframe is the required number of spaces. 
Table 80-14-3: Shared Parking Calculation Land Use Weekday Weekend 12:00 a.m.-7:00 a.m. 7:00 a.m.-6:00 p.m. 6:00 p.m.-12:00 a.m. 12:00 a.m.-7:00 a.m. 7:00 a.m.-6:00 p.m. 6:00 p.m.-12:00 a.m. Residential 100% 100% 100% 100% 100% 75% Commercial 0% 100% 80% 0% 100% 60% Restaurant 50% 70% 100% 45% 70% 100% Hotel 100% 50% 90% 100% 65% 80% Office 5% 100% 5% 0% 40% 10% Industrial 5% 100% 5% 0% 60% 10%  
iv.  Shared parking may be located off-site so long as it complies with the location requirements of this article. 
v.  The following is a sample calculation of how this provision is applied: 
Sample Calculation 
Example: multi-use office park with the following uses within the development; based on current parking requirements, the number of required spaces is: 
Use and Square Footage Parking Requirement Number of Spaces Needed Office: 40,000 sf GFA 1 per 500 sf GFA 80 spaces Hotel/motel: 60 rooms 1 per room 60 spaces Restaurants: 10,000 sf GFA 1 per 500 sf GFA 20 spaces Retail establishments: 15,000 sf GFA 1 per 500 sf GFA 30 spaces Total spaces required 190 spaces  
Using the shared parking calculation, these numbers are plugged into the table and using the percentages allotted to each land use for each time of day, are calculated as total spaces required per timeframe. 
Land Use Required by Code Weekday Weekend 12:00 a.m.-7:00 a.m. 7:00 a.m.-6:00 p.m. 6:00 p.m.-12:00 a.m. 12:00 a.m.-7:00 a.m. 7:00 a.m.-6:00 p.m. 6:00 p.m.-12:00 a.m. % # % # % # % # % # % # Residential N/A 100% N/A 100% N/A 100% N/A 100% N/A 100% N/A 75% N/A Commercial 30 0% 0 100% 30 80% 24 0% 0 100% 30 60% 18 Restaurant 20 50% 10 70% 14 100% 20 45% 9 70% 14 100% 20 Hotel 60 100% 60 50% 30 90% 54 100% 60 65% 39 80% 48 Office 80 5% 4 100% 80 5% 4 0% 0 40% 32 10% 8 Industrial N/A 5% N/A 100% N/A 5% N/A 0% N/A 60% N/A 10% N/A Total 190 74 154 102 69 115 94  
With a straight parking calculation, 190 spaces are required. However, the shared parking provision allows this example multi-use office park to be constructed by-right with 154 spaces (the highest number of spaces within the various timeframes-The 7:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m. timeframe). This is because these timeframe calculations take into account the times of day the various uses utilize the most parking. 
(Ord. No. 9301A , 9-26-18) 
Sec. 80-14.13. - Storage of commercial vehicles. 
(a)  No commercial vehicle may be parked outdoors on a lot in a residential district, with the exception of vehicles engaged in loading or unloading or current work being done to the adjacent premises. This does not include standard size passenger motor vehicles including, but not limited to, vans, sports utility vehicles (SUVs), standard passenger size livery vehicles, and pick-up trucks, which are permitted to be stored or parked outdoors overnight on lots in residential districts.

(Ord. No. 9301A , 9-26-18) 
Sec. 80-15.7. - Required parking lot landscape. 
(a)  Required parking lot landscape abutting street lot line. Landscape is required along the edges of a parking lot that abuts a street lot line. The landscape treatment must run the full length of the street lot line. The landscaped area must be improved as follows: 
i.  The landscape area in the I-G, S-S, and NPH districts must be a minimum of 15 feet in width. In all other districts, the landscape area must be a minimum of seven feet in width. 
ii.  There must be a minimum linear distance of 18 inches between any wheels stops or curbs to accommodate vehicle bumper overhang. This area is not included in the minimum landscape area calculation. 
iii.  One shade tree is required for every 30 linear feet of landscape area length, excluding driveways. As part of the landscape plan approval, trees may be spaced at various intervals based on specific site constraints and design considerations, but the total number of trees planted must be no less than one per 30 linear feet of landscape area length. 
iv.  One shrub, reaching a minimum of three feet in height at maturity, is required for every three feet of landscape area length, excluding driveways. Shrub plantings must be spaced linearly to provide consistent buffering. 
v.  Any one or more of the following alternatives to shrub plantings are also permitted: 
a.  A low masonry or natural stone wall a minimum of three feet to a maximum of four feet in height may be used instead of shrubs. Where feasible, plant materials should be installed between the sidewalk and the wall to provide a softening effect. 
b.  The landscape area may be planted with a mix of shrubs, perennials, native grasses, and other planting types that provide screening of a minimum of three feet in height. 
c.  Stormwater management techniques, such as rain gardens and bioswales, planted with appropriate species to provide screening of a minimum of three feet in height, as measured from the established grade of the parking lot surface. 
d.  An earthen berm a minimum of three feet to a maximum of four feet in height, as measured from the established grade of the parking lot surface. Berms must be constructed with no slope exceeding 33 percent, to prevent erosion and promote proper, safe maintenance. If an earthen berm is used, required plantings as specified in items (iii) and (iv) above may be reduced by 25 percent. The remainder of the berm must be planted in live groundcover, perennials, or grass. 
vi.  In addition to the requirements above, the remainder of the required landscape area must be planted in live trees, groundcover, perennials, or grass. 

(b)  Required parking lot interior landscape. All parking lots of 20 or more spaces require interior parking lot landscape as described in this section. When the calculation of interior parking lot landscape requirements results in a fraction, said fraction is rounded up to the nearest whole number. 
i.  One parking lot island must be provided between every ten parking spaces. As part of the landscape plan approval, parking lot island locations may be varied based on specific site requirements or design scheme, but the total number of islands must be no less than the amount required of one island for every ten spaces. 
ii.  The minimum total landscape area of a parking lot, including parking lot islands, must be ten percent of the total parking lot area. Parking lot landscape along a street lot line, as required in item i., above, is excluded from the calculation of total parking lot area. 
iii.  All rows of parking spaces must terminate in a landscape area. 
iv.  Parking lot islands must be the same dimension as the parking stall. Double rows of parking must provide parking lot islands that are the same dimension as the double row. 
v.  A minimum of one shade tree must be provided for every parking lot island or landscape area. Where a parking lot island or landscape area is the dimension of a double row, two shade trees are required. The remaining area of a parking lot island must be planted in ornamental trees, live groundcover, shrubs, perennials, or grass. 
vi.  The use of stormwater management elements such as rain gardens and bioswales is encouraged in landscape areas. The inclusion of shade tree species that are tolerant to flooding or intermittent inundation is required. 

(Ord. No. 9301A , 9-26-18) 
Sec. 80-15.8. - Required buffer yard. 
    This section establishes standards for the dimensions and landscape for required buffer yards. 
(a)  Buffer yards are located within rear and interior side yards, including the required rear or interior side setbacks, and must be reserved for the planting of material and installation of screening as required by this section. No parking spaces or accessory structures are permitted within the required buffer yard. 
(b)  As of the effective date of this code, buffer yards are required for along interior side and rear yards in the following cases: 
i.  Where a multi-family development abuts another residential district other than the R-3 district. 
ii.  Where a non-residential use is located within a residential district, excluding parks. 
iii.  Where a non-residential district or use abuts a residential district. This does not apply to the C-1 district or the natural resource districts or to any parks. 
iv.  Where an I-G, S-S, or NPH district abuts a commercial district. 
(c)  When the calculation of minimum buffer yard requirements results in a fraction, the fraction is rounded up to the nearest whole number. The minimum size and improvement of buffer yards is as follows: 
i.  A buffer yard must be a minimum of ten feet in width. 
ii.  One evergreen tree must be planted for every 20 linear feet of buffer yard length. As part of the landscape plan approval, trees may be spaced at various intervals based on specific site requirements, but the total number of evergreen trees planted must be no less than one per 20 linear feet of buffer yard length. 
iii.  One shade tree must be planted for every 40 linear feet of buffer yard length. As part of the landscape plan approval, trees may be spaced at various intervals based on specific site requirements, but the total number of shade trees planted must be no less than one per 40 linear feet of buffer yard length. 
iv.  One shrub, measuring a minimum of 18 inches in height at planting and reaching a minimum of three feet in height at maturity, must be planted for every three linear feet of buffer yard length, spaced linearly. 
v.  A solid fence or wall a minimum of six feet and a maximum of seven feet in height must be erected along 100 percent of the yard length. At a minimum, the required plantings must be located on the exterior facing side of the fence. 
vi.  The remainder of the buffer yard must be planted in live trees, groundcover, perennials, or grass.

Sec. 80-15.9. - Tree lawn trees. 
    The following tree planting requirements apply to tree lawns (i.e., those areas within the public right-of-way located between the curb and the sidewalk). Tree lawn trees must be planted as part of any new construction, including individual single-family and two-family development. Where a landscape plan is not required, tree lawn planting requirements will be verified as part of building permit approval. 
(a)  Tree lawn trees must be planted at one tree for every 30 linear feet of tree lawn. Where appropriate, tree lawn trees may be clustered or spaced differently as determined appropriate or necessary by the city forester. 
(b)  The selecting of tree species must be reviewed and approved by the city forester with particular regard for site-appropriate species. 
(Ord. No. 9301A , 9-26-18) 
Sec. 80-15.10. - Stormwater management. 
    Any new development that consists of 10,000 square feet or more of paved surface, including the building footprint and paved parking area must be designed to filter or store the first inch of rainwater during each rain event. A stormwater management plan must be submitted and approved as part of the landscape plan showing compliance with this standard and the standards of this section. 
(a)  Stormwater management measures. 
i.  Stormwater management measures must be implemented in the following order of preference: 
a.  Infiltration, flow attenuation and pollutant removal of runoff on-site to existing areas with groundcover, trees, and similar vegetation, and through the use of open vegetated swales and natural depressions. 
b.  Use of stormwater on-site to replace water used for industrial processes or irrigation. Stormwater detention structures for the temporary storage of runoff for these purposes must designed so as not to create a permanent pool of water. 
c.  Stormwater retention structures for the permanent storage of runoff by means of a permanent pool of water. 
d.  Retention and evaporation of stormwater on rooftops or in parking lots. 
ii.  Infiltration practices must be utilized to reduce runoff volume increases. A combination of successive practices may be used to achieve the stormwater management standard of this section. 
iii.  Best management practices (BMP) must be employed to minimize pollutants in stormwater runoff prior to discharge into a separate storm drainage system or water body. 
iv.  All stormwater management facilities must be designed to provide an emergency overflow system, and incorporate measures to provide a non-erosive velocity of flow along its length and at any outfall. 
v.  The designed release rate of any stormwater structure must be modified if any increase in flooding or stream channel erosion would result at a downstream dam, highway, structure or normal point of restricted stream flow. 
(b)  Technical guides. The following documents serve as the official guides and specifications for stormwater management. Stormwater management practices that are designed and constructed per the most recent or successor versions of these technical documents are presumed to meet the standards of this article: 
i.  The New York State Stormwater Management Design Manual (New York State Department of Environmental Conservation).

Sec. 80-15.11. - Alternative landscaping plan. 
    Alternative landscaping plans may be proposed where strict application of the requirements in this article would prohibit reasonable development of a property. The planning board may consider the topography, shape, size or other natural features of the property or design features of the development when considering the suitability of a proposed alternative landscaping plan. Examples of situations where alternative landscaping plans are more likely to receive favorable consideration are mixed-use buildings and developments that qualify for reduced parking under this ordinance. Another technique that can be used in alternative landscaping plans is the enhancement of landscaping in a nearby area to soften the overall effect of the development, such as improvement of a nearby existing public right-of-way.

ARTICLE XVII. - PLANNED DEVELOPMENT 

Sec. 80-17.1. - Purpose. 
    The purpose of planned development (PD) is to permit an overlay to the zoning map that establishes the PD in a particular area of the city, which applies an overlay to the underlying zoning district and, in doing so, facilitates innovative development that may not be allowed through the strict application of this code. More specifically, the purpose of a planned development is to: 
(a)  Encourage flexibility in design and development that will result in a more efficient and desirable use of land. 
(b)  Permit flexibility of design, placement of buildings, use of required open spaces, circulation facilities, off-street parking areas, and otherwise better utilize the potential of sites characterized by special features, such as geography, topography, size, or shape. 
(c)  Provide for maximum efficiency in layout of streets, utility networks, and other public improvements. 
(d)  Produce an integrated or balanced development of mutually supportive uses that might otherwise be inharmonious or incongruous.

(Ord. No. 9301A , 9-26-18) 
Sec. 80-17.4. - Procedure. 
(a)  Pre-application consultation. 
i.  Prior to formal submittal of an application, the applicant is required to schedule a pre-application conference with the code enforcement officer. 
ii.  At a pre-application consultation, the applicant must provide information as to the location of the proposed planned development, the proposed uses, proposed public and private improvements, including the proposed public benefits and amenities, existing natural features, anticipated exceptions to this code, and any other information necessary to explain the planned development. Anticipated construction phasing must also be indicated at this time so feedback on water, sewer, and electrical services capacity and connectivity can be provided. 
iii.  The purpose of such pre-application consultation is to make advice and assistance available to the applicant before preparation of required application, so that the applicant may determine whether the proposed planned development is in compliance with the provisions of this code and other applicable regulations, and whether the proposed planned development will be in conformity with the adopted land use policies. 
iv.  The pre-application conference does not require formal application, fee, or filing of a planned development application. Any opinions or advice provided are in no way binding with respect to any official action that may be taken on the subsequent formal application. 
(b)  Concept plan. 
i.  Before submitting a formal application for a planned development, the applicant must present a concept plan before the common council for the purpose of obtaining information and guidance prior to entering into binding commitments or incurring substantial expense. At minimum, the concept plan must consist of the following: 
a.  A map or maps in general form containing the proposed land uses, the natural features of the development site, the character and approximate location of all roadways and access drives proposed within the planned development, the location of all adjacent streets and public utilities, and schematic drawings showing the size, character and disposition of buildings on the site. 
b.  A written statement containing a general explanation of the planned development, including a statement of the present ownership of all the land within said development, the expected schedule of construction, and the anticipated public benefits to be provided. 
ii.  The common council will review the concept plan, and provide such information and guidance as it deems appropriate. Any opinions or advice provided by the common council is in no way binding with respect to any official action that may be taken on the subsequent formal application. The review of the concept plan is not a public hearing. 
(c)  Application and common council legislation. 
i.  The applicant must submit an application, including all information by section 80-17.5, and SEQR full form to the code enforcement officer with the applicable fee. The code enforcement officer will review the application for completeness and, if deemed complete, submit common council legislation. 
ii.  The common council will review the application and make an initial SEQR determination of significance and classify the action as either type I, type II, or unlisted action. 
iii.  The common council will request a recommendation from the planning board on the proposed planned development. 
(d)  Planning board recommendation of site plan. 
i.  The common council will delegate the application for a public hearing by the planning board. The planning board will hold the required public hearing as to obtain any information from the surrounding property owners that the board could use in making its recommendations to the common council. The applicant must provide the application for the planning board to review at least 16 days prior to the planning board hearing date. 
ii.  The planning board may recommend approval, approval with modifications, or disapproval of a planned development application as submitted or amended and must report its decision to the common council within 45 days of the close of the planning board meeting. If the applicant amends the application to conform with the planning board recommendations, as reported to the common council, and re-files with the common council, the common council may act upon the application without referring it back to the planning board. 
iii.  The planning board may make such additional requirements as are necessary to protect established or allowed uses in the vicinity and to promote and protect the orderly growth and sound development of the city. In reaching its decision on the proposed development and changes, if any, in the plans, drawings, elevations and specifications, the planning board will consider among other things, the following: 
a.  Spacing between buildings and orientation of building groups. A building group may not be arranged so that any permanently or temporarily inhabited building is inaccessible by emergency vehicles. 
b.  Adequate, safe and convenient arrangement of pedestrian circulation facilities, bikeway circulation facilities, roadways, driveways, off-street parking and loading spaces, facilities for waste, and lighting. 
c.  Adequate amount and suitable location of pedestrian walks, malls/plazas, and landscaped spaces to prevent pedestrian use of vehicular ways and parking space and to separate pedestrian walks, malls/plazas, and public transportation loading places from general vehicular circulation facilities. 
d.  Arrangement of buildings, vehicular circulation, and open spaces so that pedestrians moving between buildings are not unnecessarily exposed to vehicular traffic. 
e.  Adequate design of grades, paving, gutters, drainage, and treatment of turf to handle stormwater, prevent erosion and formation of dust. 
f.  Proper arrangement of signs and lighting devices with respect to traffic control devices and adjacent properties. 
g.  In nonresidential building groups abutting or within 100 feet of residential districts, fences, walls, or year-round screening when necessary to shield adjacent residential districts from parking lot illumination, headlights, heat, litter, and dust, and to reduce the visual encroachment of commercial architecture, signs, and activity on residential neighborhoods. 
h.  Conformance to the city comprehensive plan and zoning code in terms of general location of uses where applicable. 
i.  Compliance with the applicable design standards for the district and/or building type. 
j.  Harmony with the surrounding development or potential future uses. 
k.  The adequacy of the size of the proposed development district to accommodate the contemplated developments. 
l.  How well the exceptions from the strict application of this code promote an integrated site plan no less beneficial to the occupants for such development, as well as of neighborhood properties, than would be obtained under the normal requirements of this code. 
(d)  Common council action. Following the planning board public hearing on the application with public notice, the common council must issue a SEQR negative or positive declaration, in accordance with 6 NYCRR part 617, prior to the final action on the planned development application. If the project is issued a SEQR negative declaration, the common council may then establish the planned developments to be annotated as "PD" on the zoning map. designation of a planned development on the zoning map is for administrative and reference purposes only and does not indicate a zoning district change. The presence or absence of a planned development on the zoning map does not validate or invalidate an approved planned development. This action only has the effect only of applying the planned development overlay to the land and does not permit development thereof. The common council may recommend approval, approval with modifications, or disapproval of a planned development application. 
(e)  Effect of final plans. Final plans and drawings for an approved planned development must be filed with the codes enforcement officer and will become a part of this code as it applies to the specific planned development. The application, legislation, determination letters maps, site plans, and all other documents will be kept on file in the office of code enforcement for no less than ten years. No occupancy permit will be issued until the codes enforcement officer certifies in writing that the development has been completed according to the final plans and drawings or as authorized by the planning board in a phased development. 
(f)  Building permit. No building permit will be issued by the city for the development of a planned development until the building inspector has been notified in writing that the common council it has reviewed and approved final plans for such development. Any amendment to a plan or changes in signs, uses, or construction requiring a building permit, must be reviewed and final plans approved by the common council. 
(g)  Phasing. If a phasing plan is approved as part of a planned development, required permits may only be issued for the first phase initially and permits for subsequent phases will not be issued unless the prior phase is substantially complete. The codes enforcement officer will determine whether a phase is substantially complete, which the applicant may appeal to the common council.

(Ord. No. 9301A , 9-26-18) 
ARTICLE XIX. - ZONING APPLICATIONS 

Sec. 80-19.1. - Zoning amendments. 
(a)  Initiation. 
i.  The common council may from time to time on its own motion, amend, supplement, repeal, or change the regulations and district boundaries established by this code.

Whenever the owners of 50 percent or more of the frontage in any district or part thereof presents a petition, duly signed and acknowledged, to the common council, requesting an amendment, supplement, change or repeal of the regulations prescribed for such district or part thereof, it is the duty of the common council to vote upon said petition within 90 days after the filing of the same by the petitioners with the clerk of the council. 
iii.  The planning board may, by resolution, propose an amendment, supplement, change or repeal of the regulations to the common council. Within 90 days from the time such resolution is received by the common council it is the duty of the council to vote on such proposed amendment. 
(b)  Application. Whenever a petition to amend, supplement, repeal, or change the regulation and district boundaries established by this code is to be considered by the common council, the individual(s) must complete an application. Each application must be accompanied by a fee, which is not refundable. For the purpose of this section, the term "applicant" does not include a member of the common council, planning board, or other official city body or department head acting within their authority. 
(c)  Procedure. 
i.  All proposed amendments originating by petition or by motion of the common council will be referred to the planning board for a report and recommendations. The planning board will submit its report within 75 days after receiving such referral. Failure of the planning board to report within the required time is deemed to be a recommendation of approval of the proposed amendment. 
ii.  Before any amendment, supplement, repeal or change in the regulations or district boundaries, there must be a public notice of hearing as provided by law. Such hearing may be held by the common council, by a committee of the council, or by the planning board, on request of the common council. Such hearing must be held at the next regularly scheduled meeting of the common council following introduction of the proposed ordinance or amendment. Notice of such hearing must be published in the official newspaper of the city, at least seven days prior to the date the public hearing is to be held. Such public notice must include the date, time and place of the public hearing and must set forth a summary of the substance of the proposed amendment. 
iii.  A public hearing on any amendment, supplement, repeal or change in the regulations or district boundaries may be held at a date prior to the next regularly scheduled informal or formal meeting, provided that a three-fourths majority vote of the common council to such earlier meeting is first obtained, and provided further, that prior to any public hearing on any proposed amendment, notice of such hearing is published as described in this section. 
iv.  The common council, in addition to any published notice of a public hearing required in this section, may direct that other and further notice be given as that body deems appropriate after consideration of the circumstances surrounding the proposed zone change. These circumstances include, but are not to be limited to, the size of the parcel(s) to be rezoned, the number of property owners located in or adjacent to such parcel(s), and the type of use to be permitted by the proposed rezoning. Where the council deems such further notice to be appropriate, it must designate the area within which persons owning property shall be given notice and shall further designate the manner in which such notice shall be given. 
v.  An amendment to the zoning code must be referred to the county planning department at least 30 days before the public hearing and acted upon in accord with the provision of General Municipal Law, § 239. 
vi.  An amendment will be effected by a simple majority vote of the common council. However, an amendment will require the approval of at least three-fourths of the members of the council if the amendment is the subject of a written protest, presented to the council and signed by one of the following: 
a.  The owners of 20 percent or more of the land area included in such proposed change. 
b.  The owners of 20 percent or more of the area of land immediately adjacent to the land included in such proposed change, extending 100 feet therefrom. 
c.  The owners of 20 percent or more of the area of land directly opposite thereto, extending 100 feet from the street frontage of such opposite land. 
(Ord. No. 9301A , 9-26-18) 
Sec. 80-19.2 - Special use permit. 
(a)  Purpose. Under these regulations, special uses are considered to be uses which may be appropriate in the district where they are located, but possess special characteristics that may pose land use or nuisance concerns or difficulties if controlled only by the district regulation applicable to permitted uses. Accordingly, such uses are further controlled by a procedure that requires special consideration and additional regulations for each such use in order to mitigate any such problems or difficulties and minimize the impact upon the district. Each use warrants consideration as an individual case in the district and on the specific lot where it is proposed to be located. Granting of a special permit for a special use in a zoning district is based on its own unique facts and circumstances and does not establish any precedent for granting of a special permit for the use or any other special permit use on any other lot in the district or in other districts. 
(b)  Authorization. 
i.  Uses requiring a special use permit are identified as special uses in each zoning district. Special uses are those that are allowed, but must meet specific standards to ensure that the proposed development is compatible with surrounding uses. In granting such a permit the zoning board of appeals may specify appropriate conditions, modifications, and requirements to ensure compatibility. The written decision of the zoning board of appeals listing the conditions and votes of each board member forms the special use permit. 
ii.  Uses designated in this code as special uses are allowed, enlarged, or altered upon approval of the zoning board of appeals, in accordance with the standards and procedures of this section. In permitting a special use, the zoning board of appeals may impose, in addition to the regulations and standards expressly specified by this code, other conditions found necessary to protect the health and welfare of the surrounding property or neighborhood or the city as a whole. Change in use, expansion, or contraction of site area or alteration of structures or uses classified as special uses, existing prior to the effective date of this code, must conform to the regulations pertaining to special uses. If the site is found inappropriate for the use requested, the zoning board of appeals may deny approval of the special use. 
(c)  Application. A request for special use permit must be submitted on an application form available at the code enforcement office. Each application must be accompanied by a site plan, floor plan, and a fee established by the common council, which is not refundable. Applications must be submitted to the codes enforcement officer, who will then transmit to the zoning board of appeals. 
(d)  Specific property restriction. Any special use permit, if granted, pertains only to the specific property for which the application was made. Such granted permit does not apply to any other property the applicant may control. 
(e)  Procedure. 
i.  Upon the filing of an application for a special use, the zoning board of appeals must set a reasonable time and place for a public hearing to consider the application. The zoning board of appeals must publish notice not at least five days prior to the hearing in at least one newspaper of general circulation within the city. Each notice must include the time, date, place, purpose of the hearing, and location of the subject proposal. 
ii.  Where the consideration for a special use permit involves land within 500 feet of an adjoining municipality, or from the boundary of any existing or proposed county or state park, or from the right-of-way of any existing or proposed state or county highway, or from the existing or proposed right-of-way of any stream or drainage channel owned by the county, or state or county-owned land on which a public building is situated, the application must be referred to the county planning department at least 30 days before the public hearing and acted upon in accord with the provision General Municipal Law, § 239. 
iii.  The zoning board of appeals may recess or table an application in order to obtain additional information which it deems to be in the best interest of the public health, safety, and welfare or necessary to assist in its decision making. Upon recessing for this purpose, the zoning board of appeals must announce a time and date when the hearing will be resumed. 
iv.  Within 62 days from the date of any public hearing, the zoning board of appeals must render a decision. For purposes of this section, a decision is deemed "rendered" upon the written permit being signed by the chairman. No later than five days following the rendering of the decision of the zoning board of appeals granting or denying the application, the applicant and parties of record must be notified of the decision in writing. Such written notification must include the findings of fact for denial or approval, whichever is applicable. The zoning board of appeals must file the decision in the city clerk's office within five business days after the day it is rendered. The zoning board of appeals will also retain in its files a copy of each decision, which files will be made available for inspection by the public. 
(f)  Findings of fact. The zoning board of appeals will review all special use requests on the basis of both architectural review and site plan review criteria and findings identified above, and must also review and determine that the use as proposed on the specific lot location will generally satisfy the following criteria: 
i.  The physical characteristics, topography and other features of the lot and the scale and physical design and other features of any new or existing buildings to be occupied by the use are suitable and adaptable for the proposed use without any modifications which would change the established character of the street or neighborhood setting. 
ii.  The nature and intensity of operations of the use will not be more objectionable to surrounding properties than those of a permitted use. Examples of measures of potential impacts due to the nature and intensity of development include, but are not limited to, traffic generation, hours of operation, size and scale, noise, odor, dust, vibration, glare, smoke and environmental hazards. 
iii.  The use is not in such proximity to a place of worship, school, community center, park, or other prominent place of community activity and public assembly so as to regularly conflict with such other activity and thereby constitute a danger to health, safety, or general welfare. 
iv.  The use will not unreasonably increase or introduce traffic congestion or safety hazards or impose traffic volumes on streets and street patterns that are deficient in width, design, sight distance, intersection configuration, or other typical standards necessary to accommodate such traffic changes. 
v.  The use makes adequate provision for off-street parking in accordance with this code. 
vi.  The use and the proposed design of the building and other structures and site facilities for the use are appropriate in the proposed location and have incorporated reasonable efforts to harmonize with surrounding uses and mitigate any adverse impacts on surrounding uses, including but not limited to, traffic congestion and hazards, untimely scheduling of activities, removal of trees and other established natural features, and excessive stormwater runoff, noise, nuisance, odors, glare, or vibration. 
vii.  The cumulative impacts of the use in the proposed location will not unreasonably interfere with or diminish the continued use, preservation, stability, value, enjoyment, prosperity or growth of the neighborhood or community. In evaluating cumulative impacts the board will consider the proximity of other special permit uses, particularly those similar to the use proposed. 
viii.  The use will not conflict in any way with the city comprehensive plan and other adopted city plans. 
(g)  Conditions. 
i.  The zoning board of appeals may impose conditions on a special use in its issuance of a special use permit which, in its opinion, are reasonable and necessary to promote the safety, health, and general welfare of the community, including preservation of the general character of the neighborhood in which the use is located. By the way of illustration and not limitation, such a condition could restrict the hours of operation of any special use. 
ii.  The zoning board of appeals reserves the right to review any special use permit and may require an annual report for any special use to ensure that the use is in compliance with all applicable code requirements and conditions of approval. 
iii.  Upon a determination by the zoning board of appeals that there are sufficient grounds to warrant a review, the zoning board of appeals may initiate a review of the operation of any previously approved special use and may call for a public hearing to determine whether the use is in compliance with applicable standards and conditions. Findings of noncompliance will result in the property owners being required to submit a compliance schedule and to fully comply within 45 days, or a shorter period of time if the zoning board of appeals determines there is cause for emergency action. Any further violations will result in revocation of the special use permit. 
(h)  Change to approved special use. If the zoning board of appeals determines that proposed change or modification to an existing special use is substantial, the zoning board of appeals must hold a public hearing as if for a new special use. A change or modification is deemed substantial if the proposal significantly changes the use, design, character, or potential impacts of the existing lot or structure. 
(i)  Resubmittal of denied application. An application that has been denied by the zoning board of appeals may not be resubmitted for a minimum of six months from the date of denial. In order for a resubmitted application to be considered by the zoning board of appeals, the applicant must show, to the satisfaction of the zoning board of appeals, that the events, facts or circumstances of the previously heard application have changed, thereby warranting submission or reconsideration of a subsequent application. 
(j)  Expiration. In the event that a special use has not commenced within one year from the date of the meeting wherein the special use was approved by the zoning board of appeals, then the permit will automatically lapse and be null and void. In addition, a special use that has been abandoned for one year or more automatically lapses and is deemed null and void. 
(Ord. No. 9301A , 9-26-18) 
Sec. 80-19.3. - Variance. 
(a)  Purpose. Where difficulties exist, rendering compliance with the zoning code impractical and such compliance would create unnecessary hardship to the owners or users of land or buildings, the zoning board of appeals may grant a variance to the requirements of the zoning code after a public hearing. 
(b)  Specific property restriction. 
i.  Any use or area variance pertains only to the specific property for which the application was made. Such variance does not apply to any other property. 
ii.  Any enlargement, contraction, or alteration of a use variance requires resubmittal of a use variance application for such change. 
(c)  Use variance standards. The zoning board of appeals, on appeal from the decision or determination of codes enforcement officer, has the power to grant use variances. No such use variance will be granted by the zoning board of appeals without a showing by the applicant that applicable zoning regulations and restrictions have caused unnecessary hardship. In order to prove such unnecessary hardship the applicant must demonstrate to the zoning board of appeals that for each and every allowed use under the zoning regulations for the particular district where the property is located: 
i.  The applicant cannot realize a reasonable return, provided that lack of return is substantial as demonstrated by competent financial evidence. 
ii.  The alleged hardship relating to the property in question is unique, and does not apply to a substantial portion of the district or neighborhood. 
iii.  The requested use variance, if granted, will not alter the essential character of the neighborhood. 
iv.  The alleged hardship has not been self-created. 
v.  That the granting of the variance requested will not confer a special privilege to the property that is denied other lands in the same district. 
    The zoning board of appeals, in the granting of the variance, will grant the minimum variance that will make possible the reasonable use of the land, and at the same time, preserve and protect the character of the neighborhood and the health, safety, and welfare of the community. 
(d)  Area variance standards. The zoning board of appeals has the power, upon an appeal from a decision or determination of the codes enforcement officer, to grant area variances. In making its determination, the zoning board of appeals will take into consideration the benefit to the applicant if the variance is granted, as weighed against the detriment to the health, safety, and welfare of the neighborhood or community by such grant. In making such determination the zoning board of appeals will also consider: 
i.  Whether an undesirable change will be produced in the character of the neighborhood or a detriment to nearby properties will be created by the granting of the area variance. 
ii.  Whether the benefit sought by the applicant can be achieved by some method feasible for the applicant to pursue, other than an area variance. 
iii.  Whether the requested area variance is substantial. 
iv.  Whether the proposed variance will have an adverse effect or impact on the physical or environmental conditions in the neighborhood or district. 
v.  Whether the alleged difficulty was self-created, which is relevant to the decision of the zoning board of appeals, but does not necessarily preclude the granting of the area variance. 
    The zoning board of appeals, in the granting of area variances, will grant the minimum variance that it deems necessary and adequate and at the same time preserve and protect the character of the neighborhood and the health, safety, and welfare of the community. 
(e)  Procedure. 
i.  A request for a variance must be submitted in duplicate on forms available from the codes enforcement office. One copy will be retained by the codes enforcement officer. Each application must be accompanied by an accurate and intelligible plan drawn to a suitable scale. A nonreturnable fee must be paid upon filing of an application. Applications must be signed by property owners or a certified agent and submitted to the codes enforcement officer, who will then transmit to the zoning board of appeals all the papers constituting the record upon which the action is to be taken. The variance will be placed on the calendar of the zoning board of appeals when the zoning board of appeals has substantial factual information to hear the case. 
ii.  A public hearing is required for an appeal for a variance or exception from the terms of the zoning code. No variance or exception will be decided until after due notice has been given and a public hearing has been held. Notice of a public hearing is as follows: 
a.  By publication of a notice thereof once in one official paper of the city at least five days before the date of the hearing. 
b.  The zoning board of appeals will mail notice of the hearing to the appellant or applicant or his attorney or agent at least five days before the date of the hearing. 
c.  The zoning board of appeals will also, insofar as practicable, mail notices of the hearing of an appeal to all property owners that appear on the latest tax roll of the city within a 200-foot radius of the premises affected by the appeal. Notices must be mailed to the street address of the properties within 200-foot radius regardless of whether or not the owner resides therein, unless the zoning board of appeals has definite knowledge of other addresses of absentee owners. Notice of the hearing must also be sent to the councilor of the district within which the property described in the application is located. The notice provided for by this section is deemed a courtesy to neighboring property owners only and compliance with this section is not a condition precedent to proper legal notice and no hearing or action taken thereon will be deemed invalid or illegal because of any failure to mail the notices provided for in this section. 
iii.  Where a variance application involves land within 500 feet of an adjoining municipality, or from the boundary of any existing or proposed county or state park, or from the right-of-way of any existing or proposed state or county highway, or from the existing or proposed right-of-way of any stream or drainage channel owned by the county, or state or county-owned land on which a public building is situated, the variance must be referred to the county planning department at least 30 days before the public hearing and acted upon in accord with the provision of General Municipal Law, § 239. 
iv.  All decisions of the zoning board of appeals will be recorded in the form of a written resolution, which shows the vote of each member and is signed by the chairman. Additionally, the written decision must set forth the basis for the decision of the zoning board of appeals and a detailed summary of the facts upon which the determination was made must be recorded in the decision and constitutes a part of the record thereof. 
v.  The decision must state whether or not the standards set forth in this section for unnecessary hardship (use variances) or practical difficulty (area variances) have or have not been met, and such determination must be supported by findings of facts, thereby warranting the reversal or affirmance of the codes enforcement officer. The decision must also state in detail what conditions and safeguards are required. 
(f)  Conditions. The zoning board of appeals has, in the granting of both use variances and area variances, the authority to impose such reasonable conditions and restrictions as are directly related to and incidental to the proposed use of the property. Such conditions must be consistent with the spirit and intent of this code, and must be imposed for the purpose of minimizing any adverse impact such variance may have on the neighborhood or community. Specific conditions may include, but are not limited to, requirements for parking, fencing, landscape, and hours of operation. 
(g)  Withdrawals. The applicant may not amend or withdraw his application after the official notice of the public hearing has been transmitted to the official paper for publications. Nothing prohibits the applicant or appellant from requesting the zoning board of appeals to table the applicable variance until such time the applicant requests or the zoning board of appeals may establish. In no event, may the variance remain tabled for more than 60 days. However, the zoning board of appeals, in its discretion or upon motion of the applicant, may retable a variance for an additional 60 days. The zoning board of appeals may not retable a particular variance more than two times.

The general purpose of the State Environmental Quality Review (SEQR) Act is to incorporate the consideration of environmental factors into planning, review, and decision-making processes of local government at the earliest possible time. To this end, SEQR requires that all agencies determine whether the actions they directly undertake, fund, or approve may have a significant effect on the environment and, if it is determined that the action may have a significant effect on the environment, prepare or request an environmental impact statement. Environmental Conservation Law, article 8 and part 617 of the New York Code of Rules and Regulations (NYCRR) and any subsequent amendments thereto are hereby adopted by reference. A summary discussion of the basic SEQR review procedures follows to supplement 6 NYCRR part 617. 
(b)  Process completion required. Where required under state law, completion of the SEQR process is required before an application is deemed complete. No final action will be taken on an application until it has complied with SEQR. Therefore, time deadlines for review and decision-making on applications do not begin until the SEQR process has been completed. 
(c)  Applicability. Projects or physical activities that meet at least one of the following criteria are subject to review under SEQR. If the proposed action does not require a discretionary decision, there is no requirement for review under SEQR. 
i.  Are directly undertaken by the city. 
ii.  Involve funding by the city. 
iii.  Require a discretionary permit from the city or its appointed boards. 
(d)  Classification of action. If a proposed action is subject to review under SEQR, the first step is to classify the action into one of four categories. 
i.  Classes of action requiring no further review under SEQR. 
a.  Exempt. These are actions such as maintenance, repair, emergency, ministerial action, or nondiscretionary permitting that do not require further review. See section 617.2(q) for the list of exempt actions. 
b.  Type II. An action that never produces significant environmental impacts and does not require the preparation of a determination of significance or a draft environmental impact statement (EIS). Type II actions are defined by the list in section 617.5. 
ii.  Classes of action that require further review under SEQR. 
a.  Type I. An action that is likely to produce significant environmental impacts and may require the preparation of a draft environmental impact statement (EIS). At a minimum, a full environmental assessment form (EAF) must be completed and determination of significance made. Type I actions are defined by the list in 6 NYCRR 617.4, or any amendment or successor regulation or law adopted thereto. 
b.  Unlisted. All actions that are not type I, type II, exempt, or excluded are considered unlisted. At a minimum, an unlisted action requires that a short EAF be completed and a determination of significance made that may require the preparation of a draft environmental impact statement (EIS). 
(e)  Environmental assessment forms. An EAF must be completed for all type I and unlisted actions. If a project involves review and approval by multiple official bodies, separate EAF approvals are needed from each. 
i.  Type I actions. A full EAF must be prepared for all type I actions. The project sponsor/applicant completes part 1 of the form and submits it to an involved agency. When the lead agency is established, that agency is responsible for completing parts 2 and 3 of the full EAF. 
ii.  Unlisted actions . A short EAF must, at a minimum, be completed for all unlisted actions. The project sponsor/applicant completes part 1 of the form and submits it to an involved agency. When the lead agency is established, that agency is responsible for completing parts 2 and 3 of the short EAF. An agency may require a full EAF if the short EAF will not provide sufficient information to assess the environmental impact of the proposed action. 
(f)  Lead agency. 
i.  If there is only one agency approving, funding, or directly undertaking an action, that agency is automatically the lead agency. If there are two or more involved agencies, a lead agency must be established by agreement of the agencies within 30 calendar days. If the lead agency cannot be agreed on, any of the involved agencies or the applicant can petition the state department of environmental conservation commissioner to resolve the dispute and designate the lead agency. 
ii.  For zoning or subdivision actions reviewed by the city, the following bodies are the lead agency, unless otherwise agreed to pursuant to state law. 
a.  Map or text amendments to this chapter: City council. 
b.  Site plan and subdivision applications: Planning board. 
c.  Variances: Zoning board of appeals. 
d.  Special use permits: Zoning board of appeals. 
(g)  Significance. 
i.  Determination of significance. For type I and unlisted actions, the lead agency has 20 calendar days to make its determination of significance. If the lead agency finds that it does not have sufficient information to make this determination, it will request that the applicant provide it. 
ii.  Considerations. In determining significance the lead agency must consider: 
a.  The whole action. 
b.  The EAF and any other information provided by the applicant. 
c.  Any comments from involved agencies. 
d.  The criteria in section 617.11. 
e.  Public comments. 
iii.  Negative declaration. 
a.  A negative declaration means that the lead agency has determined that the proposed action will not have a significant effect on the environment and a draft EIS will not be prepared. Every negative declaration must identify the relevant areas of environmental concern, analyze the identified concerns to determine if there will be a significant impact on the environment, and document the determination, in writing, showing why the environmental concerns will not be significant. A model negative declaration form can be found as appendix F of part 617. 
b.  The lead agency must maintain a file, readily accessible to the public, containing the EAF and the negative declaration. For a type I action, the lead agency must additionally comply with filing and notice requirements described in section 617.10. 
iv.  Positive declaration. If the lead agency determines, after review of the EAF, that the proposed action has the potential for a significant impact on the environment or community character, it must prepare and file a notice of positive declaration and may require the preparation of a draft environmental impact statement (EIS) that includes information specified in section 617.14. A model positive declaration form can be found as appendix E of part 617. 
v.  Draft EIS. The applicant has the right to prepare the draft EIS. If the applicant refuses to prepare the draft EIS, the lead agency has the option of preparing the draft EIS for the applicant or tabling the proposed action for lack of a complete application. If the lead agency decides to prepare the draft EIS, it may hire a consultant and charge the applicant a fee to recover the direct costs of preparation. 
(h)  Acceptance of draft EIS. After receiving a draft EIS, the lead agency has 30 days to determine whether the document is adequate for public review in terms of scope and content as described in section 617.14. If the lead agency decides that the draft EIS is not adequate, it will return the document to the applicant with a written identification of the deficiencies. If the lead agency determines that the draft EIS is adequate, it will issue a notice of completion of a draft EIS and file it as prescribed in section 617.10. A sample notice of completion of a draft EIS form is included as appendix G of part 617. 
(i)  Public comment period. The notice of completion of a draft EIS starts the public comment period that must be a minimum of 30 days, during which all concerned parties are encouraged to offer their comments to the lead agency. The public comment period must continue at least ten days following a public hearing, if one is held. 
(j)  Public hearing. When the lead agency accepts the draft EIS, it must decide whether to hold a public hearing or not. If a hearing is held, the lead agency must comply with notice and filing requirements identified in section 617.10. A hearing must provide at least 14 days of public notice and must start within 60 days from the date of filing the notice of completion of the draft EIS. 
(k)  Notice of completion of final environmental impact statement. Upon completion or receipt of the final EIS, the notice of completion of the final EIS must be prepared and filed as described in section 617.10. A sample notice of a completion of the final EIS form is included as appendix H of part 617. 
(l)  Findings statement. All involved agencies must prepare their own SEQR findings statement after the final EIS has been filed and before the agency makes a decision. The lead agency must prepare its findings statement within ten to 30 days following the filing of the notice of completion of the final EIS. The findings statement should discuss the balance of environmental impacts versus the needs and benefits of the proposed action. 
i.  Positive findings statement: A positive findings statement means that the lead agency has determined that the proposed action is approvable after consideration of the final EIS and demonstrates that the action chosen is one that minimizes or avoids environmental impacts to the maximum extent practicable in terms of location, layout and design, scale or magnitude, timing and use. 
ii.  Negative findings statement: If the action is not approvable, the lead agency must make a negative findings statement documenting the reasons for the denial. A sample findings statement form may be found as appendix I of part 617. Findings of each agency must be filed with all other involved agencies and the applicant.

ARTICLE XX. - NONCONFORMITIES 

Sec. 80-20.1. - General applicability. 
(a)  Authority to continue. Any structure, use, lot, site element, or sign that legally existed as a nonconformity as of the effective date of this code, and any legally existing structure, use, lot, site element, or sign that has been made nonconforming after the effective date of this code, and any subsequent amendments, may continue subject to the provisions of this article so long as it remains otherwise legal. A structure, use, lot, site element, or sign that is illegal as of the effective date of this code, remains illegal if it does not conform with every requirement of this code. 
(b)  Burden on property owner. The burden of establishing the legality of a nonconformity under the provisions of this code is the responsibility of the property owner of the nonconforming structure, lot, site element, or sign, and the operator of the use. 
(c)  Safety regulations. All police power regulations enacted to promote public health, safety, and welfare including, but not limited to, all building, fire, and health codes apply to nonconformities. 
(Ord. No. 9301A , 9-26-18) 
Sec. 80-20.2. - Nonconforming use. 
(a)  Definition. A nonconforming use is the use of a structure or land that at one time was an allowed use within a zoning district but because of subsequent amendments to the code is no longer allowed. 
(b)  Expansion. No structure devoted to a nonconforming use may be enlarged more than 25 percent of its square footage as existing subsequent to it rendered nonconforming. However, the zoning board of appeals may, upon petition, and after holding a public hearing, rule that a special exception to this regulation be granted based upon the following considerations: 
i.  Favorable report and recommendation from the codes enforcement officer. 
ii.  Such expansion will not encroach upon adjoining land uses. 
iii.  The expansion will not result in increased noise, smoke, glare, or other nuisances to adjoining uses. 
iv.  Traffic to and from the nonconforming use will not be substantially increased over local streets. 
v.  Adequate off-street parking and service areas are provided. 
vi.  New construction will be in keeping with surrounding development and of sound, durable material. 
vii.  Any existing building was built for the use it now contains or a similar use, and is not a converted residential dwelling. 
(c)  Relocation. A nonconforming use cannot be relocated, in whole or in part, to any other location on the same lot. The nonconforming use may only be relocated to another structure or lot if the use conforms to all regulations of the zoning district where it is relocated. 
(d)  Change of use. A nonconforming use may not be changed to any other nonconforming use. A nonconforming use may only be changed to a use allowed within the district. 
(e)  Discontinuation. Whenever a nonconforming use has been discontinued, the use cannot be re-established, and any future use must conform to the uses allowed within the district. A use is deemed discontinued under any of the following circumstances: 
i.  The vacancy of a building occupied by a nonconforming use for a continuous period of one year. 
ii.  The vacancy of land occupied by a nonconforming use for a continuous period of 90 days. However, the nonconforming use of land for agricultural purpose is not deemed abandoned until put to some other lawful use. 
iii.  The manifestation of a clear intent on the part of the owner to abandon the nonconforming use. 
iv.  A seasonal nonconforming use is not deemed abandoned because of a vacancy between seasons. 
(f)  Damage or destruction of structure. When a structure devoted to a nonconforming use is damaged by fire, structural failure, wind, explosion, or other natural cause, once such structure is repaired or rebuilt, it may continue to be used for the nonconforming use as previously occupied. If such structure was a nonconforming structure, it is subject to the provisions of section 80-20.3 below. 
(Ord. No. 9301A , 9-26-18) 
Sec. 80-20.3. - Nonconforming structure. 
(a)  Definition. A nonconforming structure is a principal or accessory structure that once conformed to zoning district regulations but because of subsequent amendments to the code no longer conforms to applicable dimensional standards. Certain nonconforming site elements are regulated separately by section 80-20.5 and nonconforming signs by section 80-20.6. 
(b)  Maintenance. Normal maintenance and incidental repair may be performed on any nonconforming structure. No repairs or reconstruction are permitted that would create any new nonconformity or increase the degree of the existing nonconformity. 
(c)  Structural alterations. No structural alterations are permitted on any nonconforming structure, except in the following situations: 
i.  When the alteration is required by law or is necessary to restore the structure to a safe condition upon the order of any official charged with protecting public safety. 
ii.  When the alteration will eliminate the nonconformity. 
iii.  When the alteration will not create any new nonconformity or increase the degree of any existing nonconformity. For example, if a structure is nonconforming in terms of the required front setback (i.e., does not meet the required minimum), the structure may add a rear addition if it meets all other district regulations. 
iv.  When the alteration is as described in item e., below. 
(d)  Relocation. A nonconforming structure cannot be relocated, in whole or in part, to any other location on the same lot unless such relocation would make the structure conforming. A nonconforming structure may be relocated to another lot if the structure conforms to all regulations of the zoning district where it is relocated. 
(e)  Damage or destruction. 
i.  In the event that a nonconforming structure is damaged or destroyed by the fault of the property owner or tenant, the structure, as restored or repaired, must be rebuilt to comply with all requirements of this code. 
ii.  In the event that any nonconforming structure is damaged or destroyed by fire, structural failure, wind, explosion, or other natural cause, it may be repaired or rebuilt to the same size and dimension as previously existed, provided that a building permit is obtained within one year following the damage or destruction. 
(Ord. No. 9301A , 9-26-18) 
Sec. 80-20.4. - Nonconforming lot. 
(a)  Definition. A nonconforming lot is a lot of record that at one time conformed to the lot dimension requirements (lot area, lot width, lot depth) of the zoning district in which it is located but because of subsequent amendments to the code no longer conforms to the applicable lot dimensions. 
(b)  Use. A nonconforming lot of record may be used for any use allowed in the zoning district. 
(c)  Development. Development of a nonconforming lot must meet all applicable dimensional regulations of the district in which it is located with the exception of any lot dimension requirement that renders it nonconforming. In the event that compliance with the yard and coverage requirements of the district would result in a structure of less than 575 square feet in area or in width less than 24 feet, the zoning board of appeals may determine and fix setback and coverage requirements for the lot to permit its reasonable utilization for a permitted use. 
(d)  Common ownership of substandard lots of record. If two or more contiguous, lawfully established substandard lots of record are under the same ownership, such lots are considered to be one lot and undivided for the purpose of this code, provided that the merger does not result in more than one principal building on the lot. For purposes of this provision, a garage is not considered a principal building. This also does not apply if such a merger would create a through lot. 
(Ord. No. 9301A , 9-26-18) 
Sec. 80-20.5. - Nonconforming site elements. 
(a)  Definition. A nonconforming site element is a site development element, such as landscape, fences or walls, lighting, and parking, that at one time conformed to the requirements of this code, but because of subsequent amendments, has been made nonconforming. Nonconforming signs are regulated separately by section 80-20.6. 
(b)  Maintenance. Normal maintenance and incidental repair to a nonconforming site element may be performed. No repairs or reconstruction are permitted that would create any new nonconformity or increase the degree of the previously existing nonconformity. 
(c)  Required conformance. All nonconforming site elements must be brought into conformance when the following occurs: 
i.  General. 
a.  The existing principal structure is demolished and a new structure is constructed. 
b.  A new principal structure is constructed on the lot. 
c.  The existing principal structure is increased in total building footprint by 30 percent or more. 
ii.  Additional specific actions. 
a.  For parking lot landscape and design, when an existing parking lot is fully reconstructed or repaved, or an existing parking lot area is expanded by 50 percent. Resealing or re-striping of an existing parking lot, which does not entail paving, resurfacing, or replacement of the asphalt, concrete, or other surface paving material, is not considered reconstruction. 
b.  For fences and walls, when 50 percent or more of the length of a fence or wall is reconstructed along any one lot line, all fences or walls on the site must be brought into conformance. 
c.  For exterior lighting, when 25 percent or more of exterior lighting fixtures are replaced, all exterior lighting on the site must be brought into conformance. This is calculated as installation of new lighting posts and/or non-post mounted lighting fixtures based on the total lighting installed by the type of mounting. For example, if over 25 percent of the wall-mounted fixtures are to be replaced, all wall-mounted fixtures must be brought into conformance while nonconforming freestanding fixtures may remain. 
(d)  Exemptions. When an existing parking lot is required to provide landscape, which would result in creating a parking area that no longer conforms to the parking regulations of this code, such existing parking lot may not be required to install all or a portion of the required landscape. The applicant is required to show that landscape cannot be accommodated on the site. If only certain requirements can be accommodated on the site, only those elements are required. The planning department will make the determination that all or a portion of required landscape does not have to be installed. 
(Ord. No. 9301A , 9-26-18) 
Sec. 80-20.6. - Nonconforming signs. 
(a)  A nonconforming sign and sign structure may remain in use, so long as it remains otherwise lawful and has not been damaged, destroyed, or removed as described in item d below. The sign face of an existing nonconforming sign may be replaced, but the structure cannot be altered to accommodate such change. 
(b)  No nonconforming sign and sign structure may be relocated, in whole or in part, to any other location on the same or other lot, unless the entire sign and sign structure conforms to all regulations of the zoning district in which the sign is relocated. 
(c)  No nonconforming sign can be altered or enlarged in a way that increases the nonconformity of the sign or sign structure. This does not preclude normal maintenance and cleaning or changing of the sign face. 
(d)  In the event that any nonconforming sign and sign structure is damaged or destroyed to the extent of more than 50 percent of its value prior to the damage, the sign and sign structure cannot be restored or repaired unless it conforms to all applicable regulations for the district. 
(Ord. No. 9301A , 9-26-18) 
ARTICLE XXI. - ENFORCEMENT 

Sec. 80-21.1. - Notice of violation. 
    If the codes enforcement officer finds that any of the provisions of this code are being violated, he/she shall notify in writing the person responsible for such violation, indicating the nature of the violation and ordering the action necessary to correct it. He/she shall take any action necessary by this title to ensure compliance with or to prevent violation of its provisions. 
(Ord. No. 9301A , 9-26-18) 
Sec. 80-21.2. - Violations and penalties. 
(a)  Violations of the provisions of this code, or failure to comply with any of its requirements, constitutes a misdemeanor. Any person, firm or corporation who violates this code or fails to comply with any of its requirements may, upon conviction, be fined not more than $500.00 and/or penalized 15 days in jail, and in addition, must pay all costs and expenses involved in the case. Each day such violation continues will be considered a separate and distinct offense. 
(b)  The tenant or occupant of any building, structure, premises or part thereof, and any architect, builder, contractor, agent, owner, or other person who commits, participates in, assists in, or maintains such violation may be found guilty of a separate offense and suffer the penalties described herein. Nothing in this code prevents the city from taking any other legal remedy authorized by law. 
(c)  For purposes of trial procedure for violations of this code, the provisions of Criminal Procedure Law and of the New York State Uniform City Court Act govern, except that no jury trial is allowed for an offense as defined in this code. 
(Ord. No. 9301A , 9-26-18) 
ARTICLE XXII. - RIGHT-OF-WAY AND ACCESS STANDARDS 

Sec. 80-22.1. - Purpose. 
    The purpose of these right-of-way and access standards is to: 
(a)  Design rights-of-way to provide safe, convenient, and functional pedestrian, bicycle, and vehicular traffic flow. 
(b)  Design circulation patterns within communities so that children can walk to school. 
(c)  Encourage safe pedestrian routes to transit. 
(d)  Use visual cues and design elements to indicate pedestrian rights-of-way and minimize conflicts. 
(e)  Make places walkable for aging populations in response to new demographics and special needs. 
(f)  Limit the use of cul-de-sacs when possible. 
(Ord. No. 9301A , 9-26-18) 
Sec. 80-22.2. - Blocks. 
(a)  Block length. Residential blocks must not exceed 1,000 feet in length, unless approved by the city engineer. 
(b)  Block design. 
i.  The shape of a new block must be generally rectangular, but may vary to conform to natural features, highway and rail rights-of-way, park boundaries, or site constraints. Where blocks curve, they must generally maintain their cardinal orientation over their entire trajectory. 
ii.  New rights-of-way must connect to and extend the existing block network where possible. This requirement does not apply when connections cannot be made because of a natural or man-made barrier, such as existing structures, steep slopes, wetlands and waterbodies, railroad and utility rights-of-way, and parks and dedicated open space. 
iii.  All rights-of-way must terminate at other rights-of-way, forming a network. The city engineer may approve cul-de-sacs and dead-end streets when they meet the following criteria: 
a.  No connection is available to an existing adjacent development or a natural or man-made barrier, such as a waterway, railroad, limited-access expressway, or unusual topography, exists that prevents connection. 
b.  The cul-de-sac or dead-end street is no more than 600 feet in length, as measured along the centerline from the closest intersection. 
iv.  Where adjoining areas are not developed, rights-of-way in new subdivisions must extend to the project boundary line where feasible to make provision for the future projection of rights-of-way into the adjoining areas. 
v.  Alleys may be required for new or reconfigured blocks. Where blocks have an existing alley, such alley must be maintained. 
(Ord. No. 9301A , 9-26-18) 
Sec. 80-22.3. - General right-of-way standards. 
    All new construction, reconstruction, and reconfiguration of rights-of-way must comply with this section. This does not apply to limited access expressways. Rights-of-way must be designed in relation to topographic and drainage conditions, public safety, and the development served by the right-of-way. 
(a)  Right-of-way construction. 
i.  All right-of-way construction and repair must be in accordance with standards and specifications set forth by the city engineer. 
ii.  Vertical and horizontal alignment must be in accordance with standards and specifications set forth by the city engineer. 
iii.  Street grades must conform in general to the terrain and the minimum grade will be based on surface type of the roadway as determined by the city engineer. 
(b)  Access and intersection requirements. 
i.  All public and private rights-of-way must be improved as complete streets. A complete street is defined as right-of-way facilities that are designed and operated to enable safe access for all users. Persons with disabilities, pedestrians, bicyclists, motorists, and transit riders are able to safely move along and across a right-of-way designed as a complete street. 
ii.  If a new subdivision involves frontage on a major street, the street layout should be planned to avoid, to the extent possible, any private residential driveways from having direct access to such streets. 
iii.  Street intersections must be at right angles. If, because of topography or other natural or man-made barriers, an intersection cannot be at right angles, the intersection may use an alternate design that ensures safety. 
(c)  Property line and curb radius. Curb radii cannot be less than 25 feet and must be increased proportionately where the angle of intersection is less than 50 degrees. These minimums may be increased where the city engineer finds that larger arcs or radii are necessary for the proper design of the intersection. 
(d)  Drainage. Proper drainage is the responsibility of the subdivider. The type of drainage system and its design must be approved by the city engineer. Green infrastructure designs are encouraged. 
(e)  Utility installation. Prior to paving of streets or sidewalks, water and sewer mains and services must be in place, or the developer must provide necessary casing for utilities. No pavement may be cut without the approval of the city engineer. No boring of new pavement is allowed for the installation of new service lines mains or other facilities unless approved by the city engineer. 
(Ord. No. 9301A , 9-26-18) 
Sec. 80-22.4. - Sidewalk design standards. 
(a)  Sidewalks must be provided on both sides of all rights-of-way, with the exception of a rural right-of-way type per section 80-22.6 or when determined by the planning board that sidewalks do not need to be installed. Sidewalks are not required where one side of the right-of-way is a steep vertical wall, railroad, or other feature where the public does not require access. 
(b)  Sidewalks must be paved with a permanent, fixed, non-slip material. 
(c)  Sidewalks must be as straight and direct as possible. 
(d)  Where sidewalks cross driveways, the sidewalk zone must remain level, with no change in cross-slope. 
(Ord. No. 9301A , 9-26-18) 
Sec. 80-22.5. - Bicycle lane design standards. 
    Where bicycles lanes are included in right-of-way construction, reconstruction, and reconfiguration projects, appropriate designs include, but are not limited to, the design types of this section. Where installed, bicycle facilities, should be constructed in accordance with the Manual on Uniform Traffic Control (MUTCD) and the Urban Bikeway Design Guide published by the National Association of City Transportation Officials (NACTO). 
(a)  Shared. A marking placed in a vehicular travel lane to indicate that a bicyclist may use the full lane. Also called a shared-lane marking. 
(b)  Bike lane. A portion of the roadway that has been designated by striping, signs, and pavement markings for the preferential or exclusive use of bicyclists, typically located adjacent to motor vehicle travel lanes and flowing in the same direction as motor vehicle traffic. 
(c)  Buffered bike lane. A conventional bicycle lane paired with a designated buffer space separating the bicycle lane from the adjacent motor vehicle travel lane and/or parking lane. 
(d)  Contra-flow bike lane. A bicycle lane designed to allow bicyclists to ride in the opposite direction of motor vehicle traffic, typically used to convert a one-way traffic street into a two-way street, one direction being for motor vehicles and bikes, and the other being for bikes only. 
(e)  Left-side bike lane. A conventional bike lane placed on the left side of one-way streets or two-way median divided streets. 
(f)  Cycle track. An exclusive bike facility that combines the user experience of a separated path with the on-street infrastructure of a conventional bike lane. A cycle track is physically separated from motor traffic and distinct from the sidewalk. 
(g)  Raised cycle track. A bicycle facility that is vertically separated from motor vehicle traffic, typically paired with a furnishing zone between the cycle track and motor vehicle travel lane and/or pedestrian area, and allowing for one-way or two-way travel by bicyclists. 
(h)  Two-way cycle track. A physically separated cycle track that allows bicycle movement in both directions on one side of the road. 
(Ord. No. 9301A , 9-26-18) 
Sec. 80-22.6. - Right-of-way dimensions. 
    All rights-of-way must match one of the right-of-way types of this section, which may be modified as needed by the city engineer to address specific site conditions. 
(a)  Right-of-way types. The classifications of rights-of-way are divided into the following: 
i.  Major streets carry the majority of trips entering and leaving the city, as well as the majority of through movements. 
ii.  Collector streets provide both access to and traffic circulation within residential neighborhoods, commercial, and industrial areas. Collector streets differ from major streets in that collector streets enter residential neighborhoods, distributing trips from arterials through the area to destinations. Collector streets also collect traffic from local streets in residential neighborhoods and channel into the arterial system. 
iii.  Minor streets primarily provide direct access to abutting land and access to the higher order street. 
iv.  Alleys are a vehicular drive located to the rear of lots providing access to service areas, parking, and outbuildings, and often containing utility easements. 
v.  Rural roads provide access and circulation through portions of the planning area that are largely undeveloped or rural in character. 
(b)  Right-of-way dimensional requirements. Minimum dimensions are provided for each right-of-way type in this section. The illustrative examples are also provided to illustrate a potential configuration of a right-of-way type. Variations to these configurations may be approved by the city engineer. All dimensions indicated are minimums, unless otherwise noted.
