PREFACE 
    This Code constitutes a recodification of the general and permanent ordinances of the Town of Wadesboro, North Carolina. 
    Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the 1992 Code, as supplemented, and ordinances subsequently adopted by the council. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this Code, the reader can locate any section of the 1992 Code, as supplemented, and any subsequent ordinance included herein. 
    The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order, and the various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Notes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state law have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this Code. 
Chapter and Section Numbering System 
    The chapter and section numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and local government codes. Each section number consists of two parts separated by a dash. The figure before the dash refers to the chapter number, and the figure after the dash refers to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the second section of chapter 1 is numbered 1-2, and the first section of chapter 6 is 6-1. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter, and at the same time new sections can be inserted in their proper place by using the decimal system for amendments. For example, if new material consisting of one section that would logically come between sections 6-1 and 6-2 is desired to be added, such new section would be numbered 6-1.5. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject. The next successive number shall be assigned to the new article or division. New chapters may be included by using one of the reserved chapter numbers. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. 
Page Numbering System 
    The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the volume. The number to the right of the colon represents the number of the page in that portion. In the case of a chapter of the Code, the number to the left of the colon indicates the number of the chapter. In the case of an appendix to the Code, the letter immediately to the left of the colon indicates the letter of the appendix. The following are typical parts of codes of ordinances, which may or may not appear in this Code at this time, and their corresponding prefixes:

Indexes 
    The indexes have been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the indexes themselves which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which the user is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
    A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up-to-date. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited, and the affected page or pages will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
    Keeping this publication up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. As revised pages are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
Acknowledgments 
    This publication was under the direct supervision of Jan Shekitka, Senior Code Attorney, and William B. Eddy, Editor, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida. Credit is gratefully given to the other members of the publisher's staff for their sincere interest and able assistance throughout the project. 
    The publisher is most grateful to Ms. Ellen Dosser-Huntley, Town Manager, Ms. Nancy Huntley, Town Clerk, and Mr. Robert E. Little, Town Attorney, for their cooperation and assistance during the progress of the work on this publication. It is hoped that their efforts and those of the publisher have resulted in a Code of Ordinances which will make the active law of the town readily accessible to all citizens and which will be a valuable tool in the day-to-day administration of the town's affairs.

Editor's note- When permission to inspect a dwelling or its premises is denied, the building inspector must obtain a warrant to inspect. G.S. 15-27(2) provides for the issuance of warrants for the conduct of inspections authorized by law. The N.C. Court of Appeals, in In Re Dwelling, 24 N.C. App. 17 (1974), has held that the consent of the tenant-occupant who was in actual possession and control of the premises was sufficient to authorize an inspection without a warrant, notwithstanding the fact that the owner had objected to the warrantless search. When faced with a situation where permission to inspect is denied, building inspectors are advised to seek the advice of the town attorney. 
Sec. 6-74. - Procedure for enforcement. 
(a)  Preliminary investigation; notice; hearing. Whenever a petition is filed with the inspector by a public authority or by at least five residents of the town charging that any dwelling or dwelling unit is unfit for human habitation, or whenever it appears to the inspector, upon inspection, that any dwelling or dwelling unit is unfit for human habitation, he shall, if his preliminary investigation discloses a basis for such charges, issue and cause to be served upon the owner of and parties in interest in such dwelling or dwelling unit a complaint stating the charges and containing a notice that a hearing will be held before the inspector at a place therein fixed, not less than ten nor more than 30 days after the serving of the complaint. The owner or any party in interest shall have the right to file and answer to the complaint and to appear in person, or otherwise, and give testimony at the place and time fixed in the complaint. Notice of such hearing shall also be given to at least one of the persons signing a petition relating to such dwelling. Any person desiring to do so may attend such hearing and give evidence relevant in courts of law or equity shall not be controlling in hearings before the inspector. 
(b)  Procedure after hearing. After such notice and hearing, the inspector shall state in writing his determination whether the dwelling or dwelling unit is unfit for human habitation, and, if so, whether it is deteriorated or dilapidated. If the inspector determines that the dwelling or dwelling unit is deteriorated, he shall state in writing his findings of fact in support of such determination, and shall issue and cause to be served upon the owner thereof an order directing and requiring the owner to repair, alter, or improve such dwelling or dwelling unit to comply with the minimum standards of fitness established by this article within a specified period of time, not to exceed 90 days. Such order may also direct and require the owner to vacate and close such dwelling or dwelling unit until such repairs, alterations, and improvements have been made. If the inspector determines that the dwelling is dilapidated, he shall state in writing his findings of fact to support such determination, and shall issue and cause to be served upon the owner thereof an order directing and requiring the owner either to repair, alter or improve such dwelling or dwelling unit to comply with the minimum standards of fitness established by this article, or else to vacate and remove or demolish the dwelling or dwelling unit within a specified period of time not to exceed 90 days.

(1)  In personam remedy. If the owner of any deteriorated dwelling or dwelling unit shall fail to comply with an order of the inspector to repair, alter, or improve or to vacate and close the dwelling or dwelling unit within the time specified therein, or if the owner of a dilapidated dwelling or dwelling unit shall fail to comply with an order of the inspector to repair, alter or improve or to vacate and close and remove or demolish the dwelling or dwelling unit within the time specified therein, the inspector shall submit to the town council at its next regular meeting a resolution directing the town attorney to petition the superior court for an order directing such owner to comply with the order of the inspector, as authorized by G.S. 160A-446(g). 
(2)  In rem remedy. After failure of an owner of a deteriorated or dilapidated dwelling or dwelling unit to comply with an order of the inspector within the time specified therein, if injunctive relief has not been sought or has not been granted as provided in subsection (c)(1) of this section, the inspector shall submit to the town council an ordinance ordering the inspector to cause such dwelling or dwelling unit to be repaired, altered, improved, vacated, closed, removed or demolished, as provided in the original order of the inspector, and pending removal or demolition, to place a placard on such dwelling as provided by G.S. 160A-443 and section 6-76.

Any appeal from the inspector shall be taken within ten days from the rendering of the decision or service of the order, and shall be taken by filing with the inspector and with the zoning board of adjustment a notice of appeal which shall specify the grounds upon which the appeal is based. Upon the filing of any notice of appeal, the inspector shall forthwith transmit to the zoning board of adjustment all the papers constituting the record upon which the decision appealed from was made. When an appeal is from a decision of the inspector refusing to allow the person aggrieved thereby to do any act, his decision shall remain in force until modified or reversed. When an appeal is from a decision of the inspector requiring the person aggrieved to do any act, the appeal shall have the effect of suspending the requirement until the hearing by the zoning board of adjustment, unless the inspector certifies to the board, after the notice of appeal is filed with him, that by reason of the facts stated in the certificate (a copy of which shall be furnished the appellant), a suspension of his requirement would cause imminent peril to life or property, in which case the requirement shall not be suspended except for due cause shown upon not less than one day's written notice to the inspector, by the zoning board of adjustment, or by a court of record upon petition made pursuant to G.S. 160A-446(f) and subsection (e) of this section. The zoning board of adjustment shall fix a reasonable time for the hearing of all appeals, shall give due notice to all the parties, and shall render its decision within a reasonable time. Any party may appear in person or by agent or attorney. The zoning board of adjustments may reverse or affirm, wholly or partly, or may modify the decision or order appealed from, and may make such decision and order as in its opinion ought to be made in the matter, and to that end it shall have all the powers of the inspector, but the concurring vote of four members of the zoning board of adjustment shall be necessary to reverse or modify any decision or order of the inspector. The zoning board of adjustment shall have power also in passing upon appeals, in any case where there are practical difficulties or unnecessary hardships in the way of carrying out the strict letter of this article, to adapt the application of the article to the necessities of the case to the end that the spirit of the article shall be observed, public safety and welfare secured, and substantial justice done. Every decision of the zoning board of adjustment shall be subject to review by proceedings in the nature of certiorari instituted within 15 days of the decision of the zoning board of adjustment, but not otherwise. 
(e)  Petition to superior court by owner. Any person aggrieved by an order issued by the inspector or a decision rendered by the zoning board of adjustment shall have the right, within 30 days after issuance of the order or rendering of the decision, to petition the superior court for a temporary injunction restraining the inspector pending a final disposition of the cause, as provided by G.S. 160A-446(f).

Occupation of a building so posted shall constitute a misdemeanor. 
(b)  Each ordinance shall be recorded in the office of the register of deeds in the county wherein in the property is located, and shall be indexed in the name of the property owner in the grantor index, as provided by G.S. 160A-443(5).

(Code 1992, § 100.048) 
Sec. 28-95. - Separate lines or wires on same poles.

(b)  Location in sidewalk. In instances where a sidewalk is paved out to the curb, such poles and guy wires may be maintained in the sidewalk pavement in respect to distances from the curb as if an unpaved utility strip existed. 
(c)  Clearance from gas pipes. In instances where room can be obtained for laying gas pipes in the utility strip as set forth in section 28-99 by moving the electric or communication poles nearer to, but not nearer than within six inches of the existing curb, or the established curbline where no curb exists, then the owner thereof shall be required to so move its poles to make such room. But any such existing poles need not be moved, unless it is necessary in order to permit the pipe to be laid on the property side of the line of poles, until the time arrives when the owner desires to replace it, and any pole installed in lieu of such existing poles, or any new pole otherwise installed in such strip, shall be so placed in reference to the minimum of six inches from the curb or curbline, as will provide the 18 inches of separation as contemplated in this section; and in the meantime, the proximity of the gas line of less than 18 inches from any such pole under such circumstances shall not be regarded as a violation of the provision of this article. 
(d)  Location in alleys. In places, such as alleys, where no curb exists and the town finds it impracticable under the circumstances to establish a curbline, such poles are to be maintained as near to the adjacent property line as practicable so as to minimize interference with vehicular traffic; and in places such as parks the poles shall be placed as the town may require under the particular circumstances existing.

(a)  All pipes and appurtenant valves and connections for use in distributing commercial gas which are located in the streets shall be installed and maintained beneath the ground surface, and may be installed and maintained within the area of such utility strip when and only when the pipes and appurtenant valves and connections can be laid in a straight line parallel at all places with the curb or curbline, on the property line side of all electric and communication poles without disturbing the soil, or placing such pipe or facility nearer than the distance of 18 inches from the outside surface of any such electric or communication pole and appurtenant facility which is in existence at the time of installing such gas pipe or appurtenant facility. 
(b)  If the utility strip along any street or road under the jurisdiction of the town is not occupied by the facilities of any electric or communication utility, then gas pipes may be laid in such utility strip, provided that the excavation for laying and the placing of any such gas pipes and facilities shall not be nearer than 24 inches of the property line side of the curb or curbline as established by the town. 
(Code 1992, § 100.053)

    If it shall be found that the locations and clearances specified in sections 28-98 and 28-99 cannot be observed at some points without undue hardship on the gas utility, deviation from such locations and clearances at such particular points may be made by written agreement between the authorized representative of the gas utility and of the electric and communications utility involved, with the written approval of the town's engineer or other person authorized to act in such matter. In the event of a failure to agree in respect to obviating any alleged undue hardship as provided in this section, the gas utility may refer the matter to the town council for its determination to be made after notice and hearing.

(b)  A service pipe leading from the gas main to supply a customer may be laid without first filing such drawing, provided that such drawing showing such information and properly related to drawings already filed, is filed within 180 days after laying such service pipe. The town clerk shall permanently file one copy of each such drawing, and deliver one each to the electric utility and the communications utility operating in the town.

Sec. 28-196. - Guidelines for naming town-owned property. 
    When considering naming any town-owned property to which this policy applies, the town council may consider the following guidelines: 
(1)  Priority may be given to names carrying geographical, historical, and/or cultural significance to the area in which the property is located, or to the town as a whole. 
(2)  Property may be named after an individual(s) when the individual(s) has a historical association with the property, or the area in which it is located within the town, or where individual(s) has contributed in a significant way to the public life and well-being of the town. 
(3)  Consideration for the naming of a property honoring a deceased individual should not occur until the person has been deceased for at least one year, and the person's historical significance and good reputation have been secured in the history of the town. 
(4)  Names should be chosen in a manner that avoids duplication, confusing similarity, or inappropriateness. 
(5)  Prior to a town council's decision to name a town-owned property, there shall be a public hearing to ensure community input. The public hearing will be placed on the agenda beforehand and the agenda distributed to media and others in the typical manner. 
(6)  The town council shall approve any naming of town-owned property only by resolution approved by the unanimous vote of all voting members of the town council.

Sec. 28-197. - Naming in connection with fund-raising effort. 
    The naming of town-owned property in connection with an effort to raise private funds for the construction, improvement, or purchase of such property presents a unique situation. In such circumstance, the town council may agree to name a property, or any portion of the property upon the council's considered determination that such action is appropriate and in the best interests of the town. When naming a town-owned property, or any portion of such property, in connection with a fund-raising effort, the provisions of this policy shall not apply unless the town council determines otherwise. 
(Ord. of 2-6-2017(2)) 
Sec. 28-198. - Right to change name. 
    If the town council determines, in its reasonable and good faith opinion, that the circumstances have changed since the naming of a town-owned property such that continued association of the town with the name would adversely impact the reputation, image, mission, or integrity of the town, or is otherwise in the town's best interest, the town council may change the name of the town-owned property including, without limitation, the person for whom a town-owned property has been named has been convicted of a felony or other crime of moral turpitude under state or federal law. 
(Ord. of 2-6-2017(2)) 
Sec. 28-199. - Policy only a guide. 
    This policy is only a guide. Nothing in this policy limits the town council's ultimate authority to vary from the terms of this policy, and to use its discretion in naming a town-owned property or related decisions based on the unique facts of a particular circumstance.

(3)  When the person is in compliance with all lawful rules and regulations of all other applicable regulatory agencies having jurisdiction; and 
(4)  When several users are discharging radioactive wastes or materials to the public sewer, they shall, upon notification, cooperate in limiting the release of the material and shall file with the town a statement of their agreed prorate discharges. If this is not done within a reasonable time after notifications, sewer use may be discontinued by the town. 
(Code 1992, § 50.73) 
Sec. 36-138. - Limitations on the use of garbage grinders. 
(a)  Waste from garbage shredders and grinders shall be acceptable for discharge into a town sewer as follows: 
(1)  Wastes generated in preparation of food normally consumed on the premises; or 
(2)  Where the user has obtained a permit for that specific use from the town, and agrees to undertake whatever self-monitoring is required to enable the town to determine the waste constituents and characteristics and applicable fees and charges. 
(b)  Such grinders must shred the waste to a degree that all particles will be carried freely under normal flow conditions prevailing in the town sewer. Garbage grinders shall not be used for grinding plastic, paper products, inert materials or garden refuse. 
(Code 1992, § 50.74) 
Sec. 36-139. - Limitations on point of discharge. 
    No person shall discharge any substances directly into a manhole or other opening in a town sewer other than through an approved building sewer, unless he has been issued a permit by the town.

(1)  Maximum concentration of certain constituents: 
Constituent Code Maximum 
Permissible 
Concentration Aluminum Al 5.0 mg/l Arsenic As 0.5 mg/l Barium Ba 0.5 mg/l Boron B 0.5 mg/l Cadmium Cd 0.5 mg/l Cobalt Co 0.5 mg/l Copper Cu 0.5 mg/l Cyanide Cn 0.1 mg/l Iron Fe 35.0 mg/l Lead Pb 0.5 mg/l Manganese Mn 0.5 mg/l Mercury Hg 0.5 ug/l Nickel Ni 0.5 mg/l Silver Ag 0.5 mg/l Total Chromium Cr 0.5 mg/l Vanadium V 0.5 mg/l Zinc An 0.5 mg/l Chloroform CHC1 3 1.0 mg/l Selenium Se 0.5 mg/l Sulfate SO 4 500 mg/l Sulfide S 2.0 mg/l Free Acidity 0 Alkalinity Town may require alkalinity addition up 
to 7.5 times the NH 3 -N concentration 
of the discharge in question.  
Except in cases where one or more of the constituents in this subsection are found in the drinking water supply. In such cases, the limits shall be the amounts listed plus the amounts found in drinking water. The amount of constituents in the drinking water supply shall be determined on samples caught at the particular industry during a normal operating day. The sample will be caught within the plant at a well-used tap after running the tap a suitable length of time to remove water that has been standing in the lines (15-minutes minimum). 
(2)  Having an ammonia nitrogen content of more than 40 mg/l. 
(3)  Having a five-day BOD of more than 1,000 mg/l. 
(4)  Having a TSS content of more than 1,000 mg/l. 
(5)  Having a COD of more than 2,500 mg/l. 
(6)  Having a pH lower than 6.5. 
(7)  Having a pH higher than 9.0. 
(8)  Having a temperature higher than 120 degrees Fahrenheit, 49 degrees Celsius. 
(9)  Containing more than 100 mg/l (total) of oil and grease of animal or vegetable and of mineral or petroleum origin. 
(10)  Containing in excess of 0.02 mg/l total identifiable chlorinated hydrocarbons. 
(11)  Containing 1.0 mg/l phenolic compounds which cannot be removed by the county's treatment process. 
(12)  Containing any toxic substances or poisonous substances in sufficient quantities to interfere with the biological processes used at the county's treatment works. 
(13)  Containing strong iron pickling wastes or concentrated plating solutions unless pretreated in such a way as to comply with all other limitations of this section. 
(14)  Containing any solid or viscous substance including but not being limited to: ashes, cinders, sand, mud, straw, shavings, metal, glass, rags, bones, feathers, slurry, lime residues, slops, whole blood, fleshings, chemical residues, paint residues, waxes, asphalt, hair, tar, plastics, wood, paunch manure, butchers offal, animal viscera, lime or any solid or viscous substances capable of causing obstructions of any kind in either the collection system or at any point in the treatment plant. Also, any waste resulting from processes involving textiles, fabrics, wool or other processes containing inert fibrous materials shall undergo evaluation by the county. Since some of these processes have been shown to be detrimental to the treatment of waste at the existing waste plant, the evaluation procedure will be concerned with residual fibre within the treatment plant and its discharges. Any process determined by the county to be creating adverse conditions within the treatment plant by the collection of fibrous or inert materials in its basins, clarifiers or discharges, shall not be allowed to continue disposing of its waste into the sanitary sewer collection system, but shall dispose of its waste by alternative means. 
(15)  Containing any liquid waste or other such substance that contains dyes or other color of such character and quantity as to prevent removal by biological processes employed at the treatment plant. 
(16)  Containing any liquid or other substances that after normal treatment require excessive amounts of chlorine for pathogenic disinfection. This excess chlorine demand exerted by such waste shall be determined by comparing the chlorine demand of such waste to obtain a free residual of 0.5 mg/l to 15 ppm, which shall be considered to be the maximum use rate for domestic waste to obtain the same residual. 
(17)  Of the industrial variety with such a volume that the peak hourly flow exceeds a gallons per day rate of 200 percent of the total daily flow of the industry. In such cases where a peak hourly flow of more than 200 percent is discharged, the town may require the discharger to provide holding facilities of sufficient capacity so as to discharge into the collection system at an assigned rate over a specified period of time. Industrial dischargers, which discharge hydraulic volumes equal to or greater than 15 percent of the treatment works design capacity, may be required to provide flow equalization facilities designed in accordance with the current edition of EPA Process Manual for Upgrading Existing Wastewater Treatment Plants. 
(b)  Users in industrial categories subject to effluent guidelines issued under Section 304(b) of the Federal Act which are discharging incompatible pollutants to publicly owned treatment works are required to adopt best practicable control technology currently available, as defined by the administrator pursuant to Section 304(b) of the Federal Act. Where the county's treatment works was designed to and does achieve substantial removal of pollutants other than the four pollutants listed in the definition for compatible pollutants in section 36-102, BOD, TSS, pH, and fecal coliform bacteria, the approving authority may not require the user to achieve best practicable control technology currently available, since this would lead to an uneconomical duplication of treatment facilities. While the term "substantial removal" is not subject to precise definition, it generally contemplates removals in the order of 80 percent or greater; minor incidental removals in the order of ten percent to 30 percent are not considered "substantial." For some industrial categories, it may be necessary to define pretreatment guidelines for problems that may arise as a result of the discharge into the county's treatment works. However, any adjustments required for particular industrial categories should be considered in connection with the county's requirements rather than in the national pretreatment standard. In no case shall any user be allowed to exceed the limits stated in subsection (a)(1) of this section. Limitations on wastewater strength in this division may be supplemented with more stringent limitations pursuant to section 36-146. If the town determines that the limitations in this section may not be sufficient to enable the county's treatment works to comply with water quality standards or effluent limitations specified in the county's national pollutant discharge elimination system (NPDES) permit, or if national pretreatment guidelines issued by EPA in the future exhibit lower values than those values listed in this section or add a parameter to those values listed in this section, the town may require additional compliances by reissuance of permits outlined in section 36-146. 
(Code 1992, § 50.77) 
Sec. 36-142. - Disposal of unacceptable waste. 
    Waste not permitted to be discharged into the town sewer must be transported to a state-approved disposal site. 
(Code 1992, § 50.78) 
Sec. 36-143. - Special provisions. 
(a)  If any waters or wastes discharged or proposed to be discharged to the public sewers contain the substances or possess the characteristics enumerated in sections 36-137 through 36-141, and which in the judgment of the approving authority, may have a deleterious effect upon the wastewater treatment works, processes, equipment or receiving waters, or which create a hazard to life, or constitute a public nuisance, the approving authority may reject the wastes. 
(b)  The town may discontinue water service or sewer service, or both, to any user who violates sections 36-137 through 36-141, when in the judgment of the approving authority such action is necessary to protect the wastewater treatment works, processes, equipment or receiving waters from injury or damage, or is necessary to protect life or health. 
(Code 1992, § 50.79) 
Sec. 36-144. - Metered water supply. 
(a)  When charges and fees are based upon the water usage, such charges and fees shall be applied against the total amount of water used from all sources, public and private, determined by means of the user and approved by the town, adding private sources volume to the metered water consumption. 
(b)  When unpolluted water is prohibited as provided by section 36-136, charges and fees will be applied only against the total wastewater discharged to the town's sanitary sewer. In such case, volume of wastewater discharged shall be determined by a flow measuring and totalizing device purchased, installed and maintained by the user. The location and type of the devices must be approved by the approving authority. 
(Code 1992, § 50.80) 
Sec. 36-145. - Discharge reports.

Sec. 36-147. - Monitoring facilities. 
(a)  Users who propose to discharge, or who in the judgment of the approving authority likely could discharge, wastewater with constituents and characteristics different from that produced by a domestic premises, may be required to install a monitoring facility. 
(b)  When more than one user can discharge into a common building sewer, the approving authority may require installation of a separate monitoring facility for each user. Also, when, in the judgment of the approving authority, there is a significant difference in the wastewater constituents and characteristics produced by different operations of a single user, the approving authority may require that separate monitoring facilities be installed for each separate discharge. 
(c)  Monitoring facilities that are required to be installed shall be constructed, operated and maintained by the user at the user's expense. The purpose of the facility is to enable inspection, sampling and flow measurement of wastewater produced by a user. If sampling or metering equipment is required by the town, it shall be provided, installed, and operated at the user's expense. The monitoring facility will normally be required to be located on the user's premises outside of the building. The town may, however, when such a location would be impractical or cause undue hardship on the user, allow the facility to be constructed in the public street or sidewalk area with the approval of the public agency having jurisdiction over that street or sidewalk, and located so that it will not be obstructed by landscaping or parked vehicles. 
(d)  If the monitoring facility is inside the user's fence, there shall be accommodations to allow safe and immediate access for town personnel, such as a gate secured with a town lock. There will be ample room in or near such facility to allow accurate sampling and compositing of samples for analysis. The entire facility and the sampling and measuring equipment shall or may be supplied by the user, at his expense. 
(e)  Whether on public or private property, the monitoring facilities shall be constructed in accordance with the town's requirements and all applicable local town construction standards and specifications. When in the judgment of the town an existing user is required to have a monitoring facility, the user will be so notified in writing. Construction must be completed within 90 days following a written notification unless a time extension is otherwise granted by the town. 
(Code 1992, § 50.83) 
Sec. 36-148. - Inspection and sampling. 
    The town may inspect the facilities of any user to ascertain whether the purpose of this article is being met and all requirements are being complied with. Persons or occupants of premises where wastewater is created or discharged shall allow the town or its representatives ready access at all reasonable times to all parts of the premises for purposes of inspection or sampling or in performance of any of their duties. The town shall have the right to set up on the user's property such devices as are necessary to conduct sampling or metering operations. Where a user has security measures in force which would require proper identification and clearance before entry into their premises, the user shall make necessary arrangements with their security guards so that upon presentation of suitable identification, personnel from the town will be permitted to enter without delay for the purposes of performing their specific responsibilities. 
(Code 1992, § 50.84) 
Sec. 36-149. - Pretreatment. 
    Users shall make wastewater acceptable under the limitations established in this division before discharging into any town sewer. Any facilities required to pretreat wastewater to a level acceptable to the town shall be provided and maintained at the user's expense. Pretreatment facilities shall be operated continuously during periods of wastewater discharge to the town sewers in such a manner as to produce a pretreated discharge acceptable to the town as defined in sections 36-141, 36-144- 36-146 and 36-152. Detailed plans showing the pretreatment facility and operating procedures shall be submitted to the town for review, and shall be approved by the town before construction of the facility. The review and approval of such plans and operating procedures will in no way relieve the user from the responsibility of modifying the facility as necessary to produce an effluent complying with the provisions of this division. Any subsequent changes in the pretreatment facility of method or operation shall be reported to and be approved by the approving authority. 
(Code 1992, § 50.85) 
Sec. 36-150. - Protection from accidental discharge. 
(a)  Each user shall provide protection from accidental discharge of prohibited materials or other wastes regulated by this division. Facilities to prevent accidental discharge of prohibited materials shall be provided and maintained at the user's expense. Detailed plans showing facilities and operating procedures to provide this protection shall be submitted to the town for review, and shall be approved by the town before construction of the facility. 
(b)  The review and approval of such plans and operating procedures will in no way relieve the user from the responsibility of modifying the facility as necessary to provide the protection necessary to meet the requirements of this division. 
(Code 1992, § 50.86) 
Sec. 36-151. - Control manhole. 
    A control manhole shall be provided downstream from any building, treatment, storage tank or any other approved works to facilitate monitoring of industrial water and waste. The discharger shall provide and maintain the control manhole pursuant to section 36-147. Any and all users may be required by the town to construct a control manhole. The user who has constructed a monitoring facility (section 36-147) may be waived of the requirement of a control manhole by the approving authority. 
(Code 1992, § 50.87) 
Sec. 36-152. - Flow control measuring equipment.

(Code 1992, § 50.88) 
Sec. 36-153. - Wastewater charges and fees. 
(a)  Schedule of charges and fees. A schedule of charges and fees shall be adopted by the town which will enable it to comply with the revenue requirements of the state clean water grant program and Public Law 92-500 and such charges and fees shall be as shown on the rate schedule which is on file in the offices of the town. All industries using the county's treatment works are subject to industrial waste surcharges on discharges the characteristics of which exceed the limits set in subsection (c) of this section for certain pollutants. 
(b)  Types of charges and fees. The charges and fees as established in the town's schedules of charges and fees may include, but not be limited to: 
(1)  User classification charges. 
(2)  Fees for extra monitoring; i.e., that which requires costs above the average cost of assessing an average or representative analysis. 
(3)  Fees for permit applications (include regular monitor charges on permit). 
(4)  Appeal fees. 
(5)  Charges and fees based on wastewater constituents and characteristics. 
(6)  Ad valorem tax. 
(7)  Industrial waste surcharges. 
(8)  User charge payments. 
(c)  Basis for determination of surcharges. 
(1)  Charges and fees shall be based upon a minimum basic charge for each premises, computed on the basis of wastewater from a domestic premises with the following characteristics: 
BOD ..... 250 mg/l TSS ..... 250 mg/l Oil and grease (total) .....  40 mg/l COD ..... 625 mg/l Ammonia nitrogen .....  15 mg/l  
(2)  The charges and fees established for permit users shall be based upon the measured or estimated constituents and characteristics of the wastewater discharge of that user which may include, but not be limited to, BOD, COD, ammonia, oil and grease, chlorine demand and volume. 
(d)  Method of determining surcharges. The charges for excesses of the constituents listed in subsection (c) of this section will be based upon the mass emission rate of those constituents and determined as follows: 
(1)  Mass emission rate, MER O = MG × C × 8.34 
where: MER is the mass emission rate in pounds of a particular constituent. MG is the millions of gallons of wastewater discharged and C is the concentration in mg/l of the particular constituency being charged for (as an example) BOD, COD, etc., and 8.34 is equal to the number of pounds/one gallon of water.  
(2)  The amount of the charge in dollars will be calculated as follows: 
Ao - R × MER O where: 
Ao is equal to the amount of the charge in dollars and 
R is equal to the rate of charge per pound of constituent and MER O is equal to the pounds of a constituent. 
An example of surcharge: 
"X" Corporation is a producer of canned foods. They discharged 1,000,000 gallons of wastewater in the month of January. Analysis found that the wastewater had the following characteristics: BOD - 400 mg/l; TSS - 950 mg/l. There were no other limitations exceeded in this example. There were 100 employees employed at the cannery. The limits of BOD and TSS are 250 mg/l. 
The MER of BOD is equal to: 
MERBOD = (400-250) x 8.34 x 1 MG = (150) x 8.34 x 1 = 1,251 lbs. of BOD or 1.121 thousand lbs. BOD  
If the charge for BOD is R - $70.00/1,000 lbs. BOD, then the total charge for BOD is equal to, as: 
Ao - R × MER Ao - $70.00 x 1.121 Ao $78.47  
For TSS, the charge would be computed as follows: MERTSS - (950-250) × 8.34 × IMG = 700 × 8.34 × 1 = 5,838 lbs. TSS or 5.838 thousand lbs. TSS. 
At a charge of $70.00/thousand lbs., the charge for TSS - 5.838 × $70.00 = $408.66. 
Total Surcharge for January = BOD Charge - $78.47 = TSS Charge - $378.66 = The higher charge which = $378.66  
(3)  Where a single discharge is such that more than one constituent is excessive and subject to surcharge, the actual surcharge will be based on the most costly constituent rather than on the total of excessive constituents. 
(e)  Method of determining charge rates. 
(1)  The county council will annually review the actual cost of operation and maintenance of the county's wastewater treatment plant and adjust the surcharge rates and the volume user charge rate (per 1,000 gallons) to reflect the true cost of constituent treatment. The adjustments, if any, will become effective following the first day of each new fiscal year. The town council may review these rates and adjust the town's rates accordingly at any time it deems adjustments are in the best interest of the town. 
(2)  The town council sets the following rates effective from the date of the ordinance from which this division is derived: 
COD $ ____________ per 1,000 pounds in excess of 625 mg/l BOD 5 $ ____________ per 1,000 pounds in excess of 250 mg/l TSS $ ____________ per 1,000 pounds in excess of 250 mg/l Total oil and grease $ ____________ per 1,000 pounds in excess of 40 mg/l  
(f)  Sampling procedures and analysis. 
(1)  All samples and determinations of wastewater characteristics shall be as representative of the waste discharge as possible. The costs of regular sampling and analysis will be included in the permit of class type. The town may take additional samples after a significant process change which significantly affects the quantity of strength of the wastewater discharged. The frequency of sampling shall be as follows: 
Daily Average Flow 
Thousand Gallons Per Day Minimum Required Frequency of Tests for Surcharge Parameters* 0-10 0-1 per year 10-20 1 per year 20-30 1 per six months 30-40 1 per three months 40-50 1 per month Over 50 2 per month  
*  More frequent sampling may be done at any time at the option of the town for any industry where pretreatment is required or that has discharged incompatible wastes in the past. 
(2)  Upon request by the person concerned, the town shall make available split samples of the composite sample collected. If the person feels the results are not representative of their wastes, the town may resample at a cost to the person, per day, in the amount as provided in the town schedule of fees and charges, which will include sampling and analysis for BOD, TSS, COD, pH, chlorine demand and oil and grease or heavy metals if necessary. 
(g)  Sampling small industries. Small industries with inadequate sampling facilities may in the event that waste characteristics do not vary more than 25 percent, be charged an estimated or average surcharge for that industry. 
(Code 1992, § 50.89) 
Sec. 36-154. - Enforcement. 
(a)  Duties of user upon unlawful discharges. 
(1)  Any user who discharges wastes in violation of this division shall, upon discovery thereof, immediately notify the approving authority so that the town may take necessary countermeasures to minimize the damage to the town sewer, treatment facilities, treatment processes and receiving waters.

Approval of the Development Plan does not imply or satisfy approval requirements of other agencies nor does approval of this Development Plan satisfy or imply approval of detailed facility plans required to be approved by the State, County, or Town.
b. Public Hearing; Notice Thereof
Town of Wadesboro Zoning Ordinance
31
Upon receipt of a properly prepared site specific development plan the Zoning Administrator shall arrange to bring such plan before the Board of Adjustment in the manner of a public hearing. Completed plans shall be received a minimum of fourteen (14) days prior to the public hearing at which the proposed vested rights plan is scheduled to be considered by the Board. Notice of the public hearing shall be given in the same manner as that required for a variance.
In considering an application for a Development Permit With Vested Rights the Board of Adjustment shall give due regard that the purpose and intent of this Ordinance shall be served, public safety and welfare secured and substantial justice done. If the Board should find, after public hearing, that the proposed Permit should not be granted, such proposed Permit shall be denied.
In granting such Permit, the Board of Adjustment shall make the following affirmative findings:
1) The use requested is among those listed as a Permitted or Conditional Use in the District in which the subject property is located or is to be located and complies with all the requirements of this Ordinance and other applicable ordinances.
2) The requested Permit is either essential or desirable for the public convenience or welfare.
3) The requested Permit will not impair the integrity or character of the surrounding or adjoining Districts, and will not be detrimental to the health, safety or welfare of the community.
4) Adequate utilities, access roads, drainage, sanitation and/or other necessary facilities have been or are being provided.
In granting a Development Permit With Vested Rights, the Board of Adjustment may impose such additional restrictions and requirements upon such Permit as it may deem necessary in order that the purpose and intent of this Ordinance are served, public welfare secured and substantial justice done. Approval of a site specific development plan
Town of Wadesboro Zoning Ordinance
32
with the condition that a variance, Conditional Use Permit or modification be obtained shall not confer a vested right unless and until the necessary variance, Conditional Use Permit or modification is obtained. If all requirements and conditions are accepted by the applicant, the Board shall authorize the issuance of the Permit, otherwise the Permit shall be denied. Any Permit so authorized shall remain vested for a period of two years from the date of the action granting the Permit.
2. Violations
Any violation of a term or condition involved in the granting of a Zoning Permit With Vested Rights shall be treated the same as a violation of this Ordinance and shall be subject to the same remedies and penalties as any such violation. In addition, the Board of Adjustment may, after public hearing, revoke any such vested rights for failure to abide by any such term or condition.
3. Other Ordinances Apply
The establishment of a vested right shall not preclude the application of overlay zoning which imposes additional requirements but does not affect the allowable type or intensity or use, or ordinances or regulations which are general in nature and are applicable to all property subject to land-use regulation, including, but not limited to building, fire, mechanical, electrical and plumbing codes.
4. Changes or Amendments
No change or amendment to any Permit With Vested Rights shall be made except after public hearing and except as provided for in this Ordinance for the original issuance of such Permit. If, at the time of consideration of proposed change or amendment to an existing Permit, such Permit or proposed change or amendment could not be lawfully made under Ordinance conditions existing at that time, such proposed change or amendment shall be denied. In addition, in no case shall there be an extension of the two-year time period for which such development right is vested. Nothing herein shall exempt plans related to such Permit from subsequent reviews and approvals to ensure compliance with the terms and conditions of the original approval,
Town of Wadesboro Zoning Ordinance
33
provided that such reviews and approvals are not inconsistent with the original approvals.
5. Status at Expiration of Term
A right which has been vested shall terminate at the end of the two-year vesting period with respect to buildings and uses for which no valid Building Permit applications have been filed. Upon issuance of a Building Permit, the provisions of G.S. 160A-418 and G.S. 160A-422 shall apply except that a Building Permit shall not expire or be revoked because of the running of time while a vested right under this Section is outstanding. Any development constructed pursuant to a Development Permit With Vested Rights for which the vested term has expired and which is not in conformance with all the terms of this Ordinance because of changes made in the provisions of this Ordinance, including the Zoning Map, after the issuance of such Permit shall be subject to the provisions of this Ordinance relating to non-conformities the same as any other non-conformity.
6. Annexation Declaration
Any landowner who signs an annexation petition to the Town pursuant to G.S. 160A.31 or G.S. 160A-58.1 shall, as part of that petition, file a signed statement declaring whether or not vested rights with respect to the property subject to the petition have been established under G.S. 160A-385.1 or G.S. 153A- 344.1. If the statement declares that such rights have been established, the Town may require petitioners to provide proof of such rights. A statement which declares that no vested rights have been established by law shall be binding on the landowner and any such vested right shall be terminated.
I-7.4 Site Plan Approval Prerequisite to Development Permit
As a prerequisite to the issuance or authorization of a Development Permit, Site Plan Approval by the Planning Board shall be required for the following developments:
1. Non-residential developments of 5,000 square feet or more of gross area or impervious area, or the addition of five (5) or more parking spaces.

Developments that have received approval for a Development Permit with Vested Rights shall not require approval under this section.
I-7.5 Duties of Zoning Administrator, Board of Adjustment, Courts and Board of Commissioners to Matters of Appeal
It is the intention of this Ordinance that all questions arising in connection with the enforcement of this Ordinance shall be presented first to the Zoning Administrator and that such questions shall be presented to the Board of Adjustment only on appeal from the Zoning Administrator; and that from the decision of the Board of Adjustment recourse shall be to courts as provided by law. It is further the intention of this Ordinance that the duties of the Board of Commissioners in connection with the Ordinance shall not include the hearing and passing upon disputed questions that may arise in connection with the enforcement thereof, but the procedure for determining such questions shall be as herein set out in the Ordinance, and that the duties of the Board of Commissioners in connection with this Ordinance shall be only the duty of considering and passing upon any proposed amendment or repeal of the Ordinance as provided by law.
I-7.6 Violations; Remedies

To erect, construct, reconstruct, alter, repair, convert, maintain, or use any building or structure or to use any land in violation or contravention of this Ordinance or any other regulation made under the authority conferred thereby.
E. Continue a Violation
Each days continuation of any of the above violations is a separate and distinct offense.
I-7.7 Penalties for Violation
Violations of this Ordinance shall constitute either a misdemeanor , with a fine not exceeding fifty (50) Dollars or imprisonment not exceeding thirty (30) days, or, at the election of the Town, shall subject the offender to a civil penalty upon the issuance of a citation for said violation as hereinafter
Town of Wadesboro Zoning Ordinance
36
provided. The civil penalty, if not paid to the Town within fifteen days of the issuance of a citation, may be recovered by the Town in a civil action in the nature of debt. Said civil penalties shall be in the amount of $50.00 (fifty dollars) for each violation and each day any single violation continues shall be a separate violation.
In addition to the civil penalties set out above, any provision of this Ordinance may be enforced by an appropriate equitable remedy issuing from a court of competent jurisdiction. In such case, the general court of justice shall have jurisdiction to issue such orders as may be appropriate, and it shall not be a defense to the application of the Town for equitable relief that there is an adequate remedy at law.
In addition to the civil penalties set out above, any provision of this Ordinance that makes unlawful a condition existing upon or use made of real property may be enforced by injunction and order of abatement by General Court of Justice. When a violation of such a provision occurs, the Town may apply to the appropriate division of the General Court of Justice for a mandatory or prohibitory injunction and/or of abatement commanding the defendant to correct the unlawful condition upon or cease the unlawful use of the property. The action shall be governed in all respects by the laws and rules governing civil proceedings, including the Rules of Civil Procedure in general and Rule 65 in particular.
An order of abatement may direct that buildings or other structures on the property be closed, demolished or removed; that fixtures, furniture or other movable property be removed from buildings on the property; that abandoned or junked vehicles be removed; that improvements or repairs be made; or that any other action be taken that is necessary to bring the property into compliance with this Ordinance. If the defendant fails or refuses to comply with an injunction or with an order of abatement within the time allowed by the court, he may be cited for contempt, and the Town may execute the order of abatement. The Town shall have a lien on the property for the cost of executing an order of abatement in the nature of a mechanics and materialmans lien. The defendant may secure cancellation of an order of abatement by paying all costs of the proceedings and posting a bond for compliance with the order. The bond shall be given with sureties approved by the Clerk of Superior Court in an amount approved by the
Town of Wadesboro Zoning Ordinance
37
judge before whom the matter is heard and shall be conditioned on the defendants full compliance with the terms of the order of abatement within a time fixed by the judge. Cancellation of an order of abatement shall not suspend or cancel an injunction issued in conjunction therewith.
The provision of this Ordinance may be enforced by one, all or a combination of the remedies authorized and prescribed by this section.
Upon determination of a violation of any section of this Ordinance, the penalty for which is a civil penalty, the Zoning Administrator shall cause a warning citation to be issued to the violator. Such citation shall set out the nature of the violation, the section violated, the date of the violation, and shall contain an order to immediately cease the violation. If the violation is in the nature of an infraction for which an order of abatement would be appropriate in a civil proceeding, a reasonable period of time must be stated in which the violation must be abated.
An appeal from a warning citation shall be taken within ten (10) days from the date of said warning citation and the Board of Adjustment, in considering such appeal, shall, not withstanding other powers as may be granted, have power only in the manner of administrative review and interpretation where it is alleged that the Enforcement Officer has made an error in the application of the Ordinance, in the factual situation as it relates to the application of the Ordinance, or both.
Where the Zoning Administrator determines that the period of time stated in the original warning citation is not sufficient for abatement based upon the work required or Consent Agreement, the Zoning Administrator may amend the warning citation to provide for additional time. The warning citation shall specify that a second citation shall incur a civil penalty, together with costs, and attorney fees.
Upon failure of the violator to obey the warning citation a civil citation shall be issued by the Zoning Administrator and either served directly on the violator, his duly designated agent, or registered agent it a corporation, either in person or posted in the United States mail service by first class mail addressed to the last known address of the violator as contained in the records of the Town or obtained from the violator at the time of issuance of the
Town of Wadesboro Zoning Ordinance
38
warning citation. The violator shall be deemed to have been served upon the mailing of said citation. The citation shall direct the violator to pay the civil assessment in person within fifteen days of the date of the citation, or alternatively to pay the citation by mail. The violation for which the citation is issued must have been corrected by the time the citation is paid, otherwise further citations shall be issued. Citations may be issued for each day the offense continues until the prohibited activity is ceased or abated.
If the violator fails to respond to a citation within fifteen days of its issuance, and pay the penalty prescribed therein, the Town may institute a civil action in the nature of debt in the appropriate division of the North Carolina General Court of Justice for the collection of the penalty, costs, attorney fees, and such other relief as permitted by law.

DIVISION II REGULATORY PROVISIONS
ARTICLE II-1 Zoning District Categories Created
For the purposes of this Ordinance, two (2) categories of Zoning Districts are created.
II-1.1 General Use Zoning Districts Created
General Use Zoning Districts are created to provide comprehensive land use regulations throughout the jurisdiction of this Ordinance. There are ten (10) General Use Zoning Districts that provide for a variety of uses that are appropriate to the character of the individual districts throughout the jurisdiction of this Ordinance. See Article II-2.
II-1.2 Conditional Use Zoning Districts Created
Conditional Use Zoning Districts are created for the purpose of providing an optional rezoning choice where the owner of property proposes to rezone property and, in order to carry out the purposes of this Ordinance, proposes to impose special limitations and conditions on the use of the property proposed for rezoning. For each General Use Zoning District, there is a corresponding Conditional Use Zoning District. See Article II-3.
Town of Wadesboro Zoning Ordinance
36
Article II-2 General Use Zoning Districts Created
For the purposes of this Ordinance, the Town of Wadesboro, North Carolina and its area of extraterritorial jurisdiction, is hereby divided into the following general use zoning districts:
R-20 Single-Family Residential District
This District is established as a district in which the principal use of the land is for low density single family residential purposes. It is also the intent of this district to allow for certain types of non-residential community facilities that would not be detrimental to the residential character of the district. The application of this District is principally for outlying areas where the development pattern has not been established and may change subject to the provision of public facilities.
R-10 Single Family Residential District
This District is established as a district in which the principal use of the land is for low density single family residential purposes. It is also the intent of this district to allow for certain types of non-residential community facilities that would not be detrimental to the residential character of the district.
R-8 Residential District
This District is established as a district in which the principal use of land is for single and two-family residential purposes. It is also the intent of this district to allow for certain types of nonresidential community facilities that would not be detrimental to the residential character of the district.
R-6 Residential District
This District is established as a district in which the principal use of land is for high density residential purposes. This district thus allows the highest residential density in the town in a variety of residential uses in areas where traffic circulation patterns can accommodate such densities. It is also the intent of this district to allow for certain types of nonresidential community facilities and services that would not be detrimental to the residential character of the district.
R-O Residential Office District
Town of Wadesboro Zoning Ordinance
37
This is a district in which the principal use of land is for residences, general business and professional offices, and institutional types such as hospitals and medical clinics which do not materially detract from nearby residential areas.
C-B Central Business District
This District is established as a district intended to protect and promote the continued vitality of the downtown commercial area of the Town. This district is intended to allow for a wide variety of commercial, service and governmental oriented uses and to discourage any land uses that would be detrimental to the continuation of this district as the primary shopping and service area of the town.
N-B Neighborhood Business District
This District is established as a district intended to provide for a wide variety of general and commercial uses at convenient neighborhood locations throughout the town in areas where traffic patterns can accommodate traffic generated by such uses. It is the intent of this district to discourage extensive strip commercial development along major highways within the town.
G-B General Business District
This District is established as a district intended to provide for a wide variety of general and commercial uses that usually cater to the motoring public and require major highway frontage. This district is thus intended to provide for controlled commercial development along major highways within the town.
L-1 Light Industrial District
This District is established as a district intended to provide for light manufacturing and warehousing and similar uses. It is not the intent of this district to allow such uses in areas where they would be incompatible with surrounding land uses.
H-I Heavy Industrial District
This District is established as a district intended to provide for manufacturing and warehousing and similar uses but which are more intensive and which have heavier processes than the L-I District.
II-2.1 District Boundaries
The boundaries of the general use districts are hereby established as shown on a map entitled Official Zoning Map, Town of Wadesboro, North Carolina, adopted by the Town Council and certified by the Town Clerk. Said map and all
Town of Wadesboro Zoning Ordinance
38
explanatory matter thereon accompany and are hereby made part of this ordinance. Said map shall be retained in the office of the Town Clerk.
II.2.2 Rules Governing Boundaries
Where uncertainty exists with respect to the boundaries of any of the aforesaid districts as shown on the zoning map, the following rules shall apply:
(1) Where district boundaries are indicated as approximately following the center lines of streets or highways, street lines or railroad right-of-way lines or such lines extended, such center lines, street lines, or railroad right-of-way lines shall be construed to be such boundaries.
(2) Where district boundaries are so indicated that they approximately follow lot lines, such lot lines shall be construed to be said boundaries.
(3) Where district boundaries are so indicated that they are approximately parallel to the centerlines of streets, highways or railroads, or rights-of-way of same, such district boundaries shall be construed as being parallel thereto and at such distance there from as indicated on the zoning map. If no distance is given, such dimension shall be determined by use of the scale shown on said zoning map.
(4) Where a district boundary line divides a lot in single ownership, the district requirements for the least restricted portion of such lot shall be deemed to apply to the whole thereof, provided that such extensions shall not include any part of such a lot more than thirty-five (35) feet beyond the district boundary line.
(5) Where physical or cultural features existing on the ground are at variance with those shown on the Official Zoning Map, or if further uncertainty exists as to the location of boundaries or applicability of zoning districts, the Board of Adjustment shall interpret the intent of the Zoning Map as to the location of such boundaries, and the applicability of such districts.

Wireless towers may be considered undesirable with other types of uses, most notably in residential zoning districts, therefore, special regulations are necessary to ensure that any adverse effects to existing and future development are mitigated.
a. Wireless telecommunications towers (including cellular towers, digital towers and PCS towers) are permitted uses by right in all L-I and H-I Industrial Zoning Districts pursuant to the regulations set forth in this section. Telecommunication towers require the issuance of a conditional use permit in all other zoning districts pursuant to the regulations set forth in this section.

Town of Wadesboro Zoning Ordinance
57
c. It is the intent of the Town to encourage providers to co-locate facilities in an effort to reduce the number of towers in the jurisdiction. The Town encourages providers to construct telecommunications towers such that additional telecommunication providers may be afforded the opportunity to co-locate facilities on the tower. The Town further reserves the right to make co-location a condition on any tower permitted by a conditional use permit under the guidelines listed above.
d. The maximum height of telecommunication towers is as follows:
(1) In all residential districts, the maximum height will be one hundred fifty (150) feet.
(2) In all other districts, the maximum tower height shall be two hundred (200) feet unless documentation is provided to show a taller tower is required to meet minimal service levels.
e. No telecommunication tower will be located within the front yard (as defined within).
f. The Town of Wadesboro, by Federal law, cannot prohibit a telecommunications tower or deny a conditional use permit on the basis of environmental or health concerns relating to radio emission if the tower complies with the Federal Radio Frequency Emission Standards. The Town requires that the provider must provide documentation proving the proposed tower does comply with the Federal Radio Frequency Emission Standards.
g. A buffer yard (as defined herein) is required along all sides of the perimeter of the tower site. It shall be the responsibility of the provider to keep all landscaping material free from disease and property maintained in order to fulfill the purpose for which it was established. Any vegetation that constitutes part of the screening shall be replaced in the event it dies.
h. Placement and Setbacks. The tower shall be situated in such a manner as to not fall across a public street or adjoining property line in the event of structural failure. Such assurance shall be made by either situating the tower a distance from the street or adjoining property line that is greater than the height of the tower or by using a self-collapsing or telescoping structure that will collapse upon itself. Any self-collapsing or telescoping design structure must be documented by a registered engineer or architect. Required setbacks for both the tower and any accessory buildings shall not be less than those
Town of Wadesboro Zoning Ordinance

The plan must be conducted by a North Carolina licensed engineer and the Town must approve the decommissioning plan prior to a solar energy facility permit being issued to applicant.
n. Prior to the issuance of a solar energy facility permit, the applicant must provide the Town with a performance guarantee as in the subsection a. below that will ensure sufficient funds are available for decommissioning of the facility and reclamation of the property to its condition prior to commencement of activities on the site even if the applicant or permit holder sells its rights in the property or becomes insolvent or ceases to reside, be incorporated, do business, or maintain assets in the State. The amount of the guarantee shall be 1.25 times the estimated decommissioning cost minus 50% of the estimated salvageable value, or $50,000.00, whichever is greater. Estimates for decommissioning the site and salvage value be determined by a North Carolina licensed engineer. It is the responsibility of the applicant to provide the Town with the certified cost estimate.
a. The following types of performance guarantees are permitted:
i. A surety or performance bond that renews automatically, is issued solely for the protection of the Town of Wadesboro, includes a minimum 60-day written notice to the Town prior to cancellation, is approved by the Zoning Administrator, and is from a company on the U.S. Department of Treasurys Listing of Certified Companies.

Prior to releasing the bond or terminating Towns rights under the letter of credit, the Town may independently verify whether the site has been fully decommissioned.
o. Following a continuous 180 calendar day period in which no electricity is generated, the solar energy facility will be considered abandoned/out-of-service and the permit holder will have 180 continuous calendar days to complete decommissioning of the solar farm. If Town of Wadesboro submits a written inquiry as to whether the site is abandoned/out-of-service to the zoning permit holder by certified or registered mail or by placing the written inquiry on the main entrance of the solar energy facility, and the zoning permit holder does not provide a written answer to the Town for 120 continuous calendar days, then the Town may deem the solar energy facility abandoned/out-of-service thereby triggering the decommissioning requirements. Decommissioning must include, but is not necessarily limited to, the following:
a. Removal of all facilities, equipment, and components of the solar energy facility of any and all kinds, both above and below ground without exception.
b. Removal of all above and below ground foundations, pads, underground wires, cables, electrical components, etc.

(B) Determination of Sign Copy Area
In measuring the copy area of a sign permitted under this Section, the entire face of the sign shall be included. Where both sides of a double-faced sign contain lettering or other allowable display, one side only shall be used to compute the allowable copy area of the sign. Where the sign consists of individual letters, numbers, characters, figures or displays attached in some manner to a building or a sign face of irregular shape, the sign copy area shall include the area of the smallest circle, square or rectangle that can encompass the total sign area composed of letters, numbers, characters, figures, or displays or the irregular shaped sign face. Where signs have appendages or additions, such as "pop-ups" or "cutouts" that extend beyond the main sign copy area, the area of such appendages or additions shall be measured separately, but included in the total sign copy area. Also to be included in the total sign copy area shall be any area designed for changeable copy. Where allowed, portable signs shall be counted toward permitted maximum total aggregate sign copy area and maximum number of freestanding signs on each public street.

(E) Protection Under First Amendment Rights
Any sign, display, or device allowed under this Section may contain, in lieu of any other copy, any otherwise lawful noncommercial message which does not direct attention to a business operated for profit, or to a commodity or service for sale; provided that such sign complies with the size, lighting, spacing, setback and other requirements of this Section. This includes signs requiring and not requiring a Development Permit.
(F) Illuminated Signs
Signs, which are illuminated from within or from an external source must be illuminated in a manner that avoids glare or reflection which in any way or manner interferes with traffic safety. Any external source of illumination, such as spotlights or floodlights shall be placed so that the source is not directly visible from any adjacent residential zoning districts and shall be beamed downward.

ARTICLE II-3 CONDITIONAL USE DISTRICTS CREATED
For each general use district established in Article II-2, there is also established a corresponding conditional use district as follows:
CU-R-20 Conditional Use R-20 District
CU-R-10 Conditional Use R-10 District
CU-R-8 Conditional Use R-8 District
CU-R-6 Conditional Use R-6 District
CU-R-0 Conditional Use R-0 District
CU-C-B Conditional Use C-B District
CU-N-B Conditional Use N-B District
CU-G-B Conditional Use G-B District
CU-L-I Conditional Use L-I District
CU-H-I Conditional Use H-I District
It is recognized that certain types of zoning districts would be inappropriate at certain locations in the absence of special conditions. Where the applicant for rezoning desires property to be rezoned to such a district in such situations, the Conditional Use District (CUD) is a means by which such special conditions can be imposed in the furtherance of the purposes of this Ordinance. The Conditional Use District classification will be considered for rezoning only upon request of a property owner. If for any reason any condition imposed pursuant to these regulations is found to be illegal or invalid or if the applicant should fail to accept any condition, it is the intent of this Ordinance that the authorization of such Conditional Use Permit shall be null and void and of no effect, and that proceedings shall be instituted to rezone the property to its previous zoning classification.
Within a CUD, only those uses authorized as permitted uses in the zoning district with which the CUD corresponds shall be permitted, and all other requirements of the corresponding district shall be met as minimum standards. In addition, with a CUD no use shall be permitted except pursuant to a Conditional Use Permit authorized by the Town Council, which shall specify the use or uses authorized. Such permit may further specify the location on the property of the proposed use or uses, the number of dwelling units, the location and extent of supporting facilities such as parking lots, driveways and access streets, the location and extent of buffer areas, and other special purpose areas, the timing of development, the location and extent of right-of-way and other areas to be dedicated for public use, and other such matters as the applicant may propose as conditions upon the request, but not to include conditions not generally a part of land development
Town of Wadesboro Zoning Ordinance
110
controls. In granting a Conditional Use Permit, the Board of Commissioners may impose such additional reasonable and appropriate safeguards upon such permit as it may deem necessary in order that the purpose and intent of this Ordinance are served, public welfare secured, and substantial justice done.
