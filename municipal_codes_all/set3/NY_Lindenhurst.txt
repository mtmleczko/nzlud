GENERAL REFERENCES
Officers and employees — See Ch. 19.
§ 7-1. Purpose.
The purpose of this chapter is to provide legal and financial protection for those individuals serving the
Village of Lindenhurst from losses which may be brought against them in their individual capacities for
actions taken while in the performance of their official duties and responsibilities. In enacting this
chapter, the Village Board finds that the State of New York has enacted similar provisions for the legal
and financial security of its officers and employees and, further, finds that such security is also required
for local personnel. By enactment of this chapter, the Village Board does not intend to limit or otherwise
abrogate any existing right or responsibility of the village or its employees with regard to
indemnification or legal defense. It is solely the intent of this chapter to provide similar coverage for
local employees as is presently provided for state employees, so as to continue to attract qualified
individuals to local government service.
§ 7-2. Definitions.
As used in this chapter, unless the context otherwise requires, the following terms shall have the
meanings indicated:
EMPLOYEE
Any person holding a position by election, appointment or employment in the service of the Village
of Lindenhurst, whether or not compensated, or a volunteer expressly authorized to participate in
a municipally sponsored volunteer program, but shall not include an independent contractor, but
shall specifically include the Village Attorney. The term "employee" shall include a former
employee, his estate or judicially appointed personal representative.[1]
Editor's Note: Amended at time of adoption of Code; see Ch. 1, General Provisions, Art. I.
§ 7-3. Defense of employees.
Upon compliance by the employee with the provisions of § 7-5 of this chapter, the village shall
provide for the defense of the employee in any civil action or proceeding in any state or federal
court arising out of any alleged act or omission which occurred or is alleged in the complaint to
have occurred while the employee was acting within the scope of his public employment or duties
or which is brought to enforce a provision of 42 U.S.C. § 1981 or 1983. This duty to provide for a
defense shall not arise where such civil action or proceeding is brought by or on behalf of the
Village of Lindenhurst.
Subject to the conditions set forth in Subsection A of this section, the employee shall be entitled to
be represented by the Village Attorney; provided, however, that the employee shall be entitled to

representation by private counsel of his choice in any civil judicial proceeding whenever the
Village Attorney determines, based upon his investigation and review of the facts and
circumstances of the case, that representation by the Village Attorney would be inappropriate or
whenever a court of competent jurisdiction, upon appropriate motion or by a special proceeding,
determines that a conflict of interest exists and that the employee is entitled to be represented by
private counsel of his choice. The Village Attorney shall notify the employee, in writing, of such
determination that the employee is entitled to be represented by private counsel of his choice. The
Village Attorney may require, as a condition to payment of the fees and expenses of such
representation, that appropriate groups of such employees be represented by the same counsel. If
the employee or group of employees is entitled to representation by private counsel under the
provisions of this chapter, the Village Attorney shall so certify to the Village Board. Reasonable
attorneys' fees and litigation expenses shall be paid by the village to such private counsel from
time to time during the pendency of the civil action or proceeding, subject to certification that the
employee is entitled to representation under the terms and conditions of this chapter by the head
of the department, commission, division, office or agency in which such employee is employed
and upon the audit and warrant of the Village Treasurer. Any dispute with respect to
representation of multiple employees by a single counsel or the amount of litigation expenses or
the reasonableness of attorneys' fees shall be resolved by the court upon motion or by way of a
special proceeding.
Where the employee delivers process and a request for a defense to the Village Attorney as
required by § 7-5 of this chapter, the Attorney shall take the necessary steps, including the
retention of private counsel, under the terms and conditions provided in Subsection B of this
section, on behalf of the employee to avoid entry of a default judgment pending resolution of any
question pertaining to the obligation to provide for a defense.
§ 7-4. Indemnification.
The village shall indemnify and save harmless its employees in the amount of any judgment
obtained against such employees in any state or federal court or in the amount of any settlement
of a claim, provided that the act or omission from which such judgment or settlement arose
occurred while the employee was acting within the scope of his public employment or duties. The
duty to indemnify and save harmless prescribed by this section shall not arise where the injury or
damage resulted from intentional wrongdoing or recklessness on the part of the employee.
An employee represented by private counsel shall cause to be submitted to the Village Board any
proposed settlement which may be subject to indemnification by the village, and, if not
inconsistent with the provisions of this chapter, the Mayor shall certify such settlement and submit
such settlement and certification to the Village Attorney. The Attorney shall review such proposed
settlement as to form and amount and shall give his approval if, in his judgment, the settlement is
in the best interest of the village. Nothing in this section shall be construed to authorize the village
to indemnify or save harmless an employee with respect to a settlement not so reviewed and
approved by the Village Attorney.
Upon entry of a final judgment against the employee or upon the settlement of the claim, the
employee shall cause to be served a copy of such judgment or settlement, personally or by
certified or registered mail, within 30 days of the date of entry or settlement, upon the Mayor, and,
if not inconsistent with the provisions of this chapter, such judgment or settlement shall be certified
for payment by such Mayor. If the Attorney concurs in such certification, the judgment or
settlement shall be paid upon the audit and warrant of the Village Treasurer.
§ 7-5. Conditions.
The duty to defend or indemnify and save harmless provided by this chapter shall be conditioned upon
delivery to the Village Attorney or his assistant, at his office, by the employee of the original or a copy

of any summons, complaint, process, notice, demand or pleading within 10 days after he is served with
such document and the full cooperation of the employee in the defense of such action or proceeding
and in defense of any action or proceeding against the state based upon the same act or omission and
in the prosecution of any appeal. Such delivery shall be deemed a request by the employee that the
village provide for his defense pursuant to this chapter.
Editor's Note: Amended at time of adoption of Code; see Ch. 1, General Provisions, Art. I.
§ 7-6. Applicability.
The benefits of this chapter shall inure only to employees as defined herein and shall not enlarge or
diminish the rights of any other party, nor shall any provision of this chapter be construed to affect, alter
or repeal any provision of the Workers' Compensation Law.
§ 7-7. Effect on insurer.
The provisions of this chapter shall not be construed to impair, alter, limit or modify the rights and

cultivated flowers and gardens, trees and shrubs.
Bamboo shall be cultivated in such manner that no bamboo shall be permitted to migrate onto an
adjacent owner's property. It shall be unlawful for an owner, tenant or occupier of property
anywhere within the Village of Lindenhurst to cause, suffer, permit or allow bamboo to be planted
or maintained in such manner that it migrates onto any adjoining property. An owner, tenant or
occupier of property, after being given notice of the occurrence of a migration or trespass upon
adjacent property by bamboo planted upon and originating from his property, shall be required to
take appropriate measures to prevent such bamboo from migrating onto adjacent property in the
future by installing a barrier sufficiently deep and impenetrable as to prevent future migration,
planting the root system of such bamboo plant so that it is entirely contained within an aboveground-
level planter, barrier or other vessel of such design, material and location as to entirely
prevent the spread/growth of the bamboo plant's root system beyond the container in which it is
planted, or by providing for its entire and complete removal. In addition to the penalties provided
herein, any owner, tenant or occupier of property who fails to maintain bamboo in such manner as
to prevent a trespass upon adjoining property shall also be subject to the penalties provided for in
this chapter.
[Amended 11-18-2014 by L.L. No. 2-2014]
All bamboo which migrates onto adjacent properties shall be deemed a public nuisance, and
no property owner shall have any vested or nonconforming right to continue maintenance of
bamboo, whether or not it preexisted the adoption of this regulation. Any property owner who
fails to prevent migration of bamboo onto adjoining property shall be guilty of a trespass, and
the fact that the offending bamboo preexisted the adoption of this regulation shall not
constitute a defense. In order to prevent migration onto adjacent properties, all bamboo plants
(whether planted or growing in a container or contained within a barrier) shall be located,
trimmed and maintained so that no part of the plant (including stalks, branches, leaves, and/or
roots) shall extend nearer than 10 feet to any property line.
In determining whether or not a barrier installed to prevent the migration of bamboo is
sufficiently deep and impenetrable to prevent future migration onto an adjacent owner's
property, it must meet the following criteria:
The barrier itself shall be composed of high-density polypropylene or polyethylene, 40 mil or
heavier;
Each portion of sheet of the barrier shall be secured or joined together by the use of stainlesssteel
clamps or stainless-steel closure strips designed for such barriers;
The barrier shall be installed not less than four feet deep unless not possible due to the level
of groundwater intrusion;
Not less than three inches of the barrier shall protrude above ground level around the entire
perimeter of the barrier;
When installed the barrier shall slant outward from the bottom to the top.[1]

Article I. General Provisions
§ 54-1. Legislative intent and application.
Local Law No. 8-2005 and Local Law No. 1-2011 of the Incorporated Village of Lindenhurst and this
chapter determine that the provisions of the New York State General Municipal Law (GML) are
applicable to establishing, extending and operating business improvement districts (BIDS) within the
Incorporated Village of Lindenhurst. Pursuant to Local Law No. 8-2005, Local Law No. 1-2011 and this
chapter, any amendments, or extensions of any proposed BID must be adopted in accordance with the
provisions of § 980-g of GML Article 19-A. The Board of Trustees of the Incorporated Village of
Lindenhurst finds no petition requesting a referendum on the adoption of Local Law No. 1-2016 was
received by the Village Administrator Clerk within the requisite statutory period. The Board of Trustees
of the Incorporated Village of Lindenhurst further determines that a resolution, as required by the GML,
to provide for the preparation of the district plan ("District Plan") of the Business Improvement District
of the Village of Lindenhurst was duly and properly adopted. The District Plan, including all information
required by § 980 of the GML, was duly and properly filed with the Administrator Clerk of the Village of
Lindenhurst. By resolution of the Board of Trustees and pursuant to GML § 980-e(a), a public hearing
was properly scheduled, advertised and held on the establishment of the BID. The Board also
determines that the requirements of GML § 980-e(c) have been adhered to since each owner and all
known tenants of the real property in the District were notified of the public hearing. The public hearing
on the establishment of the BID, having been held, the Board of Trustees finds each of the questions
set forth in GML § 980-f(l) has been answered affirmatively. No objection has been presented by the
requisite number of owners of real property in the proposed BID to the adoption of this chapter herein.
The Board of Trustees reaffirms and ratifies the applicability of GML Article 19A to the BID of the
Village of Lindenhurst and finds the creation of the BID is in the public's best interest and will benefit
the health and welfare of the residents of the Village of Lindenhurst and that all properties benefited
are included in the District Plan.
Article II. Business Improvement District of the Village of
Lindenhurst
§ 54-2. Creation of district.
The Business Improvement District of the Village of Lindenhurst shall be and hereby is created and
established in the Village of Lindenhurst for a period of five years, being March 1, 2016, through
February 28, 2021. Any extension of the Business Improvement District beyond the five years herein
authorized shall occur only by adoption of a subsequent local law as may be approved by the Board of
Trustees.
§ 54-3. Improvements and services.
All services and improvements provided under the District Plan shall be undertaken solely in the name
of "The Business Improvement District of the Village of Lindenhurst." Services pursuant to the BID
shall not be in substitution for those municipal services provided by the Village of Lindenhurst, but shall
act as additional services. All improvements and services shall be provided as permitted in the District
Plan and in compliance with the GML.

both publicly and privately owned; and injury to and loss of human life. In order to minimize the threat
of such damages and to achieve the purposes and objectives hereinafter set forth, this chapter is
adopted.
§ 91-2. Statement of purpose.
It is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health, safety and general welfare and to
minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to:
Regulate uses which are dangerous to health, safety and property due to water or erosion
hazards, or which result in damaging increases in erosion or in flood heights or velocities;
Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which serve such uses, be protected
against flood damage at the time of initial construction;
Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels and natural protective barriers which
are involved in the accommodation of floodwaters;
Control filling, grading, dredging and other development which may increase erosion or flood
damages;
Regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may
increase flood hazards to other lands; and
Qualify and maintain for participation in the National Flood Insurance Program.
§ 91-3. Objectives.
The objectives of this chapter are to:
Protect human life and health;
Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects;
Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken
at the expense of the general public;
Minimize prolonged business interruptions;
Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains, electric, telephone
and sewer lines, streets and bridges located in areas of special flood hazard;
Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of areas of
special flood hazard so as to minimize future flood blight areas;
Provide that developers are notified that property is in an area of special flood hazard; and
Ensure that those who occupy the areas of special flood hazard assume responsibility for their
actions.

a request for a variance.
AREA OF MODERATE WAVE ACTION
The portion of the SFHA landward of a V Zone, or landward of an open coast without mapped V
Zones, in which the principal sources of flooding are astronomical tides, storm surges, seiches or
tsunamis, not riverine sources. Areas of moderate wave action may be subject to wave effects,
velocity flows, erosion, scour or combinations of these forces and are treated as V Zones. The
area of moderate wave action is an area within a Zone AE that is bounded by a line labeled "limit
of moderate wave action."
AREA OF SHALLOW FLOODING
A designated AO, AH or VO Zone on a community's Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) with a
one-percent-or-greater annual chance of flooding to an average annual depth of one to three feet
where a clearly defined channel does not exist, where the path of flooding is unpredictable and
where velocity flow may be evident. Such flooding is characterized by ponding or sheet flow.
AREA OF SPECIAL FLOOD HAZARD
The land in the floodplain within a community subject to a one-percent-or-greater chance of
flooding in any given year. This area may be designated as Zone A, AE, AH, AO, A1-A30, A99, V,
VO, VE or V1-V30. It is also commonly referred to as the "base floodplain" or one-hundred-year
floodplain. For purposes of this chapter, the term "special flood hazard area (SFHA)" is
synonymous in meaning with the phrase "area of special flood hazard."
BASE FLOOD
The flood having a one percent chance of being equaled or exceeded in any given year.
BASEMENT
That portion of a building having its floor subgrade (below ground level) on all sides.
BREAKAWAY WALL
A wall that is not part of the structural support of the building and is intended, through its design
and construction, to collapse under specific lateral loading forces without causing damage to the
elevated portion of the building or the supporting foundation system.
BUILDING
See "structure."
CELLAR
Has the same meaning as "basement."
COASTAL HIGH-HAZARD AREA
An area of special flood hazard extending from offshore to the inland limit of a primary frontal dune
along an open coast and any other area subject to high velocity wave action from storms or
seismic sources. The area is designated on a FIRM as Zone V1-V30, VE, VO or V. The "coastal
high-hazard area" shall also include areas in a FIRM within a Zone AE that is bounded by a line
labeled "limit of moderate wave action."
CRAWL SPACE
An enclosed area beneath the lowest elevated floor, 18 inches or more in height, which is used to
service the underside of the lowest elevated floor. The elevation of the floor of this enclosed area,
which may be of soil, gravel, concrete or other material, must be equal to or above the lowest

adjacent exterior grade. The enclosed crawl space area shall be properly vented to allow for the
equalization of hydrostatic forces which would be experienced during periods of flooding.
DEVELOPMENT
Any man-made change to improved or unimproved real estate, including but not limited to
buildings or other structures, mining, dredging, filling, paving, excavation or drilling operations or
storage of equipment or materials.
ELEVATED BUILDING
A nonbasement building built, in the case of a building in Zone A1-A30, AE, A, A99, AO, AH, B, C,
X or D, to have the top of the elevated floor or, in the case of a building in Zone V1-30, VE or V or
area of moderate wave action, to have the bottom of the lowest horizontal structure member of the
elevated floor elevated above the ground level by means of pilings, columns (posts and piers) or
shear walls parallel to the flow of the water and adequately anchored so as not to impair the
structural integrity of the building during a flood of up to the magnitude of the base flood. In the
case of Zone A1-A30, AE, A, A99, AO, AH, B, C, X or D, "elevated building" also includes a
building elevated by means of fill or solid foundation perimeter walls with openings sufficient to
facilitate the unimpeded movement of floodwaters. In the case of Zone V1-V30, VE or V, "elevated
building" also includes a building otherwise meeting the definition of "elevated building," even
though the lower area is enclosed by means of breakaway walls that meet the federal standards.

When the Federal Emergency Management Agency has designated areas of special flood
hazard on the community's Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) but has neither produced water
surface elevation data (these areas are designated Zone A or V on the FIRM) nor identified a
floodway, the local administrator shall obtain, review and reasonably utilize any base flood
elevation and floodway data available from a federal, state or other source, including data
developed pursuant to § 91-13G, as criteria for requiring that new construction, substantial
improvements or other proposed development meet the requirements of this chapter.
When base flood elevation data are not available, the local administrator may use flood
information from any other authoritative source, such as historical data, to establish flood
elevations within the areas of special flood hazard for the purposes of this chapter.
Alteration of watercourses. The local administrator shall:
Notify adjacent communities and the New York State Department of Environmental
Conservation prior to permitting any alteration or relocation of a watercourse and submit
evidence of such notification to the Regional Director, Region II, Federal Emergency
Management Agency.
Determine that the permit holder has provided for maintenance within the altered or relocated
portion of said watercourse so that the flood-carrying capacity is not diminished.
Construction stage.
The local administrator shall, in Zones A1-A30, AE and AH, and also Zone A if base flood
elevation data are available, upon placement of the lowest floor or completion of floodproofing
of a new or substantially improved structure, obtain from the permit holder a certification of
the as-built elevation of the lowest floor or floodproofed elevation in relation to mean sea
level. The certificate shall be prepared by or under the direct supervision of a licensed land
surveyor or professional engineer and certified by same. For manufactured homes, the permit
holder shall submit the certificate of elevation upon placement of the structure on the site. A
certificate of elevation must also be submitted for a recreational vehicle if it remains on a site
for 180 consecutive days or longer (unless it is fully licensed and ready for highway use).
In Zones V1-V30 and VE, and also Zone V if base flood elevation data are available, or in an
area of moderate wave action, upon placement of the lowest floor of a new or substantially
improved structure, the permit holder shall submit to the local administrator a certificate of
elevation, in relation to mean sea level, of the bottom of the lowest structural member of the
lowest floor (excluding pilings and columns). The certificate shall be prepared by or under the
direct supervision of a licensed land surveyor or professional engineer and certified by same.
For manufactured homes, the permit holder shall submit the certificate of elevation upon
placement of the structure on the site. An elevation certificate must also be submitted for a
recreational vehicle if it remains on a site 180 consecutive days or longer (unless it is fully
licensed and ready for highway use).

Determination of loading forces. Structural design shall consider the effects of wind and water
loads acting simultaneously during the base flood on all building components.
The structural design shall be adequate to resist water forces that would occur during the
base flood. Horizontal water loads considered shall include inertial and drag forces of waves,
current drag forces and impact forces from waterborne storm debris. Dynamic uplift loads
shall also be considered if bulkheads, walls or other natural or man-made flow obstructions
could cause wave runup beyond the elevation of the base flood.
Buildings shall be designed and constructed to resist the forces due to wind pressure. Wind
forces on the superstructure include windward and leeward forces on vertical walls, uplift on
the roof, internal forces when openings allow wind to enter the house and upward force on the
underside of the house when it is exposed. In the design, the wind should be assumed to
blow potentially from any lateral direction relative to the house.

Wind loading values used shall be those required by the building code.
Foundation standards.
The pilings or column foundation and structure attached thereto shall be adequately anchored
to resist flotation, collapse or lateral movement due to the effects of wind and water pressures
acting simultaneously on all building components. Foundations must be designed to transfer
safely to the underlying soil all loads due to wind, water, dead load, live load and other loads
(including uplift due to wind and water).
Spread footings and fill material shall not be used for structural support of a new building or
substantial improvement of an existing structure.
Pile foundation design.
The design ratio of pile spacing to pile diameter shall not be less than 8:1 for individual piles.
(This shall not apply to pile clusters located below the design grade.) The maximum center-tocenter
spacing of wood piles shall not be more than 12 feet on center under load-bearing sills,
beams or girders.
Pilings shall have adequate soil penetration (bearing capacity) to resist the combined wave
and wind loads (lateral and uplift) associated with the base flood acting simultaneously with
typical structure (live and dead) loads and shall include consideration of decreased resistance
capacity caused by erosion of soil strata surrounding the piles. The minimum penetration for
foundation piles is to an elevation of five feet below mean sea level (msl) datum if the BFE is
+10 msl or less, or to be at least 10 feet below msl if the BFE is greater than +10 msl.
Pile foundation analysis shall also include consideration of piles in column action from the
bottom of the structure to the stable soil elevation of the site. Pilings may be horizontally or
diagonally braced to withstand wind and water forces.
The minimum acceptable sizes for timber piles are a tip diameter of eight inches for round
timber piles and eight by eight inches for square timber piles. All wood piles must be treated
in accordance with requirements of EPEE-C3 to minimize decay and damage from fungus.
Reinforced concrete piles shall be cast of concrete having a twenty-eight-day ultimate
compressive strength of not less than 5,000 pounds per square inch and shall be reinforced
with a minimum of four longitudinal steel bars having a combined area of not less than 1% nor
more than 4% of the gross concrete area. Reinforcing for precast piles shall have a concrete
cover of not less than 1 1/4 inches for No. 5 bars and smaller and not less than 1 1/2 inches
for No. 6 through No. 11 bars. Reinforcement for piles cast in the field shall have a concrete
cover of not less than two inches.
Piles shall be driven by means of a pile driver or drop hammer, jetted or augered into place.
Additional support for piles in the form of bracing may include lateral or diagonal bracing
between piles.
When necessary, piles shall be braced at the ground line in both directions by a wood timber
grade beam or a reinforced concrete grade beam. These at-grade supports should be
securely attached to the piles to provide support even if scoured from beneath.
Diagonal bracing between piles, consisting of two-inch-by-eight-inch (minimum) members
bolted to the piles, shall be limited in location to below the lowest supporting structural
member and above the stable soil elevation and aligned in the vertical plane along pile rows
perpendicular to the shoreline. Galvanized steel rods (minimum diameter: 1/2 inch) or cabletype
bracing is permitted in any plane.

Knee braces, which stiffen both the upper portion of a pile and the beam-to-pile connection,
may be used along pile rows perpendicular and parallel to the shoreline. Knee braces shall be
two-by-eight lumber bolted to the sides of the pile/beam, or four-by-four or larger braces
framed into the pile/beam. Bolting shall consist of two five-eighths-inch galvanized steel bolts
(each end) for two-by-eight members or one five-eighths-inch lag bolt (each end) for square
members. Knee braces shall not extend more than three feet below the elevation of the base
flood.
Column foundation design. Masonry piers or poured-in-place concrete piers shall be internally
reinforced to resist vertical and lateral loads and be connected with a movement-resisting
connection to a pile cap or pile shaft.
Connectors and fasteners. Galvanized metal connectors, wood connectors or bolts of size and
number adequate for the calculated loads must be used to connect adjoining components of a
structure. Toe nailing as a principal method of connection is not permitted. All metal connectors
and fasteners used in exposed locations shall be steel, hot-dipped galvanized after fabrication.
Connectors in protected interior locations shall be fabricated from galvanized sheet.
Beam-to-pile connections. The primary floor beams or girders shall span the supports in the
direction parallel to the flow of potential floodwater and wave action and shall be fastened to the
columns or pilings by bolting, with or without cover plates. Concrete members shall be connected
by reinforcement, if cast in place, or (if precast) shall be securely connected by bolting and
welding. If sills, beams or girders are attached to wood piling at a notch, a minimum of two fiveeighths-
inch galvanized steel bolts or two hot-dipped galvanized straps 3/16 inch by four inches by
18 inches, each bolted with two one-half-inch lag bolts per beam member, shall be used. Notching
of pile tops shall be the minimum sufficient to provide ledge support for beam members without
unduly weakening pile connections. Piling shall not be notched so that the cross section is
reduced below 50%.
Floor and deck connections.
Wood two-inch-by-four-inch (minimum) connectors or metal joist anchors shall be used to tie
floor joists to floor beams/girders. These should be installed on alternate floor joists, at a
minimum. Cross bridging of all floor joists shall be provided. Such cross bridging may be oneinch-
by-three-inch members, placed eight feet on-center maximum, or solid bridging of the
same depth as joists at the same spacing.
Plywood should be used for subflooring and attic flooring to provide good torsional resistance
in the horizontal plane of the structure. The plywood should not be less than a total thickness
of 3/4 inch and should be exterior grade and fastened to beams or joists with 8d annular or
spiral thread galvanized nails. Such fastening shall be supplemented by the application of
waterproof industrial adhesive applied to all bearing surfaces.
Exterior wall connections. All bottom plates shall have any required breaks under a wall stud or an
anchor bolt. Approved anchors will be used to secure rafters or joists and top and bottom plates to
studs in exterior and bearing walls to form a continuous tie. Continuous plywood sheathing of
15/32 inch or thicker, overlapping the top wall plate and continuing down to the sill, beam or girder,
may be used to provide the continuous tie. If the sheets of plywood are not vertically continuous,
then two-by-four nailer blocking shall be provided at all horizontal joints. In lieu of the plywood,
galvanized steel rods of 1/2 inch in diameter or galvanized steel straps not less than one inch wide
by 1/16 inch thick may be used to connect from the top wall plate to the sill, beam or girder.
Washers with a minimum diameter of three inches shall be used at each end of the one-half-inch
round rods. These anchors shall be installed no more than two feet from each corner rod, no more
than four feet on center.
Ceiling joist/rafter connections.

All ceiling joists or rafters shall be installed in such a manner that the joists provide a
continuous tie across the rafters. Ceiling joists and rafters shall be securely fastened at their
intersections. A metal or wood connector shall be used at alternate ceiling joist/rafter
connections to the wall top plate.
Gable roofs shall be additionally stabilized by installing two-by-four blocking on two-foot
centers between the rafters at each gable end. Blocking shall be installed a minimum of eight
feet toward the house interior from each gable end.
Projecting members. All cantilevers and other projecting members must be adequately supported
and braced to withstand wind and water uplift forces. Roof eave overhangs shall be limited to a
maximum of two feet and joist overhangs to a maximum of one foot. Larger overhangs and
porches will be permitted if designed or reviewed and certified by a registered professional
engineer or architect.
Roof sheathing.
Plywood, or other wood material, when used as roof sheathing, shall not be less than 15/32
inch in thickness and shall be of exterior sheathing grade or equivalent. All attaching devices
for sheathing and roof coverings shall be galvanized or be of other suitable corrosion-resistant
material.
All corners, gable ends and roof overhangs exceeding six inches shall be reinforced by the
application of waterproof industrial adhesive applied to all bearing surfaces of any plywood
sheet used in the sheathing of such corner, gable end or roof overhang.
In addition, roofs should be sloped as steeply as practicable to reduce uplift pressures, and
special care should be used in securing ridges, hips, valleys, eaves, vents, chimneys and
other points of discontinuity in the roofing surface.
Protection of openings. All exterior glass panels, windows and doors shall be designed, detailed
and constructed to withstand loads due to the design wind speed of 75 miles per hour.
Connections for these elements must be designed to transfer safely the design loads to the
supporting structure. Panel widths of multiple-panel sliding glass doors shall not exceed three feet.
Breakaway wall design standards.
The breakaway wall shall have a design safe loading resistance of not less than 10 and not
more than 20 pounds per square foot, with the criterion that the safety of the overall structure
at the point of wall failure be confirmed using established procedures. Grade beams shall be
installed in both directions for all piles considered to carry the breakaway wall load. Knee
braces are required for front row piles that support breakaway walls.
Use of breakaway wall strengths in excess of 20 pounds per square foot shall not be
permitted unless a registered professional engineer or architect has developed or reviewed
the structural design and specifications for the building foundation and breakaway wall
components and certifies that: the breakaway walls will fail under water loads less than those
that would occur during the base flood; and the elevated portion of the building and
supporting foundation system will not be subject to collapse, displacement or other structural
damage due to the effects of wind and water loads acting simultaneously on all building
components (structural and nonstructural). Water loading values used shall be those
associated with the base flood. Wind loading values shall be those required by the building
code.

operations during periods of flooding;
The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise and sediment transport of the floodwaters
and the effects of wave action, if applicable, expected at the site; and
The costs of providing governmental services during and after flood conditions, including
search-and-rescue operations, maintenance and repair of public utilities and facilities such as
sewer, gas, electrical and water systems and streets and bridges.
Upon consideration of the factors of Subsection D and the purposes of this chapter, the Board of
Appeals may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further
the purposes of this chapter.
The local administrator shall maintain the records of all appeal actions, including technical
information, and report any variances to the Federal Emergency Management Agency upon
request.
§ 91-23. Conditions for variances.
Generally, variances may be issued for new construction and substantial improvements to be
erected on a lot of 1/2 acre or less in size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing
structures constructed below the base flood elevation, provided that the items in § 19-22D(1)
through (12) have been fully considered. As the lot size increases beyond the 1/2 acre, the
technical justification required for issuing the variance increases.
Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic structures upon determination
that:
The proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structure's continued designation as
an historic structure; and
The variance is the minimum necessary to preserve the historic character and design of the
structure.
Variances may be issued by a community for new construction and substantial improvements and
for other development necessary for the conduct of a functionally dependent use, provided that:
The criteria of Subsections A, D, E and F of this section are met; and
The structure or other development is protected by methods that minimize flood damages
during the base flood and create no additional threat to public safety.
Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any increase in flood levels during
the base flood discharge would result.

Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary,
considering the flood hazard, to afford relief.
Variances shall only be issued upon receiving written justification of:
A showing of good and sufficient cause;
A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship to the
applicant; and
A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights,
additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create nuisances, cause
fraud on or victimization of the public or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances.
Any applicant to whom a variance is granted for a building with the lowest floor below the base
flood elevation shall be given written notice over the signature of a community official that the cost
of flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from lowest floor
elevation.

shall also include proof of worker's compensation and disability insurance in amounts in compliance
with state law. Such application shall also provide the office address of the landscaping business, the
address where the vehicles and equipment are being stored and proof that the property contains the
necessary permits and approvals if the vehicles and equipment are stored within the Village of

Article IV. Public Nuisances
[Adopted 2-6-1996 by L.L. No. 2-1996]
§ 125-12. Legislative Intent.
The Board of Trustees of the Village of Lindenhurst hereby finds that buildings and property within the
Village of Lindenhurst are being used for the sale of controlled substances and the consumption of
controlled substances as well as other illegal activities and that the recent proliferation of such
buildings and property has brought to the village's attention the negative effect on the surrounding
community of real estate being used for improper, undesirable, illegal and anti-social purposes and that
these public nuisances exist in occupied and vacant buildings and on occupied and vacant developed
and undeveloped real estate; that these public nuisances exist as a result of the operation of certain
businesses, establishments and uses of property in flagrant violation of the pertinent provisions of
penal laws, health laws, licensing laws and other regulations; and that these public nuisances present
a substantial risk to the health and safety of the surrounding community while interfering with the
community's interest in the quality of life as well as their interest in the value of their property.
Therefore, the purpose of this Article is to create a uniform and standardized procedure for securing
legal and equitable remedies; to strengthen existing laws so as to effectively deal with the problem of
nuisance houses in the Village of Lindenhurst by preventing buildings, residences, premises and real
estate within the Village of Lindenhurst from being used in such a way as to constitute a "public
nuisance."
§ 125-13. Definitions.
As used in this Article, the following terms shall have the meanings indicated:
NUISANCE HOUSE
Any building, residence, premises, structure or place where an arrest for prohibited conduct as
defined in § 125-13 of this Article has taken place at said location.
PROHIBITED CONDUCT

Law:

§ 160-1. Findings of fact; statutory authority.
It is hereby determined by the Village Board of the Village of Lindenhurst that:
Land development activities and associated increases in site impervious cover often alter the
hydrologic response of local watersheds and increase stormwater runoff rates and volumes,
flooding, stream channel erosion, or sediment transport and deposition.
This stormwater runoff contributes to increased quantities of waterborne pollutants, including
siltation of aquatic habitat for fish and other desirable species. The Great South Bay and its
tidal tributaries within the Village of Lindenhurst have been placed on the New York State
Department of Environmental Conservation (NYSDEC) Priority Water Bodies List. The
NYSDEC identified urban runoff and storm drain systems as the major source/contributors to
their impairment.
Clearing and grading during construction tends to increase soil erosion and add to the loss of
native vegetation necessary for terrestrial and aquatic habitat.

A.
Improper design and construction of stormwater management practices can increase the
velocity of stormwater runoff, thereby increasing stream bank erosion and sedimentation.
Impervious surfaces allow less water to percolate into the soil, thereby decreasing
groundwater recharge and stream baseflow.
Substantial economic losses can result from these adverse impacts on the waters of the
Village of Lindenhurst.
Stormwater runoff, soil erosion and nonpoint source pollution can be controlled and minimized
through the regulation of stormwater runoff from land development activities.
The regulation of stormwater runoff discharges from land development activities in order to
control and minimize increases in stormwater runoff rates and volumes, soil erosion, stream
channel erosion, and nonpoint source pollution associated with stormwater runoff is in the
public interest and will minimize threats to public health and safety.
Regulation of land development activities by means of performance standards governing
stormwater management and site design will produce development compatible with the
natural functions of a particular site or an entire watershed and thereby mitigate the adverse
effects of erosion and sedimentation from development.
Therefore, the Village Board of the Village of Lindenhurst hereby establishes this policy applicable
to all land development activities within the Village of Lindenhurst to provide reasonable guidance
for the regulation of stormwater runoff and erosion and sediment control for the purpose of
protecting local water resources from degradation. It is determined that the regulation of
stormwater runoff and sediment discharges from land development projects and other
construction activities is in the public interest in order to control and minimize increases in
stormwater runoff rates and volumes, soil erosion, stream channel erosion, and nonpoint source
pollution associated with stormwater runoff and will prevent threats to public health and safety and
enhance and improve the environmental and economic conditions within the Village of
Lindenhurst. This chapter is adopted pursuant to the requirements of the New York State
Environmental Conservation Law (ECL) and the federal Clean Water Act (CWA) for small
municipal separate storm sewer systems (MS4s) to develop, implement and enforce a stormwater
management program (SWMP) designed to reduce the discharges of pollutants to the waters of
the United States within the Village of Lindenhurst to the maximum extent practicable (MEP) in
order to protect water quality. This chapter is consistent with the Comprehensive Management
Plan for the South Shore Estuary Reserve to reduce nonpoint source pollution of the estuary and
its tributaries.
§ 160-2. Purpose.
The purpose of this chapter is to establish minimum stormwater management requirements and
controls to protect and safeguard the general health, safety, and welfare of the residents of the Village
of Lindenhurst and to address the findings of fact in § 160-1 hereof. This chapter seeks to meet those
purposes by achieving the following objectives:
Establish minimum stormwater and erosion and sediment control requirements in order to protect
and safeguard the general health, safety, and welfare of the public and businesses located within
the Town of Babylon by implementation of a stormwater management program (SWMP) that
meets or exceeds the following six minimum control measures:
Public education and outreach on stormwater impacts;
Public involvement/participation;
Illicit discharge detection and elimination;

flooding, siltation, increases in stream temperature, and streambank erosion and maintain the
integrity of stream channels;
Minimize increases in pollution caused by stormwater runoff from land development activities
which would otherwise degrade local water quality;
Minimize the total annual volume of stormwater runoff which flows from any specific site during
and following development to the maximum extent practicable; and
Reduce stormwater runoff rates and volumes, soil erosion and nonpoint source pollution,
wherever possible, through stormwater management practices and to ensure that these
management practices are properly maintained and eliminate threats to public safety.

§ 163-7. Required improvements and agreements.
Improvements and performance bond. Prior to an action by the Planning Board approving a
subdivision plat, the applicant shall be required to complete, in accordance with the Planning
Board's decision and to the satisfaction of the appropriate village departments, all streets and
improvements specified in the action approving said plat or, as an alternative, to file with the
Village Board a bond in an amount estimated by the Planning Board to secure to the village the
satisfactory construction and installation of the incompleted portion of the required improvements.
A period of one year, or such other period as the Planning Board may determine appropriate,
within which required improvements must be completed, shall be specified by the Planning Board
and expressed in the bond. Such performance bond shall comply with the requirements of the
Village Law and shall be satisfactory to the Village Board as to form, sufficiency and manner of
execution. The bond shall provide that an amount determined adequate by the Planning Board
shall be retained for a period of one year after the date of completion of the required
improvements to assure their satisfactory condition. All required improvements shall be made by
the applicant at his expense, without reimbursement by the village or any district therein.[1]
Editor's Note: Amended at time of adoption of Code; see Ch. 1, General Provisions, Art. I.
Inspection of improvements. The village shall employ an inspector to act as agent of the Planning
Board for the purposes of assuring the satisfactory completion of improvements required by the
Planning Board and shall determine an amount sufficient to defray costs of inspection. The
applicant shall pay the village costs of inspection before the subdivision plat is signed for filing. If
the Planning Board or its agent finds, upon inspection, that any of the required improvements have
not been constructed in accordance with the approved construction detail sheets, the applicant
and the bonding company will be severally and jointly liable for the costs of completing said
improvements according to specifications.
Public utilities. As to utilities required by the Planning Board, the Board may accept assurance
from each public utility company whose facilities are proposed to be installed. Such assurance
shall be in writing, addressed to the Board, stating that such public utility company will make the
installations necessary for the furnishing of its services within a specified time, in accordance with
the approved construction detail sheets.
Monuments. Permanent monuments shall be set at block corners and at intervals of approximately
500 feet, or such other distance as the Planning Board may determine appropriate, and their
location shall be shown on the subdivision plat. Wooden stakes or iron pipes shall not be
considered permanent monuments for the purposes of these regulations.
Offers of cessions and releases. The plat shall be endorsed with the necessary agreements in
connection with required easements or releases. Offers of cession to the village shall be
presented prior to plat approval. Formal offers of cession to the village of all streets and parks not
marked on the plat, with notation to the effect that such cession will not be offered, shall be filed
with the Planning Board prior to plat approval.
Filing of approved subdivision plat. Upon completion of all requirements set forth in the action
approving the subdivision plat, the plat shall be properly signed by the appropriate officers of the
Planning Board and shall be filed by the applicant in the office of the County Clerk of Suffolk

County. Any subdivision plat not so filed within 90 days of the date of Planning Board signature
shall become null and void.
Resubdivision. For a resubdivision, the same rules and regulations apply as for a subdivision.
Public streets, parks and playground areas. The approval by the Planning Board of a subdivision
plat shall not be deemed to constitute or imply the acceptance by the village of any street, park,
playground or other open space shown on said plat. The Planning Board may require said plat to
be endorsed with appropriate notes to this effect. The Planning Board may also require the filing of
a written agreement between the applicant and the Village Board covering future title, dedication
and provision for the cost of grading, development, equipment and maintenance of any park or
playground area.
§ 163-8. Considerations and standards.
The Planning Board, in considering an application for the subdivision of land, shall be guided by the
following considerations and standards:
General.
Character of the land. The land to be subdivided shall be of such character that it can be used
safely for building purposes without danger to health or peril from fire, flood or other menace.
Conformity to Official Map and Village Plan. Subdivisions shall conform to the streets and
parks shown on the Official Map of the village and shall be properly related to the Village Plan
as it is developed.
Location, width and improvement of streets.
Streets shall be suitably located, of sufficient width and adequately improved to accommodate
the prospective traffic and to afford satisfactory access to police, fire-fighting, snow-removal or
other road-maintenance equipment and shall be coordinated so as to compose a convenient
system. The arrangement of streets shall be such as to cause no undue hardship to adjoining
properties.
Widths of rights-of-way. Streets shall have the following widths, unless otherwise indicated on
the Village Plan:
Right-of-Way Type
(feet) Width
Minor Street 50
Collector Street 60
Business Street 60
Standards for street design.

Minimum length of tangents between

Minimum Sight Distance (feet) 150 250 250
Block size. Within any zoning district, block dimensions shall be at least twice the minimum lot
depth and generally not more than 12 times the minimum lot width. In long blocks, the
Planning Board may require the reservation through the block of a twenty-foot-wide easement
to accommodate utilities or pedestrian traffic.
Intersections. Intersection of major streets by other streets shall be at least 800 feet apart, if
possible. Cross (four-cornered) street intersections shall be avoided insofar as possible,
except at important traffic intersections. A distance of at least 150 feet shall be maintained
between offset intersections. Within 40 feet of an intersection, streets shall be approximately
at right angles, and grades shall not exceed one and one-half percent (1 1/2%). All streetintersection
corners shall be rounded by curves of at least 25 feet in radius at the property
line. Within triangular areas formed by the intersecting street lines, for a distance of 50 feet
from their intersection and the diagonals connecting the end points of these lines, nothing in
the way of fences, walls, hedges or other landscaping shall be permitted to obstruct such
visibility.
Continuation of streets into adjacent property. The arrangement of streets shall provide for the
continuation of principal streets between adjacent properties where such continuation is
necessary for convenient movement of traffic, effective fire prevention, efficient provision of
utilities and particularly where such continuation is in accordance with the Village Plan. If the
adjacent property is undeveloped and the street must be a dead-end street temporarily, the
right-of-way and improvements shall be extended to the property line. A temporary circular
turnaround having an outside roadway diameter of at least 100 feet and a street property line
diameter of at least 120 feet shall be provided on all temporary dead-end streets, with the
notation on the plat that land outside the street right-of-way shall revert to the abutting
property owners whenever the street is continued. The Planning Board may limit temporary
dead-end streets to a length not more than double the permitted length of permanent deadend
streets.
Permanent dead-end streets. Where a street does not extend to the boundary of the
subdivision and its continuation is not needed for access to adjoining property, it shall be
separated from such boundary by a distance of not less than the minimum lot depth
prescribed by the zoning regulations for the zoning district in which the street is located.
Reserve strips of land shall not be left between the end of a proposed street and an adjacent
piece of property. However, the Planning Board may require the reservation of a twenty-footwide
easement to accommodate pedestrian traffic or utilities. A circular turnaround having an
outside roadway diameter of at least 100 feet and a street property line diameter of at least
120 feet shall be provided at the end of a permanent dead-end street. For greater
convenience to traffic and more effective police and fire protection, permanent dead-end
streets shall be limited in length to six times the minimum lot width for the zoning district.
Street names. All streets shall be named, and such names shall be subject to the approval of
the Planning Board. Names shall be sufficiently different in sound and in spelling from other
street names in the village, so as not to cause confusion. A street which is a continuation of
an existing street shall bear the same name.

Improvements. Streets shall be graded and improved with pavement, street signs, sidewalks,
streetlighting standards, curbs, gutters, street trees, water mains, storm drains and fire hydrants,
except where waivers may be requested, and the Planning Board may waive, subject to
appropriate conditions, such improvements as it considers are not requisite in the interest of the
public health, safety and general welfare. If placed in the street right-of-way, underground utilities
required by the Planning Board shall be placed between the paved roadway and street line. The
applicant shall install underground service connections to the property line of each lot before the
street is paved. Such grading and improvements shall conform to the village's minimum road
specifications and shall be approved as to design and specifications by the village's Engineer or
post a performance bond sufficient to ensure the satisfactory completion of such improvements.
Lots.
The lot arrangement shall be such that there will be no foreseeable difficulties, for reasons of
topography or other conditions, in securing building permits to build on all lots in compliance
with the Zoning Ordinance[1] and in providing access to buildings on such lots from an
approved street.
Editor's Note: See Ch. 193, Zoning.
Where a watercourse separates the buildable area of a lot from the street by which it has
access, provision shall be made for the installation of a culvert or other structure, of design
approved by the village's Engineer.
Lot dimensions shall comply with the minimum standards of the Zoning Ordinance.[2] Where
lots are more than double the minimum required area for the zoning district, the Planning
Board may require that such lots be arranged so as to allow further subdivision and the
opening of future streets where they would be necessary to serve such potential lots.
Editor's Note: See Ch. 193, Zoning.
Side lot lines shall be at right angles to the street lines unless a waiver of this rule shall be
granted by the Planning Board on the basis of a better street or lot plan.
Lots shall not, in general, derive access exclusively from a major street. Where driveway
access from a major street may be necessary for several adjoining lots, the Planning Board
may require that such lots be served by a combined access drive in order to limit possible
traffic hazard on such street.
Reservation and easements.
The Planning Board may require adequate, convenient and suitable areas for parks and
playgrounds or other recreational purposes to be reserved on the plat. The area shall be
shown and marked on the plat, "Reserved for Park or Playground Purposes."[3]
Editor's Note: Amended at time of adoption of Code; see Ch. 1, General Provisions, Art. I.
Where the subdivision borders an existing street and the Official Map or Master Plan indicates
plans for the realignment or widening of the street that would require reservation of some land
of the subdivision, the Planning Board may require that such areas be shown and marked on
the plat, "Reserved for Street Realignment (or Widening) Purposes."
Where topography or other conditions are such as to make impractical the inclusion of utilities
or drainage facilities within street rights-of-way, perpetual unobstructed easements at least 20
feet in width for such utilities shall be provided across property outside the street lines and
with satisfactory access to the street. Easements shall be indicated on the plat.
The Planning Board, where it deems it necessary, may require, in order to facilitate pedestrian
access from streets to schools, parks, playgrounds or other nearby streets, perpetual
unobstructed easements at least 20 feet in width. Easements shall be indicated on the plat.

Preservation of existing features.
Existing features which would add value to residential development, such as large trees,
watercourses, beaches and similar irreplaceable assets, should be preserved, insofar as
possible, through harmonious design of the subdivision.
The owner may place restrictions on the development greater than those required by the
Zoning Ordinance.[4] Such restrictions, if any, shall be indicated on the final plat.
Editor's Note: See Ch. 193, Zoning.
The Planning Board may modify the specified requirements in any individual case where, in
the Board's judgment, such modification is in the public interest or will avoid the imposition of
unnecessary individual hardship.
§ 163-9. Specifications for preliminary layouts and subdivision
plats.

§ 171-1. Tax on furnishing of services.
[Amended 6-16-1992 by L.L. No. 2-1992]
Pursuant to the authority granted by § 5-530 of the Village Law of the State of New York, a tax equal to
1% of its gross income from and after the first day of November 1950 is hereby imposed upon every
utility doing business in the Village of Lindenhurst, which is subject to the supervision of the State
Department of Public Service, which has a gross income for the 12 months ending May 31 in excess of
$500, except motor carriers or brokers subject to such supervision under § 240 et seq. of the
Transportation Law, and a tax equal to 1% of its gross operating income from and after the first day of
November, 1950 is hereby imposed upon every other utility doing business in the Village of
Lindenhurst, which has a gross operating income for the 12 months ending May 31 in excess of $500,
which taxes shall have application only within the territorial limits of the Village of Lindenhurst and shall
be in addition to any and all other taxes and fees imposed by any other provision of law. Such taxes
shall not be imposed on any transaction originating or consummated outside of the territorial limits of
the Village of Lindenhurst, notwithstanding that some act may be necessarily performed with respect to
such transaction within such limits.
§ 171-2. Definitions.
As used in this article, the following terms shall have the meanings indicated:
GROSS INCOME
Includes receipts received in or by reason of any sale, conditional or otherwise, (except sales
hereinafter referred to with respect to which it is provided that profits from the sale shall be
included in gross income) made or service rendered for ultimate consumption or use by the
purchaser in the Village of Lindenhurst, including cash, credits and property of any kind or nature

would properly be included in the inventory of the taxpayer if on hand at the close of the period for
which a return is made; also receipts from interest, dividends and royalties derived from sources
within the Village of Lindenhurst, other than such as are received from a corporation, a majority of
whose voting stock is owned by the taxpaying utility, without any deduction therefrom for any
expenses whatsoever incurred in connection with the receipt thereof, and also profits from any
transaction (except sales for resale and rentals) within the Village of Lindenhurst whatsoever;
provided, however, that the words "gross income" shall include, in the case of a utility engaged in
selling telephony or telephone service, only receipts from a local exchange service wholly
consummated within the Village of Lindenhurst and, in the case of a utility engaged in selling
telegraphy or telegraph service, only receipts from transactions wholly consummated within the
Village of Lindenhurst.
GROSS OPERATING INCOME
Includes receipts received in or by reason of any sale, conditional or otherwise, made for ultimate
consumption or use by the purchaser of gas, electricity, steam, water, refrigeration, telephony,
telegraphy or in or by reason of the furnishing for such consumption or use of gas, electric, steam,
water, refrigerator, telephone or telegraph service in the Village of Lindenhurst, including cash,
credits and property of any kind or nature, within any deduction therefrom on account of the cost
of the property sold, the cost of materials used, labor or services or other costs, interest or
discount paid or any other expenses whatsoever.
PERSON
Persons, corporations, companies, associations, joint-stock associations, copartnerships, estates,
assignee of rents, any person acting in a fiduciary capacity or any other entity and persons, their
assignees, lessees, trustees or receivers appointed by any court whatsoever or by any other
means, except the state, municipalities, political and civil subdivisions of the state or municipality,
and public districts.
UTILITY
Includes every person subject to the supervision of the State Department of Public Service, except
persons engaged in the business of operating or leasing sleeping and parlor railroad cars or of
operating railroads other than street surface, rapid transit, subway and elevated railroads and also
includes every person (whether or not such person is subject to such supervision) who sells gas,
electricity, steam, water, refrigeration, telephone or telegraphy delivered through mains, pipes or
wires or furnishes gas, electric, steam, water, refrigerator, telephone or telegraph service by
means of mains, pipes or wires, regardless of whether such activities are the main business of
such person or are only incidental thereto or of whether use is made of the public streets.
§ 171-3. Records of business to be kept.
Every utility subject to a tax under this article shall keep such records of its business and in such form
as the Village Treasurer may require, and such records shall be preserved for a period of three years,
except that the Village Treasurer may consent to their destruction within that period or may require that
they be kept longer.
§ 171-4. Filing of returns.
Every utility subject to tax hereunder shall file annually, on or before the 25th day of March, a return for
the 12 calendar months preceding such return date or any portion thereof for which the tax imposed
hereby is effective; provided, however, that, in lieu of the annual return required by the foregoing
provisions, any utility may file quarterly, on or before September 25, December 25, March 25 and June
25, a return for the three calendar months preceding each such return date, and, in the case of the first
such return, for all preceding calendar months during which the tax imposed hereby was effective.

shall contain such other data, information or matter as he may require to be included therein. The
Village Treasurer, in order to ensure payment of the tax imposed, may require at any time a further or
supplemental return, which shall contain any data that may be specified by him, and he may require
any utility doing business in the Village of Lindenhurst to file an annual return, which shall contain any
data specified by him, regardless of whether the utility is subject to tax under this article. Every return
shall have annexed thereto an affidavit of the head of the utility making the same or of the owner or of
a co-partner thereof or of a principal officer of the corporation, if such business is conducted by a
corporation, to the effect that the statements contained therein are true.
§ 171-5. Tax payable upon filing of return.
At the time of filing a return as required by this article, each utility shall pay to the Village Treasurer the
tax imposed by this article for the period covered by such return. Such tax shall be due and payable at
the time of filing the return or, if a return is not filed when due, on the last day on which the return is
required to be filed.
§ 171-6. Failure to submit acceptable return.
In case any return filed pursuant to this article shall be insufficient or unsatisfactory to the Village
Treasurer and if a corrected or sufficient return is not filed within 20 days after the same is
required by notice from him or if no return is made for any period, the Village Treasurer shall
determine the amount of tax due from such information as he is able to obtain and, if necessary,
may estimate the tax on the basis of external indices or otherwise. He shall give notice of such
determination to the person liable for such tax. Such determination shall finally and irrevocably fix
such tax, unless the person against whom it is assessed shall, within 30 days after the giving of
notice of such determination, apply to the Village Treasurer for a hearing or unless the Village
Treasurer, of his own motion, shall reduce the same. After such hearing, the Village Treasurer
shall give notice of his decision to the person liable for the tax. Such decision may be reviewed by
a proceeding under Article 78 of the Civil Practice Law and Rules of the State of New York, if
application therefor is made within 90 days after the giving of notice of such decision. An order to
review such decision shall not be granted unless the amount of any tax sought to be reviewed,
with interest and penalty thereon, if any, shall be first deposited with the Village Treasurer and an
undertaking filed with him, in such amount and with such sureties as a Justice of the Supreme
Court shall approve, to the effect that, if such proceeding is dismissed or the tax confirmed, the
applicant will pay all costs and charges which may accrue in the prosecution of such proceeding
or, at the option of the applicant, such undertaking may be in a sum sufficient to cover the tax,
interest, penalties, costs and charges aforesaid, in which event the applicant shall not be required
to pay such tax, interest and penalties as a condition precedent to the granting of such order.
Except in the case of a willfully false or fraudulent return with intent to evade the tax, no
assessment of additional tax shall be made after the expiration of more than three years from the
date of the filing of a return; provided, however, that, where no return has been filed as required by
this article, the tax may be assessed at any time.
§ 171-7. Authorized notice.
Any notice authorized or required under the provisions of this article may be given by mailing the same
to the person for whom it is intended, in a postpaid envelope, addressed to such person at the address
given by him in the last return filed by him under this article, or, if no return has been filed, then to such
address as may be obtainable. The mailing of such notice shall be presumptive evidence of the receipt
of the same by the person to whom addressed. Any period of time, which is determined according to
the provisions of this article by the giving of notice, shall commence to run from the date of mailing of
such notice.

https://ecode360.com/print/LI0062?guid=LI0062&children=true 167/384
§ 171-8. Failure to file; penalty.
Any person failing to file a return or corrected return or to pay any tax or any portion thereof, within the
time required by this article, shall be subject to a penalty of 5% of the amount of tax due, plus 1% of
such tax for each month of delay or fraction thereof, excepting the first month, after such return was
required to be filed or such tax became due; but the Village Treasurer, for causes shown, may extend
the time for filing any return and, if satisfied that the delay was excusable, may remit all or any portion
of the penalty fixed by the foregoing provisions of this section.
§ 171-9. Refunds.
If, within one year from the payment of any tax or penalty, the payer thereof shall make application for
a refund thereof and the Village Treasurer or the court shall determine that such tax or penalty or any
portion thereof was erroneously or illegally collected, the Village Treasurer shall refund the amount so
determined. For like cause and within the same period, a refund may be so made on the initiative of
the Village Treasurer. However, no refund shall be made of a tax or penalty paid pursuant to a
determination of the Village Treasurer as hereinbefore provided unless the Village Treasurer, after a
hearing as hereinbefore provided, or of his own motion, shall have reduced the tax or penalty or it shall
have been established in a proceeding under Article 78 of the Civil Practice Law and Rules of the State
of New York that such determination was erroneous or illegal. All refunds shall be made out of moneys
collected under this article. An application for a refund, made as hereinbefore provided, shall be
deemed an application for the revision of any tax or penalty complained of, and the Village Treasurer
may receive additional evidence with respect thereto. After making his determination, the Village
Treasurer shall give notice thereof to the person interested, and he shall be entitled to an order to
review such determination under said Article 78, subject to the provisions hereinbefore contained
relating to the granting of such an order.
§ 171-10. Tax on utility part of operating cost.
The tax imposed by this article shall be charged against and be paid by the utility and shall not be
added as a separate item to bills rendered by the utility to customers or others but shall constitute a
part of the operating cost of such utility.
§ 171-11. Enforcement.
[Amended 6-16-1992 by L.L. No. 2-1992]
Whenever any person shall fail to pay any tax or penalty imposed by this article, the Village Attorney
shall, upon the request of the Village Treasurer, bring an action to enforce payment of the same. The
proceeds of any judgment obtained in any such action shall be paid to the Village Treasurer. Each
such tax and penalty shall be a lien upon the property of the person liable to pay the same, in the same
manner and to the same extent in accordance with the New York State Tax Law.
§ 171-12. Powers of Village Treasurer.
In the administration of this article, the Village Treasurer shall have the power to make such
reasonable rules and regulations, not inconsistent with law, as may be necessary for the exercise of
his powers and the performance of his duties, and to prescribe the form of blanks, reports and other
records relating to the administration and enforcement of the tax, to take testimony and proofs, under
oath, with reference to any matter within the line of his official duty under this article and to subpoena
and require the attendance of witnesses and the production of books, papers and documents.

custody of such returns shall not be required to produce any of them or evidence of anything
contained in them in any action or proceeding in any court, except on behalf of the Village of
Lindenhurst in an action or proceeding under the provisions of this article or on behalf of the State
Tax Commission in an action or proceeding under the provisions of the Tax Law of the State of
New York or on behalf of any party to an action or proceeding under the provisions of this article
when the returns or facts shown thereby are directly involved in such action or proceeding, in
either of which events the court may require the production of any may admit in evidence so much
of said returns or of the facts shown thereby as are pertinent to the action or proceeding, and no
more. Nothing herein shall be construed to prohibit the delivery to a person or his duly authorized
representative of a copy of any return filed by him, nor to prohibit the publication of statistics so
classified as to prevent the identification of particular returns and the items thereof or the
publication of delinquent lists showing the names of persons who have failed to pay their taxes at
the time and in the manner provided for by this article, together with any relevant information
which, in the opinion of the Village Treasurer, may assist in the collection of such delinquent taxes;
or the inspection by the Village Attorney or other legal representatives of the Village of Lindenhurst
of the return of any person who shall bring action to set aside or review the tax based thereon or
against whom an action has been instituted in accordance with the provisions of this article.
Any offense against the foregoing secrecy provisions shall be punishable by a fine not exceeding
$1,000 or by imprisonment not exceeding one year, or both, and, if the offender is an officer,
agent, clerk or employee of the Village of Lindenhurst, he shall be dismissed from office and shall
be incapable of holding any office or employment in the Village of Lindenhurst for a period of five
years thereafter.
Notwithstanding any provision of this article, the Village Treasurer may exchange with the chief
fiscal officer of any city or any other village in the State of New York information contained in
returns filed under this article, provided that such city or other village grants similar privileges to
the Village of Lindenhurst and provided that such information is to be used for tax purposes only,
and the Village Treasurer shall, upon request, furnish the State Tax Commission with any
information contained in such returns.
§ 171-14. Disposition of taxes and penalties.
All taxes and penalties received by the Village Treasurer under this article shall be paid into the
treasury of the Village and shall be credited to and deposited in the general fund of the Village.

violations of the Village of Lindenhurst's MS4 SPDES permit authorization.
§ 189-10. Use of best management practices to prevent, control
and reduce stormwater pollutants.
Where the Village of Lindenhurst has identified illicit discharges as defined in § 189-4 or activities
contaminating stormwater as defined in § 189-9, the municipality may require implementation of best
management practices (BMPs) to control those illicit discharges and activities.

discharge which presents or may present imminent and substantial danger to the environment, to
the health, welfare, or safety of the public at large, or to the MS4. The Village of
Lindenhurst/SMO(s) shall notify the person of such suspension within a reasonable time thereafter
in writing of the reasons for the suspension. If the violator fails to comply with a suspension order
issued in an emergency, the Village of Lindenhurst SMO(s) may take such steps as deemed
necessary to prevent or minimize damage to the Village of Lindenhurst MS4 or to minimize danger
to persons.
Suspension due to the detection of illicit discharge. Any person discharging to the municipality's
MS4 in violation of this article may have their Village of Lindenhurst MS4 access terminated if
such termination would abate or reduce an illicit discharge. The Village of Lindenhurst/SMO(s) will
notify a violator in writing of the proposed termination of its MS4 access and the reasons therefor.
The violator may petition the Village of Lindenhurst/SMO(s) for a reconsideration and hearing.
Access may be granted by the SMO if he/she finds that the illicit discharge has ceased and the
discharger has taken steps to prevent its recurrence. Access may be denied if the Village of
Lindenhurst/SMO(s) determine in writing that the illicit discharge has not ceased or is likely to
recur. A person commits an offense if the person reinstates Village of Lindenhurst MS4 access to
premises terminated pursuant to this section, without the prior approval of the Village of
Lindenhurst/SMO(s).

form acceptable to the Village of Lindenhurst prior to the allowing of discharges to the Village of
Lindenhurst MS4.
§ 189-13. Access to facilities and monitoring of discharges.
Applicability. This section applies to all facilities that the Village of Lindenhurst/SMO(s) must
inspect to enforce any provision of this article, or whenever the authorized enforcement agency
has cause to believe that there exists, or potentially exists, in or upon any premises any condition
which constitutes a violation of this article.
Access to facilities.
The Village of Lindenhurst/SMO(s) shall be permitted to enter and inspect facilities subject to
regulation under this article and/or Chapter 193 of the Code of the Village of Lindenhurst as
often as may be necessary to determine compliance with this article. If a discharger has

monitoring equipment as is reasonably necessary to determine compliance with this article.
The facility's sampling and monitoring equipment shall be maintained at all times in a safe
and proper operating condition by the discharger at its own expense. All devices used to
measure stormwater flow and quality shall be calibrated to ensure their accuracy.
Unreasonable delay in allowing the Village of Lindenhurst access to a facility subject to this
article is a violation of this article. A person who is the operator of a facility subject to this
article commits an offense if the person denies the Village of Lindenhurst/SMO(s) reasonable
access to the facility for the purpose of conducting any activity authorized or required by this
article.
If the Village of Lindenhurst/SMO(s) has been refused access to any part of the premises
from which stormwater is discharged, and the Village of Lindenhurst SMO(s) is able to
demonstrate probable cause to believe that there may be a violation of this article, or that
there is a need to inspect and/or sample as part of a routine inspection and sampling program
designed to verify compliance with this article or any order issued hereunder, then the Village
of Lindenhurst/SMO(s) may seek issuance of a search warrant from any court of competent
jurisdiction.

No use shall be permitted if it is in conflict with the following standards:
Enumeration of standards.
Fire and explosion hazards. All activities involving and all storage of flammable and explosive
materials shall be provided at a point with adequate safety devices against the hazard of fire
and explosion and adequate fire-fighting and fire-suppression equipment and devices
standard in industry. Burning of waste materials in open fires is prohibited at any point. The
relevant provisions of federal, state and local laws and regulations shall also apply.
Vibration. No vibration shall be produced which is transmitted through the ground and is
detectable without the aid of instruments at or beyond the lot lines; nor shall any vibration
produced exceed a peak of two-thousandths (0.002) g at up to fifty-hertz frequency,
measured at or beyond the lot lines using either seismic or electronic vibration-measuring
equipment. Vibrations occurring at higher than fifty-hertz frequency or a periodic vibration
shall not induce acceleration exceeding one-thousandth (0.001) g. Single-impulse periodic
vibrations occurring at an average interval greater than five minutes shall not induce
accelerations exceeding one-hundredth (0.01) g.
Smoke. No emission shall be permitted at any point, from any chimney or otherwise, of visible
gray smoke a shade equal to or darker than No. 2 on the standard Ringlemann Smoke Chart,
as issued by the United States Bureau of Mines or its approved equivalent, except that visible
gray smoke of a shade equal to No. 2 on said chart may be emitted for four minutes in any 30
minutes. These provisions applicable to visible gray smoke shall also apply to visible smoke
of a different color but with an apparently equivalent opacity.

quantities as to be readily detectable when diluted in the ratio of one volume of odorous air
emitted to four volumes of clean air. Any process which may involve the creation or emission
of any odors shall be provided with a secondary safeguard system, so that control will be
maintained if the primary safeguard system should fail. There is hereby established as a
guide in determining such quantities of offensive odors Table III, Odor Thresholds, in Chapter
5, Air Pollution Abatement Manual, copyright 1959 by Manufacturing Chemists' Association,
Inc., Washington, D. C., and said manual and/or table as subsequently amended.
Fly ash, dust, fumes, vapors, gases and other forms of air pollution. No emission shall be
permitted which can cause any damage to health, animals, vegetation or other forms of
property or which can cause any excessive soiling at any point on the property of others and,
in no event, any emission, from any chimney or otherwise, of any solid or liquid particles in
concentrations exceeding three-tenths (0.3) grain per cubic foot of the conveying gas. For
measurement of the amount of particles in gases resulting from combustion, standard
corrections shall be applied to a stack temperature of 500° F. and 50% excess air.

Purposes and considerations.
In the execution of this chapter, it is recognized that there are some uses which, due to their
very nature, have serious objectionable characteristics. The objectionable characteristics of

these uses are further heightened by their concentration in any one area, thereby having
deleterious effects on adjacent areas. Special regulation of these uses is necessary to ensure
that these adverse effects will not contribute to the blighting or downgrading of the
surrounding neighborhoods or land uses.
It is further declared that the location of these uses in regard to areas where our youth may
regularly assemble and the general atmosphere encompassing their operation is of great
concern to the Village of Lindenhurst.
These special regulations are itemized in this section to accomplish the primary purposes of
preventing a concentration of these uses in any one area and restricting their accessibility to
minors.
The adult uses as defined in § 193-1 are to be restricted as to location in the following manner in
addition to any other requirements of this Code.
Any of the above uses shall not be located within a five-hundred-foot radius of any area
zoned for residential use.
Any of the above uses shall not be located within a one-half-mile radius of another such use.
Any of the above uses shall not be located within a five-hundred-foot radius of any school,
church or other place of religious worship, park, playground or playing field.
The restrictions enumerated in Subsection B above may be waived by the Village Zoning Board of
Appeals if the applicant shows and the Board finds that the following conditions have been met in
addition to the general conditions contained in Article XV of this chapter.
That the proposed use will not be contrary to the public interest or injurious to nearby
properties and that the spirit and intent of this chapter will be observed.
That the establishment of an additional use of this type in the area will not be contrary to any
program of neighborhood conservation or improvement, either residential or nonresidential;
and
That 51% or more of the property owners within the restricted area, as defined in Subsection
B(1) of this section, have signed a petition stating that they have no objection to the
establishment of one of the uses defined above.
No more than one of the adult uses as defined above shall be located on any lot.
By amortization, the right to maintain a legal nonconforming adult use shall terminate in
accordance with the following schedule:
Amount of Capital Investment* as of the
Effective Date of This Chapter Date Before Which Use Shall Terminate
0 to 5,000 January 1, 1989
5,001 to 8,000 January 1, 1990
8,001 to 15,000 January 1, 1991
15,001 to 22,000 January 1, 1992
22,001 or more January 1, 1993
NOTES: *The term "capital investment," as used above, is defined to mean the initial outlay by
the owner or operator of the use to establish the business as of the date of the enactment of this
chapter, exclusive of the fair market value of the structure in which the use is located.

§ 193-123. Permit applications.
Permits for construction or alteration. Before the construction or alteration of any structure,
including waterfront structures, or any part of a structure and before the construction or alteration
of the plumbing of any structure or premises is commenced, the owner or lessee shall submit to
the Building Inspector a statement, in triplicate, on appropriate blanks furnished by the Building
Inspector, describing the proposed work, together with such computations, plans and detail
drawings as the Building Inspector may require. Such statement, constituting an application for a
permit, shall be accompanied by a further statement, in writing, sworn to before a notary public or
commissioner of deeds, giving the full name and residence of each of the owners of the structure,
proposed structure or premises and (except as otherwise herein provided in this section) by a
diagram of the lot or plot on which the construction is to be made, showing the exact location of
any proposed new construction and all existing structures that are to remain, including information
as to the occupancy of such structures.
In the case of an interior or a minor exterior alteration to an existing structure, the filing of a lot
diagram shall not be required unless the Building Inspector deems it to be necessary because of
special conditions.
In the case of minor alterations which do not involve a structural change and which, in the opinion
of the Building Inspector, do not require the filing of plans, a statement describing such minor
alterations shall be submitted to the Building Inspector on such form as he may designate.
When plans are required to be filed, and such plans contemplate structural changes or structural
work affecting public health or safety, they shall be accompanied by an affidavit of a licensed
architect or licensed professional engineer stating that he has supervised the preparation of the
plans and that, to the best of his knowledge and belief, the structure, if built in accordance with the
plans, will conform to this code and will not be in conflict with any provision of the laws of the State
of New York, the Zoning Ordinance or any other provision of law applicable thereto, except as
specifically noted otherwise. (NOTE: The submission of plans and specifications shall be
governed by the requirements of the State Education Law.)
If a licensed professional engineer has been employed in the preparation of the structural or
mechanical design, the structural or mechanical plans shall be accompanied by his affidavit
stating that the structural or mechanical design drawings prepared under his supervision, to the
best of his knowledge and belief, conform with the laws governing building construction, except as
specifically noted otherwise. (NOTE: Plans for the construction or alteration of all factories,
mercantile establishments and places of public assembly over which the New York State
Department of Labor has jurisdiction must be filed with and approved by the Department of Labor
before a permit can be issued by the Building Inspector.)
The Building Inspector will review all building permit applications, including the plans and
specifications for the proposed construction, to determine if said construction is consistent with the
Flood Damage Prevention chapter herein.[1]

Inspector, to secure the filling in of such excavation or foundation in the event that it becomes
abandoned. A deposit, in cash, may be made in lieu of such bond.
Approval of applications in part. Nothing in this section shall be construed to event the Building
Inspector from approving and issuing a permit for the construction of part of a building or structure,
provided that plans have been submitted or approved.

Compliance with plans, laws and regulations.
The construction of any structure or of any plumbing shall be in accordance with the approved
statement of specifications and plans for which the permit was issued or any approved
amendment thereof. The Building Inspector may require a certified copy of the approved
plans to be kept at all times on the premises from the commencement of the work to the
completion thereof, except that this requirement may be waived by the Building Inspector
where compliance is not deemed necessary.
Permits issued by the Building Inspector for the construction or equipment of a structure shall
be deemed to incorporate the proviso that the applicant, his agent, employees or contractors
shall use only approved materials, appliances and methods of construction and shall carry out

any other laws, ordinances or regulations applicable thereto, whether specified or not.
Adherence to diagrams. The location of any new structure or of any extension to an existing
structure, shown on the diagram filed as required by § 193-123, Permit applications, or on any
approved amendment thereof, shall be strictly adhered to. It shall be unlawful to reduce or
diminish the area of any lot or plot, a diagram of which has been filed with an application to
construct or alter and has been used as the basis for a permit, unless the structure for which the
permit was issued complies in all respects with the requirements of this code for structures located
on plots of such diminished area; provided, however, that this shall not apply to any case in which
the lot area is reduced by reason of any street opening or widening or any other public
improvement.
Revocation of permits. The Building Inspector may revoke any permit or approval issued under the

§ 193-134.1. Charges for consultant services established.
[Added 11-21-2000 by L.L. No. 3-2000]
Referral. The Board of Trustees, the Planning Board, the Zoning Board of Appeals and/or the
Building Department, in the review of any application, may refer any such application presented to
it for review and consultation to an engineering, planning, legal, technical or environmental
consultant(s) or professional(s) as such Board shall deem reasonably necessary to enable it to
review such application as required by law. Charges made by such consultants shall be in
accordance with charges usually made for such services in the metropolitan New York region or
pursuant to an existing contractual agreement between the Village and such consultant. Charges
incurred by the Village in utilizing Village employees shall be in accordance with the hourly rates
upon which the employee's actual salary is based including fringe benefits and reasonable
overhead. All such charges shall be paid by the applicant on submission of a Village voucher.
Reimbursement. The applicant shall reimburse the Village for the cost of such consultant services
upon submission of a copy of the voucher. In the event that an application is required to be
reviewed by more than one board, then, in such event and to the extent practicable, boards and
departments shall use the same consultant, who shall in such case, to the extent practicable,
prepare one report providing data, information and recommendations requested. In all instances,
duplication of consultants' reports or services shall be sought to be avoided wherever practicable
in order to minimize the cost of such consultants' report or services to the applicant. The above
fees are in addition to any and all other fees required by any other law, rule or regulation or the
Village Code.
Escrow accounts. At the time of submission of any application or thereafter, the reviewing board or
department may require the establishment of any escrow account, from which withdrawals shall
be made to reimburse the Village for the costs of consultant services. The applicant shall then
provide funds to the Village for deposit into such account in an amount to be determined by the
reviewing board based on its evaluation of the nature and complexity of the application. The
applicant shall be provided with copies of any Village voucher for such services as they are
submitted to the Village. When the balance in such escrow account is reduced to 1/3 of its initial
amount, the applicant shall deposit additional funds into such account to bring the balance up to
the amount of the initial deposit. If such account is not replenished within 30 days after the
applicant is notified, in writing, of the requirement of such additional deposit, the reviewing board
may suspend its review of the application. An application shall be deemed incomplete if any
amount shall be outstanding. A building permit or certificate of occupancy or use shall not be
issued unless all consultant services fees charged in connection with the applicant's project have
been reimbursed to the Village. After all pertinent costs, fees and charges under this section have
been paid, the Village shall refund to the applicant any funds remaining on deposit.
Collection of fees. All fees required pursuant to this chapter shall be collected by the Village
Administrator Clerk of the Village of Lindenhurst.
Applicability. This chapter shall be applicable to the applications pending at the time it shall
become effective, unless the reviewing board shall determine that its application would be
impracticable, unfair or unjust in the particular circumstances. Where this chapter shall be
applicable to a pending application, it shall, in such event, require an applicant only to pay for
consultant services rendered after it shall have become effective.
§ 193-135. Powers and duties of Building Inspector.

discretion, and all routine inspections shall be made at reasonable hours during the working day,
and, in the event that the occupant or owner refuses to allow the Building Inspector to exercise
this right of entry for the purpose of carrying out his office, then the Building Inspector shall have
the right to apply to a court of competent jurisdiction for the necessary court order and injunction to
carry out this duty.[1]

further the intent of this article to preserve and enhance the character, historical interest, beauty and
general welfare of the municipality and to ensure that the location and design of buildings, structures,
appurtenances and open spaces in the municipality shall aid in creating a balanced and harmonious
composition of the whole as well as in the relationship of its several parts. Various on-site structures
and uses within the development shall be harmonious and in scale to one another and with the
neighborhood. No open design foundation system will be permitted for any structures within an AE

Physical compatibility. The open space environment of the Village shall be fostered by preserving,
wherever possible, large trees and other natural features of the site. Extensive clearing and
grading shall be avoided. Screening with trees or other plantings may be required for parking and
other disturbed areas which are created. Where necessary or appropriate, a landscaping plan
demonstrating that suitable vegetation will be planted and nurtured may be required by the
designee of the Village Board, in conjunction with the Planning Board. Such plan, when submitted
by the applicant and approved, shall become a part of the approved site plan.

The power to approve, as granted herein, shall also include the power to impose reasonable
stipulations upon the applicant and to modify and approve or disapprove such application in
furtherance of the considerations as set forth in § 193-176. The power to review shall include the

[Amended 2-6-1990 by L.L. No. 6-1990]
§ 193-176. Considerations.
On all applications to the Planning Board, the Board shall consider the following factors in making its
determination: that the approval given or the recommendation made is in harmony with the general
purpose and intent of the Code to lessen congestion in the streets, to secure safety from fire, panic
and other dangers, to provide adequate light and air, to prevent the overcrowding of land, to avoid
undue concentration of population, to facilitate the adequate provision of transportation, water, sewage
treatment, parks and other public requirements, to ensure the orderly development of land consistent
with the usage and architecture of structures in the surrounding area, to conserve the value of
buildings and land and to encourage the most appropriate use of land throughout the Village.
§ 193-177. Exceptions.
[Amended 4-20-1993 by L.L. No. 2-1993; 1-16-1996 by L.L. No. 1-1996; 6-2-2009 by L.L. No. 2-2009]
In cases where a building permit is required as prescribed in § 193-175, yet the entire cost of the
project described in that building permit is determined by the Building Inspector to be less than $2,500,
the Building Inspector and the Village Administrator Clerk may determine whether such application is
required to be submitted for approval or review by the Planning Board. Further, recognizing that in
certain restricted instances the strict application of the requirements of this chapter may cause
hardship and be unduly burdensome, the Planning Board, by majority vote at an open meeting, is
authorized to waive the site plan review requirements as further set forth in § 193-143. Any such
waiver must be accompanied by a determination from the Building Inspector that the entire cost of the
project as described in the building permit is not in excess of $10,000 and a sworn affidavit from the
applicant detailing the hardship imposed. Should the Planning Board approve any such request for a

https://ecode360.com/print/LI0062?guid=LI0062&children=true 335/384
waiver, such approval may be contingent upon the applicant complying with certain conditions which
further the intent of this chapter. A denial of any requested waiver shall not be subject to further review.
In addition, if a building permit application only involves interior alterations, approval from the Planning
Board shall not be required. Only in instances where the interior alteration involves a change of use not
permitted in that zone shall Planning Board and/or site plan review be required.

Article XX. Two-Family Residence
[Added 5-3-1994 by L.L. No. 2-1994[1]]
Editor's Note: This local law also repealed former Article XX, Two-Family Residence, adopted 4-18-
1989 by L.L. No. 3-1989, as amended 6-16-1992 by L.L. No. 2-1992.
§ 193-196. Purpose.
This Article is intended to amend the existing Village ordinances and regulations which do not
adequately address the existence of illegal two-family dwellings within the Incorporated Village of
Lindenhurst. It is the purpose of this Article to encourage the residents of the Village of Lindenhurst
7/14/2020 Village of Lindenhurst, NY Ecode360
https://ecode360.com/print/LI0062?guid=LI0062&children=true 342/384
who require two-family homes to legalize the existence of such homes. Further, this Article intends to
provide for the safety and appearance of two-family homes and surrounding neighborhoods. Its
purpose is to further preserve the single-family residential character of the Village and to protect the
health, safety and welfare of the general public. Moreover, this Article will regulate through a permit
system the maintenance of two-family dwellings, requiring such homes to be owner-occupied, thereby
curbing the existence of absentee landlord situations. It is also the intent of this Article to establish a
permit system for those wishing to maintain a single-family home with a second kitchen since it is
recognized that the unregulated use of second kitchens has resulted in the conversion of such homes
to two-family residences.
§ 193-197. Definitions.
As used in this Article, the following terms shall have the meanings indicated:
APPLICANT
The person who, personally or through another, makes the application for the temporary twofamily

permit, must be a "resident" of the premises at the time of the application and continue to be a
resident of such premises for the duration of the permit, or such permit shall be deemed null and
void. In the case of newly constructed dormers or extensions built without prior approval for use as
a two-family residence, such applicant must reside in said premises for a minimum of five years in
order to become eligible for a two-family use permit. New dwellings with certificates of occupancy
issued after January 1, 2008 shall be ineligible for a two-family permit.

unit, albeit occasionally changing in composition as a natural family might and does.

of the Village Board.
An ad hoc member shall serve a two-year term expiring at the end of the official year. The
Village Board shall have the power to remove any ad hoc member of the Two-Family Review
Board for cause, after a public hearing if one is requested.
Although the ad hoc member of the Two-Family Review Board is authorized to attend all
meetings of the Two-Family Review Board, he shall have no powers to participate in any
actions of the Two-Family Review Board except as provided herein.

Article XXII. Regulation of Wireless Telecommunications
Towers and Facilities
[Added 11-21-2000 by L.L. No. 4-2000]
§ 193-212. Title.
This article shall be known and may be cited as the "Regulation of Wireless Telecommunications
Towers and Facilities."
§ 193-213. Purpose and intent.
The Telecommunications Act of 1996 (hereinafter referred to as the "Act") was enacted by the
United States Congress to provide a more competitive environment for wireless communication
services in the United States by deregulating the telecommunications industry. The Act preserves
the authority of local government to regulate the placement, construction and modification of
personal wireless services antennas, towers and accessory structures in order to protect the
health, safety and welfare of the public.
The purpose of this article is to establish predictable and balanced regulations for the siting and
screening of personal service antennas, towers and accessory structures. The establishment of
such regulations is to accommodate the growth of such systems within the Incorporated Village of
Lindenhurst (hereinafter referred to as the "Village"). Such regulations will further serve to protect
the public against any adverse impacts on aesthetic resources. Additionally, the regulations will
eliminate potential damage to adjacent properties from tower failure through structural standards
and setback requirements. Finally, the regulations set forth in this article will reduce the number of
towers needed to service the community by maximizing the use of existing towers and structures.
This article is intended to regulate the placement, construction and modification of towers and
telecommunications facilities in order to protect the health, safety and welfare of the public, while
at the same time not unreasonably interfere with the development of the competitive wireless
telecommunications marketplace in the Village. Specifically, this article is intended to:
Regulate the location of the towers and telecommunications facilities in the Village.
Protect residential areas and land uses from potential adverse impacts of towers and
telecommunications facilities.

D.
E.
Minimize adverse visual impacts of towers and telecommunications facilities through careful
design, siting, landscaping and innovative camouflaging techniques.
Promote and encourage shared use/collocation of towers and antenna support structures as
a primary option, rather than construction of additional single-use towers.
Promote and encourage utilization of technological designs that will either eliminate or reduce
the need for the erection of new tower structures to support antenna and telecommunications
facilities.
Avoid potential damage to property caused by towers and telecommunications facilities by
ensuring that such structures are soundly and carefully designed, constructed, modified,
maintained and removed when no longer used, or determined to be structurally unsound.
Ensure that towers and telecommunications facilities are compatible with surrounding land
uses.
The Communications Act of 1934, as amended by the Act, grants the Federal Communications
Commission (FCC) exclusive jurisdiction over:
The regulation of the environmental effects of radio frequency (RF) emissions from
telecommunications facilities; and
The regulation of radio signal interference among users of the RF spectrum.
The Village's regulation of towers and telecommunications facilities in the Village will not have the
effect of prohibiting any person from providing wireless telecommunications services in violation of
the Act.

A written statement from an engineer that the construction and placement of the tower will not
interfere with public safety communications and the usual and customary transmission or
reception of radio, television or other communications services enjoyed by adjacent
residential and nonresidential properties.
Written, technical evidence from an engineer that the proposed structure meets the standards
set forth in § 193-220, "Structural requirements," of this article.
Written, technical evidence from a qualified engineer acceptable to the Fire Marshall and the
Building Inspector that the proposed site of the tower or telecommunications facilities does
not pose a risk of explosion, fire or other danger to life or property due to its proximity to
volatile, flammable, explosive or hazardous materials such as LP gas, propane, gasoline,
natural gas or corrosive or other dangerous chemicals.
In order to assist Village staff and the Board of Trustees in evaluating visual impact, the
applicant shall submit color photo simulations showing the proposed site of the tower with a
photorealistic representation of the proposed tower as it would appear viewed from the
closest residential property and from adjacent roadways, including "before" and "after" views.
The Act gives the FCC sole jurisdiction of the field of regulation of RF emissions and does not
allow the Village to condition or deny, on the basis of RF impacts, the approval of any
telecommunications facilities (whether mounted on towers or antenna support structures)
which meet FCC standards. Antennas and towers shall be subject to state and federal
regulations pertaining to nonionizing radiation and other health hazards related to such
facilities. In order to provide information to its citizens, the Village shall make available, upon
request, copies of ongoing FCC information and RF emission standards for
telecommunications facilities transmitting from towers or antenna support structures.
Applicants shall be required to submit information on the proposed power density of their
proposed telecommunications facilities and demonstrate how this meets FCC standards.
Applicants shall submit evidence of compliance with FCC standards on a yearly basis to the
Village. If new, more restrictive standards are adopted, the antennas shall be made to comply
or continued operations may be restricted by the Board of Trustees. The cost of verification of
compliance shall be borne by the owner and operator of the tower.
The use of guyed towers is prohibited. Towers must be self-supporting without the use of wires,
cables, beams or other means. The design should utilize an open framework or monopole
configuration. Permanent platforms or structures, exclusive of antennas that serve to increase offsite
visibility, are prohibited.
The base of the tower shall occupy not more than 500 square feet.
Minimum spacing between tower locations is three-fourths of a mile.
The Board of Trustees may require an applicant to supplement any information that the Board of
Trustees considers inadequate or that the applicant has failed to supply. The Board of Trustees
may deny an application on the basis that the applicant has not satisfactorily supplied the
information required in this subsection.
§ 193-218. Collocation requirements.
All towers erected, or located within the Village, shall comply with the following requirements:
A proposal for a tower shall not be approved unless the Board of Trustees finds that the antenna
planned for the proposed tower cannot be accommodated on an existing or approved tower or
building within a one-mile search radius (one-half-mile search radius for towers under 120 feet in
height, one-quarter-mile search radius for towers under 80 feet in height) of the proposed tower
due to one or more of the following reasons:

The antenna would exceed the structural capacity of the existing or approved tower or
building, as documented by a qualified professional engineer, and the existing or approved
tower cannot be reinforced, modified or replaced to accommodate the planned or equivalent
antenna at a reasonable cost.
The antenna would cause interference materially impacting the usability of other existing or
planned antennas at the tower or building as documented by a qualified professional
engineer, and the interference cannot be prevented at a reasonable cost.
Existing or approved towers and buildings within the search radius cannot accommodate the
antenna at a height necessary to function reasonably, as documented by a qualified
professional engineer.
Other foreseen reasons that make it infeasible to locate the antenna upon an existing or
approved tower or building.
It is otherwise preferable to use an alternate site for reasons related to encouraging
collocation.
Design of proposed towers.
Any proposed tower shall be designed, structurally, electrically and in all respects, to
accommodate both the applicant's antennas and comparable antennas for at least two
additional users if the tower is over 100 feet in height or for at least one additional user if the
tower is over 60 feet in height. Towers must be designed to allow for future rearrangement of
antennas upon the tower and to accept antennas mounted at varying heights.
The applicant shall submit to the Board of Trustees a letter of intent committing the applicant,
and his/her successors in interest, to negotiate in good faith for shared use of the proposed
tower by other personal wireless service providers In the future. The issuance of a special use
permit (assuming the tower is approved according to this section) shall commit the new tower
owner and his/her successors in interest to:
Respond in a timely comprehensive manner to a request for information from a potential
shared-use applicant.
Negotiate in good faith concerning future requests for shared use of the new tower by
other personal wireless service providers.
Allow shared use of the new tower if another personal wireless service provider agrees in
writing to pay charges.
Make no more than a reasonable charge for shared use, based on generally accepted
accounting principles The charge may include, but is not limited to, a pro rata share of
the cost of site selection, planning, project administration, land costs, site design,
construction and maintenance financing, return on equity, and depreciation, and all of the
costs of adapting the tower or equipment to accommodate a shared user without causing
electromagnetic interference.
In order to keep neighboring municipalities informed, and to facilitate the possibility of directing
that an existing tall structure or existing tower in a neighboring municipality be considered for
shared use, the Board of Trustees shall require that:
An applicant who proposes a new tower shall notify, in writing, the legislative body of each
municipality that borders the Village and the County Planning Commission. Notification shall
include the exact location of the proposed tower and a general description of the project,
including, but not limited to, the height of the tower and its capacity for future shared use.

§ 193-219. Lot size and setbacks.
All proposed wireless telecommunications facilities shall be set back from abutting parcels,
recorded rights-of-way and road and street lines a distance sufficient to substantially contain onsite
ice-fall or debris from a tower or tower failure and to preserve the privacy and sanctity of any
adjoining properties.
Wireless telecommunications facilities shall be located with a minimum setback from any property
line a distance equal to the height of the wireless telecommunications facility or the existing
setback requirement of the underlying zoning district, whichever is greater. Further, any accessory
structure shall be located so as to comply with the applicable minimum setback requirements for
the property on which it is situated.
Setback requirements may be modified when placement of a tower in a location which will reduce
the visual impact can be accomplished; for example, adjacent to trees which may visually hide the
tower.
A tower's setback may be reduced in the sole discretion of the Board of Trustees to allow the
integration of a tower into an existing, or proposed, structure such as a church steeple, light pole,
power line or similar structure. Towers located on municipal property shall be exempt from lot size
and setback requirements.
§ 193-220. Structural requirements.
All towers must be designed and certified by an engineer to be structurally sound and, at minimum, in
conformance with the Village Code and any other standards outlined in this article. All towers in
operation shall be affixed to land.
§ 193-221. Separation or buffer requirements.
For the purpose of this article, the separation distances between towers shall be measured by
drawing or following a straight line between the base of the existing or approved structure and the
proposed base, pursuant to a site plan, of the proposed tower. Tower separation distances from
residentially zoned lands shall be measured from the base of a tower to the closest point of
residentially zoned property. The minimum tower separation distances from residentially zoned
land and from other towers shall be calculated and applied irrespective of Village jurisdictional
boundaries.
Towers shall be separated from all residentially zoned lands by a minimum of 150 feet, except
where circumstances dictate less separation to be in the best interest of the public's health, safety
and welfare. Towers shall be separated from schools by a minimum of 1,000 feet, except where
circumstances dictate less separation to be in the best interest of the public's health, safety and
welfare.
Proposed towers must be the minimum separation requirements of 3/4 of a mile from existing
towers or towers which have a special use permit but are not yet constructed at the time a special
use permit is granted pursuant to this article.
§ 193-222. Method of determining tower height.

Measurement of tower height for the purpose of determining compliance with all requirements of this
article shall include the tower structure itself, the base pad and any other telecommunications facilities
attached thereto which extend more than 20 feet over the top of the tower structure itself. Tower height
shall be measured from grade.
§ 193-223. Illumination.
Towers shall not be artificially lighted, except as required by the Federal Aviation Administration or
other federal or state authority for a particular tower. Upon commencement of construction of a tower,
in cases where there are residential uses located within a distance which is 300% of the height of the
tower from the tower and when required by federal law, dual-mode lighting shall be requested from the
Federal Aviation Administration.
§ 193-224. Design of antennas, towers and accessory structures.
Antennas, towers and accessory structures shall be designed to blend into the surrounding
environment through the use of color and camouflaging architectural treatment, except in instances
where the color is indicated by federal or state authorities such as the Federal Aviation Administration.
Every antenna, tower and accessory structure shall be of neutral colors that are harmonious with, and
that blend with, the natural features, buildings and structures surrounding such antenna and structure;
provided, however, that directional or panel antennas and omnidirectional or whip antennas located on
the exterior of a building that will also serve as an antenna tower shall be of colors that match, and
cause the antenna to blend with, the exterior of the building. Accessory structures will be designed to
be architecturally compatible with principal structures on the site.
§ 193-225. Landscaping and security of structures.
All landscaping on a parcel of land containing towers, antenna support structures or
telecommunications facilities shall be in accordance with the applicable landscaping requirements in
the zoning district where the tower, antenna support structure or telecommunications facilities are
located. The Village may require landscaping in excess of the requirements in the Village Code in
order to enhance compatibility with adjacent land uses. Landscaping shall be installed on the outside
of any fencing. Existing on-site vegetation shall be preserved to the maximum extent practicable. The
base of the tower and any accessory structures shall be landscaped. Towers and accessory structures
shall be provided with security fencing to prevent unauthorized entry.
§ 193-226. Access.
The Board may require the following depending on the location of the tower:
A parcel of land upon which a tower is located must provide access to at least one paved
vehicular parking space on-site.
A road will be provided to assure adequate emergency and service access. Maximum use of
existing roads, public or private, shall be made.

The application for telecommunications facilities on antenna support structures shall include all
information necessary to a tower permit to the extent determined by the Building Department.
Any telecommunications facilities which are not attached to a tower may be permitted on any
antenna support structure at least 50 feet tall, regardless of zoning restrictions applicable to the
zoning district where the structure is located. Telecommunications facilities are prohibited on all
other structures. The owner of such structure shall, by written certification to the Board of
Trustees, establish the following at the time plans are submitted for a special use permit:
That the height from grade of the telecommunications facilities shall not exceed the height
from grade of the antenna support structure by more than 20 feet.
That any telecommunications facilities and their appurtenances, located above the primary
roof of an antenna support structure, are set back one foot from the edge of the primary roof
for each one foot in height above the primary roof of the telecommunications facilities. This
setback requirement shall not apply to telecommunications facilities and their appurtenances,
located above the primary roof of an antenna support structure, if such facilities are
appropriately screened from view through the use of panels, walls, fences or other screening
techniques approved by the Village. Setback requirements shall not apply to stealth antennas
which are mounted to the exterior of antenna support structures below the primary roof, but
which do not protrude more than 18 inches from the side of such an antenna support
structure.
§ 193-229. Modification of towers.
A tower existing prior to the effective date of this article, which was in compliance with the Village's
Code immediately prior to the effective date of this article, may continue in existence as a
nonconforming structure. Such nonconforming structure may be modified or demolished and
rebuilt without complying with any of the additional requirements of this article, except for § 193-
221, "Separation or buffer requirements," § 193-230, "Certification and inspections," § 193-231,
"Maintenance," provided that:
The tower is being modified or demolished and rebuilt for the sole purpose of
accommodating, within six months of the completion of the modification or rebuild, additional
telecommunications facilities comparable in weight, size and surface area to the discrete
operating telecommunications facilities of any person currently installed on the tower.
An application for a special use permit is made to the Board of Trustees, which shall have the
authority to issue a special use permit without further approval. The grant of a special use
permit pursuant to this section allowing the modification or demolition and rebuild of an
existing nonconforming tower shall not be considered a determination that the modified or
demolished and rebuilt tower is conforming.
The height of the modified or rebuilt tower and telecommunications facilities attached thereto
do not exceed the maximum height allowed under this article.
Except as provided in this article, a nonconforming structure or use may not be enlarged,
increased in size or discontinued in use for a period of more than 180 days. This article shall not
be interpreted to legalize any structure or use existing at the time this article is adopted, which
structure or use is in violation of the Village Code prior to enactment of this article.

standards set forth by the Village's Code and federal and state law. For new monopole towers and
telecommunications facilities, such certification shall be submitted with an application pursuant to
§ 193-215 of this article and every five years thereafter. For existing monopole towers, certification
shall be submitted within 60 days of the effective date of this article and then every five years
thereafter. The tower owner may be required by the Village to submit more frequent certifications
should there be reason to believe that the structural and electrical integrity of the tower is
jeopardized.
The Village or its agents shall have authority to enter onto the property upon which a tower or
telecommunications facility is located, between the inspections and certifications required above,
to inspect the tower for the purpose of determining whether it complies with the Village Code and
all other construction standards provided by the Village Code and federal and state law.
The Village reserves the right to conduct such inspections at any time, upon reasonable notice to
the owner. All expenses related to such inspections by the Village shall be borne by the tower
owner.
§ 193-231. Maintenance.

public.
Telecommunications facility owners shall install and maintain towers, telecommunications facilities,
wires, cables, fixtures and other equipment in substantial compliance with the requirements of the
National Electric Safety Code and all FCC, state and local regulations, and in such manner that

A description of off-site or on-site factors which mitigate any adverse impacts which might
occur as a result of the modification.
A technical study that documents and supports the criteria submitted by the applicant upon
which the request for modification is based. The technical study shall be certified by an
engineer and shall document the existence of the facts related to the proposed modifications
and its relationship to surrounding rights-of-way and properties.
For a modification of the setback requirement, the application shall identify all parcels of land
where the proposed tower could be located, attempts by the applicant to contact and
negotiate an agreement for collocation and the result of such attempts.
The Board of Trustees may require the application to be reviewed by an independent
engineer under contract to the Village to determine whether the antenna study supports the
basis for the modification requested. The costs of the review by the Village's engineer shall be
reimbursed to the Village by the applicant.
The Board of Trustees shall consider the application for modification based on the following
criteria:
That the telecommunications facility as modified will be compatible with and not adversely
impact the character and integrity of surrounding properties.
Off-site or on-site conditions exist which mitigate the adverse impacts, if any, created by the
modification.
In addition, the Board of Trustees may include conditions on the site where the
telecommunications facility is to be located if such conditions are necessary to preserve the
character and integrity of the neighborhoods affected by the proposed tower and mitigate any
adverse impacts which arise in connection with the approval of the modification, and
encourage the legislative intent expressed herein.
§ 193-233. Retention of expert assistance and reimbursement by
applicant.
The Board may hire any consultants and/or experts necessary to assist the Board in reviewing
and evaluating the application and any requests for recertification.
An applicant shall deposit with the Village funds sufficient to reimburse the Village for all
reasonable costs of consultant and expert evaluation and consultation to the Board in connection
with the review of any application. The initial deposit shall be $7,500. These funds shall
accompany the filing of an application, and the Village will maintain a separate escrow account for
all such funds. The Village's consultants/experts shall bill or invoice the Village no less frequently
than monthly for its services in reviewing the application and performing its duties. If at any time
during the review process this escrow account has a balance less than $2,500, the applicant shall
immediately, upon notification by the Village, replenish said escrow account so that it has a
balance of at least $2,500. Such additional escrow funds must be deposited with the Village
before any further action or consideration is taken on the application. In the event that the amount
held in escrow by the Village is more than the amount of the actual billing or invoicing at the
conclusion of the review process, the difference shall be promptly refunded to the applicant.
The total amount of the funds required to review an application may vary with the scope and
complexity of the project, the completeness of the application and other information as may be
needed by the Board or its consultant/expert to complete the necessary review and analysis.
Additional escrow funds, as required by the Village, shall be paid by the applicant.

days, the Board of Trustees shall notify the owner, with a copy to the applicant, that the site will be
subject to a determination by the Board of Trustees that such site has been abandoned. The

repair during the period, the Board of Trustees shall issue a final determination of abandonment;
the owner shall, within 75 days, dismantle and remove the tower or telecommunications facility.
In the event that a tower or telecommunications facility is not removed within the relevant time
period, the tower and associated facilities may be removed by the Village and the costs of removal
assessed against the owner.
Unused portions of towers above a manufactured connection shall be removed within six months
of the time of antenna relocation. The replacement of portions of a tower previously removed
requires the issuance of a new special use permit.

Article XXIII. Rental Dwelling Units
[Added 6-21-2005 by L.L. No. 6-2005]
§ 193-243. Legislative intent.
The Village Board has determined that there exist in the Village of Lindenhurst serious conditions
arising from the rental of dwelling units that are substandard or in violation of the Village Code and
New York State Uniform Fire Prevention and Building Code, are inadequate in size, are overcrowded
and dangerous, create blight, tend to overburden municipal services, pose a danger to life, limb and
property and promote or encourage deterioration of the housing stock of the Village. The Board of
Trustees finds that new Code provisions will serve to halt the proliferation of such conditions and that
the public health, safety, welfare and good order and the governance of the Village will be enhanced by
enactment of the regulations set forth in this article.
§ 193-244. Definitions.
As used in the article, the following terms shall have the meanings indicated:

Article XXIV. DRD (Downtown Redevelopment District)
[Added 6-20-2017 by L.L. No. 3-2017]
§ 193-264. Purpose.
As set forth in the March 2000 report of the Suffolk County Planning Commission entitled "Smart
Communities through Smart Growth/Applying Smart Growth Principles to Suffolk County Towns
and Villages" (hereinafter the "County Smart Growth Report"), principles of "smart growth" include
encouraging mixed land uses and mixed-use buildings, taking advantage of compact building
sizes and creating a range of housing opportunities, providing a variety of transportation choices,
and creating pleasant environments and attractive communities.
With respect to encouraging mixed land uses and mixed-use buildings, the County Smart Growth
Report provides:
"This activity will help create the density of development that is needed to sustain a healthy
community. By mixing compatible uses, a walking community is created. By having stores on the

first floor and residential uses on the second or third, the base population is within walking
distance of these uses. . . By providing many differing services in any given area, local synergy is
created and the need for people to drive to that area for any particular services or stores is
diminished. This will help reduce the use of the automobile. . . The concentration of uses in a
tight knit area lends itself to leaving the car in one place. . . The alternative is to drive everywhere
because of the separation of land uses that have been zoned, compartmentalized and spread
out, each in its own location unrelated to the other."
With respect to taking advantage of compact building sizes and creating a range of housing
opportunities, the County Smart Growth Report provides:
"This action refers to allowing densities that are associated with traditional compact downtowns
to be applied to residential and commercial development that occurs from new growth. A
framework provided through local zoning codes can allow higher densities which use land more
wisely. Higher densities would be allowed in areas located within the existing infrastructure
enabling residents to walk to shopping, personal services, community centers and transportation
facilities. . ."
With respect to providing a variety of transportation choices, the County Smart Growth Report
provides:
"Suffolk County is home to one of the nation's most heavily used commuter railroads. . .
Transportation options might relieve Suffolk County's roads of some automobile congestion. . ."
The County Smart Growth Report further provides:
"Housing in or near Central Business Districts
A significant aspect of Smart Growth recommends housing be located within walking distance or
in the central part of a town for easy access to services, business, community and municipal
facilities. . ."
Applying the foregoing principles, the Village of Lindenhurst Board of Trustees (the "Board of
Trustees") finds:
It is desirable to encourage pleasant and attractive residential development and
redevelopment on suitable sites within walking distance of:
The Long Island Rail Road station in the Village; and
The central business district of the Village;
It is also desirable to allow such residential development/redevelopment to be mixed with
appropriate nonresidential uses; and
To facilitate such residential and mixed-use development and redevelopment, it is appropriate
to establish a "Downtown Redevelopment District (DRD)," allowing for such uses, as a
floating zone, subject to approval by the Board of Trustees in each case and in accordance
with an approved conceptual development plan, as described and defined herein.
§ 193-265. Application procedure.
The procedure for zone change and development approval of any proposed DRD (or the extension or
expansion of an existing DRD) shall involve a two-stage review process, as follows:
Approval of a conceptual development plan and the reclassification of a specific parcel or parcels
of land for development in accordance with that plan by the Board of Trustees; and

Law) and the SEQRA implementing regulations at 6 NYCRR Part 617, a full environmental
assessment form or draft environmental impact statement, as provided by such SEQRA
implementing regulations.
Such other information as may be determined necessary by the Board of Trustees in order to
properly enable it to review and decide upon the application.
§ 193-267. Procedure for zone change approval.
The Board of Trustees may determine, at any time, with or without a public hearing, and with or
without review pursuant to SEQRA and its implementing regulations, that an application for zone
change approval pursuant to this article will not be entertained.
If the Board of Trustees determines to entertain an application for zone change approval pursuant
to this article, the Board of Trustees shall schedule and hold a public hearing on the application
pursuant to the notice and procedural requirements for adoption of local laws, as set forth in the
New York State Municipal Home Rule Law.
§ 193-268. Criteria for zone change approval and development.
In determining whether to grant an application for establishment, extension, or expansion of a DRD,
the Board of Trustees, in addition to exercising its usual discretion in considering a change of zone,
shall also determine that the application complies with all the following requirements:
Location. A DRD may be established, extended, or expanded within an area that is proximate to
(i.e., within walking distance of) the Long Island Rail Road station and the Village's central
business district and is, in the opinion of the Board of Trustees, suitable for higher-density
residential or mixed commercial/residential development. Any area proposed for expansion or
extension of a DRD shall be located within the area set forth above and shall adjoin (i.e., be
located either adjacent to or across the street from) an existing DRD.
Minimum site size. The minimum land area required for the establishment of a DRD shall be three
acres, except that there is no minimum land area required for the addition of lands to an existing
DRD where such addition is being proposed by the developer of the existing DRD, or by an
affiliate under common ownership or control with such developer. In any event, however, any site
proposed for establishment of a DRD shall be of such shape, dimension, topography, and location
as will allow for an appropriate and attractive development; and, in reviewing any proposed
addition to a DRD, the Board of Trustees may consider the compatibility of development proposed
in the additional area to the development in the existing DRD.
Ownership. The site of a proposed DRD, or proposed extension or expansion to an existing DRD,
may include any number of separate parcels and may be owned by one or more persons or
entities but shall be presented as a single parcel of land in any application made pursuant to this
article. Such application shall be jointly filed by all owners and, if approved, shall be binding upon
all of them and shall be developed in accordance with any approvals granted as part of the final
site development approval.
Permitted uses. The conceptual development plan shall provide for attached or detached
residential uses, including any combination of rental or ownership units, as well as accessory
parking facilities. The conceptual development plan may also provide, where appropriate, for
retail, office, and other uses deemed by the Board of Trustees to be appropriate and compatible
with the proposed DRD development.

Height. The maximum height (not including chimneys; spires; cupolas; antennas; stairway/elevator
penthouses or bulkheads; rooftop amenities; tanks; mechanical equipment; trellises; parapet
walls; similar ornamental, architectural, or mechanical features; and safety railings, fences, and
walls) of any building or structure in a DRD shall not exceed 53 feet.
Maximum density. The number of residential units in a DRD shall not exceed 37 units per acre.
Maximum occupancy. The maximum occupancy of any residential unit in a DRD shall be two, for a
studio unit, and the number of bedrooms plus two for all other units.
Minimum floor area. The minimum floor area of any residential unit in a DRD shall be 580 square
feet.
Setbacks. Minimum building setbacks in a DRD shall be provided as follows:
Front yards: 10 feet.
Rear yards: 10 feet.
Side yards: 10 feet (for one); 20 feet (total).
Parking.
Notwithstanding the provisions of Article XIX of this chapter, parking spaces, whether public
or private, shall be provided in the following amounts for each of the uses in a DRD:
Retail and office uses: one space per 250 square feet of floor area devoted to such use.
Multifamily residential uses:
Studio units: 1.15 per dwelling unit.
One-bedroom units: 1.30 per dwelling unit.
Two-bedroom units: 1.75 per dwelling unit.
Three-or-more-bedroom units: 2.00 per dwelling unit.
All other uses: as determined by the Board of Trustees at the time of site development
approval.
Landbanked parking. As part of site development approval pursuant to § 193-270 of this
article, the Board of Trustees may determine, upon a finding that improvement of such spaces
is not necessary given the anticipated parking needs of the DRD in question, that a portion of
the total parking spaces required for a DRD, as computed above, need not be improved but
may be "landbanked" [i.e., left as landscaped area(s) or other open space] until such time as
the Board of Trustees determines, based on increased parking demand or actual site
conditions, that improvement of such landbanked spaces, or some portion thereof, is
necessary. In the event of a determination by the Board of Trustees that some amount of the
total parking spaces required, as computed above, may be landbanked:
The approved site plan shall show both the reduced parking area to be improved and the
total parking area required, as computed above, with any unimproved parking area(s)
conforming to all zoning requirements and the size requirements set forth in § 193-195 of
this chapter, but left as landscaped area(s) or other open space;
The site development applicant shall submit to the Board of Trustees a declaration of
covenants and restrictions, in a form approved by the Village Attorney and signed by all
landowners in the subject DRD, specifying that all such landbanked spaces, or such

portion thereof as the Board of Trustees shall deem adequate, shall be improved upon a
subsequent finding by the Board of Trustees that improvement of such additional spaces
is necessary due to increased parking demand or actual site conditions; and, upon its
approval by the Village Attorney, such declaration of covenants and restrictions shall be
recorded, against the subject property in the office of the Suffolk County Clerk.
All parking spaces and facilities shall comply with the size requirements set forth in § 193-195
of this chapter or such other requirements as shall be established by the Board of Trustees in
the local law establishing the DRD.
Living accommodations. No basement or cellar shall be occupied as living or sleeping quarters, or
as a habitable space of any sort.
Security. Each building shall be equipped with security and fire alarm systems; appropriate
security cameras shall be provided on site; building staff shall be present, on site, during normal
business hours from Monday through Friday; and twenty-four-hour emergency contact information
shall be provided to all site residents and the Village.
§ 193-269. Zoning approval by the Board of Trustees.
The Board of Trustees may approve or approve with modifications the conceptual development
plan, as well as the establishment of a proposed DRD, by local law granting a zone change so as
to locate or place the property shown in such conceptual development plan in a DRD. Approval of
the conceptual development plan or approval with modifications is required for, and shall be
deemed to authorize, the applicant(s) to proceed with the detailed design of the proposed
development in accordance with such conceptual development plan and the subsequent
procedures and requirements of this article. Copies of the said local law shall be forwarded to the
Planning Board and the applicant(s).
The Board of Trustees may require, incident to granting a DRD zone change, that the applicant(s)
submit a declaration, to be recorded in the office of the Suffolk County Clerk, imposing such
covenants and restrictions on the property included in such DRD as the Board of Trustees may
reasonably deem necessary or desirable to protect the neighborhood and assure that such
property will be developed in accordance with, and will not be used in violation of, the purposes
and provisions of this article.
Any local law establishing a DRD may establish dimensional regulations applicable to
development of the property included in such DRD and may also establish other conditions and
requirements applicable to the use and development of such property. Such dimensional
regulations, conditions, and requirements shall supersede any and all dimensional regulations,
conditions, and requirements set forth elsewhere in this Code, including, but not limited to, those
set forth in § 193-268 of this article.
Use and development of property classified in a DRD shall comply with the dimensional
regulations and other conditions and requirements established by the Board of Trustees in the
local law granting such zone change.
Except as provided below, approval of the establishment of a DRD shall expire five years (or
seven years where a phased development plan is approved) after the effective date of such local
law if the applicant has not, within such period, applied for and received site development approval
and, if applicable, final subdivision plat approval for at least the first section of the subdivision plat.
The Board of Trustees, upon request of the applicant, may extend the above five- or seven-year
time period for two additional periods of not more than one year each. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the Board of Trustees may extend any of the said expiration periods upon application of
any owner of the premises affected by the DRD, made prior to expiration of the prior period. In the
event of expiration of DRD approval, the DRD classification shall automatically be removed from

that existed prior to the establishment of the DRD for such property. The Village Clerk shall amend
the official copy of the Zoning Map accordingly.
The Board of Trustees may also, by local law, amend or modify any previously approved DRD
conceptual development plan to change, for example, the locations or sizes of proposed uses, the
number or type of residential units, the location or size of vehicular or pedestrian travel or
accessways, the location or size of parking areas, and proposed development phasing.
§ 193-270. Site development approval by the Board of Trustees.
Before a building permit is issued or a use is commenced or changed on property located in a
DRD, a site development plan showing the layout, arrangement, and design of the proposed use
shall be submitted to the Board of Trustees, and approved or approved with modifications by the
Board of Trustees. Site development plan review shall be conducted in accordance with the
procedures set forth in Article XVI of this chapter, and every reference in such article to the
Planning Board shall, for purposes of the site development plan review and approval to be
conducted under this article, be deemed to refer to the Board of Trustees.
The site development plan shall show and include the following elements:

locations of gas, electric, and other utility connections/services.
No building permit shall be issued and no commencement or change of use shall be permitted
unless and until a site development plan shall have been approved by the Board of Trustees.
Where a proposed DRD development also involves a subdivision or resubdivision of land, no
development may proceed unless and until the Board of Trustees has granted final subdivision
plat approval in accordance with the Village Law and any applicable Village regulations.
The Board of Trustees may impose such requirements for bonding the approved off-site
development, construction, and improvements as it deems necessary and appropriate, and also to
condition the release of such bond or portions thereof on the approval, acceptance, or dedication
of all or any portion of the work that has been bonded.

Concrete Pavement on a Stone Base
§ A201-1. Preparation of subgrade.
The subgrade area shall be cleared of fences, trees, logs, stumps, brush, vegetation, rubbish and
any other perishable or objectional matter. The area shall be stripped of all topsoil, and any other
unsuitable material encountered shall be removed and replaced with material suitable for fill under
pavements.
The subgrade shall be properly prepared by bringing to the designed line and grade the suitable
materials available at hand, if any, or such other suitable materials as loam, course sand, gravel,
stone dust or cinders. These subgrade materials shall be mixed, stabilized, compacted and rolled
with a ten-ton roller, in such a manner as to produce a stable surface upon which the stone base
will be placed. If materials are sandy or of such consistency that they will not produce a hard
surface, additional loam of approved quality free from all vegetable or other foreign matter shall be
added. The subgrade shall be rolled thoroughly with a roller weighing not less than 10 tons until
the entire surface is firm and will not heave or be otherwise distorted by the rolling operation. If

any soft or other unstable areas develop within the surface limits of the pavement, the deleterious
material shall be removed and suitable material replaced and rolled so that a proper subgrade true
to line and grade is produced. Before the stone base is placed, this subgrade must be approved
and accepted by the Engineer or Superintendent of Public Works.
§ A201-2. Stone base.
Upon the subgrade, a base course of broken stone shall be uniformly placed so that after rolling
and compacting a minimum depth of four and one-half (4 1/2) inches is obtained. The broken
stone shall consist of clean hard, tough durable traprock resistant to wear and frost and free from
an injurious amount of deleterious substances. An excess of flat or elongated fragments will be
cause for rejection.
Broken stone shall be free from dust or dust coating and shall conform to the following sizes:
Passing Square Opening Retained Square Opening Percent by Weight
2-inch 1 1/2-inch 45 to 65
1 1/2-inch 1-inch 35 to 55
1-inch 0 to 10
The stone shall be evenly spread to a thickness that will produce the required thickness of the
course after compaction.
After the foundation course has been laid loose, it shall be shaped and rolled with a self-power
roller weighing at least 10 tons. Rolling shall be continued until a firm, even surface of the required
cross section is obtained. Any defects in the grade of the surface shall be corrected while rolling.
Should the subgrade material be churned up and mixed with the foundation course through any
reason whatsoever or the surface of the foundation course become filled with mud or dirt before
the course has been filled, rolled and completed, the affected areas shall be removed and
replaced with clean stone. In confined areas not accessible to rollers, pneumatic tampers shall be
used.
Upon the compacted stone base, hot asphalt, of Penetration Grade 85-100, shall be applied
uniformly over the entire surface at the rate of two gallons per square yard. The asphalt shall be
heated to a temperature of between two hundred seventy-five degrees and three hundred degrees
Fahrenheit (250° and 300° F.) and distributed evenly over the entire surface by the use of an
approved pressure distributor operating under a pressure of 50 pounds per square inch.
In small areas or adjacent to structures, application may be made with hand pots. In spreading
adjacent strips, the material shall not lap over the previous application. Adjacent concrete
pavement, curbs and structures shall be protected from asphalt by paper or sand covering.
Asphalt Cement Grade 100-120 will be required in cool weather, that is below 50° F.; application
shall not be made when in temperature below 35° F.
Immediately after penetrating the stone base, there shall be evenly distributed broken stone filler
at the rate of 40 pounds per square yard, or more, to the entire surface.
Broken stone filler shall be free from dust or dust coating graded as follows:
Passing Square Retained Square Percentage by Weight

The stone shall be broomed to fill all surface voids without forming a distinct layer. While the
asphalt is still warm, the surface shall be rolled with a ten-ton roller. After the first rolling, the
surface shall be broomed and additional filler added where necessary. Rolling and brooming shall
be continued until voids are filled and the foundation is compacted to true and even surface at the
established grade. All loose stone shall be removed before the next course is placed.

Normal asphalt content is 5% to seven and one-half percent (7 1/2%) by weight of total
mix. The upper limit may be raised when using absorptive aggregate.
The course aggregate shall consist of clean, durable, broken stone showing a percent of
wear, when tested by the Deval method, ASTM Designation D-2-33, or subsequent
revisions, of not more than 3.5. It shall show not over 10% loss when subjected to five
cycles of a sodium or magnesium sulphate soundness test, ASTM Designation C-88-41T,
or subsequent revisions. Course aggregate shall be considered to be that portion
retained on the No. 4 sieve.
Fine aggregate. Fine aggregate shall consist of clean, natural-washed sand, rock sand, stone
screenings from approved rock or a combination of any of these materials.
Construction methods.
Preparation. Prior to the arrival of the mixture on the job, the foundation course shall be
cleaned of all loose and foreign materials and shall be in satisfactory condition. Contact
surfaces of curb and gutters and other structures shall be painted with a thin, uniform coating
of asphalt material before the course is placed.
Placement.
The pavement shall then be deposited on the base course by a mechanical spreader and
rolled to a thickness of one and one-half (1 1/2) inches after compaction by a ten-ton twowheel
roller. Rolling shall continue until all irregularities and roller marks disappear and
the surface shows no further compressability. All pavement not accessible to the roller
shall be tamped with heated tampers weighing not less than 25 pounds each, having a
bearing area not exceeding 48 square inches.
The finished surface shall be smooth and even and shall not vary more than one-fourth
(1/4) inch in 10 feet from the cross section or more than three-eights (3/8) inch from true
elevation.
Material shall not be placed on wet base or placed while rain or snow is falling. No
material shall be placed when the temperature is below 32° F.
Article II. Specification for the Construction of Earth Roads
with Oiled Surface
§ A201-4. Preparation of subbase.
The subbase area shall be cleared of fences, trees, logs, stumps, brush, vegetation, rubbish and
any other perishable or objectionable matter. The area shall be stripped of all topsoil, and any
other unsuitable material encountered shall be removed and replaced with material suitable for fill
under pavements.
The subbase shall be properly prepared by bringing to the designed line and grade the suitable
materials available at hand, if any, or such other suitable materials as loam, course sand, gravel,

stone dust or cinders. These subbase materials shall be mixed, stabilized, compacted and rolled
with a ten-ton roller, in such a manner as to produce a stable surface upon which three coats of oil
will be placed. If materials are sandy or of such consistency that they will not produce a hard
surface, additional loam of approved quality free from all vegetable or other foreign matter shall be
added. The subbase shall be rolled thoroughly with a roller weighing not less than 10 tons until the
entire surface is firm and will not heave or be otherwise distorted by the rolling operation. If any
soft or other unstable areas develop within the surface limits of the pavement, the deleterious
material shall be removed and suitable material replaced and rolled so that a proper subbase true
to line and grade is produced. Before commencing to oil, this subbase must be approved and
accepted by the Engineer or Superintendent of Public Works.
§ A201-5. Finished surface.
After the subbase has been approved, one-half (1/2) gallon of MC-2 per square yard shall be
applied with a blotter coat of sand sufficient to absorb any excess oil and rolled with a ten-ton
roller.
Within 60 days, but not less than 15 days after applying the first coat of oil, 1/2 gallon of RC-2 per
square yard shall be applied and covered with 3/8-inch crushed stone at 25 pounds per square
yard, broomed, rolled with a ten-ton roller and all excess stone removed.
Within one year, but not less than 90 days after applying the second coat of oil, 1/2 gallon of RC-2
per square yard shall be applied and covered with 3/8-inch crushed stone at 25 pounds per
square yard, broomed, rolled with a ten-ton roller and all excess stone removed.
