PREFACE 
    This Code constitutes a complete recodification of the general and permanent ordinances of the City of Hickory, North Carolina. 
    Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the 1981 Code, as supplemented through February 20, 1990, and ordinances subsequently adopted by the city council. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this Code, the reader can locate any section of the 1981 Code, as supplemented, and any subsequent ordinance included herein. 
    The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order, and the various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Notes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state law have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this Code. 
Chapter and Section Numbering System 
    The chapter and section numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and local government codes. Each section number consists of two parts separated by a dash. The figure before the dash refers to the chapter number, and the figure after the dash refers to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the second section of chapter 1 is numbered 1-2, and the first section of chapter 4 is 4-1. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter, and at the same time new sections or even whole chapters can be inserted in their proper place by using the decimal system for amendments. For example, if new material consisting of one section that would logically come between sections 3-1 and 3-2 is desired to be added, such new section would be numbered 3-1.5. New chapters may be included in the same manner. If the new material is to be included between chapters 12 and 13, it will be designated as chapter 12.5. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject. The next successive number shall be assigned to the new article or division. 
Page Numbering System 
    The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the volume. The number to the right of the colon represents the number of the page in that portion. In the case of a chapter of the Code, the number to the left of the colon indicates the number of the chapter. In the case of an appendix to the Code, the letter immediately to the left of the colon indicates the letter of the appendix.

Indexes 
    The indexes have been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the indexes themselves which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which the user is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
    A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up-to-date. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited, and the appropriate page or pages affected will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
    Keeping this publication up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. As revised sheets are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
Acknowledgments 
    This publication was under the direct supervision of Milton E. Lefkoff, Supervising Editor, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida. Credit is gratefully given to the other members of the publisher's staff for their sincere interest and able assistance throughout the project. 
    The publisher is most grateful to Ms. Patricia W. Williams, City Clerk, for her cooperation and assistance during the progress of the work on this publication. It is hoped that her efforts and those of the publisher have resulted in a Code of Ordinances which will make the active law of the city readily accessible to all citizens and which will be a valuable tool in the day-to-day administration of the city's affairs.

PART I - CHARTER[1] 
Footnotes: 
--- (1) --- 
Editor's note- The charter herein set out is contained in Session Laws 1961, ch. 323, ratified May 2, 1961. Acts amending the charter are cited following the sections affected. Unless so cited, each section derives unchanged from the original act. A uniform system of capitalization, spelling, numbers and citations to state statutes has been employed, and a frontal analysis has been added for the convenience of the user. Catchlines have been added or altered to more accurately reflect the contents of each section. Provisions in brackets have been added by the editors for clarity. 
The following is a brief history of North Carolina legislative acts applicable to the Towns of Hickory Tavern, Berryville and Highland, which eventually merged into the City of Hickory prior to the adoption of the 1961 charter. No attempt has been made in this discussion to mention every such act, it being the intention merely to provide a summary of how the present City of Hickory came to be. 
Based upon the tradition that a town known as Hickory Tavern existed upon the present site of the City of Hickory as early as 1870, Hickory celebrated its centennial in 1970. Legislative records show that the Town of Hickory Tavern was incorporated by Private Laws 1863, ch. 20. Private Laws 1863, ch. 20, was amended by Private Laws 1869-70, ch. III, which in turn was amended by Private Laws 1870-71, ch. XXIII. The Town of Hickory was incorporated and provided with a charter by Private Laws 1873-74, ch. XIII. Such act was amended at least twice, by Private Laws 1874-75, ch. LXXIII and by Private Laws 1876-77, ch. XLIV, before being replaced with a new charter for the Town of Hickory in 1879 (Private Laws 1879, ch. 52). This new charter was amended by Private Laws 1881, ch. 59 and by Private Laws 1887, ch. 79, before being replaced by yet another charter in 1889 (Private Laws 1889, ch. 238), which also changed the name from "Town" to "City" of Hickory. The 1889 charter was amended (relative to liquor licenses) by Private Laws 1893, ch. 273. 
The City of Hickory, then, has existed under that name since 1889. The present city, however, is composed not only of the City of Hickory as incorporated in 1889 but also of the former Towns of Berryville (later called West Hickory) and Highland. The Town of Berryville was incorporated by Private Laws 1895, ch. 287. The charter of the Town of Berryville was amended by Private Laws 1907, ch. 46, and the name of the town was changed from Berryville to West Hickory by Private Laws 1899, ch. 133. The Town of Highland was incorporated by Private Laws 1905, ch. 248, which was amended by Private Laws 1907, ch. 41. Following a vote on the first Monday in July 1931, pursuant to Private Laws 1931, ch. 41, the Towns of West Hickory and Highland became parts of the City of Hickory. 
Prior to the enactment of the present charter in 1961, there were numerous amendments to the charter contained in Private Laws 1889, ch. 238. The most important of these, and the only one to be mentioned here, was Private Laws 1913, ch. 68, which rewrote many of the provisions of the 1889 charter and instituted the council-manager form of government, Hickory being the first city in North Carolina and one of the first in the United States to adopt such form. 

CHAPTER I. - ORGANIZATION AND POWERS 
SUBCHAPTER A. - INCORPORATION AND CORPORATE POWERS GENERALLY 

Sec. 1.01. - Incorporation of city; enumeration of corporate powers.

Sec. 1.02. - Exercise of powers. 
    All powers, functions, rights, privileges and immunities of the city, its officers, agencies, or employees, shall be carried into execution as provided by this charter.

Alterations in these boundaries shall be indicated by appropriate entries upon or additions to such map or description. Such entries or additions shall be made by or under the direction of the city manager. Photographic, typed or other copies of such map or description, certified by the city clerk, shall be admitted in evidence in all courts and shall have the same force and effect as would the original map or description.

Such recommendations may include suggestions for renumbering or rearranging the provisions of such laws, providing titles and catchlines, and for such changes in arrangement and form that do not change the law as may be thought necessary to implement the purposes of this section. 
(b)  After considering the recommendations of the city attorney, the city council may provide for the incorporation of such laws into this chapter. 
(c)  The purpose of this section is to enable the city to maintain at all times a current and accurate city charter, organized in clear and orderly fashion, and embracing all local laws relating to the property, affairs and government of the city. 
CHAPTER II. - COMPOSITION OF CITY COUNCIL; ELECTIONS[2] 
Footnotes: 
--- (2) --- 
Editor's note- Session Laws 1971, ch. 835, enacted G.S. ch. 163, subch. IX (G.S. 163-279 et seq.), which now governs municipal election procedures. Section 3 of that act states: 
"It is the intent of this act to make uniform the laws governing the registration of voters for and the conduct of elections in cities, towns, incorporated villages, and special districts in this state. To this end, all laws and clauses of laws, whether general, private, special or local are repealed to the extent that they are in conflict with or superseded by this act, except that provisions of town or city charters providing for elections during the calendar year 1972 shall continue in effect until such 1972 elections have been conducted and their results declared." 
With certain exceptions, most of the existing provisions of this charter relating to elections have, therefore, been omitted from this chapter. 
See Chapter 9 of this Code for the option which the city has exercised pursuant to G.S. ch. 163, subch. IX (G.S. 163-279 et seq.).

SUBCHAPTER B. - ORGANIZATION AND PROCEDURE 

Sec. 3.21. - Meetings; rules; records. 
(a)  The council shall hold two regular meetings each month at some stated day and regular hour to be fixed by ordinance from time to time. It may hold such adjourned and called or special meetings as may be necessary or desirable. The mayor or any three members may call a meeting upon written notice of not less than 48 hours to all members, signed by the members calling the meeting, and issued through the city clerk's office. 
(b)  The council shall adopt rules not inconsistent with law concerning the conduct of meetings, including a rule that only those matters included upon the agenda may be considered at any council meeting, and that no matter may be placed upon the agenda for a meeting which has not been presented to the city clerk or the city manager by 5:00 p.m. on the Wednesday preceding the meeting. The rule concerning the agenda shall provide, however, that the council may consider a matter not included on the agenda by a vote of a majority of the council or, if necessary to meet a public emergency affecting life, health or property-such consideration to be had only after adoption of a motion stating that an emergency exists and describing the emergency in clear and specific terms. No council rule concerning the conduct of meetings may be adopted, amended or repealed upon less than 30 days' notice presented at a regular meeting of the council, such notice to be recorded in the minutes of that meeting. 
(c)  All special or adjourned meetings other than executive sessions and all regular meetings shall be open to the public. No directives, ordinances or resolutions may be adopted, amended or repealed in an executive session.

(e)  A record of the proceedings of every meeting shall be kept by the city clerk in a well bound book, and every resolution, bylaw, or ordinance passed by the city council, and every motion made at any meeting, must be recorded in such book. The records of the proceedings of each meeting must be signed by the city clerk. Any citizen may have access, during reasonable hours, to these records upon application to the city manager.

(b)  No member shall be excused from voting except upon matters involving the consideration of his own official conduct. In all other cases a failure to vote by a member who is present or who, having been present, has withdrawn from the meeting without being excused, shall be deemed an affirmative vote and shall be so recorded. A member who has withdrawn from a meeting without being excused by the council shall be counted as present for purposes of determining the existence of a quorum. 
SUBCHAPTER C. - ORDINANCES 

Sec. 3.41. - Applicable general law provisions. 
    Except as otherwise herein provided, the adoption, amendment, repeal, pleading and proving of ordinances shall be governed by applicable provisions of general law. 
Sec. 3.42. - Adoption. 
(a)  Except as provided by subsection (b) of this section, no ordinance shall be enacted unless the same shall have been read twice and passed two readings, which readings shall have been on two different days and at least one of which shall have been at a regular meeting. The affirmative vote of a majority of the members upon each reading shall be necessary to adopt any ordinance. 
(b)  To meet a public emergency affecting life, health or property the council may adopt one or more emergency ordinances; but such ordinances may not be used to levy taxes; grant, renew or extend a franchise; regulate the rate charged by any public utility for its services; or authorize the borrowing of money. Every emergency ordinance shall be plainly designated as such and shall contain, after the ordaining clause, a declaration stating that an emergency exists and describing the claimed emergency in clear and specific terms. An emergency ordinance may be considered and may be adopted upon a single reading with or without amendment, or rejected, at the meeting at which it is introduced. The affirmative vote of two-thirds of the members of the council shall be required for the adoption of such an ordinance. An emergency ordinance shall be effective only until the first regular meeting after its enactment, unless ratified at such meeting. 
Sec. 3.43. - Publication. 
(a)  Notice of any compilation or codification of the city ordinances adopted by the city council, and ordered issued by it in pamphlet or book form, shall from time to time be given by publication of the title of the ordinance adopting the compilation or codification, which title shall adequately describe the general contents of the ordinance. The ordinances included in the compilation or codification shall be effective not less than 20 days after publication of such notice. 
(b)  Any new chapter of the city Code whether by way of addition or substitution may be published in its entirety or a notice thereof may be published by stating the title of the chapter, the date of its adoption, and that it will be effective 20 days after the publication of said notice. Any new chapter published in its entirety shall become effective upon publication. Any new chapter published by title shall become effective not less than 20 days after publication. When a new chapter is published by title, at least one copy of the ordinance shall be kept for public examination and inspection in the office of the city clerk at least from the time of its publication until the effective date. 
(c)  All other ordinances shall be published in their entirety and shall become effective upon publication, unless the ordinance expressly provides for a different effective date. 
(d)  As used in this section the term "publi- cation" means publication once in some newspaper, published in the city, which is qualified to carry legal notices, or, if there be no such newspaper, by posting in three public places in the city. 
Sec. 3.44. - Code of ordinances; pleading and proving. 
(a)  The city council shall, from time to time, adopt and provide for the issuance and distribution of a codification of the city ordinances, to be known as the "Hickory Code of Ordinances." The Code of Ordinances shall consist of two separate parts. The first part shall be known as "General Ordinances." The second part, which may be published in sections, shall be known as "Technical Ordinances," and may include all ordinances regarding the construction of buildings, the installation of plumbing, the installation of electric wiring, the installation of oil appliances, or gas appliances and equipment, use of the city sewerage system, and other technical ordinances designated as such by the city council. [3] 
(b)  Any of the following shall be admitted in evidence in all courts and shall have the same force and effect as would an original ordinance: 
(1)  An official code or compilation of ordinances which: 
(i)  Sets forth the ordinances in question; 
(ii)  Is reproduced by the process of printing, mimeographing, photoduplication, or similar process;

CHAPTER V. - REGULATORY AND PLANNING FUNCTIONS 
SUBCHAPTER A. - CITY PROPERTY 

Sec. 5.01. - Reserved. 
Editor's note- Ord. No. 18-04 , § 1, adopted Feb. 6, 2018, repealed § 5.01, which pertained to control of beggars, etc. and derived from the original Code. 
SUBCHAPTER B. - MOTOR VEHICLES AND TRAFFIC 

Sec. 5.21. - Location of traffic control devices. 
(a)  The city council may authorize an official to designate the location of any or all official traffic control devices, upon a determination by him in each case and upon presentation to the city council of his intention at least two days prior to a regularly scheduled meeting: 
(1)  If such a device is to be installed by him at a particular location, that its installation is necessary in order to control traffic congestion in the interest of public safety; 
(2)  If such a device is to be moved or removed from a particular location, that the device is no longer required at such location for the control of traffic congestion in the interest of public safety. An "official traffic control device," as used in this section, is a sign, signal, marking, or device, including a parking meter, which is intended to regulate vehicular or pedestrian traffic. 
(b)  Whenever an official traffic control device is installed, moved or removed pursuant to the preceding subsection, such action shall be reported in writing at the next regular council meeting.

Such map or record book shall be retained permanently in the office of the city clerk and shall be designated, as the case may be, as "Map (or Record Book) of Location of Official Traffic Control Devices." Typed, photographic or other copies of any part of such map or record book certified by the city clerk, shall be admitted in evidence in all courts and shall have the same effect as would the original map or record book. 
(c)  For purposes of enforcement, the installation or moving or removing of a traffic control device pursuant to subsection (a) shall take effect immediately when such a device is installed, moved or removed. The location of a traffic control device may be proved by the testimony of the official who designated its location in any case where an offender is brought to trial before a notation concerning the traffic control device in question has been made pursuant to subsection (b). 
(Sess. Laws 1967, ch. 404, § 2) 
Editor's note- The city no longer uses the procedure established by this section, exercising instead the more general authority as to vehicle control signs and signals granted the city by G.S. 20-158. This is seen by the city officials as a utilization of the city's option under G.S. 160A-3 to choose to follow either a general law or a charter procedure when both a general law and a charter provision purport to prescribe all acts necessary for the performance or execution of a power, duty, function, etc. 
Sec. 5.22. - Obstruction of private alleys.

(b)  The city manager may revoke or suspend any license issued by the council pending the action of the council. 
Sec. 5.42. - Liability insurance or surety bond to be furnished by demolition contractors. 
(a)  The city council may require every demolition contractor to furnish and keep in effect, for each building demolition project in the City of Hickory he may undertake, a policy of insurance or surety bond with sureties approved by the city manager. The policy or bond shall be in such amount or amounts as may be fixed by the council and shall be conditioned upon such contractor responding in damages for any liability incurred on account of any inquiry [injury] to persons or damage to property resulting from the prosecution of the demolition project, but the total liability of the contractor under such policy or bond shall not exceed a maximum limit designated by the council. The policy or bond, if required, shall be filed with the council as a condition precedent to conducting any building demolition project in the City of Hickory. 
(b)  As used in this section, the term "demolition contractor" means a person, firm or corporation who undertakes on his account or for another (whether for an agreed price or for cost plus a fixed fee or otherwise) to raze, dismantle or demolish a building. 
SUBCHAPTER D. - PLANNING, ZONING AND BUILDING REGULATIONS AND RELATED MATTERS

Requirements adopted under this subsection may be adopted throughout the area over which the city is authorized by law to exercise platting or subdivision controls. 
(b)  The requirements may provide, in lieu of the completion prior to the final approval of the plat of such work and installation on land within the corporate limits of the city, for an assessment under this chapter or under G.S. ch. 160, art. 9, or other statutory authorization whereby the city may do the work and make the installation at the cost of the owners of the property within the subdivision. 
Editor's note- G.S. ch. 160, art. 9 was repealed by Session Laws 1971, ch. 698, § 2, effective January 1, 1972. See now G.S. ch. 160A, art. 10 (G.S. 160A-216 et seq.).

In the event the county boards of commissioners of Catawba or Burke Counties or the governing bodies of the Town of Longview or Brookford fail or refuse to make such appointments after receipt of a written request and within 90 days from the date of the receipt thereof, the governing body of the City of Hickory may proceed to appoint those members to the planning commission which the county boards of commissioners or the municipal governing bodies failed or refused to appoint and such members so appointed shall have all the privileges, rights and duties as other members of the planning commission.

Sec. 8. - Authority of City of Hickory to adopt and implement major thoroughfare plan for regional planning area. 
    The governing body of the City of Hickory is authorized to adopt in cooperation with the North Carolina State Highway Commission a plan for the location, relocation, opening, widening, construction, extension or improvement of major highways and streets which are located in whole or in part anywhere within the regional planning area as defined by section 14 of this act except as such may be located within the corporate limits of the Town of Longview or the Town of Brookford. 
    In exercising the authority granted by this section, the governing body of the City of Hickory shall have the same authority within the regional planning area outside the corporate limits of the Town of Brookford and the Town of Longview that may now or hereafter be granted to the city by its charter, special act of the General Assembly, or the General Statutes of this state, including but not being limited to the provisions of G.S. 136-66.2. 
    In implementing the authority granted by this section, the governing body of the City of Hickory shall have additional authority as follows: 
(1)  Establishment of proposed street lines. 
(a)  Platting of proposed street lines. From and after the time of adoption of a major street plan by the governing body and the state highway commission pursuant to provisions of G.S. 136-66.2, the governing body shall have the power to request, make, or cause to be made, from time to time, surveys for the exact locating of the lines of new, extended, widened, or narrowed streets and highways in the whole or any portion of the city and within the regional planning area outside the corporate limits of the Town of Brookford or the Town of Longview. Personnel making such surveys are empowered to enter upon lands, make examinations or surveys, and place and maintain necessary monuments thereon, at reasonable times and with due care for the property. A plat or plats of the area or areas thus surveyed shall be prepared on which are indicated the locations of the lines recommended as the planned or mapped lines of future streets, street extensions, street widenings, or street narrowings. The preparation of such plat or plats shall not in and of itself constitute or be deemed to constitute the opening or establishment of any street or the taking or acceptance of any land for street purposes. 
(b)  Adoption of official map; hearing; notice. Following the preparation of such plats, the governing body may officially adopt a map or maps of planned new streets and highways, extensions, widenings, or narrowings, or vacations of streets within the city and within the regional planning area outside the corporate limits of the Town of Longview and the Town of Brookford. Before taking any such action, the council shall hold a public hearing thereon, notice of the time and place of which shall have been given once a week for two successive weeks in a newspaper published in the city and having general circulation in the regional planning area. Such notice shall be published for the first time not less than 15 days prior to the date fixed for said hearing. Following adoption of such a map or maps, the council shall certify a copy to the register of deeds of Catawba or Burke County, whichever is appropriate, which copy shall be duly filed. The placing of any street or street line upon any official map or maps shall not in and of itself constitute or be deemed to constitute the opening or establishment of any street or the taking or acceptance of any land for street purposes. 
(c)  Right of city to acquire property before improvement. From and after the time of adoption and certification to the register of deeds of any such map or maps, it shall be unlawful to build upon any land within the lines of proposed streets shown thereon or to repair or otherwise improve any existing buildings within said lines until the governing body shall have been given an opportunity to purchase or otherwise acquire said property for street purposes as provided by this section. To that end, any person proposing to build upon such land or to make repairs or improvements to any existing building on such land shall, in writing, notify the governing body of the nature and estimated cost of such building, repairs, or improvements. The governing body shall then determine whether it will take the necessary steps to acquire said land prior to construction of said building or the making of said repairs or improvements. If the council fails, within 60 days from the receipt of such notice, to acquire, adopt a formal resolution directing an appropriate officer to acquire, or institute condemnation proceedings to acquire said property, then the owner or other person giving notice may proceed to erect the building or to make the repairs or improvements described in said notice. The building inspector is authorized to withhold and refrain from issuing, for a period not exceeding 60 days from receipt by the governing body of the notice herein prescribed, any building permit for the erection of any building within the said lines, or for the making of any repairs or improvements to existing buildings within said lines. 
(d)  Failure to give notice bars recovery for value of improvements. If any person, firm, or corporation builds upon any land included within said proposed street lines, or repairs or otherwise improves that part of any existing building within said lines, without giving the governing body an opportunity to acquire said property free from improvements, as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, the governing body shall not be required to pay for the value of said building, repairs, or improvements in any proceeding subsequently brought to acquire the land for the purpose shown on the officially adopted map or maps. 
(e)  Failure of city to act no limit to subsequent condemnation. The failure of the governing body to take action under paragraph (c) of this section within 60 days after notice shall not have the effect of limiting the right of the governing body at any subsequent time to condemn the same. In such case, however, the owner shall be entitled to full compensation as now provided by law for the building, repairs, or improvements made after the failure of the council to take action within the prescribed period. 
(2)  Acquisition of rights-of-way. From and after the time of adoption of a major highway or street plan, pursuant to the provisions of G.S. 136-66.2 the governing body shall be vested with the same power and authority to acquire street or highway rights-of-way anywhere within the regional planning area as defined by section 14 of this act, except within the corporate limits of the Town of Longview or the Town of Brookford as is granted to the North Carolina State Highway Commission in G.S. ch. 136. In addition, authority is hereby granted to the city council to appropriate funds to be used outside the corporate limits and within the regional planning area for this purpose. 
(3)  Controlled access facilities. From and after the time of adoption of a major highway or street plan, pursuant to the provisions of G.S. 136-66.2 the city council shall be vested with the same power and authority to establish controlled access facilities anywhere within the regional planning area as defined by section 14 of this act, except within the corporate limits of the Town of Brookford or the Town of Longview as is granted to the state highway commission in G.S. ch. 136, art. 6D.

Editor's note- See G.S. 136-66.2, which provides for the cooperation of the state department of transportation in the development of a comprehensive plan for a street system.

b.  Any provision of this Code or any other city ordinance may be enforced by an appropriate equitable remedy issuing from a court of competent jurisdiction. In such case, the general court of justice shall have jurisdiction to issue such orders as may be appropriate, and it shall not be a defense to the application of the city for equitable relief that there is an adequate remedy at law. Any provision of this Code or any other city ordinance that makes unlawful a condition existing upon or use made of real property may be enforced by injunction and order of abatement, and the general court of justice shall have jurisdiction to issue such orders. 
c.  When a violation of such a provision occurs, the city may apply to the appropriate division of the general court of justice for a mandatory or prohibitory injunction and order of abatement commanding the defendant to correct the unlawful condition upon or cease the unlawful use of the property. The action shall be governed in all respects by the laws and rules governing civil proceedings, including the Rules of Civil Procedure in general and Rule 65 in particular. 
d.  In addition to an injunction, the court may enter an order of abatement as a part of the judgment in the case. An order of abatement may direct that buildings or other structures on the property be closed, demolished or removed; that fixtures, furniture or other movable property be removed from buildings on the property; that grass and weeds be cut; that improvements or repairs be made; or that any other action be taken that is necessary to bring the property into compliance with this Code or such ordinance. If the defendant fails or refuses to comply with an injunction or with an order of abatement within the time allowed by the court, he may be cited for contempt, and the city may execute the order of abatement. The city shall have a lien on the property for the cost of executing an order of abatement in the nature of a mechanic's and materialman's lien. The defendant may secure cancellation of an order of abatement by paying all costs of the proceedings and posting a bond for compliance with the order. The bond shall be given with sureties approved by the clerk of superior court in an amount approved by the judge before whom the matter is heard and shall be conditioned on the defendant's full compliance with the terms of the order of abatement within a time fixed by the judge. Cancellation of an order of abatement shall not suspend or cancel an injunction issued in conjunction therewith. 
(2)  A violation of any provision of the Hickory City Code or the Hickory Land Development Code may be enforced by any remedy provided by G.S. 160A-175. 
(3)  The provisions of this Code and any other city ordinance may be enforced by any one, all or a combination of the remedies authorized and prescribed by this section. 
(4)  Any violation of the provisions of Chapter 15 of the Hickory City Code, or any provision of the Hickory Land Development Code, may be enforced only through the civil penalty provisions established herein.

(1)  That the presence of a dog when off-premises of its owner's property and not under the exclusive control of its owner, often creates substantial anxieties and concerns for the safety and free movement of people and, therefore, the owner has an obligation to the citizens of the city to effectively confine and physically control his/her dog.

(3)  That a dog owner has a responsibility to be aware of any possible dangers to children, who might be unable to fully appreciate the possible danger presented by a dog and a dog's reaction to a young child. 
(4)  That a dog owner has a responsibility to be aware of any possible dangers to disabled and elderly persons who may not be able to physically ward off an aggressive dog. 
(5)  That animal control officers must have sufficient authority to impose preventive measures, to seize animals, and, if necessary, to determine ownership rights. 
(6)  That the city must adopt civil penalties, fines and other sanctions as measures to protect the citizens of the city and to declare that the ownership of pets entails responsibility on the part of the owners.

In the event that a cemetery or portion thereof has been closed to the opening of apparently unused gravesites, the cemetery sexton may make an exception if, in the sexton's opinion, the likelihood of a gravesite in question being previously occupied but unmarked is low given the information available either from the sexton's records, from information provided by next of kin or parties with knowledge of adjacent gravesites, or from other sources of information which may be available to the sexton.

(b)  The city council finds that cable service has become an integral part of its citizens' lives, and that evolving cable systems have the potential to play an even more dramatic role in the future, providing great benefits and advanced capabilities to the city.

(c)  In order to ensure that the city and its residents receive superior cable services and capabilities as this technology further evolves, all franchises granted pursuant to this chapter will be subject to periodic review to keep current with changing law, technology, industry standards and services. It is the intent of this chapter to help ensure that local cable operators provide the best possible cable service to residents of the city, and any franchises issued pursuant to this chapter shall be deemed to include this finding as an integral part thereof. 
(d)  Further, it is recognized that cable systems have the capacity to provide entertainment and information services to the city's residents, and may have the capacity to provide a variety of broadband, interactive communications services to institutions and individuals. For these purposes, the following goals underlie the regulations contained herein: 
(1)  Community antenna television systems services should be made available to all of the city's residents at reasonable costs. 
(2)  The system should be capable of accommodating both the present and reasonably foreseeable future community antenna television systems needs of the city.

(4)  Each of the above-enumerated goals shall be sought to the maximum extent, taking into account the costs and benefits to the residents of the city. 
(e)  The council further finds that stringent customer service standards, including liquidated damages provisions, are an effective means of ensuring compliance and approximating the costs of franchise agreement noncompliance to the city and its residents.

(c)  In the event that the federal or state government discontinues preemption in any area of cable communications over which it currently exercises jurisdiction in such manner as to expand rather than limit municipal regulatory authority, grantor may, if it so elects, adopt rules and regulations in these areas to the extent permitted by law, provided the same do not materially alter the rights and obligations of a grantee under any existing franchise. 
(d)  The grantee's rights are subject to the police powers of the city to adopt and enforce ordinances necessary to the health, safety, and welfare of the public. The grantee shall comply with all applicable general laws and ordinances enacted by the city pursuant to that power. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the grantee shall retain all rights it may have in compliance with applicable law. 
(e)  The provisions of this chapter shall apply to all franchises granted or renewed after the effective date of this chapter. This chapter shall also apply to all existing franchises, to the extent not inconsistent with the terms of any such franchise or applicable law. In the event of any conflict between the terms and conditions of a franchise agreement and the provisions of this chapter, and other generally applicable regulatory ordinances of the city, the terms of the franchise agreement shall control. A franchise agreement (including all of grantee's particular rights, powers, protections, privileges, immunities and obligations associated therewith as the same exist on the date hereof) shall constitute a legally binding contract between the city and grantee, and as such, cannot be amended, modified or changed by the city or grantee without the consent of grantee and grantor in any manner whatsoever, whether by ordinance, rule, regulation or otherwise, to impose on grantee more stringent or burdensome requirements or conditions; provided, however, that nothing herein contained shall preclude the city from the proper exercise of its police powers, or its powers of eminent domain. 
(f)  In the event of a change in state or federal law which by its terms would require the city to amend this chapter, the parties shall modify the existing franchise in a mutually agreed upon manner. 
(g)  Grantee shall not be relieved of its obligation to comply with any of the provisions of this chapter or a franchise agreement by reason of any failure of the city to enforce prompt compliance. 
(Amend. No. 6, § 1, 11-20-01) 
Sec. 8-41. - Rights reserved to grantor. 
    In addition to any rights specifically reserved to grantor by this chapter or a franchise agreement, grantor reserves to itself every right and power that is required to be reserved by a provision of any other ordinance or under any other franchise. 
(Amend. No. 6, § 1, 11-20-01) 
Sec. 8-42. - Franchise agreement. 
(a)  Every grantee shall agree to the terms and provisions of a franchise agreement as negotiated between the grantee and the grantor. 
(b)  In addition to those matters required elsewhere in this chapter to be included in the franchise agreement, each franchise agreement must contain the following express representations by each grantee:

(2)  Grantee recognizes, unless otherwise agreed in the applicable franchise agreement, the right of the city to adopt such additional regulations of general applicability as it shall find necessary in the exercise of its police power. 
(c)  Every franchise agreement shall contain such further conditions or provisions as may be negotiated between the city and a grantee, except that no such conditions or provisions shall be such as to conflict with any provisions of state or federal law. 
(Amend. No. 6, § 1, 11-20-01)

(Amend. No. 6, § 1, 11-20-01) 
Sec. 8-46. - Grant of additional franchise and competing service. 
    Competing or overlapping franchises may have an adverse impact on the public rights-of-way and on the quality and availability of services to the public. In considering whether to grant one or more additional franchises, the city shall specifically consider, and address in a written report or in provisions of the franchise agreement, the following issues: 
(1)  The positive and/or negative impact of an additional franchise on the community. 
(2)  The ability and willingness of the specific applicant in question to provide cable services to the franchise area. 
(3)  The amount of time it will take the applicant to complete construction of the proposed system and activate service in the franchise area; and, whether the applicant can complete construction and activation of its system pursuant to industry standards. 
(4)  The financial capabilities of the applicant and its guaranteed commitment to make the necessary investment to erect, maintain, and operate the proposed cable system for the duration of the franchise term. In order to ensure that any prospective grantee does have the requisite current financial capabilities, the city may request equity and debt financing commitment letters, current audited financial statements, bonds, letters of credit, or other documentation to demonstrate to the city's satisfaction that the requisite funds to construct and operate the proposed system are available. 
(5)  The quality and technical reliability of the proposed system, based upon the applicant's plan of construction and the method of distribution of signals, and the applicant's technical qualifications to construct and operate such system. 
(6)  The experience of the applicant in the erection, maintenance, and operation of a cable system. 
(7)  The capacity of the public rights-of-way to accommodate one or more additional cable systems and the potential disruption of those public rights-of-way and private property that may occur if one or more additional franchises are granted. 
(8)  The likelihood and ability of the applicant to continue to provide competing cable service to subscribers within the franchise area for the duration of the franchise. 
(9)  Such other information as the city may deem appropriate to be considered prior to granting any competing or overlapping franchise. 
(10)  The purpose of this section is to ensure that any competition which may occur among grantees will be on terms which when taken as a whole are nondiscriminatory according to federal law. 
(Amend. No. 6, § 1, 11-20-01) 
Sec. 8-47. - Permits for nonfranchised entities. 
(a)  The city may issue a license, easement, or other permit to a person other than the grantee to permit that person to traverse any portion of the grantee's franchise area within the city in order to provide service outside, but not within the city. Such license or easement, absent a grant of a franchise in accordance with this chapter, shall not authorize nor permit said person to provide cable service to any subscriber within the city nor render any other service within the city. 
(b)  The granting of such license, easement or permit shall be conditioned upon the payment of fee for occupancy of the public right-of-way to the extent permitted by applicable law. 
(Amend. No. 6, § 1, 11-20-01) 
Sec. 8-48. - Review for competition. 
    The city recognizes that the community antenna television systems and telecommunications industries are in a period of convergence, that the technologies and services provided by these industries are rapidly changing, and that the Telecommunications Act of 1996 promoted and encouraged competition between and among these formally discrete industries. At this time it is premature to know fully the extent to which there will be changes in law, technology or services that may impact entities that have been or may be granted franchises or licenses to use the city's rights-of-way. It is the desire of the city to be a communications friendly city, that encourages the development of competitive advanced communications capabilities for the benefit of all its citizens. For this reason the regulatory ordinances and franchises of the city should not impede or restrict the fair opportunity to compete, but rather are intended to provide uniform and consistent requirements for all multi-channel video programming providers. 
(Amend. No. 6, § 1, 11-20-01) 
Sec. 8-49. - Application and renewal fees. 
(a)  An application fee shall not be deemed to be "franchise fees" within the meaning of Section 622 of the Cable Act (47 U.S.C. § 542), and such payments shall not be deemed to be (i) "payments in kind" or any involuntary payments chargeable against the compensation to be paid to the city by grantee, or (ii) part of the compensation to be paid to the city by grantee pursuant to this chapter or a franchise agreement. 
(b)  All applicants for an initial franchise grant shall submit an application fee as established in the city's fee schedule to compensate the city for its costs in reviewing, preparing and awarding a franchise, including the costs of outside consultants. Upon grant of a franchise the city may request the payment of an additional fee to the extent that the reasonable costs of the franchise review and negotiation process exceed the initial application fee amount. Consistent with the Cable Act, all such fees shall not constitute or be credited towards a grantee's franchise fee obligations. Reasonable costs include staff time, professional fees, and administrative costs as determined necessary by the city. 
(c)  The city reserves the right, unless prohibited by applicable law, to require a grantee to pay the incidental costs of the franchise renewal and negotiation process. Incidental costs include staff time, professional fees, and administrative costs as stated in the franchise agreement. 
(Amend. No. 6, § 1, 11-20-01) 
Sec. 8-50. - Institutional network, and public educational and governmental ("PEG") access.

Such institutional network provision may be supported pursuant to a separate contract arrangement if so agreed upon in the franchise agreement. 
(b)  Every grantee shall provide a channel or channels, bandwidth capacity, service, and funding for separate public, educational, and government ("PEG") access channels, as specified in its franchise agreement. All such PEG access channels shall be available to all subscribers as part of basic cable service. 
(c)  Oversight and administration of the PEG access channels shall be set forth in the franchise agreement. The city may designate a community access corporation or similar entity to administer one or more of the access channels. 
(d)  Cost associated with construction and operation of the I-Net shall not be considered a franchise fee unless specified in the franchise agreement.

(1)  Whenever grantor has reason to believe that there may be grounds for revocation of a franchise, grantor shall first notify the grantee in writing of its basis for believing grounds for revocation exist. Such notice shall indicate with reasonable specificity the grounds for revocation that are believed to exist so that the grantee may have a reasonable opportunity to cure or otherwise address the same. If a grantee fails to adequately cure or address the purported grounds for revocation within 30 days of such notice, or such longer period of time as may be necessary to cure said violation in grantor's reasonable determination, then the grantor may, upon 30 days written notice to the grantee, commence a public administrative hearing to determine whether there exists any ground for revocation. 
(2)  The administrative hearing shall be conducted so as to protect the full due process rights of the parties and provide for, at a minimum, the right to have counsel, the right to call and cross-examine witnesses, and the right to a full transcript of the proceedings at the cost of the individual or entity requesting such.

Sec. 8-52. - Foreclosure, receivership and abandonment. 
(a)  Foreclosure. Upon the foreclosure or other judicial sale of all or a part of a system, a grantee shall notify grantor of such fact and such notification shall be treated as a notification that a change in control of the grantee has taken place, and the provisions of this chapter governing the consent to transfer or change in ownership shall apply without regard to how such transfer or change in ownership occurred. 
(b)  Receivership. Apart from and supplemental to the right to revoke a franchise, grantor shall have the right to cancel a franchise agreement 120 days after the appointment of a receiver or trustee to take over and conduct the business of a grantee, whether in receivership, reorganization, bankruptcy, or other action or proceeding, unless such receivership or trusteeship shall have been vacated prior to the expiration of said 120 days, or unless: 
(1)  Within 120 days after its election or appointment, the receiver or trustee has fully complied with all the provisions of grantee's franchise agreement and this chapter and remedied all defaults thereunder; and

(a)  No grantee shall sell, transfer, lease, assign, sublet, or dispose of, in whole or in part, an interest in or control of a franchise or cable system or any of the rights or privileges granted by a franchise agreement, without the prior consent of the grantor, which consent shall not be unreasonably denied or delayed and may be denied only upon a good faith finding by the grantor that the proposed transferee lacks the legal, technical, or financial qualifications to consummate the transaction and operate the system so as to perform its obligations under this chapter and the applicable franchise agreement. This section shall not apply to sales of property or equipment in the normal course of business. Consent from the grantor shall not be required for a transfer in trust, mortgage, or other instrument of hypothecation, in whole or in part, to secure an indebtedness, or for a transfer to a corporation, partnership, or other entity controlling, controlled by, or under common control with a grantee. 
(b)  The following additional events shall be deemed to be a sale, assignment, or other transfer of an interest in or control of a grantee or its franchise or cable system requiring compliance with this section: (i) the sale, assignment, or other transfer of all or a majority of a grantee's assets; (ii) the sale, assignment, or other transfer of capital stock or partnership, membership, or other equity interests in a grantee by one or more of its existing shareholders, partners, members, or other equity owners so as to create a new controlling interest in a grantee; (iii) the issuance of additional capital stock or partnership, membership or other equity interest by a grantee so as to create a new controlling interest in a grantee; and (iv) a grantee's agreement to transfer management or operation of the grantee or the system.

(c)  In the case of any sale or transfer of ownership of an interest in or control of a grantee or its franchise or cable system, the city shall have 120 days to act upon any request for approval of such sale or transfer that contains or is accompanied by such information as is required in accordance with FCC regulations and the requirements of this chapter and the applicable franchise agreement, including information related to the legal, technical and financial qualifications of the proposed transferee. Failure to provide all information reasonably requested by the city as part of its review may be grounds for a denial of the proposed transfer. If the city fails to render a final decision on the request within 120 days after receipt by the city of all required information, such request shall be deemed granted unless the grantee and the city agree to an extension of the 120-day period. 
(d)  The consent or approval of the city to any transfer of the grantee shall not constitute a waiver or release of the rights of the city in and to the public rights-of-way, and any transfer shall, by its terms, be expressly subject to the terms and conditions of this chapter and the franchise agreement. 
(e)  In the absence of extraordinary circumstances, the city will not approve any transfer or assignment of the franchise prior to completion of construction of the proposed initial system. 
(f)  Any approval by the city of a transfer shall be contingent upon the prospective new grantee becoming a signatory to the franchise agreement.

Unless the franchise agreement provides otherwise, every grantee shall serve all areas of the city equally with populations of at least 20 residential dwelling units per cable mile as measured from a grantee's existing distribution system, including areas annexed subsequent to the grant of the franchise. The franchise agreement shall provide a schedule of the areas to be served, and the specific build-out requirements of the grantee, and shall also describe the process for extending service to areas that will meet minimum density requirements at some future date. All grantees must make every commercially reasonable effort to extend service to commercial buildings 
(b)  During the initial construction phase of a new system, a grantee may implement its system in stages pursuant to a schedule and line extension policy established in its franchise agreement that serves all areas of the city equally, provided that any deviation from the service and line extension requirements of this chapter do not discriminate between different areas of the city on the basis of race, creed, religion or economic condition and are consistent with section 8-38 of this chapter.

(c)  Cost-sharing. Pursuant to section 8-127(a) of this chapter, and in franchise agreements with a 20-homes-per-mile requirement in areas with less than 20 homes per proposed cable mile, grantee shall offer a cost-sharing arrangement to Residents. grantee shall bear its pro rata share of the current construction costs based upon the actual number of homes per mile. The cost-sharing arrangement shall consist of the following: On the request of a subscriber desiring service, grantee shall prepare, at its cost, a cost analysis to determine the cost of the plant extension required to provide service to the subscriber from the closest usable point on the cable system. The cost of construction shall be allocated based on the following formula: If a request for extension into a residential area requires the construction of cable plant which does not pass at least 20 homes per cable mile, a proportionate share of construction costs shall be borne by grantee and by the subscribers. For example, if there are ten dwelling units per mile, grantee's share will equal 10/20 th of the construction cost. The line extension formula shall also be applied to a portion of a cable mile meeting proportionate density requirements. For example, if there are ten dwelling units per one-half mile, the grantee shall construct the plant. The cost sharing described above would be utilized if there were less than the proportionate share of dwelling units per the portion of a mile needed to reach the dwelling units. The remaining costs will be shared equally by each subscriber in the area to be constructed. Each person contributing toward the direct cost of the line extension shall waive all ownership interest in the line extension. All equipment and components of the line extension, including, but not limited to, cable wire, electronics and pedestals shall at all times remain the exclusive property of the grantee.

ARTICLE VI. - FINANCES AND INSURANCE 

Sec. 8-196. - Franchise fee. 
(a)  The administration of this chapter or the franchise agreement imposes upon the city additional regulatory responsibility and expense and in consideration for permission to use the public rights-of-way of the city for the construction, operation and maintenance, of a cable system within the city, a grantee of any franchise hereunder shall pay to the city a franchise fee in an amount as designated in the franchise agreement, up to the maximum amount allowed by applicable law. To the extent that applicable law changes the maximum authorized franchise fee, the city reserves the right to change the franchise fee as stated in the franchise agreement, by adopting an ordinance establishing the new franchise fee rate and allowing reasonable notice to the grantee for administration of the change. The city shall hold a public hearing prior to adopting any change in the franchise fee. 
(b)  Payments due grantor under this section shall be computed quarterly, for the preceding quarter. Each quarterly payment shall be due and payable no later than 45 days after the end of the preceding quarter. Each payment shall be accompanied by a brief report by a grantee showing the basis for the computation and a "franchise fee worksheet" listing all of the sources of revenues attributable to the operation of grantee's system in the city. All such payments shall be certified as correct by an officer or manager of the grantee. 
(c)  No acceptance of any payment shall be construed as an accord that the amount paid is in fact the correct amount, nor shall such acceptance of payment be construed as a release of any claim grantor may have for further sums payable under the provisions of this chapter or a franchise agreement. All amounts paid shall be subject to audit and recomputation by grantor or its designee at any time during any calendar year (but not more than once per calendar year) upon 20 calendar days notice, which shall include a request for any documents sought to be reviewed. Audits shall be at the expense of the grantee if the additional amount due is greater than three percent of the amount paid. Any additional amount due to the city as a result of the audit shall be paid within 60 days following written notice to the grantee by the city which notice shall include a copy of the audit report. Grantor's right to audit and grantee's obligation to retain records related to the Franchise fee audit, shall expire three years from the date on which the most recent franchise fee payment by the grantee was due from the time of written notice. 
(d)  In the event that any franchise payment or recomputed amount is not made on or before the dates specified herein, grantee shall pay as additional compensation an interest charge, computed from such due date, at the annual rate equal to the commercial prime interest rate of the city's primary depository bank during the period that such unpaid amount is owed. 
(Amend. No. 6, § 1, 11-20-01) 
Sec. 8-197. - Performance bond. 
    Each grantee shall maintain a performance bond with the city to ensure compliance with this chapter and the applicable franchise agreement, in an amount and in a manner as set forth in the grantee's franchise agreement. 
(Amend. No. 6, § 1, 11-20-01) 
Sec. 8-198. - Penalties procedure. 
(a)  Whenever grantor has reason to believe that a grantee has violated any material provision of a franchise agreement or this chapter, grantor shall first notify the grantee of the material violation and demand correction within a reasonable time, which shall not be less than 20 days in the case of the failure of a grantee to pay any sum or other amount due the grantor under a franchise agreement, and not less than 30 days in all other cases. If a grantee fails to correct the violation within the time prescribed, or if a grantee is unable to correct the violation and fails to commence corrective action within the time prescribed and to diligently remedy such violation thereafter, the grantee shall then be given written notice of not less than 20 days of a public hearing to be held on the matter. Said notice shall indicate with reasonable specificity the violation alleged to have occurred. 
(b)  At the public hearing, the council shall hear and consider all relevant evidence and thereafter render findings and a decision based upon the evidence. Any such hearing must, at a minimum, provide the grantee a full and fair opportunity to be heard by the council. 
(c)  In the event the council finds that a grantee has corrected the violation or promptly commenced correction of such violation after notice thereof from grantor and is diligently proceeding to fully remedy the violation, or that no violation has occurred, the proceedings shall terminate and no penalty or other sanction shall be imposed. 
(d)  In the event the council finds that a violation exists and that a grantee has not corrected the same in a satisfactory manner or did not promptly commence and diligently proceed to correct the violation, the council may impose liquidated damages to be collected from the performance bond, as set out in the franchise agreement. 
(e)  If the council elects to assess liquidated damages, then such election shall constitute grantor's exclusive remedy for a period of 60 days. Thereafter, if a grantee remains in noncompliance, the grantor may pursue any other available remedy. 
(f)  In the event that a franchise is cancelled or terminated by reason of the default of a grantee, the performance bond deposited pursuant to a franchise agreement shall remain in effect and available to the grantor until all pending claims or penalties are resolved or settled, after which point any remaining amounts in the performance bond shall revert to the grantee. 
(g)  The rights reserved to grantor with respect to the security fund are in addition to all other rights of grantor, whether reserved by a franchise agreement, this chapter, or authorized by law, and no action, proceeding, or exercise of a right with respect to such performance bond shall affect any other right grantor may have. 
(h)  In instances of repeated material violations, whether remedied or not, the grantor may serve special notice outlining additional remediation requirements and allow grantee sufficient time to pursue such remediation. Failure to cure, as measured by repeated instances of the same violation, is evidence of an evasive practice and may lead to revocation under section 8-51 of this chapter. 
(i)  Grantee acknowledges that noncompliance with the provisions of the franchise agreement and this chapter will harm subscribers and the city and the amounts of actual damages will be difficult or impossible to ascertain. The city may therefore assess the following liquidated damages against grantee for unexcused noncompliance with the requirements of the franchise agreement and this chapter. Grantee acknowledges that the liquidated damages set forth below are a reasonable approximation of actual damages and that this provision is intended to provide compensation and is not a penalty. All damages provided shall be cumulative, unless expressly stated. 
(1)  For failure to materially complete construction or line extensions in accordance with the ordinance and the franchise agreement: $250.00 per calendar day for each day the violation continues.

Exception: For new subdivisions approved by the subdivision review board where a performance guarantee is accepted for completion of water utilities in lieu of actual completion of the utility work prior to acceptance of the final plat, single-family dwelling construction may begin without hydrants and water mains being ready for service. Construction sites shall be limited so as not to cause an undue fire hazard, with the fire marshal being notified prior to the beginning of each construction. No dwelling shall be occupied until all fire protection requirements have been met and are ready for service. For those new subdivisions where water mains are not available, then the fire protection requirements necessary to compensate for this deficiency shall be approved by the fire marshal. This may include but is not limited to, draft points, proper road construction to allow for tanker operations, water fill points, etc. 
(3)  Unless otherwise agreed to by the public utilities department of the city, hydrants shall be installed at the developer's or owner's expense, including but not limited to: 
a.  Extension of city owned waterlines in order to provide service for the new development as required by this policy. 
b.  Addition of fire hydrants to existing waterlines. 
c.  Private fire lines. 
d.  The cost of possible upgrading of existing lines to provide the necessary water flow capacity for the building or project. 
(b)  For buildings which are under renovation or remodeling of which a building permit is required or a certificate of occupancy is being applied for due to a change in ownership, change in type of occupancy, or any other reason, the existing water system shall be deemed as adequate for the existing building, so long as a required number of hydrants with a flow certified as adequate by the fire marshal's office is acceptable to the fire marshal. If hazardous materials or dangerous processes are part of the change of occupancy, then additional water flow requirements shall meet Fire Code requirements. 
(Amend. No. 2, 9-4-91) 
Sec. 11-74. - Existing development. 
    The following guidelines shall apply to existing industrial, commercial, and residential projects, buildings, and subdivisions. 
(1)  The city shall determine the deficient areas in fire hydrant protection which are located in the public right-of-way. A plan of correction shall be developed in accordance to monies available. 
(2)  Where existing development poses a danger to life and property due to fire hydrant deficiencies existing on private property, the fire department may require the deficiency to be corrected. The cost of this type of fire hydrant protection shall be borne by the owner. 
(Amend. No. 2, 9-4-91) 
Sec. 11-75. - Required fire flow tables. 
(a)  Generally. 
(1)  The following tables shall be used to determine the minimum fire flow requirements needed for a building. The fire-flow requirement is the quantity of water in gallons per minute needed to control an anticipated fire in a building or group of buildings. Fire flows determined from these tables shall be required to be available for a duration of at least 60 minutes, with a minimum of 20 PSI residual pressure available. This will assure of sufficient flow for fire protection while allowing other water users in the area to maintain a normal usage without any interruption or damage to the user's system. 
(2)  These fire flow requirements may be modified by the fire official of the fire department to allow for exposure problems of adjacent buildings, storage of hazardous materials, occupancy classification, or any other such condition that may warrant an increase in fire flow to provide adequate fire protection. 
(b)  Definition. To define fire area, this is the total floor area in square feet for all floor levels within the exterior walls, or under the horizontal projection of the roof of a building. Four-hour fire separation walls may be considered in dividing a building into separate fire areas for the purpose of determining fire flow. 
(c)  Notes to tables. 
(1)  The minimum fire-flow requirements for one- and two-family dwellings shall be 1,000 GPM. Exception: This requirement may be reduced 50 percent if the building is equipped with an approved sprinkler system. 
(2)  The minimum fire flow requirement determined by the following tables for buildings other than one- or two-family dwellings may be reduced 50 percent if the building is equipped with an approved sprinkler system. However, the flow requirement shall not be reduced below the requirements of the sprinkler system as determined per NFPA 13. 
(3)  Multi-story buildings may have modifications to the fire flow. The fire official of the fire department shall assist in these determinations. 
(4)  Hydrants installed to meet the provisions of the fire flow requirements shall be calculated at providing 1,500 GPM each. If the required fire flow does not exceed the hydrant flow calculation by 500 GPM or more, then an additional hydrant shall not be required. (See Table 5.) 
(5)  Additional hydrants may be necessary for the adequate fire protection of a building above the minimum calculated by Table 5, due to the accessibility of fire apparatus, extended hose lays or other such situations that may dictate fire department procedures. The fire official of the fire department will be able to help the developer in making these determinations. In no case shall the spacing distance of hydrants that are installed under the provisions of this policy be more than is allowed under these guidelines. 
(d)  Conversion chart. The following conversion chart shall be used to determine the proper table to be used in the fire flow requirements: 
Table 1 -Type VI Construction (Wood frame), 
C = 1.5 
Table 2: -Type V Construction (Masonry exterior walls with wood construction elsewhere), 
C = 1.0 
Table 3: Type IV Construction (Noncombustible construction such as metal buildings), C = 0.8 
Table 4: Type I & II Construction (Fire resistive construction), C = 0.6 
Note: For buildings of Type III (Heavy timber) Construction, the same formula shall be used for determining fire flow using a co-efficient of 0.9 in the calculation. The calculation used for these determinations is as follows: 
F = 18 C (A) 0.5 
where "F" equals required fire flow, "C" equals co-efficient for each type of construction, and "A" equals total floor area being considered.

Over 7501 GPM fire flow requirements will require one hydrant per 1000 GPM increase in fire flow. 
Exception: When the required fire flow does not exceed the hydrant calculation by 500 GPM or more, then an additional hydrant shall not be required. (See subsection (c)(5) above.) 
Example: The required fire flow for a building is 3250 GPM. According to Table 5, three hydrants are required. However, two hydrants calculated at 1500 GPM each (See subsection (c)(5) above) equal 3000 GPM. The required fire flow does not exceed the hydrant calculation by 500 GPM (3250 - 3000 = 250 GPM). Therefore, only two hydrants would be required in this situation. 
(Amend. No. 2, 9-4-91) 
Sec. 11-76. - Fire hydrant installation. 
    The following guidelines shall apply to the installations of all new hydrants required by the fire official and replacements of existing hydrants that are already in service. 
(1)  Hydrants. 
a.  Hydrants installed shall be of the dry barrel type. They shall be listed and approved by a certified testing laboratory and of one of the following brands: American-Darling Mark 73, Kennedy K-81, and Mueller Centurion. The hydrant shall include two 21/2-inch discharge outlets and one 41/2-inch discharge outlet. All threads of the outlets shall be NST (National Standard Thread). The hydrant shall have a uniform-sized pentagonal operating nut measuring 11/2 inches from point to flat at the base with 1 7/16 inches at the top. 
b.  The diameter of the bottom of the valve shall not be less than six inches to provide no more than three psi-friction loss at a flow of 250 GPM through a single 21/2-inch outlet. 
c.  Hydrants shall be installed at a readily accessible location. Hydrants shall be installed so that the 41/2-inch discharge is at least 18 inches above finished grade. This clearance is necessary to facilitate a hydrant assist-valve when connecting to the hydrant. 
d.  Upon completion of installation, each hydrant shall be flushed of all sediment or debris that may hinder its operation. The caps will then be greased and the hydrant set ready for service. The fire department will then be notified of the completion of the installation and that the hydrant is in service and ready for an inspection by the fire official. 
e.  All completed hydrant installations shall be inspected by the fire official in order to be sure that the hydrant is in compliance with this policy. 
f.  All new installations shall be warranted by the installer for the period of one year for material or installation defects. 
g.  Once the hydrant has met approval of proper installation by the fire marshal, then it will become the responsibility of the city to maintain the hydrant if the hydrant is located on public right-of-way. The city will take care of any expense in maintaining and repairing any defects or malfunctions with the hydrant other than those that are covered under the warranty of the installer. All hydrants installed on private property shall be maintained by the owner or occupant. 
h.  All new hydrants shall be painted to match the existing hydrants in the city. Unless otherwise specified, this color shall be: yellow (barrel); white reflective (caps and bonnet). 
i.  Materials used and installation methods shall meet the standards of the city public utilities department in compliance with the ANSI and AWWA standards. 
(2)  Hydrant spacing. 
a.  Hydrants shall be located as close as possible to street intersections or areas of direct vehicular access. Recommended hydrant spacing for developed areas will be 500 feet. At no time will hydrant spacing exceed 800 feet. Larger industrial commercial or multifamily developments may require additional hydrants to compensate for long hose lays and/or greater water demand. These determinations shall be made by the fire official at the time of the plans review or at the subdivision review board meeting. 
b.  Hydrants shall be located no closer than 50 feet from a building. If a probable collapse zone exists due to the height of the building that provides a greater distance than 50 feet, then the hydrant shall be located out of this zone. 
c.  Hydrants should be located close to street access as to facilitate easy hook-up. 
d.  Hydrants located in areas designated for parking shall be afforded some type of protection from collision of vehicular traffic. 
Exception: Side street parking where a curb protects the hydrant from normal parking and is marked for no parking; no other type of protection is needed. 
e.  For parking on a street beside a hydrant, at least one parking space shall be marked at the hydrant to provide for no parking. In shopping centers or other type parking areas, at least one parking space in front and/or back, for whichever provides the means of access, shall be designated as for fire department access. The area around the hydrant shall be marked with yellow markings and designate in letters "No Parking." 
f.  Hydrants shall be located at least four feet from any solid object such as a power pole, tree, building, dumpster, etc., that may hinder access and use of the hydrant. Brush and/or trees shall be cleared around the hydrant to at least four feet in all directions. A clear area of access shall be maintained to the hydrant at all times. 
(Amend. No. 2, 9-4-91) 
Sec. 11-77. - Water supply lines for hydrants. 
    The following are the guidelines in the installation of piping for supply of water to a hydrant. 
(1)  Hydrants installed on existing water lines will need to have a flow test conducted by the fire marshal's office to insure that the existing line can supply an adequate flow of water as needed per ISO fire flow requirements. 
(2)  All supply line piping and fittings shall be suitable for the working pressures and conditions under which the pipe is installed. Types of piping and fittings used shall meet the standards set forth by the city public utilities department and in conjunction with ANSI and AWWA standards. The installation methods shall also meet these standards. Recommended practices of materials used and installation are covered under the Fire Protection Handbook of the National Fire Protection Association. 
(3)  A new supply line installation that ties both ends of the new piping into the feeder mains so as to be fed from two directions shall be considered a "loop system." The minimum size piping installed for a loop system shall be six inches. Any supply line that supplies more than four hydrants shall be installed as a loop system, unless the piping is oversized to overcome the friction loss in order to provide the prescribed fire flow. Any supply line supplying less than four hydrants but extends more than 2,500 feet shall also be installed as a loop system, unless the piping is oversized to provide the prescribed fire flow. 
(4)  A new supply line installation that only ties one end into a feeder main so that it receives a supply of water from one direction shall be considered a "dead end main." 
(5)  Dead end mains shall be a minimum size of eight-inch piping. If the dead end main extends for more than 2,500 feet with a required fire flow of 750 GPM or more, then a larger size pipe shall be installed to overcome the friction loss that may reduce the available flow. It shall be the responsibility of the installer to contact the fire marshal's office to determine the minimum size necessary in this situation. 
(6)  Valves for the isolation of hydrants and/or branch or feeder supply lines shall be as a good practice as per the city public utility department requires. A recommended practice of installation is in accordance with the publication NFPA #26. 
(7)  It shall be the responsibility of the developer, property owner, or person in charge of the development project to submit plans of construction of the water supply lines or hydrant location and spacing to the fire marshal's office and utilities department for approval prior to installation. All new supply lines shall be inspected prior to their covering of fill material to insure compliance with the submitted plans. Once the system is completed, a final inspection will be conducted. This inspection will also include a flow test to insure proper fire flow adequacy. 
(8)  All new installed supply lines shall be warranted by the installer for a period of one year for material and/or installation defects. This is commensurate with the installation of new hydrants. Once the line has met approval of proper installation by the fire marshal, then it will be the responsibility of the city to maintain those lines, which are located on the public right-of-way. Supply lines installed on private property shall be maintained at the expense of the owner. Defects covered under the installer's warranty shall be corrected by the installer.

Whenever a petition is filed with the inspector by a public authority or by at least five residents of the city charging that any dwelling or dwelling unit is unfit for human habitation, or whenever it appears to the inspector, upon inspection, that any dwelling or dwelling unit is unfit for human habitation, he shall, if his preliminary investigation discloses a basis for such charges, issue and cause to be served upon the owner of and parties in interest in such dwelling or dwelling unit a complaint stating the charges and containing a notice that a hearing will be held before the inspector at a place therein fixed, not less than ten nor more than 30 days after the serving of such complaint. The owner or any party in interest shall have the right to file an answer to the complaint and to appear, in person or otherwise, and give testimony at the place and time fixed in the complaint. Notice of such hearing shall also be given to at least one of the persons signing a petition relating to such dwelling. Any person desiring to do so may attend such hearing and give evidence relevant to the matter being heard. The rules of evidence prevailing in courts of law or equity shall not be controlling in hearings before the inspector. 
(b)  Procedure after hearing. 
(1)  Generally. After such notice and hearing, the inspector shall state in writing his determination whether such dwelling or dwelling unit is unfit for human habitation and, if so, whether it is deteriorated or dilapidated. 
(2)  Deterioration. If the inspector determines that the dwelling or dwelling unit is deteriorated, he shall state in writing his findings of fact in support of such determination and shall issue and cause to be served upon the owner thereof an order directing and requiring the owner to repair, alter and improve such dwelling or dwelling unit to comply with the minimum standards of fitness established by this chapter within a specified period of time, not to exceed 90 days. Such order may also direct and require the owner to vacate and close such dwelling or dwelling unit until such repairs, alterations and improvements have been made. 
(3)  Dilapidation. If the inspector determines that the dwelling is dilapidated, he shall state in writing his findings of fact to support such determination and shall issue and cause to be served upon the owner thereof an order directing and requiring the owner to either repair, alter or improve such dwelling or dwelling unit to comply with the minimum standards of fitness established by this chapter or else vacate and remove or demolish the same within a specified period of time, not to exceed 90 days. 
(c)  Failure to comply with order. 
(1)  In personam remedy. If the owner of any deteriorated dwelling or dwelling unit shall fail to comply with an order of the inspector to vacate and close and remove or demolish the same within the time specified therein, the inspector shall submit to the city council at its next regular meeting a resolution directing the city attorney to petition the superior court for an order directing such owner to comply with the order of the inspector, as authorized by G.S. 160A-446(g). 
(2)  In rem remedy. After failure of an owner of a deteriorated dwelling or dwelling unit, or of a dilapidated dwelling, to comply with an order of the inspector within the time specified therein, if injunctive relief has not been sought or has not been granted as provided in paragraph (1) of this subsection, the inspector shall submit to the city council a request for an ordinance ordering the inspector to cause such dwelling or dwelling unit to be repaired, altered, improved or vacated and closed and removed or demolished, as provided in the original order of the inspector, and pending such removal or demolition, to placard such dwelling "This building is unsafe for human habitation" as provided by G.S. 160A-443 and section 15-68 of this article.

Upon the filing of any notice of appeal, the inspector shall forthwith transmit to the city council all papers constituting the record upon which the decision appealed from was made. When an appeal is from a decision of the inspector refusing to allow the person aggrieved thereby to do any act, his decision shall remain in force until modified or reversed. When any appeal is from a decision of the inspector requiring the person aggrieved to do any act, the appeal shall have the effect of suspending the requirement until the hearing by the city council, unless the inspector certifies to the city council, after the notice of appeal is filed with him, that because of facts stated in the certificate (a copy of which shall be furnished the appellant), a suspension of his requirement would cause imminent peril to life or property. In that case the requirement shall not be suspended except by a restraining order, which may be granted for due cause shown upon not less than one day's written notice to the inspector, by the city council, or by a court of record upon petition made pursuant to G.S. 160A-446(f) and subsection (e) of this section. The city council shall fix a reasonable time for the hearing of all appeals, shall give due notice to all the parties and shall render its decision within a reasonable time. Any party may appear, in person or by agent or attorney. The city council may reverse or affirm, wholly or partly, or may modify the decision or order appealed from and may make such decision and order as in its opinion ought to be made in the matter, and to that end it shall have all the powers of the inspector, but the concurring vote of five members of the city council shall be necessary to reverse or modify any decision or order of the inspector. The city council shall have power also in passing upon appeals, in any case where there are practical difficulties or unnecessary hardships in the way of carrying out the strict letter of this chapter, to adapt the application of this chapter to the necessities of the case, to the end that the spirit of this chapter shall be observed, public safety and welfare secured and substantial justice done.

Such lien shall be filed, have the same priority and be enforced and the costs collected as provided by G.S. chapter 160A, article 10 (G.S. 160A-216 et seq.). If the dwelling is removed or demolished by the public officer, he shall sell the materials of the dwelling, and any personal property, fixtures or appurtenances found in or attached to the dwelling, and shall credit the proceeds of the sale against the cost of the removal or demolition and any balance remaining shall be deposited in the superior court by the inspector, shall be secured in a manner directed by the court, and shall be disbursed by the court to the persons found to be entitled thereto by final order or decree of the court. Nothing in this section shall be construed to impair or limit in any way the power of the city to define and declare nuisances and to cause their removal or abatement by summary proceedings, or otherwise. 
(b)  If any occupant fails to comply with an order to vacate a dwelling, the inspector may file a civil action in the name of the city to remove such occupant. The action to vacate the dwelling shall be in the nature of summary ejectment and shall be commenced by filing a complaint naming as parties-defendant any person occupying such dwelling. The clerk of superior court shall issue a summons requiring the defendant to appear before a magistrate at a certain time, date and place not to exceed ten days from the issuance of the summons to answer the complaint. The summons and complaint shall be served as provided in G.S. 42-29. The summons shall be returned according to its tenor, and if on its return it appears to have been duly served, and if at the hearing the inspector produces a certified copy of an ordinance adopted by the city council pursuant to section 15-68 authorizing the officer to proceed to vacate the occupied dwelling, the magistrate shall enter judgment ordering that the premises be vacated and that all persons be removed. The judgment ordering that the dwelling be vacated shall be enforced in the same manner as the judgment for summary ejectment entered under G.S. 42-30. An appeal from any judgment entered hereunder by the magistrate may be taken as provided in G.S. 7A-228, and the execution of such judgment may be stayed as provided in G.S. 7A-227. An action to remove an occupant of a dwelling who is a tenant of the owner may not be in the nature of a summary ejectment proceeding pursuant to this paragraph unless such occupant was served with notice at least 30 days before the filing of the summary ejectment proceeding that the city council has ordered the inspector to proceed to exercise his duties under this article to vacate and close or remove and demolish the dwelling.

Sec. 17-71. - Purpose, exemptions. 
    The city council is committed to protecting the general welfare of the city through the enforcement of laws prohibiting obscenity, indecency, and sexual offenses. It seeks to reduce and eliminate the deleterious effects of sexually oriented businesses while preserving constitutionally protected forms of expression. The city council finds that sexually oriented businesses in certain locations contribute to neighborhood deterioration and blight through an increase in crime and diminution of property values, among other adverse consequences, and finds that such effects are contrary to the general welfare of the city. The city council recognizes that important and substantial government interests provide a constitutional basis for reasonable regulation of the time, place and manner under which sexually oriented businesses operate; and that, therefore, the city council has determined that persons seeking to operate sexually oriented businesses shall be required to observe specific locational requirements before they commence business, as provided for in this article. The city council finds that the licensing of sexually oriented businesses is necessary to ensure compliance with the locational and zoning requirements of such businesses. The city council finds that sexually oriented businesses in other communities have been used for unlawful sexual activities, including prostitution, and sexual encounters of a casual nature. The concern over sexually transmitted diseases is a legitimate health concern of the city. The provisions of this article shall not be construed as permitting any use, activity or structure that is otherwise prohibited, illegal or made punishable by law, nor shall it be construed so as to prohibit conduct or expression that is subject to constitutional protection.

ARTICLE II. - FALSE ALARMS 

Sec. 20-26. - Purpose and scope. 
    The purpose of this article is to encourage alarm users to assume increased responsibility for maintaining the mechanical reliability and the proper use of alarm systems, to prevent unnecessary police emergency response to false alarms, and thereby to protect the emergency response capability of the city from misuse. 
(Amend. No. 5, 11-17-98) 
Sec. 20-27. - Definitions. 
    Alarm system means any single device or assembly of equipment designed to signal the occurrence of an illegal entry or other activity requiring immediate attention and to which the police department is expected to respond, but does not include alarms installed in motor vehicles or fire alarms. 
    Alarm signal means a detectable signal, either audible or visual, generated by an alarm system, to which the police are expected to respond. 
    Alarm systems coordinator means an employee of the city designated by the chief of police to administer this article. 
    Alarm user means any person, corporation, partnership, proprietorship, governmental or educational entity or any other entity owning or leasing an alarm system, or on whose premises an alarm system is maintained for the protection of such premises. 
    Automatic dial protection device means an automatic dialing device or an automatic telephone dialing alarm system and shall include any system which, upon being activated, automatically initiates the city police department, a recorded message or code signal indicating a need for police response. 
    Chief of police means the Chief of Police of the City of Hickory or his designee. 
    False alarm means the activation of an alarm system through mechanical or electronic failure, malfunction, improper installation, or the negligence of the alarm user, his/her employees or agents, and signs activated to summon police personnel unless law enforcement response was canceled by the alarm user or his agent before police personnel arrive at the alarm location. A false alarm shall not include an alarm which can reasonably be determined to have been caused or activated by unusually violent conditions of nature nor does it include other extraordinary circumstances not reasonably subject to control by the alarm user. In addition, an alarm activated during an alarm system testing procedure shall not be considered a false alarm if the alarm user first notifies and receives permission from the user's alarm company, or designee, to test the system. An alarm is false within the meaning of this ordinance when, upon inspection by the chief of police, evidence indicates that no unauthorized entry, robbery, or other such crime was committed or attempted in or on the premises which would have activated a properly functioning alarm system. 
(Amend. No. 5, 11-17-98) 
Sec. 20-28. - Response to alarm; determination of validity. 
(a)  Police response. Whenever an alarm is activated in the city and the police department responds, a police officer on the scene of the activated alarm system will inspect the area and will determine whether the police response was in fact necessary as indicated by the alarm system or whether the alarm was a false alarm. 
(b)  Notification. If the police officer at the scene of the activated alarm system determines the alarm to be false, the officer will notify police communications to make the appropriate computer entry. An alarm user shall be notified of each false alarm determination by registered mail or other method to reduce public notification. 
(Amend. No. 5, 11-17-98) 
Sec. 20-29. - Review of false alarm determinations. 
    The alarm systems coordinator will, when requested by an alarm user, review the determination that an alarm was false. Such review shall be conducted by the alarm systems coordinator only if the alarm user requests in writing such a review within ten days of the date that the false alarm occurred. The written request for review of a false alarm determination by the alarm systems coordinator shall include the following information: 
(1)  Alarm user name. 
(2)  Address at which alarm is installed.

Sec. 29-22. - Loitering and disorderly conduct on public property. 
(a)  Purpose and intent . Generally, public property has a specific or primary purpose. Public streets are intended to be used for vehicular and some pedestrian travel. Public sidewalks are intended for pedestrian travel. Public parks normally carry a recreational use and each public building or other public parcel of land will have its own specific purpose. For some public area, use as a public assembly or public forum is an incidental use. Public places are not intended as a "place of business" for crime nor does any particular group of citizens have the right to appropriate public areas for their specific purpose and use without necessary permission. Public streets and sidewalks must remain open for public travel and law-abiding citizens must not be discouraged or intimidated from using such streets and sidewalks. There are two identifiable conditions which discourage legitimate public use of public property. Firstly, under some circumstances, unruly groups simply impede the flow of vehicular and pedestrian traffic. Secondly, soliciting for drug related activities will create public areas controlled by the criminal element of the community if allowed to go unchecked. This chapter is intended to restore the use of the streets, sidewalks and other public parks and public areas within the city to lawful use by law-abiding citizens. 
(b)  Definition . For purposes of this section, public place means any street, sidewalk, bridge, alley or alleyway, plaza, park, driveway, parking lot, transportation facility, public vehicular area as defined in G.S. § 20-4-.01, as amended from time to time, other publicly owned or leased property, school and school grounds or property, common areas of apartments or condominium communities, common areas of public housing projects, any place of business or amusement which is open to the public, or the doorways and entrances to any buildings which front on any of these places or a motor vehicle in or on any of these places, or any other place to which the public has ready access. 
(c)  Impeding traffic . 
(1)  It shall be unlawful for any person or persons to congregate with others, loiter, stand around, lounge, sit upon parked vehicles, stop or leave cars or vehicles parked or standing with the intent or under circumstances evidencing the purpose to interfere with or impeded the flow of vehicular or pedestrian traffic, to litter, to consume or use alcoholic beverages, or to otherwise disturb the public peace. 
(d)  Loitering for purposes of engaging in illegal drug activity . 
(1)  It shall be unlawful for any person or persons to loiter, remain or wander about in a public place with the intent to or in a manner and under circumstances indicating the purpose to violate any provision of the North Carolina Controlled Substances Act (G.S. ch. 90, art. 5) or any other law defining or prohibiting illegal drug activity. 
(2)  No arrest or charge is permitted under this subsection unless the circumstances establish probable cause to believe that the person intended to violate one or more of the provisions of the North Carolina Controlled Substances Act. 
(e)  A violation of this section is a misdemeanor as set forth in North Carolina General Statute Section 14-4.

Sec. 29-24. - Urban camping and improper use of public places. 
(a)  Definitions . For purposes of this section, 
    Camp shall mean residing in or using a public street, sidewalk or park for private living accommodations, such as erecting tents or other temporary structures or objects providing shelter; sleeping in a single place for any substantial prolonged period of time; regularly cooking or preparing meals; or other similar activities.

(b)  Public parks . It shall be unlawful to camp or to store personal property in any park, as defined above, owned by the city. 
(c)  Public streets . It shall be unlawful to camp, to sleep, to store personal property, to sit or to lie down on any public street as defined above. 
(d)  Other public property-Blocking ingress and egress; interfering with the normal course of business associated with the designated public property . It shall be unlawful to camp, to sleep, to store personal property, to sit or to lie down on any public property so as to interfere with ingress or egress from buildings or to interfere with the normal course of business or operations for which the buildings or properties are designated. 
(e)  Warning . No person may be arrested for violating this code section until he or she has received an oral or written warning to cease the unlawful conduct. If the violator fails to comply with the warning issued, he or she is subject to arrest for urban camping.

(8)  Persons sitting or lying down while waiting in an orderly line awaiting entry to any building, including shelters or awaiting social services, such as provision of meals; or 
(9)  Children sleeping while being carried by an accompanying person or while sitting or lying in a stroller or baby carriage. 
(10)  Camping by groups or persons with prior approval of the Hickory City Council. 
(g)  Penalty. A violation of this section is a misdemeanor as set forth in North Carolina General Statute Section 14-4.

(2)  All thoroughfares longer than 1,000 feet running generally east and west shall be designated as "avenues" and shall be titled by numbers, progressing from parallel base lines beginning at the primary intersection, except avenues in the northern portion of the southeast quadrant, between the Southern Railway tracks and First Avenue SE shall be titled by letters of the alphabet beginning with the letter "A" at the railroad tracks and progressing alphabetically south toward First Avenue SE.

(5)  In the event that a roadway could be determined to fall in more than one category of the preceding section, the city manager shall have the authority to determine which shall be the most appropriate designation, taking into consideration confusion with similar sounding names, the wishes of any developer or property owner on the roadway, and the needs of public safety and emergency response systems. 
(6)  Nothing in this section shall be construed to require that any roadway, street or avenue existing at the time of adoption of this article shall be permitted or required to be renamed other than as allowed pursuant to this article.

(1)  The requested street name appeared on a plat or official map approved the city or the county prior to its designation as a numbered street; or 
(2)  The requested street name has been in common usage as evidenced by mailing addresses, printed stationary, personalized checks or similar documentation prior to its designation as a numbered street under the uniform system; or

(7)  All fees as established in the fee schedule are submitted with the request.

(2)  The suggested name may not be one which is easily confused with the name of another street in the county in which it is located or any adjacent county, and must fit within the parameters of GIS mapping and E911 system requirements. In considering a request for a name variance, the city council shall consider recommendations from applicable public safety, planning, engineering, public works, and postal agencies concerning potential problems associated with granting a variance.

Sec. 1.14 Transitional Provisions
1.14.1 Violations Continue
Any violation of the previous zoning, subdivision or sign regulations of the city shall continue to be a violation under this Land Development Code and shall be subject to penalties and enforcement under Article 15 unless the use, development, construction or other activity is consistent with the express terms of this Land Development Code, in which case enforcement action shall cease, except to the extent of collecting penalties for violations that occurred before the effective date of this ordinance.

This section applies in addition to any established vested right a person may have, but in no case may a person add time acquired pursuant to this section to time permitted by virtue of a vested right or vice versa.
1.14.5 Plats Approved Before the Effective Date of this Ordinance
Any subdivision for which a preliminary plat was approved before the effective date of this ordinance may be recorded in accordance with the approved plat and other applicable permits and conditions, even if the subdivision does not fully comply with the provisions of this Land
City of Hickory Land Development Code (November 19, 2019) 13

2.2.8 Conditional Zoning
City of Hickory Land Development Code (November 19, 2019) 21
A. Purpose. Conditional zoning is established to provide for flexibility in the development of property while ensuring that the development is compatible with neighboring uses. Conditional zoning affords a degree of certainty in land use decisions not possible when rezoning to a general use district. Additional standards and regulations may be attached to a proposed development to ensure compatibility with the surrounding uses and with applicable adopted plans in accordance with the requirements of this section.
B. Conditional zoning districts. Conditional zoning is available for any of the general zoning classifications enumerated in this ordinance. The conditional zoning designation shall be indicated on all zoning maps and other official documents with the suffix, "(CZ)" (e.g. R-1 (CZ); C-2 (CZ)). All applications for rezoning to a Planned Development (PD) zoning district, as described in Article 5, shall be processed as conditional zoning applications.
C. General requirements. The following provisions shall apply to the administration of conditional zoning.
(1) A conditional zoning application shall be considered only upon request of the owners of all the affected property or their duly authorized representative.
(2) Prior to submittal of the application, it is strongly recommended that the applicant meet with representatives of the surrounding property owners and of the surrounding neighborhood(s) to discuss the proposed development, and include a report of any such meetings in its application.
(3) All standards and requirements of the corresponding general use zoning district shall be met, except to the extent that the conditions imposed by the conditional zoning are more restrictive than the general use standards, and/or where the requirements are modified in accordance with subsection 2.2.8(c)(6).
(4) No uses shall be permitted except those enumerated in the ordinance adopting the conditional zoning.
(5) The conditions agreed upon pursuant to the conditional zoning approval shall be stated in the adopting ordinance and may limit the uses which are permitted on the property. By way of illustration and not limitation, conditions may specify location on the property of the proposed structure(s), the number of dwelling units, the location and extent of supporting facilities such as parking lots, driveways, and access streets, the location and extent of buffer areas and other special purpose areas, the timing of development, the height of structures, the location and extent of rights-of-way and other areas to be dedicated for public purposes, and other such matters as may be identified as appropriate for the proposed development.
(6) Minor modifications to the approved conditional zoning ordinance may be approved by the planning and development director. Such modifications shall be limited to the following:
(a) An increase of up to 10 percent in the number of parking spaces required by Sec. 9.2.2.

During such period, the Historic Preservation Commission or its agent shall negotiate with the owner and with any other parties in an effort to find a means of preserving the building, structure, or site.

OI districts providing transitional areas are generally characterized as smaller sites allowing for small-scale offices.
E. Central Business District
The Central Business District (C-1) implements the Central Business District policies of the Hickory by Choice 2030 Comprehensive Plan. The C-1 is intended to preserve and enhance downtown Hickorys role as a commercial, financial, cultural and governmental center. In recognition of the downtown areas historic building pattern and the communitys planning goals, the C-1 district is intended to be a physically predictable, pedestrian oriented environment. The standards that apply in the district are intended to create and maintain an appealing environment for people who work and live downtown, as well as those who come to the area for goods, services, entertainment or leisure.
F. General Business District
The General Business (C-2) district implements the General Business policies of the Hickory by Choice 2030 Comprehensive Plan.

94 City of Hickory Land Development Code (November 19, 2019)
Article 6 Use Regulations
Sec. 6.1 Use Table
6.1.1 [P] Permitted Uses
A P indicates that a use is permitted by right in the respective zoning district, subject to compliance with all other applicable regulations of this Land Development Code.
6.1.2 [S] Special Uses
An S indicates that a use is allowed only if reviewed and approved in accordance with the Special Use procedures of Sec. 2.4.
6.1.3 [AC] Accessory Uses
The abbreviation AC indicates that a use is allowed only as an accessory use in the respective zoning district. For additional information on accessory uses, see Sec. 6.3.
6.1.4 Uses Not Allowed
A blank cell (one that doesnt contain an S or P) indicates that the listed use is not allowed in the respective zoning district, unless it is otherwise expressly allowed by other regulations of this Land Development Code.
6.1.5 Classification of Uses
A. Considerations
(1) Uses are assigned to the category whose description most closely describes the nature of the primary use. Article 14 defines each use category. Developments may have more than one primary use. Developments may also have one or more accessory uses. Developments with more than one primary use are addressed in Sec. 6.1.6.
(2) The following items are considered to determine what use category in which a use is placed, and whether the activities constitute primary uses or accessory uses:
(a) The description of the activity(ies) in relationship to the characteristics of each use category;
(b) The relative amount of site or floor space and equipment devoted to the activity;
(c) The relative amounts of sales from each activity;
(d) The customer type for each activity;
(e) The relative number of employees in each activity;
(f) Hours of operation;
(g) Building and site arrangement;
(h) Vehicles used with the activity;
(i) The relative number of vehicle trips generated by the activity;
(j) Signs;
(k) How the use advertises itself; and
(l) Whether the activity would be likely to be found independent of the other activities on the site.
6.1.6 Developments with Multiple Primary Uses
City of Hickory Land Development Code (November 19, 2019) 95
When all of the primary uses of a development fall within one use category, then the development is assigned to that use category. For example, a development that contains a retail bakery and a café would be classified in the Retail Sales and Service category because all the primary uses are in that category. When the primary uses of a development fall within different use categories, each primary use is classified in the applicable category and is subject to the standards for that category.
6.1.7 Unlisted Uses (TA 18-01)
If an application is submitted for a use type that is not listed in the use table of this section, the Planning Director shall be authorized to classify the new or unlisted use type into an existing land use category that most closely fits the new or unlisted use.
6.1.8 Standards and Conditions
Some uses in some zoning districts are subject to special use-specific conditions and standards. These standards and conditions are indicated by bracketed numbers[1] or by a cross-reference in the final column of the table. Cross references refer to detailed standards that apply to the listed use type. Bracketed numbers refer to conditions that immediately follow the use table.

are installed in accordance with the provisions of this subsection shall not be deemed to constitute the expansion of a nonconforming use or structure.
E. Special Use Criteria. The following criteria shall be used in deciding whether to approve the siting of new towers that require Special Use approval:
(1) Evidence that the applicant has investigated the reasonable feasibility of collocating new antennas and equipment on an existing structure or structures within the applicants search ring. Collocation on an existing structure is not feasible if the applicant demonstrates that collocation is technically or commercially impractical or the owner of a tower is unwilling to enter into a contract for such use at fair market value. Such evidence shall consist of:
(a) Copies of letters sent to owners of all existing towers within a one-mile radius of the proposed site, requesting the following information:
i. tower height;
ii. existing and planned tower users;
iii. whether the existing tower could accommodate the proposed antenna without causing instability or radio frequency interference; and
iv. if the proposed antenna cannot be accommodated on the existing tower, an assessment of whether the existing tower could be structurally strengthened or whether the antennas transmitters and related equipment could be protected from electromagnetic interference, and a general description of the means and projected cost of shared use of the existing tower
(b) A copy of all responses within 30 days from the mailing date of the letter required by subsection (a).
(c) A summary explanation of why the applicant believes the proposed facility cannot be located on an existing tower.
(d) A summary explanation of why the applicant believes that the use of an alternative tower structure is not possible.
(2) Buffering and screening of the site shall be installed in accordance with Sec. 9.13 In order to provide spatial separation and create visual block from adjacent properties and streets, a buffer shall be installed around the outside of all improvements on the site, including the tower and guy anchors, any ground buildings or equipment, and security fencing. Ground buildings located in a residential district may be located outside the buffered area if they are constructed so the exterior appearance of the building has the appearance of a residential dwelling, including pitched roof and frame or brick veneer construction. The applicant shall submit scaled elevations of such buildings to assist in the evaluation of compliance with this standard. The towers guy anchors may be screened or fenced separately in order to comply with the requirements of this subsection.
(3) All roof mounted antenna and equipment located on a building in the C-1, NC, CC-1, and CC-2 zoning districts shall be screened from view.
(4) The base of the tower and each guy anchor shall be surrounded by a security fence or wall at least 8 feet in height unless the tower and all guy anchors are mounted entirely on a building over eight feet in height. The towers guy anchors may be screened or fenced separately in order to comply with the requirements of this subsection.
114 City of Hickory Land Development Code (November 19, 2019)
(5) No outside storage shall be allowed on any telecommunication facility site.
(6) Associated buildings located in any residential district shall not be used as an employment center for any worker. This provision does not prohibit the periodic maintenance or periodic monitoring of equipment and instruments.

(9) The color of the tower shall be neutral, except to the extent required by Federal law, so as to minimize its visual impact.
(10) No commercial advertising shall be allowed on the tower or its related facilities.
(11) The base of the tower shall be set back from all adjacent property lines one foot for each foot in height. This setback may be reduced by the Planning Commission upon a finding that failure to grant a setback reduction would have the effect of prohibiting the provision of personal wireless service, that the reduction serves the general intent and purpose of this Land Development Code and the adopted Land Development Plan, and that the reduction will not substantially interfere with or injure the rights of others whose property would be affected by the reduced setback. To encourage shared use of towers, applications for towers which will operate with more than one user immediately upon completion may have a 10% reduction in the required setbacks. Also, to encourage the construction of monopole structures, monopole towers may have a 20% reduction in the required setbacks. To encourage location of towers in forested areas with a minimum depth of 65 feet, the tower may have a 20% reduction in the required setbacks. In no case shall the setback be less than those required for the underlying zoning district Said setback reductions shall only be allowed upon a professional engineering certification which states that the structure's construction will cause the tower to crumble inward so that in the event of collapse, no damage to structures on adjacent zoning lots will result.
(12) Notice shall be provided to the Planning Director when the tower is placed out of service. Towers that are not used for a period of 6 months or more shall be removed by the owner within 120 days of receipt by the City of notification to that effect.

Sec. 7.4 Measurements, Computations and Exceptions
7.4.1 Lot Area
A. Measurement. The area of a lot shall include the total horizontal surface area within the lots boundaries, not including submerged lands, roadways or rights-of-way.
B. Multiple Zoning Districts. If a zoning lot includes different zoning districts, the minimum lot area requirements for each district shall be met.
7.4.2 Lot Width
Minimum lot width shall be measured between side lot lines along a line that is parallel to the street lot line or its chord. Measurements of lot width shall be made at the minimum street setback line. When a lot has more than one street setback line, lot width shall be measured along the street setback line with the narrower width. In all cases, the width between side lot lines at their intersection with street lot lines shall be at least 25 feet.
7.4.3 Density (TA 18-01)
A. Residential
(1) Measurement. Maximum density refers to the maximum number of dwelling units allowed per acre of site area..
(2) Calculation. To calculate the number of dwelling units allowed on a parcel, multiply the acreage by the maximum density standard of the zoning district, with the understanding the actual density may be reduced due to infrastructure construction, and site development related items.
(3) Rounding. When density calculations result in fractions, fractions of 0.5 (½) or greater shall be rounded to the next highest whole number; fractions of less than 0.5 shall be rounded down to the next lowest whole number.
B. Non-Residential and Mixed-Use (TA 18-01) (TA 19-01)
(1) Measurement. Maximum density refers to the maximum amount of floor area allowed per acre of a development site. For non-residential and mixed-use development, maximum floor area is expressed by floor area ratio (FAR).
(2) Calculation. To calculate the floor area allowed on a parcel, the total acreage is multiplied by the maximum floor area ratio of the zoning district, with the understanding the actual density may be reduced due to infrastructure construction, and site development related items.
(3) Rounding. When density calculations result in fractions, fractions of 0.5 (½) or greater shall be rounded to the next highest whole number; fractions of less than 0.5 shall be rounded down to the next lowest whole number.
7.4.4 Setbacks
A. Measurements. Setbacks refer to the unobstructed, unoccupied open area between the furthermost projection of a structure and the property line of the lot on which the structure is located. Setbacks shall be unobstructed from the ground to the sky except as specified in this subsection.
B. Street Setbacks. Street setbacks shall extend the full width of a lot and shall be measured from the street lot line.
City of Hickory 129 Land Development Code (November 19, 2019)
C. Side Setbacks. Side setbacks shall extend from the required street setback line to the required rear setback line and be measured from the side lot line. If no street or rear setback is required, the required setback area shall run to the opposite lot line. Side setbacks on through lots shall run the full length between street lot lines.
D. Rear Setbacks. Rear setbacks shall extend the full width of the lot and be measured from the rear lot line. If a corner lot has more than 4 sides, the yards along the interior lot lines that do not intersect a street line shall be considered rear yards.
E. Special Yards. A special yard, for purposes of these regulations, shall be construed as a yard other than adjacent to a street, required to perform the same functions as a side or rear yard, but adjacent to a lot line so placed or oriented that neither the term, "side yard" nor the term, "rear yard", as generally determined, defined or applied with respect to regular lots, fits the circumstances of the case. In such instances, the special yard shall be considered a rear yard unless the Planning Director determines that side yard requirements of the district shall apply because of the relationship of the portion of the lot on which the yard is to be located to the adjoining lot or lots, with due regard to the orientation of structures and buildable areas thereof.
F. Waterfront Yards
(1) Waterfront yards are yards adjacent to waterways that are 50 feet or more in average width adjacent to the yard. Lots having one or more such waterfront yards shall be considered waterfront lots.
(2) Where a waterfront yard is required on a lot, the requirement shall be construed as replacing yard requirements otherwise applicable to the portion of the lot involved.
(3) Depth of required waterfront yards shall be measured perpendicular to the actual waterfront line, provided, however, that in the case of irregularities in such line, such projections, curves or chords may be used as are reasonably necessary to achieve a regular outer boundary for the yard, as well as reasonable in relation to the general pattern of waterfront yards on adjoining lots.
(4) The minimum required depth for waterfront yards shall be 35 feet, provided that the lot width may be measured at the rear setback line. Boathouses, gazebos, docks, pier structures, davits and similar structures may occupy up to 30% of the required waterfront yard.
G. Projections/Encroachments. The following features may project in required setbacks to the extent indicated.
(1) Architectural features, such as, but not limited to, cornices, chimneys, eaves, stoops and gutters, may project no more than 3 feet into the required street setback, 5 feet into the required rear setback and 2 feet into the required side setback.
(2) Mechanical equipment, such as air conditioning units, heat pumps, heating equipment, solar panels, and similar installations, may not project into the required street setback, but may project 5 feet into the required rear setback and 2 feet into the required side setback.
(3) Structural or mechanical devices added to make such structures accessible to physically disadvantaged persons may encroach into required setbacks and buffers.
(4) Unenclosed porches and decks may encroach into the required front and/or rear yard for a distance of not more than 20% of the required setback. For the purpose of this section, a porch or deck enclosed in wire screen, or similar material, shall not be considered an enclosed porch or deck.
7.4.5 Setback Averaging
City of Hickory Land Development Code (November 19, 2019) 130
Where the average of the street setbacks for all lots located within 50 feet of either side of a lot is less than the minimum required front setback, the required setback line may be reduced to this lesser average depth, but in no case, to less than 10 feet. For the purpose of computing such average, a vacant lot shall be considered as having the minimum street setback required for the zoning district.
7.4.6 Setbacks along Thoroughfares. (TA 18-01)
A. When development of parcels along roadways shown for future improvement in the adopted thoroughfare plan occurs, consideration should be given to provide for additional setback along such roadways to accommodate the outlined future improvements.
7.4.7 Building Height (TA 19-01)
A. Measurement. Building height shall be measured as the vertical distance from the mean elevation at the finished grade along the front of the structure to the highest point of the structure or to the highest point of a flat or mansard roof or to the mean height between the eaves and ridge for a pitched roof in the case of buildings.
B. Exceptions. Except as specifically provided herein, the height limitations of this Land Development Code shall not apply to any roof structures for housing elevators, stairways, tanks, ventilating fans, solar energy collectors, or similar equipment required to operate and maintain a building, provided that such structures shall not cover more than 33% of roof area or extend over 10 feet in height; nor to church spires, steeples, belfries, cupolas, domes, monuments, water towers, skylights, vents, construction or mining cranes or draglines, or similar structures, which may be erected above the height limit, nor to fire or parapet walls provided, however, that such walls shall not extend more than 5 feet above the roof.
C. Aviation Hazards. No building or other structure, regardless of the height exceptions set forth in this subsection, shall be located in a manner or built to a height that constitutes a hazard to aviation or creates hazards to persons or property by reason of unusual exposure to aviation hazards.
D. Tall Structures. Unless expressly stated otherwise elsewhere in this Land Development Code, towers that are principal structures in themselves, such as high voltage transmission line towers, grain elevators, silos and other such agricultural uses and similar principal structures, may only exceed the height limitations established for the district wherein they are proposed for relocation following review by the Planning Commission as a Special Use Permit in accordance with Sec. 2.4. A zoning compliance permit may only be granted where the Planning Commission finds:
(1) That the proposed structure would not result in restriction or interference with air traffic or air travel to or from any existing or proposed airport.
(2) That the proposed structure is consistent with the existing surrounding uses, and is compatible with the existing neighborhood development.
(3) That the proposed structure is consistent with the Hickory by Choice 2030 Comprehensive Plan.
(4) That the proposed structure is not detrimental to the existing or proposed use of any neighboring property, and does not unreasonably restrict the free flow of light, sunlight and air to those properties.

B. Schedule B
Schedule B uses have widely varying parking demands, making it difficult to specify a single requirement. The off-street parking requirement for such uses shall be established by the Planning Director based on estimates of parking demand, which may include recommendations of the Institute of Traffic Engineers (ITE), data collected from uses that are the same or comparable to the proposed use, or other relevant information. The Planning Director may require that the applicant submit a parking study that provides analysis and justification for the proposed number of spaces to be provided. Parking studies shall document the source of data used to develop the recommendations. The Planning Director shall review the submitted study along with any other traffic engineering and planning data that are appropriate and establish the off-street parking or loading requirements for the use proposed.
9.2.3 Off-Street Loading (TA 18-01)
A. Off-street loading space shall be provided for all non-residential uses that contain a gross floor area of 40,000 square feet, or greater.
B. Minimum Dimensions
Each loading space shall be at least twelve (12) feet wide by twenty-five (25) feet long, with at least fourteen (14) feet of overhead clearance. Each required loading space shall have adequate, unobstructed means for the ingress and egress of vehicles.
C. Waiver or Modification of Requirements
As part of the review and approval of a site plan, the Planning Director may waive or modify the requirements of this section upon finding that the use does not require loading spaces of a number or size required by this section, given the particular operational characteristics of the use and its need or lack thereof for the delivery or shipments of goods to and from the site.
D. Location and Screening of Loading Areas
To the maximum extent possible, all loading berths shall be located between the building and the rear lot line of the property, and/or shall be screened from the view of the street and adjacent properties. Such screening shall consist of dense evergreen landscaping, raised berms, or masonry walls that are architecturally compatible to the building. The planning director may approve an alternative screening mechanism provided that it meets or exceeds the objectives of this Land Development Code
9.2.4 Rules for Computing Parking and Loading Requirements
The following rules shall apply when computing the number of parking and loading spaces required under this section.
A. Fractions
When calculation of the number of required spaces results in a fractional number, a fraction of less than .5 shall be disregarded and a fraction of .5 or more shall be rounded to the next highest whole number.
City of Hickory 153 Land Development Code (November 19, 2019)
B. Distances
Distances shall be measured between nearest off-street parking facility and nearest primary entrance of the building or use to be served.
C. Multiple Uses
When 2 or more uses or separate establishments are located within the same development, off-street parking shall be provided for each use or separate establishment unless an Alternative Parking Plan is approved under the provisions of Section 9.2.7, or the property is developed as a Conditional Zone. If one or more uses within a multi-use development are of a size that would otherwise exempt them from compliance with off-street parking requirements, only one such exemption shall be permitted to be taken for the entire development.
D. Floor Area
(1) Unless otherwise expressly stated, all square footage-based off-street parking and loading standards shall be computed on the basis of the sum of the gross horizontal floor areas of all the floors of a building or structure, measured from the exterior faces of exterior walls or from the centerline of walls separating 2 buildings or structures, but excluding stairwells and elevator shafts at each floor and floors or parts of floors devoted exclusively to vehicular parking or loading.
(2) When more than 20 percent of the floor area on a site is in an accessory use, the parking for the accessory use is calculated separately. An example would be a 30,000 square foot building with 20,000 square foot warehouse and a 10,000 square foot accessory office area. The required parking for the office and warehouse would be calculated separately.
E. Seating
When seating consists of benches, pews or other similar seating facilities, each 20 linear inches of seating space shall be counted as 1 seat. Where parking requirements relate to movable seating in auditoriums and other assembly rooms, 15 square feet of net floor area shall be construed to be equal to one seat, except where otherwise specified. Net floor area shall be the actual area occupied by seating and related aisles, and shall not include accessory unoccupied areas or the thickness of walls.
F. Employees, Students and Other Occupants
For the purpose of computing parking requirements based on the number of employees, students, residents or occupants, calculations shall be based on the largest number of persons working on any single shift, the maximum enrollment or the maximum fire-rated or licensed capacity, whichever is applicable.
G. New and Unlisted Uses
Upon receiving a development application for a use not listed in the parking and loading schedules of this section, the Planning Director shall apply the standards of the listed use that is deemed most similar to the use proposed or require that a parking study be submitted pursuant to Sec. 9.2.2B.
H. Bicycle Parking
Bicycle parking may substitute for up to ten percent of required parking. For every five secure bicycle parking spaces provided, the motor vehicle parking requirement is reduced by one space. Existing parking may be converted to take advantage of this provision.
City of Hickory Land Development Code (November 19, 2019) 154
9.2.5 Use of Required Off-Street Parking Spaces
A. Required off-street parking spaces may be used only for parking licensed, operable, motor vehicles.
B. Required spaces may not be used for the display of goods for sale or lease, except in compliance with a temporary or seasonal use permit, for motor vehicle repair or service work of any kind, or for long-term storage of recreational vehicles, boats, motor homes, campers, mobile homes, or building materials.
C. No buildings other than those for shelter of attendants for the off-street parking area shall be erected or placed upon off-street parking areas. Attendant buildings may have a maximum gross floor area of 50 square feet and a maximum height of 15 feet.
9.2.6 Parking on Unpaved Surfaces Prohibited
No person shall keep, store or park any motor vehicle or trailer, whether operable or inoperable, on any portion of a front yard or any side corner yard facing a street except on a paved surface that is used as a driveway or approved off-street parking area to the property.
9.2.7 Alternative Parking Plans
A. Scope
An Alternative Parking Plan represents a proposal to meet vehicle parking and transportation access needs by means other than providing parking in accordance with the ratios established in Sec. 9.2.2. Alternative Parking Plans may not be used to reduce required setbacks, landscaping or screening of off-street parking areas.
B. Applicability
Applicants who wish to provide fewer off-street parking spaces than required pursuant to Sec. 9.2.2 or provide parking on a remote site shall be required to secure approval of an Alternative Parking Plan in accordance with the standards of this section.
C. Review and Approval Procedure
(1) The Planning Director shall be authorized to approve, approve with conditions, or deny Alternative Parking Plans for developments that will provide at least 80 percent of the required number of off-street parking spaces.
(2) All other Alternative Parking Plans shall require review and approval in accordance with the Special Use procedures of Sec. 2.4.
(3) In order to approve an Alternative Parking Plan, the Decision-Making Body must determine that the proposed plan will protect surrounding neighborhoods, maintain traffic circulation patterns and promote quality urban design as would strict compliance with otherwise applicable off-street parking standards.
D. Contents
Alternative Parking Plans shall be submitted in a form established by the Planning Director and made available to the public. At a minimum, such plans shall include maps that detail the type of alternative proposed and the rationale behind the proposal.
E. Recording
Approved Alternative Parking Plans shall be recorded in the office of the County Register of Deeds where the property is located. No building permits or certificates of occupancy shall be issued until proof of recordation of the agreement has been presented to the Planning Director.
City of Hickory 155 Land Development Code (November 19, 2019)
F. Violations and Revocation
Any modification or waiver of off-street parking approved under an Alternative Parking Plan shall remain valid only as long as the conditions warranting the modification or waiver exist. If such conditions are deemed to no longer exist, the alternative parking plan approval shall be revoked. Revocation of an Alternative Parking Plan shall not preclude other remedies and enforcement actions available under this Land Development Code. The Zoning Compliance Permit or Special Use Permit covering such approval shall include the requirements that the permit is valid only so long as the conditions described in the application for the permit exist.
G. Eligible Alternatives
A number of specific parking and access alternatives are described below. The Planning Director shall, however, be authorized to consider and approve other alternatives to providing off-street parking spaces on the site of the subject development if the applicant demonstrates to the satisfaction of the Planning Director that the proposed plan will do at least as good of job protecting surrounding neighborhoods, maintaining traffic circulation patterns and promoting quality urban design as would strict compliance with otherwise applicable off-street parking standards.
(1) Shared Parking
Shared parking spaces may occur where two or more uses on the same or separate sites are able to share the same parking spaces because their parking demands occur at different times. Shared use of required nonresidential parking spaces is allowed if the following documentation is submitted in writing to the planning director as part of a building or zoning permit application or land use review:
(a) The names and addresses of the uses and of the owners or tenants that are sharing the parking.
(b) The location and number of parking spaces that are being shared.
(c) An analysis showing that the peak parking times of the uses occur at different times and that the parking area will be large enough for the anticipated demands of both uses; and
(d) A legal instrument such as an easement or deed restriction that guarantees access to the parking for both uses.
(2) Remote Parking
The Planning Director may permit all or a portion of required off-street parking to be located on a separate lot (from the use served), subject to the standards of this section.
(a) Location
No Remote parking space shall be located more than 600 feet from the boundary of the lot containing the use to be served by the parking. This distance limitation may be waived the Planning Director if adequate assurances are offered that van or shuttle service will be operated between the remote lot and the principal use.
(b) Zoning Classification
Remote parking areas shall be considered accessory to the principal use that the parking spaces are intended to serve. Parking areas shall require the same or a more intensive zoning classification than that required for the most intensive of the uses served by the remote parking area,
City of Hickory Land Development Code (November 19, 2019) 156
provided that remote parking facilities may be located in any zoning districts that allow commercial parking lots.
(c) Remote Parking Agreement
If a remote parking area is not under the same ownership as the principal use served, a written agreement among the owners of record shall be required.
(d) Application
Remote Parking Agreements shall be submitted in a form established by the Planning Director. At a minimum, such plans shall detail the type of alternative proposed and the rationale behind the proposal.
(3) Valet Parking
The Decision-Making Body may authorize valet parking as a means of satisfying some or all of otherwise applicable off-street parking standards.
(4) Transportation Demand Management Plan
The Planning Director may authorize a reduction in the number of required off-street parking spaces for large developments or uses (those otherwise required to provide more than 100 parking spaces) that institute and commit to maintain a Transportation Demand Management program, in accordance with the standards of this section.
(a) Required Study
The applicant shall submit a study to the Decision-Making Body clearly indicating the types of transportation demand management activities and measures proposed. The study shall be provided in a form established by the Planning Director.
(b) Transportation Management Activities
There shall be no limitation on the types of transportation management activities for which reductions may be granted from otherwise required off-street parking ratios. The following measures shall serve as a guide to eligible transportation management activities.
(c) Posting and Distribution of Information
The distribution and posting of information from transit agencies and other sources of alternative transportation may be cause for a reduction in otherwise applicable off-street parking requirements.
(d) Transportation Coordinator
The appointment of a Transportation Coordinator with responsibility for disseminating information on ride-sharing and other transportation options may be cause for a reduction in otherwise applicable off-street parking requirements. In addition to acting as liaisons, Transportation Coordinators must be available to attend meetings and training sessions with the city or transit providers.
(e) Off-Peak Work Hours
Employers that institute off-peak work schedules, allowing employees to arrive at times other than the peak morning commute period may be eligible for a reduction in otherwise applicable off-street parking requirements. The peak morning commute period is defined as 7:309:00 a.m., and the peak p.m. period is defined as 4:00-6:00 p.m.
City of Hickory 157 Land Development Code (November 19, 2019)
(f) Preferential Parking
The provision of specially marked spaces for each registered car pool and vanpool may be cause for a reduction in otherwise applicable off-street parking requirements.
(g) Financial Incentives
The provision of cash or in-kind financial incentives for employees commuting by car pool, vanpool and transit may be cause for a reduction in otherwise applicable parking requirements.

an alternative landscape plan, as outlined in Section 9.13.8.
City of Hickory 173 Land Development Code (November 19, 2019)
9.13.8 Alternative Methods of Compliance
A. The Planning Commission, by means of a Special Use Permit in accordance with Sec. 2.4, shall have the authority to waive or reduce the requirements of Sec. 9.13, Landscaping and Screening provided that the alternative landscape plan meets or exceeds the objectives of this Land Development Code.
B. Perimeter buffer requirements between properties may be reduced or eliminated by a legal agreement between the property owners and the City of Hickory provided that the agreement runs with the land and is recorded with the appropriate countys Register of Deeds.
9.13.9 Plant Specifications
A. Plant Species
Plants shall be chosen from the recommended plant species lists in the Manual of Practice. Plants which are not on the list may be used if approved by the Planning Director upon a showing that the proposed plants will likely achieve the objectives of this section as well as or better than plants listed in the Manual of Practice. Invasive, exotic plant species (see chart in Manual of Practice) shall not be used to meet the landscape requirements of this Land Development Code.
B. For the purpose of measuring required canopy trees for this section, the caliper of a tree is the diameter measured six (6) inches above the ground, if that measurement does not exceed four (4) inches. If the measurement does exceed four (4) inches, the measurement is taken twelve (12) inches above the ground.

Sec. 9.16 Underground Utilities
9.16.1 Underground Utilities  Purpose and Intent
The appearance of the streets in the Hickory Regional Planning Area is an important part of the image of the City of Hickory. Aerial utilities add to the visual clutter along these streets and thereby detract from the aesthetics of the community. It is the intent of the City of Hickory to require all new utility distribution and service lines in the community to be placed underground.
9.16.2 Definitions
For purposes of this section the following definitions shall apply:
City of Hickory 177 Land Development Code (November 19, 2019)
A. Distribution line: Any utility line less than 300 feet in length providing connection between transmission lines and service lines to a new building, parcel or subdivision. Distribution line may also include feeder lines and sub-feeders.
B. Service Line: Any utility line that connects a distribution line to an end user. Service line may also include tap lines and service drops.
C. Transmission line: Any utility line intended to move large qualities of utility service from generation sources to distribution lines. These lines do not provide direct service to adjoining property.
9.16.3 Permit Required for Utility Crossings of Public Streets and Other Property
All new utility distribution line and service line crossings of public rights of way and property shall be placed underground.
A. No new public utility distribution or service line shall cross any public right of way within the Hickory Regional Planning Area without first obtaining a written permit from the City Engineer, or his designee, and without complying strictly with the provisions of the permit and of this Ordinance.
B. Public utilities including: cable TV, natural gas, electric and telephone companies or any other company that provides a commodity through a system of transmission that remains in place to provide the item or service created to ultimate consumers, may submit written specifications they will follow for the review and approval of the City Engineer. The City Engineer may issue a city-wide permit. Upon receiving approval, the service provider shall not be required to obtain a permit for routine underground crossings of public rights-of-way or property as long as such work is done in strict accordance with the approved specifications. Failure to comply with the approved specifications is a violation of this Ordinance.
C. All distribution systems, whether wire, pipeline, coaxial, fiber-optic cable or other, shall be underground unless unfeasibility of such installation has been documented and the documentation accepted as satisfactory by the Planning Director.
D. In making this decision on the adequacy of the documentation and appropriateness of the request, the Planning Director shall consider the following factors:
(1) Terrain;
(2) Impacts on other customers,
(3) Load characteristics;
(4) Reliability;
(5) Accessibility;
(6) System flexibility;
(7) Equipment availability;
(8) Safety;
(9) Timing; and
(10) Excessive conflicts with other utilities.
9.16.4 Underground Utilities  On-site Service
Within any new development, all utilities installed to serve the project shall be placed underground without expense to the City. Such utilities shall be underground from the point they enter the site and shall include but not be limited to pad mounted or subterranean transformers, secondary electrical, telephone, fiber optic, and cablevision distribution lines. Underground
City of Hickory Land Development Code (November 19, 2019) 178
secondary electrical services shall originate from a ground mounted or subterranean electrical transformer. Ground mounted transformers shall be located off the public right-of-way.
9.16.5 Underground Utilities  Off-site Service
All distribution lines or service lines providing direct customer service to an individual lot or subdivision shall be brought to the site underground including crossing public rights of way or property without expense to the City. Such lines shall not be required to be placed underground, however, if the distance of such placement will exceed 300 feet.
9.16.6 Underground Utilities  Required Road Improvements
All existing service lines or distribution lines providing direct customer service to an individual lot or subdivision running parallel to and installed or relocated in conjunction with construction of a new roadway or widening of an existing roadway to service the development which involves the relocation of power lines and poles shall be located underground.
9.16.7 Exemptions
Aerial crossings of public rights of way shall be permitted for service lines providing electrical service to a single lot/single family home. However, service lines from the right of way to the home shall be placed under ground.
City of Hickory 179 Land Development Code (November 19, 2019)
Article 10 Signs
Sec. 10.1 General
10.1.1 Purposes
The purposes of these sign regulations are to:
A. Permit the effective use of signs as a means of communication;
B. Maintain and enhance the aesthetic environment and the ability of the city to attract sources of economic development and growth;
C. Maintain pedestrian and traffic safety and minimize the distractions, hazards and obstructions caused by signs;
D. Minimize the possible adverse effects of signs on nearby public and private property;
E. Enable the fair and consistent enforcement of these sign regulations; and
F. Ensure that the constitutionally guaranteed right of free speech is protected.
10.1.2 Applicability
Unless otherwise expressly exempted, the sign regulations of this article shall be binding upon every owner of a building or property, every lessee, and every person responsible for or who causes the construction, repair, relocation, or alteration of any sign in the City of Hickory. Signs may be erected, placed, established, painted, created or maintained only in conformance with the provisions of this article.
10.1.3 Permits Required
Unless otherwise expressly exempted, no sign may be erected or structurally altered until a Zoning Compliance Permit has been obtained in accordance with Sec. 2.6.
10.1.4 Computations and Measurements
A. Number of Signs
For the purpose of determining the number of signs, a sign shall be considered to be a single display surface or display device containing elements organized, related and composed to form a unit. Where matter is displayed in a random manner without organized relationship of units, where strings of lights are used, or where there is a reasonable doubt about relationship of elements, each element or light shall be considered to be a single sign. For back-to-back signs or those with an interior angle no greater than 15 degrees, both surfaces shall be considered to be a single sign. In the case of v-type or double-faced signs with an interior angle greater than 15 degrees, the entire surface shall be considered to be a single sign.
B. Sign Area of Individual Signs (TA 18-01)
The surface area of a sign shall be computed as including the entire area within a parallelogram, triangle, circle, semi-circle or other regular geometric figure, including all of the elements of the display, but not including any blank masking border (a plain strip, bearing no advertising matter around the edge of a sign), frames, display or identification or licensing officially required by any governmental body, or structural elements outside the sign surface and bearing no advertising matter. The width of the masking border or sign frame structure shall not extend beyond the maximum surface area more than 6 inches. In the instance of projecting signs, the area of all surfaces shall be considered when determining the total permissible area.
City of Hickory Land Development Code (November 19, 2019) 180
C. Area of Double-Faced Signs
Where the sign faces of a double-faced sign are parallel or the interior angle formed by the faces is 15 degrees or less, only 1 display face shall be counted in computing sign area. If the 2 faces of a double-faced sign are of unequal area, the area of the larger sign face shall be counted as the sign's area. In the case of signs with an interior angle greater than 15 degrees, cylindrical signs, signs in the shape of cubes, or other signs that are substantially three-dimensional with respect to their display surfaces, the entire display surface or surfaces shall be included in computations of sign area.
D. Embellishments
In the case of embellishments (display portions of signs extending outside the general display area), surface area extending outside the general display area and bearing advertising material shall be computed separately as part of the total surface area of the sign.
E. Height and Clearance
The overall height of the sign or sign structure is measured from the normal grade to the highest point of the sign or sign structure (see Figure 10-1). Clearance is measured from the normal grade to bottom of the sign structure enclosing the sign face. Normal grade shall be construed to be the existing grade prior to construction, or newly established grade after construction, exclusive of any filling, berming, mounding or excavating solely for the purpose of locating the sign. In cases where the normal grade cannot reasonably be determined or where the normal grade is below the grade at street level, sign height shall be computed on the assumption that the elevation of the normal grade at the base of the sign is equal to the elevation of the nearest point of the crown of a public street.
Figure 10-1: Sign Heights and Clearance
10.1.5 Signs Exempt from Regulation (TA 18-01)

Article 12 Nonconformities
Sec. 12.1 General
12.1.1 Scope
The regulations of this article govern uses, structures, lots, signs and other situations that came into existence legally but that do not conform to one or more requirements of this Land Development Code.
12.1.2 Intent
A. In order to encourage redevelopment consistent with this Land Development Code and provide property owners with reasonable use of their land, it is the general policy of the city to allow uses, structures, signs and lots that came into existence legally in conformance with then-applicable requirements to continue to exist and be put to productive use, but to bring as many aspects of such situations into compliance with existing regulations as is reasonably possible. This article establishes regulations governing uses, structures and lots that were lawfully established but that do not conform to one or more requirements of this Land Development Code.
B. A situation that did not constitute a lawful, nonconforming situation under the previously adopted zoning ordinance does not achieve lawful nonconforming status under this chapter merely by the repeal of the prior ordinance or regulation.
C. The regulations are further intended to:
(1) recognize the interests of property owners in continuing to use their property;
(2) promote reuse and rehabilitation of existing buildings; and
(3) place reasonable limits on the expansion and alteration of nonconformities that have the potential to adversely affect surrounding properties or the community as a whole.
12.1.3 Authority to Continue
Any lawful nonconformity that legally existed as of the effective date of this Land Development Code or that becomes nonconforming upon the adoption of any amendment to this Land Development Code may be continued in accordance with the provisions of this article. If such use is discontinued for a period of one hundred and eighty days, such nonconformity shall be deemed to have been abandoned and shall not be continued in the future except in conformance with the provisions of this Land Development Code.
12.1.4 Determination of Nonconformity Status
The burden of establishing that a nonconformity is a legal nonconformity shall, in all cases be solely upon the owner of such nonconformity.
12.1.5 Repairs and Maintenance
A. Incidental repairs and normal maintenance of nonconformities shall be permitted unless such repairs are otherwise expressly prohibited by this Land Development Code. For the purpose of this provision, repair or replacement of non-load bearing walls, fixtures, wiring or plumbing shall be considered incidental repairs if the total value of the repairs in any 12-month period does not exceed 50 percent of the current replacement value of the structure.
B. Nothing in this article shall be construed to prevent structures from being structurally strengthened or restored to a safe condition, in accordance with an official order of a public official. When improvements are made to restore the property to a safe condition, the cost of such repairs or alterations shall not be included in the 50% noted in the preceding paragraph.

The status of a nonconformity is not affected by changes of tenancy, ownership, or management.
12.1.7 Cost Estimates
In making determinations regarding replacement value, the Planning Director shall use the Dodge Reports, Marshall Swift, or their successors, as a basic reference.
Sec. 12.2 Nonconforming Uses
12.2.1 Definition
A nonconforming use is a use that was legally established but which is no longer allowed by the use regulations of the zoning district in which it is located. A use that was legally established without a Special Use Permit shall not be deemed nonconforming solely because a Special Use Permit is now required for the subject use. Enlargement, replacement or modification of the subject use resulting in an expansion of more than 500 square feet of building area, the expansion of the site to include additional property or the addition of more than 20 parking stalls shall require approval of a Special Use Permit, just as if it were a new special use application.
12.2.2 Expansion
A. A nonconforming use shall not be enlarged or expanded unless one of the following conditions exists:
(1) such expansion eliminates or reduces the nonconforming aspects of the situation;
(2) the expansion is into a part of a building or other structure that was lawfully and manifestly designed or arranged for such use; or
(3) the expansion is for a living space addition to a single dwelling unit.
B. Expansion for the sole purpose of providing off-street parking shall not be considered expansion of a nonconforming use.
12.2.3 Change of Use
A nonconforming use may not be changed to any use other than a use allowed in the zoning district in which it is located except as provided in this section. A nonconforming use can be changed to another similar or less intense nonconforming use with the approval of the Planning Commission. The Planning Commission shall find that the new use is no more intensive in character than the original nonconforming use. Such changes shall be treated in the same manner as special uses.
12.2.4 Relocation
A nonconforming use shall not be relocated in whole or in part to another location on the lot or parcel unless the movement or relocation eliminates or decreases the extent of nonconformity.
12.2.5 Loss of Legal Nonconformity Status
A. Abandonment
If a nonconforming use is abandoned, ceases or is discontinued for any reason for a period of more than 180 days, the use shall be considered abandoned. Once abandoned, the uses legal nonconforming status shall be lost and re-establishment of the use shall be prohibited. Evidence of abandonment shall include but not be limited to: cessation or discontinuance of the particular use, disconnection of water service to the property, disconnection of electric service to the property, failure to pay property taxes or failure to maintain the property. Any subsequent use of the property shall comply with the regulations of the zoning district in which it is located.
City of Hickory 203 Land Development Code (November 19, 2019)
B. Single Family Dwellings and Duplexes (TA 11-01, TA 18-01)
Any nonconforming single-family dwelling or duplex may be altered, repaired, enlarged or replaced, provided that the altered or replaced structure meets the dimensional requirements of the Land Development Code.
C. Manufactured Home
An existing manufactured home located in a district that no longer permits manufactured homes, may be replaced provided that the replacement dwelling meets the appearance criteria of Sec. 6.2.13.
12.2.6 Accessory Uses and Structures
No use or structure that is accessory to a principal nonconforming use or structure shall continue after such principal use or structure shall have ceased or terminated, unless it complies with all regulations of this Land Development Code.
Sec. 12.3 Nonconforming Structures
12.3.1 Definition
A nonconforming structure is any building or structure, other than a sign, that was legally established but which no longer complies with the Intensity, Dimensional and Design Standards of Land Development Code. Nonconforming structures may remain, subject to the regulations of this section.
12.3.2 Structural Changes (TA 19-01)
Structural changes, including enlargements, shall be permitted if the structural change does not increase the extent of nonconformity. When a structure is nonconforming because it encroaches into a required setback, this provision shall be interpreted as allowing other portions of the structure to be expanded out to the extent of the existing encroachment, as long as there is no greater reduction of required setbacks. See Figure 12-1.
Figure 12-1  Structural Changes to Nonconforming Structures
12.3.3 Use
A nonconforming structure may be used for any use allowed in the underlying zoning district.
12.3.4 Relocation
City of Hickory Land Development Code (November 19, 2019) 204
A nonconforming structure may be relocated in whole or in part to another location on the subject parcel if the movement or relocation decreases or eliminates the nonconformity.
12.3.5 Loss of Nonconforming Status; Damage or Destruction
If a nonconforming structure is damaged or destroyed to the extent of more than 50 percent of the assessed taxable value of the structure immediately prior to damage, the nonconforming structure shall not be restored unless it is in full compliance with all applicable provisions of this Land Development Code. If a nonconforming structure is damaged by 50 percent or less of its assessed taxable value immediately prior to damage, the structure may be re-established to the extent that it existed before the time of damage, provided that such repairs, restoration or reconstruction are substantially completed within 12 months of the date of such damage.
Sec. 12.4 Nonconforming Lots
12.4.1 Definition
A nonconforming lot is a tract of land, designated on a duly recorded subdivision plat, or by a duly recorded deed, or by other lawful means, that complied with all applicable lot area, lot width and lot depth standards of the zoning district in which it was located at the time of its creation, but which does not comply with the minimum lot area, lot width or lot depth requirements of the zoning district in which it is now located.
12.4.2 Use of Single Nonconforming Lots
The provisions of this section apply to nonconforming lots:
A. In residential zoning districts, single nonconforming lots may be used for detached single-family dwellings and related accessory structures, subject to all other applicable standards of the underlying zoning district.
B. In nonresidential zoning districts, single nonconforming lots may be used for uses allowed within the underlying zoning district, subject to all other applicable standards of the underlying zoning district. If the underlying zoning district allows a variety of uses or a variety of intensities of uses and one or more uses or intensities would comply with applicable lot area, lot width or other dimensional standards, while others would not, then only the uses or intensities that comply with applicable standards shall be permitted.
12.4.3 Division of Nonconforming Lots
Where a nonconforming lot of record in single ownership exists and is occupied by more than 1 detached single-family dwelling that meets the State Building Code, such lot may be re-subdivided to create a separate lot for each dwelling even though the resulting lots do not meet the lot area or width standards of the underlying zoning district. Before such subdivision is allowed, the Planning Director shall make the following findings:
A. Drainage easements and rights-of-way will be maintained;
B. The division does not adversely affect permissible development of adjoining property;
C. No additional nonconformities are created;
D. The division will maintain or enhance the value of contiguous property; and
E. The character of the area is maintained or enhanced.
City of Hickory 205 Land Development Code (November 19, 2019)

12.5.2 Compliance or Removal  On Premises Signs
On premises signs shall be replaced with signs conforming to the regulations contained in Article 10 when removed or repaired if the cost of such repair exceeds 50% of the value of the sign.

12.6.1 Examples
The types of other nonconformities to which this section applies include but are not necessarily limited to: fence height or location; lack of required buffers or screening; lack of or inadequate landscaping; lack of or inadequate off-street parking or loading spaces; and other nonconformities not involving structural aspects of a building, location of a building on a lot, lot dimensions or land or building use.
12.6.2 Increase prohibited
It shall be the intent of this Land Development Code to encourage the reduction of these other types of non-conformities to the maximum extent feasible as buildings, lots or parking areas are redeveloped or expanded. Parking areas that do not comply with the landscape requirements of this Land Development Code shall be brought into compliance as required Sec. 9.13 when buildings are expanded or redeveloped as provided herein. The extent of such other nonconformities shall not be increased, and no use, building, structure or signs shall be established, expanded, altered, changed or relocated in such a manner to increase the degree of such other nonconformity.
12.6.3 Operational Performance Standards
Uses established prior to effective date of this ordinance, that are found to violate the operational performance standards contained in Sec. 9.9 shall be required to make reasonable modifications to bring the use of the property into compliance with the standards contained in Sec. 9.9. Such modifications may include, but shall not be limited to, installation of screening, walls or buffering, installation of noise reduction equipment such as mufflers, replacing lighting fixtures or changes in manufacturing process or use of the property that does not unreasonably interfere with the operations of the facility. No violation shall be prosecuted under this code where modifications have been made as part of a good-faith attempt to comply with Sec. 9.9 and which result in measurable reductions in the extent of the violation and the operational performance standards continue to exceed the standards of Sec. 9.9.
A. Upgrade/Expansion: Prior to issuance of a building permit for any upgrade in equipment or expansion of the facility in violation, the property owner shall certify to the Planning Director that the proposed change will not result in an increase in the nonconformity of the property with respect to the operational performance standards. If the property that has been found in violation of Sec. 9.9 is proposed to be expanded or renovated where such expansion or renovation will increase the taxable value by more than 50 percent over the assessed taxable value, the entire structure or operation shall be brought into compliance with all provisions of Sec. 9.9.
B. Damaged/Destroyed: If a property that has been found in violation of Sec. 9.9 is damaged or destroyed to the extent of more than 50 percent of the assessed taxable value of the structure immediately prior to damage, the nonconforming structure shall not be restored unless it is in full compliance with all applicable provisions of this Land Development Code.
