The actual start means either the first placement of permanent construction of a structure on site, such as the pouring of slab or footings, the installation of piles, the construction of columns, or any work beyond the 
§4.10 Town of Amherst Zoning Ordinance 	§4.10 
stage of evacuation; or the placement of manufactured home on a foundation. Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as clearing, grading, and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings, piers, or foundations, or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or part of the main structure. 
Substantial Damage means damage of any origin sustained by a structure whereby the cost of restoring the structure to its before-damaged condition would equal or exceed fifty percent (50%) of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred. 
Substantial Improvement means any combination of repairs, reconstruction, alteration, or improvements to a structure in which the cumulative cost equals or exceeds fifty percent (50%) of the market value of the structure. The market value of the structure should equal: 
1. 	
The appraised value prior to the start of the initial repair or improvement, or 

2. 	
In the case of damage, the value of the structure prior to the damage occurring. For the purposes of this definition, “substantial improvement” is considered to occur when the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of the building commences, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the structure. This term includes structures which have incurred substantial damage, regardless of actual repair work performed. The term does not, however, include any project for improvement of a structured required to comply with existing health, sanitary, or safety code specifications which are solely necessary to assure safe living conditions or any alteration of a “historic Structure,” provided that the alteration will not preclude the structure’s continued designation as a “historic structure.” 


Violation means the failure of a structure or other development to be fully compliant with community’s flood plain management regulations. A structure or other development without the elevation certificate, other certifications, or other evidence of compliance required in 44CFR Sec. 60.3(b)(5), (c)(4), (c)(10), (d)(3), (e)(2), (e)(4), or (e)(5) is presumed to be in violation until such time as that documentation is provided. (3-13-07) 
Water Surface Elevation means the height, in relation to the National Geodetic Vertical Datum (NGVD) of 1929, (or other datum, where specified) of floods of various magnitudes and frequencies in floodplains.

A. WORKFORCE 	HOUSING DEVELOPMENTS are permissible upon demonstration of the conditions set forth below. 
B. PURPOSE. Provide suitable opportunities for housing that is affordable (as that term is defined in RSA 674:58) for households of limited means, without sacrificing public health, safety, and welfare. 
Encourage creative approaches to  providing affordable housing suitable for a variety of households, including (but not limited to) families, singles and seniors. 
Comply with the provisions of RSA 674:58, et. seq. 
C. PRELIMINARY CONCEPTUAL CONSULTATION. The Applicant may make application for conceptual consultation to the Planning Board to construct Workforce Housing which shall include preliminary, conceptual plans, site drawing and building information sufficient for a non-binding discussion of the proposed project in accordance with RSA 676:4-II(a). 
D. DESIGN REVIEW. 	The Applicant may make application for design review to the Planning Board to construct Workforce Housing which shall include preliminary plans, site drawings and building information sufficient for review of the project in accordance with RSA 676:4-II(b). 
E. FINAL REVIEW. 	The applicant shall make application to the Planning Board to construct Workforce Housing, which shall include sufficient useful information for the Planning Board to review and determine the same as a suitable Workforce Housing application and project that meets the following criteria: 
1. General Criteria. 
a. 	
The complete Workforce Housing project shall be harmonious with its natural surroundings and compatible with neighboring developments and homes in terms of outside design, relative size, and finish. 

b. 	
The project shall not detract from either the ecological or the visual qualities of the environment. 

c. 	
The housing proposal shall be affordable in compliance with Section G. 


§4.14 Town of Amherst Zoning Ordinance 	§4.14 
d. 	
The proposal meets the purposes of the ordinance under which the application is proposed. 

e. 	
There will be no significant adverse impacts resulting from the proposed use upon the public health, safety, and general welfare of the neighborhood and the Town of Amherst. 

f. 	
The proposed residential uses will not adversely affect nearby properties due to noise, fumes, vibration, or light. The project location shall not expose its residents to objectionable noise, fumes, vibration, or inappropriate light. (3-11-14) 

g. 	
The proposed use will not adversely affect the water resources of Amherst, as defined in the Aquifer Conservation and Wellhead Protection District as defined in Section 4.13 of the Amherst Zoning Ordinance. 

h. 	
The project shall comply with all applicable site plan and/or subdivision regulations, other than those waived hereunder. 

i. 	
An Applicant’s request for a site density level that exceeds that provided for in the applicable district regulations is predicated on a showing that the same is required to achieve a reasonable expectation of Economic Viability (as defined herein). Accordingly, any project which is requesting such a density level shall, in addition to the demonstration of Economic Viability, also demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Planning Board the manner in which this project is promoting the purposes of this ordinance (as set forth above) and the spirit and intent of the Amherst Zoning Ordinance and the Amherst Master Plan. 


2. Specific Criteria 
a. 	
Where there is an existing dwelling, the Net Tract Area shall be at least sufficient to provide a conforming conventional sized lot for the existing dwelling. 

b. 	
The Planning Board may designate accessory apartments incorporated within an existing or proposed single-family home as Workforce Housing. Such designation will allow an accessory workforce dwelling-unit within an existing freestanding structure if the structure can be legally adapted to such residential use and any such adaptation remains economically viable as defined herein. The total area of any workforce housing accessory apartment shall not be less than six hundred (600) square feet or exceed forty five percent (45%) of the total heated living area contained within the existing residential structure. 

c. 	
The Planning Board reserves the right to modify density allowances if during its comprehensive site plan review it determines that physical land characteristics or other considerations do not support preliminary density allowances. 


3. Preliminary Density 
Density allowances and/or total unit count that result from “Design Review” determinations are preliminary. The Planning Board may vary both density allowances and total unit count based upon Section G and Section H if the completed project analysis reveals calculations or conditions are other than those upon which the Planning Board made its determinations under Design Review (See below). 
F. 	ZONING DISTRICT. Once the Planning Board designates a proposed project as suitable for Workforce Housing and determines that the same is satisfactory and compliant with the above 
§4.14 Town of Amherst Zoning Ordinance 	§4.14 
standards, that project may be located on any suitable property irrespective of the zoning district classification. 
G. MODIFIED LOT SIZE, DENSITY, SETBACKS, and OPEN SPACE: The Planning Board may modify minimum lot area, density, setbacks, and open space requirements for each project as the Planning Board determines to be necessary in the best interest of the Town. The Planning Board may grant departures from general and specific standards based on economic criteria presented by the applicant in evidence of need for such departures so as to make the construction of Workforce Housing Economically Viable as defined herein. 
When deliberating modifications to zoning requirements for Workforce Housing applications, the Planning Board shall consider the following: 
a. 	
Open space shall be sufficient to accommodate the needs of the proposed occupants of the project. At least 25% of the total parcel area shall be open space. 

b. 	
Setbacks shall be sufficient to buffer and protect adjacent properties. A perimeter setback of 50 feet of landscaped or natural vegetation shall provide a buffer to less dense neighborhood development. 

c. 	
The Planning Board may waive dimensional standards of lot size, density, setbacks and open space, but only when it has been demonstrated that construction of a “workforce housing project” (as that term is defined below), cannot for economic reasons be feasibly constructed because of those standards. In making such a determination, however, the Planning Board shall ensure that the project complies with the general criteria. Further, the Planning Board, in making such waiver, shall grant only the minimum waiver(s) demonstrated to be necessary to render the project economically feasible. 

i. 	
An applicant seeking to request a waiver under this section shall apply for the same to the Planning Board according to the procedure set forth in the Site Plan Regulations. When making that application, the applicant shall provide sufficient information to the Planning Board to demonstrate the following: 


ii. 	The proposed project is incapable of being feasibly constructed within the existing area requirements specified for the applicable zoning district for economic reasons and that the limitations do not permit any other sufficient, realistic or reasonable opportunities to provide workforce housing; and, (NOTE: See Non-Residential Site Review Regulations for Project Suitability Procedure Regulations; “Affordable Housing”.) 
iii. 	The granting of waivers will result in the project being Economically Viable and will allow for the construction of “workforce housing” units, which RSA 674:58, as amended defines as target income group(s) or lower income group(s) that the applicant defines; and, 
iv. 	The applicant seeking a waiver will identify the general and specific standards for which a waiver is necessary and will provide appropriate documentation supporting the economic reasons by which the strict application of such general or specific standards causes the project to be economically infeasible to construct and, 
§4.14 Town of Amherst Zoning Ordinance 	§4.14 
v. 	The project design is such that it complies with all applicable standards related to environmental protection, water supply, sanitary disposal, traffic safety, and fire, and life safety protection; and, 
vi. 	
The applicant has provided a suitable mechanism to ensure that the proposed housing stock as constructed will be available to persons of the target income group for a period not less than twenty-five (25) years. 

d. 	
The Planning Board may withdraw any regulatory allowances including lot size, density, setback, and other zoning or regulatory allowances for Workforce Housing before final Site Plan approval upon its determination that revocation of its voluntary measures is reasonable due to the following: 

i. 	
A material reduction in project cost that renders unwarranted the basis for density or other allowances granted to promote Economic Viability; 


ii. 	
Fraud, misrepresentation of facts, or other deliberate actions that abuse or violate the intent of this ordinance; 

e. 	
Projects that are to be constructed in a phased manner shall include construction of a proportional mix of units and amenities upon which allowances were based. 

f. 	
Expiration of provision shall occur subject to the following: 

i. 	
Any failure to implement development of a Workforce Housing project following site plan approval within a time frame set and approved by the Planning Board; 

ii. 	
Any failure to complete a Workforce Housing project within a timeframe set and approved by the Planning Board. 


H. RULES 	AND REGULATIONS. The Planning Board may adopt appropriate rules and regulations to implement the review process contemplated hereunder. Such rules shall provide for the developer and subsequent owners to restrict the sale or lease of the units through appropriate recorded covenants to those who qualify, pursuant to the definition of affordable housing contained in this Ordinance. 
Existing housing units previously designated as “Affordable Housing” units that do not have appropriate recorded covenants may elect to present to the Zoning Administrator appropriate covenants, to be approved by Planning Board, in exchange for a written waiver that allows such existing residential units to legally exceed the      previously mandated 1,300       SF      size      limitation. 
I. 	DEFINITIONS. “Workforce Housing,” as used in this ordinance, shall constitute qualifying housing, which is for sale or lease, and is affordable. 
1. “Affordable” in this context shall mean: 
a. 	
Housing intended for sale with combined mortgage loan debt service, property taxes, and required insurance shall not exceed thirty percent (30%) of household gross annual income; 

i. 	
Such annual gross income for homebuyers shall be no more than one hundred percent (100%) of the median income for a four (4) person household for the metropolitan area or county in which the housing is located as published annually 


§4.14 Town of Amherst Zoning Ordinance 	§4.14 
by the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development or as otherwise modified by state or federal law. (3-11-14). 
b.

A. PURPOSE. 	Planned Residential Development allows an alternative pattern of land development to the pattern permitted in the Residential/Rural, Northern Rural, Northern Transitional, and Commercial Zones. It is intended to encourage the preservation of open space and, at the same time, provide for a greater variety of housing types and affordability in the Town of Amherst at somewhat greater densities than permitted elsewhere in the Zoning Ordinance, without causing a significant increase in the town-wide population density. It is envisioned that in a PRD, dwelling units will be constructed in clusters which are harmonious with neighborhood developments and housing, and with natural surroundings. These clusters shall detract neither from the ecological and visual qualities of the environment, nor from the value of the neighborhood, environment, or the Town. The PRD should contain a variety of housing types to accommodate the Master Plan purposes of encouraging a diversity of people, a variety of age groups of different interests, backgrounds, and economic levels. The overall site design and amenities should enhance the quality of living for the residents of the development and, in general, the neighborhood and the Town. The Board shall determine whether the proposed PRD, namely the site plan or layout, and number, type, and design of the proposed housing is suitable to the neighborhood within which it is to be located and is consistent with the Master Plan and its reasonable growth objectives. (3-14­89) 
§4.17 Town of Amherst Zoning Ordinance 	§4.17 
B. CONDITIONS. 	An applicant for approval of a proposed PRD shall make application to the Planning Board in the same fashion as specified in the Subdivision Regulations and Section 4.16 ­IIHO. In the course of review of the proposal by the Planning Board, the Board shall hear evidence presented by the applicant and determine whether, in its judgment, the proposal meets the objectives and purpose set forth above, in which event the Board may grant approval to the proposal subject to such reasonable conditions and limitations as it shall deem appropriate. (3-14­17) 
C. (Deleted 3-10-15) 
D. (Deleted 3-10-15). 
E. PERMITTED USES. 
1. 	There may permitted in any PRD, single family detached and single family attached, and multi-unit structures of any type without regard to dwelling unit configuration or form of ownership. It is envisioned that the housing types, while having different internal configurations, will have an external appearance that complements and is in general harmony with the natural surroundings of the PRD. Up to ten percent (10%) of the dwelling units may be mobile homes. The maximum height of any dwelling structure shall be thirty-five (35) feet, exclusive of chimneys or cupolas, measured from the lowest adjacent exterior elevation. For the purposes of this ordinance, the following definitions shall apply: 
a.

ii. 	Upgrading of existing facilities and infrastructures, the need for which is not created by new development, shall not be paid for by impact fees. 
iii. In the case of development created by a change of use, redevelopment, expansion, or modification of an existing use, the capital facilities fee shall be based upon the net positive increase in the impact created by the new use as compared to that which was or would have been assessed for the previous use.

x. 	
Sewer and water facilities, if any. 


3. 	Impact fee schedules shall be established and reviewed as set forth in this Section and Sections 
4.19.G below.  In the case of change of use, redevelopment, or expansion or modification of an existing use which constitutes new development, the impact fees shall be based upon the net positive increase in the impact fee for the new use as compared to the previous use. (3-10-09) 
G. IMPACT FEE ESTABLISHMENT PROCEDURE. 	In order to establish an impact fee, the Selectmen shall identify projects eligible for impact fee funding as indicated in the Capital Improvements Program, as, from time to time, amended. The Selectmen shall then prepare a report describing a methodology or basis for calculating impact fee assessments and an Impact Fee Schedule, in accordance with RSA 674:21, and this ordinance. The Selectmen shall conduct a public hearing on the proposed schedule, and shall consider all comments received prior to finalizing the Schedule. The Selectmen, upon such finalization, shall then submit the Schedule to the Planning Board for their review and recommendation. The Board of Selectmen at a regular meeting shall accept or modify the proposed schedule which may include modifications consistent with the recommendations of the Planning Board. The Impact Fee Schedule shall be in effect when a majority of the Board of Selectmen approves the schedule. (3-10-09) 
1. 	A determination of the number of building permits that will need to be issued in order to finance the impact fee. (3-10-09) 
H. Review of Impact Fees. 	The Selectmen may review and revise an Impact Fee Schedule whenever circumstances warrant and shall review an established Impact Fee Schedule, at a minimum, on an annual basis and shall modify the Impact Fee Schedule if it finds that new data is available that will refine the schedule.

The Selectmen shall submit the Impact Fee Schedule to the Planning Board for their review and recommendation before the adoption of any revised schedule. 
I. 	Termination of Impact Fees. 
1. 	
Impact fees shall terminate when the Board finds that the appropriate conditions for 
assessment are no longer present. (3-10-09) 


2. 	
The Board of Selectmen may also by majority vote terminate an impact fee schedule in effect, whenever there is occasion to do so. This may be done only after soliciting recommendations from the Planning Board, and after conducting a public hearing. 


J. 	Administration of Impact Fees. 
§4.19 Town of Amherst Zoning Ordinance 	§4.19 
1. 	
Accounting for Impact Fees. Each impact fee shall be accounted for separately, shall be segregated from the Town's general fund, may be spent upon order of the Selectmen and shall be used solely for the capital improvements for which it was collected, or to recoup the cost of capital improvements made in anticipation of the needs for which fees are collected to meet. In the event that bonds or other debt instruments have been issued for public capital facilities which were constructed in anticipation of new development, or are issued for advanced provision of capital facilities identified in this ordinance, Impact fees may be used to pay debt service on such bonds or similar debt instruments. Each fee collected under a specific Impact Fee Schedule shall not be commingled with any other impact fee accounts or any other funds. (3-10-09) 

2. 	
Assessment of Impact Fees. All impact fees shall be assessed at the time of planning board approval of a subdivision plat or site plan. When no planning board approval is required, or has been made prior to the adoption or amendment of the impact fee ordinance, impact fees shall be assessed prior to, or as a condition for, the issuance of a building permit or other appropriate permission to proceed with new development. Impact fees shall be intended to reflect the effect of development upon municipal facilities at the time of the issuance of the building permit. 

3. 	
Collection of Impact Fees. Impact fees shall be collected at the time a certificate of occupancy is issued. If no certificate of occupancy is required, impact fees shall be collected when the development is ready for its intended use.  The Selectmen and the assessed party may establish an alternate, mutually acceptable schedule of payment of impact fees in effect at the time of subdivision plat or site plan approval by the planning board. If an alternate schedule of payment is established, the Selectmen may require developers to post bonds, issue letters of credit, accept liens, or otherwise provide suitable measures of security so as to guarantee future payment of the assessed impact fees. 

4. 	
Refund of Unused Impact Fees. If, within six (6) years of the collection of an Impact Fee pursuant to this ordinance, any portion of such Impact Fee which has not become encumbered or otherwise legally bound to be spent for the purpose for which it was collected shall be refunded, with any accrued interest, to the owner of record of the property. Whenever the calculation of an impact fee has been predicated upon some portion of capital improvement costs being borne by the municipality, a refund shall be made upon the failure of the legislative body to appropriate the municipality's share of the capital improvement costs within said six 

(6) year period. (3-10-09) 

5. 	
Maintaining Records of Impact Fees and Related Projects -The Town Treasurer shall have custody of all accounts and shall pay out the same only upon written orders of the Board of Selectmen. At the end of each fiscal year, the Town Treasurer shall prepare a report, showing a full account of all impact fee transactions during the year and deliver same to the Board of Selectmen, the Planning Board, and the same shall be available to the public. (3-10-09) 


§4.19 Town of Amherst Zoning Ordinance 	§4.19 
K. Waiver and Appeal of Fees. 
1. 	
Any person may request from the Planning Board, a full or partial waiver of Impact Fee payments required by this ordinance where it can be shown that, due to unique and/or mitigating circumstances, the impact of the particular new development is demonstrated to be nonexistent or less than anticipated. 

2. 	
On-site and off-site improvements which are required by the Planning Board as a result of subdivision or site plan review, including but not limited to, extension of water and sewer mains or the construction of roads or other infrastructure, which would have to be completed by the developer regardless of the capital facilities fee provisions, shall not be considered eligible for waiver under this ordinance. 


L. 	Credits. 
1. 	Land or Improvement Construction in Kind in Lieu of Payment: Land for capital facilities and/or public capital facility improvements may be offered by the fee-payer as total or partial payment of the required fee. The offer must be determined to represent an identifiable dollar value computed in a manner acceptable to the Planning Board. 
M. Applicability. 
1. 	This ordinance shall not be deemed to affect the existing authority of the Planning Board over subdivisions and site plans, including, but not limited to the authority to declare a development to be premature or scattered in accordance with the regulations of the Board and in accordance with RSA 674:36, II(a). 
N. Off-site Improvements. 
1. 	
Definition of Offsite Improvement.  A specific “off-site” capital facility or infrastructure improvement that is required by the Planning Board for either a site plan or subdivision that is necessary, in the judgment of the Planning Board, for the project to operate properly on the day that it opens shall be considered to be an Off-Site Improvement. 

2. 	
Imposition of Offsite Improvements Requirements. Off site improvements for site specific applications shall be assessed on a case by case basis and shall be in addition to other impact fees imposed pursuant to this ordinance. In a case in which it is determined that such an improvement is necessary for the proper operation of the project, the Planning Board shall so notify the applicant. 

3. 	
Determination of Proportionate Share of Off-Site Improvement Cost(s). In circumstances 


§4.19 Town of Amherst Zoning Ordinance 	§4.19 
where it can be demonstrated that such improvement will benefit the community at large, as well as the future occupants of the proposed new development, the Planning Board may require the applicant to present to the Board a study that identifies the proportionate share of the cost of the required improvement that pertain to the new development. In such a case, the Planning Board may, at the expense of the applicant, refer such study to a consultant of its own choosing to determine the reliability of the findings that shall be considered by the board to arrive at an amount to be contributed by the applicant for the off site improvement. 
4. 	Reimbursement for Contributions in Excess of Proportionate Share. The applicant shall be assessed his/her proportionate share of the cost of the project. In cases where it is determined that an improvement is necessary for the proper functioning of a new development but the applicant, for whatever reason is determined to contribute more than his/her proportionate share to the improvement under this section, and, therefore, that the improvement will also accommodate other future development, the Selectmen, at the request and expense of the applicant, may establish a separate, project related impact fee that assesses other new development for their proportionate share of the improvement to reimburse the applicant for such disproportionate contribution. Such future impact fees shall provide for the payment to the original applicant, with any interest. 
O. Applicability of Impact Fees. 
1. 	
Any person or agent, who after the effective date of this ordinance, seeks to undertake new development within the Town of Amherst, New Hampshire, by applying for site plan approval, subdivision approval or a building permit and who is not vested pursuant to RSA 674:39, is hereby required to pay the appropriate Impact Fees in the manner set forth in this ordinance, in accordance with any Impact Fee Schedule adopted by the Board of Selectmen. 

2. 	
No new building permit for an activity requiring payment of one or more impact fee(s) pursuant to this ordinance shall be issued unless and until the impact fee(s) hereby required have been assessed and/or otherwise agreed upon, and no certificate of occupancy or other permission for the use of said new development project shall be issued until the same have been paid or otherwise discharged. 


P. 	Other Assessments Unaffected. 
Payment of an impact fee does not restrict the Town or the Planning Board from requiring other payments from the applicant, including without limitation such payments relating to the cost of the extensions of water and sewer mains or the construction or improvement of roads or streets or other infrastructure and facilities specifically benefitting the development which are required by the subdivision or site plan review regulations or as otherwise permitted by law. 
§4.19 Town of Amherst Zoning Ordinance 	§4.20 
Q. Premature and Scattered Development. 
Nothing in this ordinance shall be construed so as to limit the existing authority of the Amherst Planning Board to provide against development which is scattered or premature, which requires an excessive expenditure of public funds, or otherwise violates the Town of Amherst's Site Pan Review Regulations, Subdivision Regulations, or Zoning Ordinance. 
R. Severability. 
If any section, phrase, sentence or portion of this ordinance is for any reason held invalid or unconstitutional by any court of competent jurisdiction, such portion shall be deemed a separate, distinct and independent provision, and such holding shall not affect the validity of the remaining portions thereof.

104 Effective Date 
These regulations shall take effect upon their adoption by the Planning Board. 

105 Review of Developments of Regional Impact 
105.1 Purpose. The purpose of this section is to: 
A.  Provide timely  notice to potentially  affected municipalities  concerning proposed  developments, which  are likely to  have  impacts  beyond the boundaries of the Town of Amherst. 
B. 	Provide opportunities for the regional planning commission and the potentially affected municipalities to furnish timely input to the Town of Amherst. 
C. 	Encourage the Town of Amherst to consider the interests of other potentially affected municipalities. 
D. 	Fulfill the statutory requirements of RSA 36:54 through 36:58. 
105.2 Definition 
For the purpose of this section, “development of regional impact” means any proposal before a local land use board which in the determination of such local board could reasonably be expected to impact on a neighboring municipality. 
105.3 Review Required 
The Amherst Planning Board, upon receipt of an application for development or a Comprehensive Planning Application, shall review it promptly and determine whether or not the development, if approved, reasonably could be construed as having the potential for regional impact. Doubt concerning regional impact shall be resolved in a determination that the development has a potential regional impact. Failure of the Planning Board to vote specifically on an application to determine if a project meets the criteria of Developments of Regional Impact shall result in a determination being made that the proposal is not a Development of Regional Impact. 
105.4 Procedure 
a. 	
Upon determination that a proposed development has a potential regional impact, the Amherst Planning Board shall afford the regional planning commission and the affected municipalities the status of abutters as defined in RSA 672:3 for the limited purpose of providing notice and giving testimony. 

b. 	
Within 72 hours of reaching a decision regarding a development of regional impact, the  Amherst Planning  Board  shall, by  certified  mail, furnish the regional planning commission and the affected municipalities with copies of the minutes of the meeting at which the decision was made. 

c. 	
At least 14 days prior to public hearing, the Amherst Planning Board shall notify, by certified mail, all affected municipalities and the regional planning commission of the date, time, and place of the hearing and their right to testify concerning the development.

A. 	Constitute a scattered or premature subdivision of land as would involve danger or injury to health, safety, or prosperity by reason of the lack of water supply, drainage, transportation, schools, fire department, or other public services; 
B. 	Necessitate an excessive expenditure of public funds for the supply of such services.  
If, after such review, the Board determines that the proposed subdivision would cause either of the aforementioned conditions, then the Board shall so inform the applicant and indicate that the applicant may modify the proposal to avoid the aforementioned conditions; and in doing so, the said Board may, considering all the circumstances, 
Town of Amherst Development Regulations    Subdivision Regulations

Town of Amherst Development Regulations 
Roadway & Utility Standards 
Part 3 --ROADS AND UTILITIES STANDARDS 
301 General Requirements 
301.1 Purpose and Intent of Design Standards for Streets 
All platted streets shall be of sufficient width and construction as detailed in this section, and shall be suitably located so as to: conform to applicable provisions of the Master Plan; safely and conveniently accommodate transportation and access needs of the public; and provide reliable access for firefighting and other essential public and private services. 
301.2 Arrangement of Streets 
The horizontal alignment of streets shall be platted so as to: comprise a convenient transportation system; provide for the continuation of streets to adjoining neighborhoods and collector streets; provide for future right-of-way extensions to undeveloped properties if deemed appropriate by the Planning Board; and to facilitate efficient future extensions of public and private utilities.  Streets shall be arranged to provide maximum separation of through and local traffic and to discourage through traffic in residential neighborhoods.  
301.3 Relationship of Streets to Topography 
Streets within any platted subdivision shall be designed to form a logical relationship between the vertical and horizontal alignments of such streets and the topography of adjoining land.  Specifically, the horizontal and vertical alignment of platted streets shall: avoid the need for cut and fill depths, which, in the opinion of the Planning Board, are unreasonably severe; and shall afford a minimum of one location where safe and convenient driveway access can be achieved along the frontage of each platted lot without need for excessive excavation. 
301.4 Dedication of Supplemental Right-of-way 
In the Commercial and Industrial Zoning Districts, where land which is the subject of an application for approval under these Regulations fronts upon an existing Class V public street having a right-of-way width less than that required, based upon the classification of that street, under these Regulations, the applicant shall dedicate supplemental right-of-way if needed to create a continuous public right-of-way having a dimension equal to not less than one-half the full right-of-way width required under these Regulations, as measured from the occupied centerline of such street to the front line of the subject land.  
301.5 Street Names 
Proposed street names shall neither duplicate nor be phonetically similar to existing street names within the Town of Amherst.  Street names shall be compliant with E-911 standards. Street names shall be subject to review and comment by the Planning Board, Amherst Police Department and Amherst Fire Department and approval by the Board of Selectmen. 
301.6 Adoption of Reference Specification 
All workmanship and materials incorporated into the construction of streets and related improvements shall conform to applicable requirements of Standard Specifications for Road and 
Town of Amherst Development Regulations 
Roadway & Utility Standards 
Bridge Construction, latest edition, as published and amended by the New Hampshire Department of Transportation unless otherwise specified in these Regulations. 
302 Geometric Design Standards for Streets 
302.1 Classification of Streets 
For the purposes of these Regulations, all streets shall be classified based upon use, as follows: 
. Residential – 1: A low volume residential street which accommodates an average daily traffic volume (ADT) of not more than 400 vehicles per day (VPD); . Residential – 2: A residential street which accommodates an ADT of 401 to 1,000 VPD; . Non-Residential: A street whose primary function is to provide frontage and local access to non-residential properties in a business or industrial park subdivision; . Collector: A street which accommodates an ADT of 1,001 to 6,000 VPD; and . Arterial:  A street which accommodates an ADT of more than 6,000 VPD. 
302.2 Table of Geometric Design Standards for Streets 
The Table of Geometric Design Standards for Streets, which is a part of these Regulations, provides design values for common geometric design parameters for streets including, but not limited to: (a) right-of-way and pavement width; (b) vertical alignment; (c) horizontal alignment; and (d) road base material and pavement thickness.  The values presented in this Table shall serve as design criteria for all platted streets classified as Residential -1, Residential – 2, Non-Residential, or Collector. Design criteria for Arterial Streets shall be derived from A Policy on Geometric Design of Streets and Highways, latest edition, as published by the American Association of State Highway & Transportation Officials (AASHTO). 
302.3 Typical Cross-Section for Construction of Streets 
The Typical Cross-Section for Construction of Streets (Figure 1), which is a part of these Regulations, shall be recognized as the standard typical cross-section for Residential – 1, Residential – 2, Non-Residential and Collector Street construction. Several minimum dimensions specified on Figure 1 vary with street classification and are therefore specified in the Table of Geometric Design Standards for Streets.  All street construction shall conform to the standards specified on the Typical Cross-Section for Construction of Streets unless otherwise approved by the Planning Board.  As an alternative, the Planning Board may, at its option, permit Residential-1 streets to be constructed in accordance with the Alternative Typical Cross-Section for Construction of Streets (Figure 2) provided the Board determines or anticipates: (a) the average daily traffic volume to be served by the street(s) in question will not exceed 400 vehicles per day; 
(b) the construction will satisfy the requirements of Sections 5.1.1 through 5.1.3 of these Regulations; and (c) construction in accordance with Figure 2 will better facilitate the installation of stormwater management improvements required in order to satisfy the provisions of Section 
610.2 of these Regulations. 
302.4 Design Requirements for Cul-De-Sac Streets 
All permanent dead-end streets shall terminate in a cul-de-sac designed, laid-out and constructed 
Town of Amherst Development Regulations Roadway & Utility Standards 3-3 
in accordance with the Typical Permanent Cul-De-Sac detail (Figure 2) contained within these Regulations.  The maximum length of any cul-de-sac street, as measured from the occupied centerline of the existing or proposed street to be intersected by said cul-de-sac street to the radius point of the cul-de-sac, shall not generally exceed 1,200-feet; however, the Planning Board may permit the construction of cul-de-sac streets of greater length, providing the applicant has submitted evidence that such an approval will not be contrary to the general health, safety and welfare of residents, and that adequate provision has been made for public safety. 
All temporary cul-de-sacs shall be planned, designed and constructed to the same standards as permanent cul-de-sacs unless the Planning Board determines that a subsequent extension of the street in question is imminent. In such instances, the Planning Board may permit the construction of a temporary “hammerhead” style turn-around having dimensions acceptable to the Board. Under no circumstances shall “hammerhead” turn-arounds be allowed as a permanent terminus for a public street. 
302.5 Design Requirements for Intersections of Streets 
All intersections of streets shall be designed and constructed in accordance with the following standards: 
A. 	Not more than two streets shall intersect with a third street at a single point; and those two streets must align such that their respective centerlines intersect with the centerline of the third street at a single point. 
B. 	Successive intersections on the same side of a single street by two or more subsequent streets shall be separated by a minimum horizontal distance of 600-feet, as measured along the centerline of the intersected street.  Successive intersections on opposite sides of a single street by two or more subsequent streets shall be separated by a minimum horizontal distance of 125-feet, as measured along the centerline of the intersected street. 
1. 	
The vertical alignment of any street intersecting with a through street at a stop condition shall be such that: (a) the intersecting street slopes away from the through street at a grade of not less than 2-percent and not more than 3-percent for a distance of not less than 50-feet, as measured along the centerline of the intersecting street from the edge of travelled way of the through street; and (b) the maximum grade of the intersecting street does not exceed 3-percent for a distance of 100-feet, as measured along the centerline of the intersecting street, from the edge of travelled way of the through street. 

2. 	
Right-of-way lines of intersecting streets shall be joined by curves having a minimum radius of 25-feet.  The edges of pavement of intersecting streets shall be joined by curves having a minimum radius of 30-feet unless a larger radius is warranted in order to accommodate vehicular turning movements without encroaching upon an opposing lane of traffic. 


C. 	A minimum of 335-feet of all-season safe sight distance shall be provided at all intersections of Residential – 1, Residential – 2 and Non-Residential Streets. A minimum of 400-feet of all-season safe sight distance shall be provided at an intersection involving one or more Collector or Arterial Streets. 
Town of Amherst Development Regulations 
Roadway & Utility Standards 
D. 	Signage and pavement markings conforming to recommendations offered in the latest edition of the Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices (MUTCD), as well as street name signs conforming to local design standards, shall be furnished and installed at all intersections of streets. 
E. 	For reasons of proper night-time intersection recognition and public safety, the Planning Board may require the installation of street lamps at any proposed intersection of streets. 
302.6 	Design Standards Governing the Horizontal and Vertical Alignments of Streets 
A. 	Taken together, the horizontal and vertical alignments of Residential – 1, Residential – 2 and Non-Residential Streets shall permit maintenance of not less than 200-feet of stopping sight distance. 
B. 	Taken together, the horizontal and vertical alignments of a Collector Street shall permit maintenance of not less than 300-feet of stopping sight distance. 
C. 	All changes in the vertical alignment of streets in excess of 1-percent shall be connected by a vertical curve of a length sufficient to attain the minimum stopping sight distance value specific in the current edition of the !!SHTO publication, “Geometric Design of Highways and Streets” (!!SHTO Green Book), as applicable. 
303 Driveway Standards 
303.1 	Prior to subdivision approval, the applicant shall demonstrate that each platted lot will enjoy at least one location along its frontage where a driveway for access to that lot can be safely accommodated. In order to satisfy this requirement, the plans shall: (a) specify the location, dimensions and design elevations for driveway apron construction on each lot; (b) all season safe intersection sight distance as required in Amherst Driveway Regulations; and c) demonstrate such driveway construction can occur without interfering with utility installations and/or stormwater management improvements. 
303.2 	Refer to Section 3.10, Driveway Regulations for additional requirements. 
303.3 	A Driveway Permit is required for any new permanent or temporary driveway, and for any modification to an existing driveway. 
304 Street Right-of-Way Monumentation Standards 
Final subdivision plans shall specify granite boundary monuments, measuring not less than 4-inches by 4­inches by 36-inches, shall be installed at all points defining the limits of street right-of-way by or under the supervision of a Licensed Land Surveyor. 
305 Streetscape Design Standards 
305.1 	Street Tree Installation Requirements: At locations where subdivision streets are to pass through an open field, or at locations where existing vegetation must be removed in order to complete construction, salt tolerant deciduous street trees, having a minimum caliper diameter of 2 ½-inches at the time of planting, shall be installed along both sides of streets at intervals of not more than 100-feet.  All street trees shall be planted at the outer limit of the street right-of-way. 
305.2 	Retention of Existing Stone Walls: The Planning Board may require an applicant to retain or reconstruct existing stone walls forming the limits of existing public right-of-way along the 
Town of Amherst Development Regulations 
Roadway & Utility Standards 
frontage of a subdivision; and further, may require, as a condition of final subdivision approval, that any rock from existing stone walls, both interior and exterior to the subdivision, which must be removed or otherwise disturbed in order to accommodate street or other infrastructure construction, be salvaged and used in the construction of streetscapes and amenities within the subdivision.  
305.3 	Avoidance of Right-of-Way Obstructions: In all instances, street trees, stone walls, lamp posts, transformers and other utility risers, as well as all other planned above-ground utility installations and aesthetic improvements shall be constructed or installed at or adjacent to the limit right-of­way so as not to interfere with routine maintenance of streets or compromise public safety. 
306 Plans and Data for Final Approval 
306.1 	Roadway Design Plan & Profile Sheets (for all applications involving the construction of new streets or significant improvement of existing streets), shall contain the following information and be sealed by a Licensed Professional Engineer: 
A. 	A title block identifying: name and location of proposed subdivision; street name; roadway stationing for the segment of street depicted on each sheet; name & address of consultant; date of preparation & each subsequent revision; and scale (all plans shall be drawn at a scale

SECTION C 
AMHERST NON-RESIDENTIAL SITE PLAN REVIEW REGULATIONS 

ARTICLE I – GENERAL PROVISIONS 

Section 1.1 Purpose. 
The purpose of these regulations is to provide for Planning Board review and approval or disapproval of all site plans for the development of tracts of land for all uses other than one-and two-family residential, prior to the issuance of a building permit, whether or not such development includes a subdivision or re-subdivision of land, and to assure that minimum standards will be attained so as to provide for and protect the public health, safety, and general well-being, in accordance with NH RSA 674:43.     
In addition, the Planning Board when considering applications for public utility structures may, under RSA 674:30A (II), designate a Building Official of the Town empowered to waive specific requirements of a Non-Residential Site Review as its agent. A public hearing shall be held if requested by Abutters, the applicant or the Planning Board.  
Section 1.2 Applicability. 
A. 	These regulations shall apply to all site plans for the development of tracts of land for all uses other than one-and two-family residential, expansion or change of use. 
B. 	Development activities subject to regulation under this part shall not commence until the 
proponent has obtained final approval of the site plan. 

Section 1.3 Administration and Enforcement. 
A. 	All construction shall be performed in accordance with the plans, profiles, typical sections and details approved by the Planning Board. 
B. 	The Office of Community Development shall review minor site plan revisions for overall consistency with the approved site plan or as-built site plan for compliance with the standards below.  For the purposes of this section, a minor revision by definition is an administrative decision that does not constitute a site plan.  The Community Development Director or his authorized designee shall approve, conditionally approve, disapprove or refer an application to the Planning Board.  The procedures and standards for minor revisions are as follows: 
1. 	Minor changes in lot coverage, location, and siting and height of buildings and structures may be authorized by the Community Development Director if required for reasons or circumstances not foreseen at the time the site plan was approved.  No change authorized 
rev 10.21.2015 
C-2 
§1.1 Amherst Non-Residential Site Plan Review Regulations 	§2.1 
by this paragraph may increase the dimensions of any building or structure by more than 10% in the aggregate, or one thousand square feet (1,000SF), whichever is less.  No change authorized by this paragraph may permit an accessory structure whose size is greater than five hundred square feet (500SF).  Changes in landscaping, such as plant materials, minor alterations in the location of plantings, changes in plant quantities or sizes, changes to the location of internal sidewalks, minor changes in utility locations that do not impact the overall site design, or changes in location or number of parking spaces may be authorized by the Community Development Director. 
2. 	
The Community Development Director may require a revised site plan or as-built plan delineating all approved changes. 

3. 	
Changes in use depicted and permitted on an approved site plan or approved as-built plan may be approved by the Community Development Director provided it is a permitted use within the zoning district and does not exceed an area of thirty-three (33%) percent of the total building or two thousand square feet (2,000 SF), whichever is less. 


C. 	No occupancy permits shall be granted for any structure until all work shown on an approved site plan is complete to the satisfaction of the Building Inspector, Fire Department, Public Works Department and Office of Community Development, as applicable. In certain cases, for good cause and reason shown, a temporary certificate of occupancy may be granted for a site provided the owner provides a performance guarantee in an amount and form acceptable to the Town, to serve as surety that remaining improvements not yet completed will be satisfactorily completed within a pre-determined period of time.

(4-5-97, 5-7-97) 
ARTICLE V --LANDSCAPING STANDARDS 

Section 5.1 General. 
The purpose of these standards is to protect, enhance and promote and economic, ecological and aesthetically pleasing landscaping by breaking up visual expanse and connected impervious areas, delineating areas of vehicular and pedestrian traffic to improve safety, and to enhance the gateways to Amherst.  In addition, soil and landscaping play an important role in stormwater quality and quantity. These standards are intended to increase absorption and cleansing of rainfall and runoff so that the quantity and quality are more reflective of the natural hydrology where vegetation will thrive with minimal need for additional water, pesticides and fertilizers. 
A landscape plan shall be prepared in sufficient detail to indicate compliance with these regulations. The Plan shall be prepared by a Professional Landscape Architect who is licensed by the State of New Hampshire.  The Landscape Architect shall sign and appropriately endorse the Plan as a requirement for a complete Site Plan application. The Planning Board may waive the requirements of this section where the overall cost of site improvements and building are less than five hundred thousand (500,000) dollars. 
The landscape plan shall identify existing and proposed trees, shrubs, ground cover, walls and fences.  Existing native vegetation shall be preserved and site disturbance shall be minimized wherever possible.  The applicant shall use native plants, shrubs and trees wherever possible.  Invasive species are prohibited (See NH Department of Agriculture Prohibited Invasive Plant Species Rule, as amended).  Plant species 
§5.1 Amherst Non-Residential Site Plan Review Regulations §6.1 
selected should be hardy for the particular area in which they will be located.  The size, number and type of plants shall be identified on the landscape plan. 
Where an applicant proposes leaving a significant portion of health non-invasive species and other mature vegetation within the proposed construction area, the Board may consider alternative landscaping design.  Removal of existing invasive species on the property is strongly encouraged. 
Section 5.2 Site Features and Layout. 
Landscaping should be designed to encourage biodiversity, remain functional and attractive during all seasons of the year through a thoughtful selection of deciduous, evergreen, flowering and non-flowering plant varieties. 
Prominent natural or man-made features of the landscape such as mature trees, surface waters, natural rock outcrops or roadways should be retained and incorporated in to the landscape plan where possible. Stone walls must be retained in accordance with RSA 472:6 and biodiversity of species is encouraged. The addition of ornamental rocks, fencing and other features new to the landscape are encouraged. 
Existing natural vegetation should be retained where possible. Existing trees and shrubs to be preserved may be substituted for any compatible required plantings. Maximum effort should be made to preserve small stands of trees rather than individual trees to minimize the potential for serious damage due to wind, grade changes or soil compaction. No construction materials, equipment, vehicles or temporary soil deposits shall be located within the drip line of existing trees to be preserved. Protective barriers shall be installed around each plant and/or groups of plants that are to remain on site. Snow fence installed around the drip line of the tree canopy is an example of an acceptable barrier. 
Natural re-growth, mulched planting beds and alternative ground cover plant varieties are preferred to 
large expanses of lawns. Lawn areas should not be planted in strips of less than six (6’) feet in width, 
especially adjacent to roads or parking areas, since such areas require watering but have little utility and are less likely to thrive. 
Native, hybrid and naturalized non-invasive species are encouraged and should be used to meet the minimum requirements of this Section.  Plant varieties selected should be hardy, drought and salt resistant (as necessary) and require minimal maintenance. Less hardy, exotic or higher maintenance plant varieties may be used to supplement minimum landscaping requirements where appropriate, but are not encouraged. Species listed on the current Invasive Species list for New Hampshire and Massachusetts are prohibited. 
To promote on-site water retention and filtration, landscaped areas shall be designed in a manner that guides stormwater from on-site roof areas, impervious roads, parking areas, sidewalks and walkways to vegetated areas or approved retention areas. 
Curbing or equivalent barriers shall be required to protect vegetation from vehicular damage. Barriers shall be designed with openings that allow stormwater to flow into vegetated areas. All curbing in the Town right-of-way shall be granite. 
§5.1 Amherst Non-Residential Site Plan Review Regulations 	§6.1 
When irrigation systems are proposed, a temporary watering plan/schedule or low volume (drip irrigation) system shall be required. Irrigation systems shall be designed and installed for efficient and effective water use to the landscaped area. Permanent irrigation shall utilize water saving technologies, including rain sensors, flowmeters and management systems that monitor current weather conditions. 
Section 5.3 Soil Preparation. 
For all newly landscaped areas a minimum of six (6”) inches of topsoil, preferably with organic matter incorporated shall be spread in all planting and turf areas. 
Section 5.4 Mulching. 
Mulching trees, shrubs and plants helps retain soil moisture, moderates temperature fluctuations, provides protection from mechanical damage by mowers and trimmers and serves as temporary covering of exposed soil until understory plants and ground covers fill in. Excessively thick mulch applications should be avoided. M ulch against tree trunks fosters poor plant health and should be avoided. Mulches for stormwater management areas should be heavier and not a type that will float away. Man-made materials such as recycled tires are not acceptable for mulch materials. 
Section 5.5 Landscape Buffers. 
Landscape plans shall be designed to provide buffers in an effort to mitigate impacts to neighboring properties. Buffers are intended to physically separate one use or property from another so as to visually shield or block, noise, lights, provide a water quality benefit and to minimize other impacts. 
A. 	Along the periphery of a property, buffers are required in the following instances: 
1. 	
Where a proposed non-residential use abuts a residential zoning district. 

2. 	
Where a proposed non-residential use abuts an existing residential use. 

3. 	
Where a proposed roadway abuts an existing property line or is within twenty (20’) feet of a property line where the existing use is residential. 


B. 	B. On the periphery of a property: 
1. 	
A landscaped buffer shall be at least ten (10’) feet in width and six (6’) feet in height to effectively screen from adjacent properties and may consist of evergreens, berms, mounds, fencing or combinations thereof in conjunction with complimenting shrubs and perennials. Chain link fence with privacy slats is discouraged. 

2. 	
Where appropriate existing trees and vegetation shall be incorporated into landscape buffers. 


C. 	Within a property, buffers are required to provide visual screens in the following instances:

2. 	
At least one (1) tree for each thirty feet (30’) of landscaped strip shall be provided. These trees shall be complemented by suitable ground cover and shrubs. 


B. 	Landscaping within parking lots or green space encompassing not less than five (5%) percent of the total parking area shall be required. A minimum of one (1) tree for every fifteen (15) parking spaces shall be provided. These trees shall be complemented by suitable ground cover and shrubs. 
§5.1 Amherst Non-Residential Site Plan Review Regulations 	§6.1 
C. 	Parking lots with more than fifty (50) parking spaces shall have curbed planting areas. Planting areas shall be placed within or at each end of a parking row. No parking row shall contain more than thirty (30) contiguous parking spaces without a curbed planting area. 
1. 	
Curbs around parking lot plantings shall have a shallow descending cut that is a minimum of five (5’) feet wide to allow drainage to flow from the parking lot into the curbed planting areas for infiltration. 

2. 	
Such planting areas shall be underlain by a suitable layer of crushed stone or other water holding reservoir, with an overlay of filter fabric to minimize clogging by superfine soils. 


D. 	Within the interior of the parking lot, landscaping should be used to delineate vehicular and pedestrian circulation patterns. Clear and legible signs, different color and texture paving materials, raised areas, and other techniques should be used to further direct the flow of both vehicular and pedestrian traffic within the site. 
E. 	A minimum four (4) foot wide landscape area shall be provided surrounding each free-standing sign base and should be designed to screen the foundation of the sign without blocking the view of the signage information. 
F. 	Bare soil is not acceptable. The introduction of groundcovers and/or perennials planted en masse and the use of mulch or other natural material as a soil covering is acceptable. However, no more than twenty (20) percent of the minimum landscaped area may be covered with non­living landscaping materials such as bark mulch, woodchips or leaf litter. 
G. 	Use of Existing Landscaping Towards Requirements: 
1. 	
Each existing healthy and native or non-invasive tree, with a caliper of three (3) inches or greater, preserved using proper protection methods within the interior parking lot area may be substituted for one tree required for every fifteen (15) parking spaces. 

2. 	
Where an applicant proposes leaving a significant portion of healthy non-invasive trees and other vegetation within the proposed parking area, the Board may consider alternative landscaping designs. 


Section 5.8 Planting Specifications. 
All trees, shrubs and ground cover shall be planted according to accepted horticultural standards.

Care should be taken to protect root systems from damage due to excavation or compaction. Individual trees, rock formations and other landscape features to be retained should also be clearly marked and bounded on-site. 
Section 5.9 Landscaping Standards – Subdivisions – New Roads. 
Where cul-de-sacs are permitted, the island or center area of the cul-de-sac shall remain in a natural vegetated state, with any invasive species removed. If it will be used as a biofilter for stormwater treatment, the area shall be vegetated with a combination of living plant material including trees, shrubs and groundcovers. Non-living landscape materials may cover up to twenty (20%) percent of the island or center area. When planting of vegetation is required, cul-de-sac landscaping shall be installed after construction of the road is complete. 
Section 5.10 Maintenance of Landscaping. 
Low maintenance, drought, insect and disease resistant plant varieties are encouraged so that buffer areas and other required landscaping can be maintained with minimal care and the need for watering, pesticide or fertilizer use is minimized. For these reasons, native, hybrid and naturalized non­invasive species are preferred since such plant species are well adapted to the local environment. 
To avoid maintenance problems and excessive watering, organic matter such as compost or peat should be added to the soil before planting as appropriate to increase the water holding capacity of the soil and to provide nutrients. 
The owner and their representative shall be responsible for providing, protecting and maintaining all landscaping in healthy and growing condition, and replacing it when necessary to insure continuous conformance with these guidelines. Any landscape element that dies, or is otherwise removed, shall be promptly replaced with the same, if not similar to, height or texture element as originally intended. 
§5.1 Amherst Non-Residential Site Plan Review Regulations 	§6.1 
In addition, landscaped areas shall be kept free of all debris, rubbish, weeds and tall grass. Tall grass is acceptable when incorporated as a design element in an approved landscape plan.

ARTICLE X --AFFORDABLE HOUSING PROJECT SUITABILITY PROCEDURES 
Section 10.1 Purpose. 
A. 	The purpose of the within regulations is to provide the implementation procedure for the Affordable Housing Zoning Ordinance passed by the Town of Amherst at the annual Town Meeting on March 14, 1989, as the same has, from time to time, been amended. Said Ordinance provides certain treatment for projects that meet the criteria set forth with respect to Affordable Housing and requires the Planning Board to review proposed projects as a preliminary matter to determine whether or not they are “suitable” within the meaning of said Ordinance. Additionally, by virtue of amendments to the Ordinance that were adopted in March of 2009, the Town has also sought to render the Ordinance compliant with the directives of the state “workforce housing” law, (SB 342 – 2008 legislative session). 
B. 	Said Ordinance also provides that the Planning Board may adopt regulations governing the process whereby the Affordable Housing Ordinance is implemented and these regulations are intended to accomplish that. In that regard, these regulations are intended to provide for a review 
process wherein the Planning Board will consider an applicant’s project to determine the 
suitability of a particular project within the parameters of the Ordinance, but also to consider the 
issues of whether the housing units being proposed in the project are ‘affordable’ as that term is 
defined in the Ordinance, as well as the extent to which they can be realistically and reasonably constructed within those parameters. In this regard it is the intent of these regulations to provide a 
§10.1 Amherst Non-Residential Site Plan Review Regulations 	§10.3 
process for the applicant to present such information to the Board to enable the Board to make a reasoned and enlightened judgment as to these issues as well as to whether and to what extent to consider any waivers that may be requested in accordance with the terms of the Ordinance. 
C. 	Said Ordinance also establishes a maximum number of units that may be approved in the Town in any calendar year and, accordingly, the Planning Board, in order to implement said Ordinance, must establish an appropriate procedural vehicle for the acceptance, review, and approval of suitable projects having in mind the limitation imposed by the Ordinance. Said regulations are also intended to provide for certain to ensure any project approved and implemented will continue to qualify as a suitable project after it is constructed. 
Section 10.2 Application Procedure. 
A. 	APPLICATION. Applicants seeking to have the Planning Board approve a proposal for an Affordable Housing project that presents “affordable housing” within the meaning of the Ordinance, may apply to the Planning Board for a review of its project pursuant to the conditions set forth herein. Said application shall be received at any time during the year, but will not be approved for construction in any given year unless within the maximum permit number identified in the Ordinance or otherwise waived. 
1. 	Form of Application.  An applicant desiring to apply for a suitability determination pursuant to these regulations shall make application on a form designated by the Town of Amherst Planning Board and shall contain all of the information required to enable the Planning Board to assess said proposal project with reference to the criteria set forth in Section 8.5 of the Town of Amherst Zoning Ordinance. 
Section 10.3 Governing Standards. 
It is understood that the application process for an affordable housing project will require, as a threshold matter, a determination that: 
A. 	The project is “affordable” as that term is defined in the Ordinance; and 
B. 	The project, if approved and constructed, will comply with the affordable housing in general and specific criteria, as more particularly set forth in the Ordinance. 
C. 	Also, if an applicant is seeking any waivers from the general and specific criteria, it shall present sufficient information to inform the Board of the basis for such waiver requests and to address the criteria for such waivers as set forth in the Ordinance at Section 14.4 C. 
§10.4 Amherst Non-Residential Site Plan Review Regulations 	§10.6 
Section 10.4 Required Information. 
A. 	The applicant must present sufficient information to enable the Planning Board to identity the project as complying with the applicable standards. Such information may include, but not necessarily limited to, a preliminary site plan, a land appraisal reporting a current market value as if limited to the legally permissible highest and best use prior to any regulatory allowances, a development cash flow prospectus of sufficient detail demonstrating economic viability or a lack thereof in support of waivers sought under the application, architectural renderings, topographical maps, landscape plans showing existing and / or proposed vegetation, and other information that is necessary, in the judgment of the Planning Board, to enable the Planning Board to make a judgment as to whether or not said proposal meets the general and specific criteria and  / or the standards for any requested waivers, as set forth in the Ordinance.  
B. 	The Planning Board and its administrative staff shall endeavor to advise applicants, when possible, during the period in which applications are received for filing of any additional specific requirements that the Planning Board feels are necessary in order to make a proper determination as to the suitability of a particular project. Failure of an applicant to provide requested information by the time of review of such application may result in a denial of the application. 
Section 10.5 Hearing Process. 
It is understood that the submission of an application under these regulations for suitability determination, constitutes a threshold requirement, but the Planning Board will not make a determination as to the suitability of a particular project unless the same is done at a public hearing with notification to the abutters of the proposed project in order that it may ensure proper input from abutting property owners and other persons who may be affected by the proposed project or who have any information that would be germane to the application. The Planning Board shall schedule the applications for a hearing and decide in a statutorily timely manner assuming all required information has been provided to the Board. 
Section 10.6 Conditions of Approval.  
A. 	In order to ensure that the purpose of the Affordable Housing Ordinance is met, the applicant shall be required as a condition of the finding of suitability to provide, among any other requirements, to the Planning Board a document in the form of a Declaration of Covenants or some other type of instrument satisfactory to Counsel and the Board, in form suitable for recordation in the Hillsborough County Registry of Deeds which document will encumber the property which is the subject of the application with appropriate conditions and requirements to ensure that the sale or lease of the dwelling units proposed in said application will be restricted to those persons qualified pursuant to the definition of affordable housing contained in Section 8.5 of the Ordinance. The applicant will be required to submit a proposed form of this document in the course of the application for suitability determination and no permits for the construction of any dwelling unit approved hereunder shall be granted until such time as said document has been received by the 
§10.6 Amherst Non-Residential Site Plan Review Regulations 	§11.1 
Planning Board, reviewed and approved by Counsel and the Board and is recorded in the Hillsborough County Registry of Deeds so as to restrict the property accordingly. Such document shall make adequate provision for the continuation of such restrictions for the length of the time designated in the Ordinance and shall identify, in such document, such private or public agency which will agree to monitor and administer the future sale(s) and / or occupancy of the property in a manner calculated to insure compliance with the intent and letter of the Ordinance. 
B. 	In the event the Planning Board determines a project not to be suitable, the Board shall make written findings of its reasons for the same and in the event that the Planning Board divides the available permits among successful applicants in a way that favors any particular application, the Planning Board shall also make findings in the record of the proceedings indicating the justification for its apportionment.

3. 	
Flat roofs are strongly discouraged unless the Planning Board finds that a proposal can provide appropriate visual appeal. 

4. 	
In cases where pitched roofs are not practical, the use of false building fronts shall be used to imitate pitched roofs to vary the horizontal lines along portions of the façade to create the appearance of multiple attached buildings. 

5. 	
Where appropriate, roofs shall provide adequate overhands for pedestrian activity. 

6. 	
Roof materials shall be comprised of high quality, durable and architecturally consistent materials, including but not limited to, concrete tile, asphalt shingles and standing seam metal. 

7. 	
In all cases, all roof top mechanical units shall be screened so as not to be visible from road level or from public areas from ground level.  Screening may be accomplished through architectural treatments including walls, parapets, false chimneys or cupolas. 


E. 	Architectural features and details shall be considered in every building design. 
1. Traditional features and details such as columns, pilasters, canopies, porticos, awnings or 
arches associated with Amherst’s architectural heritage are strongly encouraged. 
2. 	
Long expanses of repetitive architectural elements and flat unarticulated wall surfaces shall be avoided.

These regulations are promulgated under the authority of and in accordance with RSA 674 and 675. 
ARTICLE I — PURPOSES 
A. 	The purpose of these Regulations is to guide construction, maintenance, and rehabilitation of properties in the Amherst Historic District so as to preserve the distinctive character and integrity of the district. The Regulations are intended to ensure that properties in the district are not altered inappropriately. The goal in developing these Regulations is to set up clear and objective rules so that decisions and permits are not based on the personal tastes and preferences of Commission members reviewing proposals for change. 
B. 	Whenever an application for the construction, maintenance, or rehabilitation of a property in the Amherst Historic District is received, the Historic District Commission shall consider said application; and if the commission finds that the applicant meets the general criteria set forth herein, it shall grant the requested permit. 
ARTICLE II — GENERAL CRITERIA 
In making a determination on an application, the Historic District Commission shall take into account these Regulations as follows: 
A. 	The historical, architectural, or cultural value of subject buildings, structures, or landscapes and their relationship and contribution to the setting; 
B. 	The compatibility of the exterior design, arrangement of elements, texture and materials proposed to be used in relationship to existing buildings or structures and their setting; 
C. 	The scale and general size of new construction in relationship to existing surroundings, with consideration of such factors as height, width, street frontage, number of stories, roof type, (windows, doors etc.), and architectural details; 
D. 	Other factors including yards, off-street parking, screening, fencing, entrance drives, sidewalks, signs, lights, and/or landscaping which might affect the character of any building or structure within the district and similar factors which relate to the setting for such structure or grouping of structures; 
E. 	The impact that the applicant’s proposal will have on the setting and the extent to which it will preserve and enhance the historical, architectural, and cultural qualities of the district and community. 
F. 	Structures or sites which are architecturally important as unique constructions or as exceptionally fine examples of their period, region, or style (Significant Structures) should be altered only so as to conform more closely to their original or most characteristic appearance. In such cases, the original appearance must be determined through convincing documentation by the applicant. 
G. 	These regulations shall be most strictly enforced for structures, facilities, and conditions within the public view. The public view shall include neighboring properties to the extent that the structure, facility, or condition may be reasonably observed from neighboring property. 
H. 	The  Commission shall have the discretion to waive any condition contained in these Regulations for good cause shown. A waiver of these Regulations will be granted if each of the following conditions is found (07-18-13): 
1. 	
Granting the waiver would benefit the public interest. 

2. 	
By granting the waiver substantial justice would be done. 

3. 	
Granting the waiver would not be contrary to the spirit and intent of the regulations. 

4. 	
Granting the waiver would not be detrimental to the historic character, environment, scenic value, or general welfare of the Town. 


ARTICLE III — PRESERVATION GUIDELINES 
A. 	For guidance and recommendations on rehabilitation, preservation, and maintenance homeowners are encouraged to refer to the U.S. Secretary of the Interior’s Standards for Rehabilitation. 
B. 	The Commission shall be guided by the following principals: 
1. 	
Every reasonable effort shall be made to provide a compatible use for a property which requires minimal alteration of the building, structure, or site and its environment, or to use a property for its originally intended purpose. 

2. 	
The distinguishing original qualities or character of a building, structure, or site and its environment shall not be destroyed. The removal or alteration of any historical material or distinctive architectural features should be avoided when possible, and additions or changes inconsistent with these goals should be discouraged. 

3. 	
All buildings, structures, and sites shall be recognized as products of their own time. Alterations that have no historical basis and which seek to create an earlier appearance shall be discouraged. 

4. 	
Changes which may have taken place in the course of time are evidence of the history and development of a building, structure, or site and its environment. These changes may have acquired significance in their own right, and this significance shall be recognized and respected. 

5. 	
Distinctive stylistic features or examples of skilled craftsmanship which characterize a building, structure, or site shall be treated with sensitivity. 

6. 	
Deteriorated architectural features shall be repaired rather than replaced, whenever possible. In the event replacement is necessary, the new material should match the material being replaced in composition, design, texture, and other visual qualities. Repair or replacement of missing architectural features should be based on accurate duplications of features substantiated by historical, physical, or pictorial evidence rather than on conjectural designs or the availability of different architectural elements from other buildings or structures. 


ARTICLE IV — RELOCATION AND DEMOLITION 
Buildings shall not be demolished or removed from their present sites except for good cause shown. Applicants shall have made a reasonable effort to maintain the existing structure on the existing site. 
ARTICLE V — MINIMUM MAINTENANCE 
A. 	Owners of all buildings shall provide sufficient maintenance to keep such buildings from falling into a state of disrepair. Owners shall therefore be responsible for taking at least the minimum steps necessary to prevent the deterioration of components which could cause an unsafe condition or a detrimental effect upon the character of the Historic District or which could lead to a later claim that deterioration has become so advanced that demolition or removal of architectural features is necessary. 
B. 	In cases where deterioration has already progressed to an advanced state and where immediate removal is requested by the owner, the standards for review of demolition contained in the U. S. Secretary of the Interior’s Standards for Rehabilitation shall be applied. In all cases, where at all applicable, non­structural architectural features shall be repaired. In situations where it is impracticable to repair these features or prohibitively expensive to replicate them, they shall be stored and not discarded. 
ARTICLE VI — CHANGES TO EXISTING STRUCTURES 
A. 	The historical architectural character of a building or structure --expressed by design, style rhythm, form, massing, scale, proportions, features, and materials --shall be maintained or restored. When a change is proposed, significant existing materials and elements shall be retained whenever possible. 
B. 	Use of synthetic (typically, aluminum or vinyl) siding shall not be permitted. Structures including fencing shall be constructed from natural materials (i.e. no vinyl, plastic, PVC or chain link) (03-99) 
C. 	Any new design elements introduced shall respect the character and history of the building. The design of such elements shall not seek to create an appearance earlier than that appropriate for the building. 
D. 	The choice of color is not regulated, but it is recommended that colors be compatible with those used on other historical buildings in the neighborhood. 
E. 	Existing historical doors shall be retained and rehabilitated wherever possible. Where doorways must be altered, doors and entranceways shall be designed to respect the exterior architectural integrity of the building. Storm doors and screen doors shall have plain --not scalloped or cross buck --stiles, rails, and panels and shall not have false “historical” hardware. 
F. 	Existing historical windows shall be retained and repaired wherever possible. Where replacement is essential, new windows should match the originals or be in character with the building as may be reasonably achievable. The original window type (hung sash, casement, pivot, etc.) should be retained as should the configuration of the individual panes of glass formed by the muntin grid. Multi-paned sash should have true panes formed by true muntins and should not utilize applied or embedded muntin grids. The original width and depth of the individual elements (such as exterior molding and/or casing, exterior frame, exterior sash members, and exterior muntins) should be reproduced or be closely approximated. For windows added as a part of an addition or new windows in the existing structure, the above regulations are recommended practices. 
G. 	Features which give a roof historical character shall be preserved or restored to the extent that such features are visible from the ground. Principal considerations include the original roof shape; original roofing materials or materials compatible with the old in composition, size, shape, color, and texture; architectural details such as dormer windows, monitors, cupolas, cornices, bargeboards, brackets, chimneys, cresting, and weathervanes. 
H. 	Outdoor mechanical equipment (ducts, fans, air conditioners, etc.) shall be installed in locations which create the least disturbance to the historical appearance of the building and which involve the minimum alteration to its structural integrity. Landscape buffers may be used. 
I. 	All existing historical elements such as windows, doors, moldings, etc., shall be retained and rehabilitated whenever possible.  Replacement is not permitted for the purposes of greater convenience or energy efficiency unless it can be demonstrated that the great convenience or energy efficiency is substantially more that what can be achieved through rehabilitation. Such demonstration shall be consistent of documentation from recognized preservationists, craftsmen, or architects who have expertise in historical rehabilitation or other such experts as appropriate.  The applicant has the burden to provide such documentation.  (One resource for locating experts is the “Old House & Barn Resource Directory” that is published by the New Hampshire Preservation Alliance.) In the case of windows, the use of storm windows is encouraged to both preserve the existing historic windows and to provide energy efficiency. (06-2009) 
ARTICLE VII — CONSTRUCTION OF NEW BUSINESS 
A. 	New construction shall be complementary to the configuration of existing buildings and streetscapes, including in height and width, and shall be governed by these Regulations as appropriately interpreted for new construction. 
B. 	Construction of New building: New building massing and style shall be distinctly residential in character, drawing on local historical design elements that are consistent with rural village characteristics of Amherst Historic District architecture. Place garage entrances on an inconspicuous side or rear elevation out of the public view or, failing this, well set back from the house façade. (06­2009) 
C. 	Each housing development shall be designed and constructed to complement and harmonize with the Amherst Historic District, particularly with regard to size and scale of the development and its prominence and visibility to the community generally and to surrounding neighborhoods in particular.  Housing developments shall include a wide variety of house sizes and lots, a mix of styles, and open spaces, reflecting the same in the Historic District. Housing developments shall be landscaped to enhance their compatibility with surrounding areas, with emphasis given to the utilization of natural features wherever possible. (06-2009) 
D. 	New construction that replaces a previous structure that was recently destroyed or removed shall have consistency in scale and style with the previous structure, where the degree of consistency in scale and style shall be highest for previous structures that were: 
1. 	
Historically significant in style or architectural details, or 

2. 	
In a prominent location. (06-2009) 


ARTICLE VIII — STREETSCAPE (05-2003) 
Section 8.1 General. 
A. 	The establishment of off-street parking shall be encouraged to be placed to the rear of buildings where such is reasonable and available, and fenced or screened with appropriate plantings. 
B. 	Any alterations requiring changes to the topography of any property which shall materially change the landscape shall require an application to the Historic District Commission. Where changes in the existing ground level are necessitated by installation of foundations or sewage systems, etc., the Commission may require appropriate fill, grading, or planting to render the altered area compatible with its surroundings. 
C. 	Reasonable efforts to preserve historical and traditional markings for property boundaries and grounds --such as stonewalls, fences, and tree borders --should be undertaken. Replication or extensions may be introduced where appropriate. Extensions such as fencing must be made of natural materials. (03­1999) 
D. 	The visual impact of telephone and electrical wires and meters as well as all other utility structures and equipment shall be minimized. Meters shall not be placed on the primary facade of a building but shall be located so as not to limit access by public service personnel. Personal wireless service facilities, as defined by the Telecommunications Act of l996, and including accessory and related structures must use concealment techniques and/or engineering designs which minimize the height and visibility of any structures including designs which promote the use of any existing structures to the extent technologically the character and integrity of the Historic District. Applicants must demonstrate that they have met or attempted to meet this standard utilizing state of the art technology and alternatives before approval by the Board. 
E. 	Public visibility of any of the following may be ordered to be minimized or concealed where the condition is to not be in character with the Historic District: 
1. 	Man-made decorative objects, large or obtrusive personal property, equipment, and machinery such as bulldozers, storage sheds or outbuildings, landscaping features, and modern appurtenances such as above-ground pools, tennis courts, antennae, and trash receptacles. 
F. 	Mailbox posts and supports shall be simple in style.  For example, they should be made of wood and be simple in design with nothing ornate and little or no carved details. (06-2009) 
Section 8.2 Removal of Mature Trees. 
Every effort should be made to maintain and protect mature trees that contribute to the character of the Historic District. (10-2013) 
A. 	Approval. A Certificate of Approval from the Historic District Commission shall be required for the removal of any mature tree on public or private property within the Historic District. 
B. 	Exemption. Specifically exempted from this requirement, but subject to the “notice to cut” requirements in 8.2D, are trees that are completely dead, showing absolutely no sign of leaf growth on any branch during peak growing season or by authorization of the Board of Selectmen in accordance with RSA 
213:145. 
Dying, decaying, or diseased trees still require a Certificate of Approval for removal since this determination is highly judgmental and may require expert opinion. In making such a determination, the Historic District Commission may at its sole discretion seek the advice of the Tree Warden, Amherst Conservation Commission, and/or a qualified arborist. 

C. 	
Definition. For the purpose of this provision and in keeping with similar provisions governing the removal of trees on “scenic roads” (see RSA 231:158), “mature trees” shall be defined as any tree that contributes to the character of the district and that exceeds fifteen inches (15”) in diameter at a height of four feet (4’) above grade and is located between the street and the rear of the main building on the property and/or provides a canopy to the street. 

D. 	
Notice to cut. Upon filing an application to remove a mature tree, the applicant shall immediately mark the tree with orange tape to indicate that it is at risk of being removed.  If the application is approved, the orange tape shall remain on the tree for twenty (20) days past the date of approval, after which, if there are no appeals, the tree may be removed.  For those trees that meet the exemption requirements in 8.2B, the owner shall file an application with the Historic District Commission to remove the tree and shall clearly mark the tree with orange tape.  The Town’s Tree Warden will inspect the tree within seven 


(7) days of the application submittal and make a determination if the tree complies with 8.2B Exemption.   
1. 	
If the tree is determined to comply with 8.2B Exemption, the applicant will be issued a Certificate of Approval to remove the tree in accordance with 8.2E, and the tree may be removed immediately. 

2. 	
If the tree is determined to be outside of the 8.2B Exemption, the application shall be placed on the next meeting agenda for review by the Historic District Commission. 


E. 	Minimum Requirements. When a tree is approved for removal, the following minimum requirements shall apply: 
1. 
The tree stump shall be ground down or removed to at least six (6) inches below grade level. 

2. 	
In cases where the tree is being removed because it is dead, dying, diseased, or decayed, the tree shall be replaced with one (1) of a native species that will grow to the same size as the one removed. For the replacement of any tree(s) to be deemed as inappropriate, due to implications of threat to public safety and/or damage to adjacent structures or other personal property, replacement as otherwise required, may be waived by vote of Approval from the Historic District Commission. 


Section 8.3 Walkways, Sidewalks, Roadway, Parking, and Curbing 
A. 	Walkways shall be brick, granite, stone, stone dust, or a narrow paved path. 
B. 	Sidewalks shall be brick or a narrow paved path. Sidewalks should generally be three (3) feet wide and should not exceed four (4) feet in width. Where there is sufficient space, a strip of grass between the sidewalk and road should be maintained. Road widths should not be increased beyond the existing, and intersections should not be widened. Striping of roadways should not be done or be kept to a minimum doing only what is needed to meet regulatory and safety requirements; in particular the center striping should be a single yellow line and not the double yellow line that is found on highways. Alternate materials are encouraged for crosswalks, parking lines, and bike lanes; such materials include brick or granite.  Parking areas should be left unpaved. Surfaces that are impervious to water such as asphalt or brick should not be used. Surfaces that are encouraged include gravel, stone dust, and paving blocks.  Curbing should not be used along roadways or driveways. Existing curbing should not be extended. Removal of existing curbing is encouraged, when it is practical to do so as part of on-going projects in those areas. (06-2009) 
ARTICLE IX — FENCES (05-2003) 
Section 9.1 General. 
A Fence is a highly visible, architectural feature that should enhance the character of the house, street, and Historic District.  The Commission encourages the replacement over time of fences that do not conform to these guidelines.  Existing fences that resemble their historic styles shall only be replaced in kind. New fences intended to replace missing fences shall reproduce the historic style wherever possible, provided sufficient documentary evidence exists. 
Section 9.2 Applicant’s Intent. 
One’s intent for installing a new fence or changing the style or construction of an existing fence must be clearly stated when applying for a Certificate of Approval. The desire for privacy and/or to enclose children or pets is not an acceptable reason of itself. Acceptable reasons include: 
A. 	Restoring a well-documented historic fence, the standards for which shall be the same as those for restoration of a missing architectural feature; 
B. 	Replacing an inappropriate contemporary style fence with a historically appropriate style; 
C. 	Changing a fence style to better complement the rhythm of existing fences of the streetscape; 
D. 	Installing a new fence where one (1) is absent and such absence breaks the well-defined rhythm of existing fences on the streetscape; 
E. 	Protecting the value of a residential property from the negative economic impact of an adjoining commercial property (see privacy fence guidelines). 
F. 	Installing a new fence where the style and location are in keeping with these guidelines. 
Section 9.3 Cause for Relief. 
The basis upon which relief from these Regulations may be granted is stated in Section 2.1H. Relief will not be granted based solely upon; 
A. 	Photographic evidence of other fences in the Historic District that do not currently meet these guidelines; 
B. 	The applicant’s personal reference for a non-conforming style of fence; 
C. 	Relative costs of construction or maintenance among various styles of fences; 
D. 	Dislike of one’s neighbor or dissatisfaction with a neighbor’s habits. 

A spite fence near Ossipee built by Thomas Plant. When he was turned down trying to buy his neighbor’s land, he built this fence of cast-off lumber directly across the street in their full view. 
Section 9.4 Demolition. 
Fence applications shall not be approved without clear photographs, sketched and/or drawings that depict the exact location and accurately represent the proposed final product along with a description of materials and measurements of all members including spacing between members (i.e., posts, rails, distance between pickets, heights, etc.). 
Section 9.5 Acceptable Styles. 
The fence should be in harmony with the style of the house and rhythm of the streetscape (e.g., simple fence with a vernacular house, simple or high-style house picket fence along a paced sidewalk etc.) Acceptable fences generally include: 
A. Post & rail with wooden posts and wither timber or board rails.  The number of rails should be two 
(2) [if timber] and three (3) or four (4) [if board]. Board rail fences should have a face board on the posts and a board cap along the top. 

Timber rails. 	Board rails with board cap. 
B. 	Picket with wooden posts and wither flat or square pickets, with or without baseboard.  Flat pickets shall not be excessively decorative. 

Flat pickets. 	Square pickets. 
C. Baluster (i.e., basically a picket fence with a baseboard and cap rail) with either flat or square balusters. 

Flat Balusters 
Section 9.6 Unacceptable Styles. 
Chain Link, barbed wire, woven wire, masonry, stockade, lattice, basket weave, and board-on-board are not acceptable.  Stone walls generally are not appropriate along village streets and between closely position residences in the village.  Dry laid stone walls are acceptable as traditional boundaries between pastures and along country roads (e.g., Mack Hill Road., Jones Road.). 
Section 9.7 Streetscape. 
A variety of styles of connecting or abutting fences between separate properties along a common street is discouraged (e.g., mixing picket with post & rail). Variety of construction and pattern within a given style is encouraged (see Section 9.11). 
Section 9.8 Privacy Fences. 
A. 	Privacy fences are allowed only on an exception basis, under extremely limited circumstances, and for good cause shown (e.g., as a visual barrier between residential and commercial properties to protect the historic integrity of the residential property). 
B. 	Privacy fences generally will not be allowed to separate residential properties if the fence would be visible to the public view. Privacy, per se, shall not be considered sufficient cause for relief. 
C. 	Landscaping is required with privacy fencing. The first course is to consider natural vegetation as an alternative buffer to a privacy fence. Where a privacy fence is approved, the applicant may be required to plant in front of it to soften the fence to the public view. 
D. 	Since privacy fences are functional, not ornamental, only one (1) type is permitted: solid board, straight top with molded cap, post caps allowed, maximum six (6) feet tall. 
E. 	Decorative picket, lattice, or other ornamental treatments along the top of the fence are prohibited. Applied or carved finials are prohibited. 
F. 	Privacy fencing around pools and spas will be minimum four (4) feet [encouraged] and maximum six 
(6) feet [discouraged], which must be removed if the pool or spa is ever removed. 

Four (4) foot solid board fence with molded caps and post caps enclosing a swimming pool and spa. 
Section 9.9 Proportions. 
The height of the fence and the size of the various members (rails, posts, pickets, finials, caps, braces, gates, and panels) and the spacing between pickets, rails, and posts shall be appropriate to the style of fence chosen. For example, materials that are too diminutive and spacing between pickets/railings that are too open give the historically uncharacteristic impression of lesser quality or poor craftsmanship and are discouraged. (In our colonial period, public officials known as “fence viewers” were appointed to ensure that fences were built “sheep high, bull strong, and hog tight.”) 

Diminutive posts.                                                    Excessive picket spacing. 
Section 9.10 Materials. 
Fences shall be built of all natural materials (e.g., no vinyl). Sawn or partially sawn granite posts are not allowed. When restoring a granite post fence, use posts that are split in the same manner as the missing historic posts. 


Historic split granite.   Modern sawn/split granite. 
Section 9.11 Construction. 
Fences pre-built in sections or kit form often create a “packaged” look and will not necessarily conform to these guidelines. Rails shall not be doweled to the posts, unless the dowel is sufficiently hidden by pickets or balusters. Rails should be butt-jointed and toe-nailed to the posts (or mounted on brackets in the case of granite posts). While the Commission limits the number of fence styles, it strongly encourages variety in fence construction and pattern within those styles. Too many fences of the same manufacturer or construction will give the district an historically uncharacteristic uniform or “packaged” look. 

Butt-joint (acceptable) 	Dowel Joint (not acceptable) 
Section 9.12 Paint. 
Post & rail, picket, and baluster fences shall be painted.  Split rail horse fences shall be left natural or treated with a clear stain. Privacy fences may be left natural at the option of the Commission if it is determined that the weathered wood will be less pronounced. 
Section 9.13 Gates. 
Gates shall generally be of the same style as the fence to which they are attached, unless otherwise documented historically. 

Section 9.14 Abutting Properties. 
A. 	In accordance with Section 12.6, B.5.b of the Rules of Procedure, all abutters shall be notified of application for fencing. 
B. 	The best side of the fence shall face out from the property. 
C. 	Fencing shall not restrict the views of neighboring residential properties. 
Section 9.15 Property Line Disputes. 
The Historic District Commission will not review a fence application if there is an unresolved property line dispute. In the event of such dispute, the application will be denied, and the fee refunded. Once the dispute is settled, the applicant may re-apply without prejudice.  If the fence is approved, the burden is on the applicant to ensure that it is built within the limits of his or her own property lines. 
Section 9.16 Retaining Walls. 
Retaining walls by their nature have a high visual impact because of their bulk and mass and are generally discouraged.  Retaining walls shall not be allowed in those cases where enough land exists to re-grade and avoid the need for a retaining wall. Where allowed, retaining walls should be constructed of fieldstone, preferably laid dry. Retaining walls of railroad ties, timber, or interlocking concrete block are not acceptable where visible to the public or abutting properties.  
ARTICLE X — NEW EXTERIOR ADDITIONS (2000) 
A. 	Significant historic materials and features should be preserved. 
1. 	
The design of an addition on a primary elevation or other character-defining elevation must not materially obscure damage, diminish, or otherwise negatively impact the primary elevation or other character-defining features of that structure. 

2. 
Minimize loss of historic material comprising external walls. 


B. 	The design of the new addition should complement, not compete with or detract from, the historic character of the original structure. 
1. 	
Make the scale, massing, and proportions of the new addition compatible with the original building to ensure that its historic form is not lost or compromised.  

2. 	
Locate or set back the new addition on a secondary or inconspicuous elevation so that the new work does not result in a radical change to the historic form and character of the building from its primary view(s). 


C. 	The historic character of the original structure shall be protected so that the old work remains visually distinct. 
1. 	Consider the new addition both in terms of the use and the appearance of other buildings in the Historic District.  The new addition may reference design motifs from the historic building to which it is attached.  However, it should complement, not compete with or detract from, the original historic structure in terms of massing, scale, proportions, materials, texture, and detailing. 
D. 	Historic and other character-defining settings around the structure shall be preserved. 
1. 	New additions should be compatible with the historic character of the immediate setting as well as the surrounding and neighboring areas and structures.  Historic relationships within the setting and surrounding area should be preserved in terms of massing, scale, design, material, texture, and 
relationship of solids to voids.

a. 	Purpose.  The purpose of the meeting is to allow for an informal exchange between the 
applicant and the Commission to review the basic concept of the proposal and offer 

suggestions which might be of assistance in resolving problems with meeting requirements during final consideration.  In this manner, the Commission may provide preliminary, non-binding guidance on the suitability of the proposal with a minimum burden of expense on the applicant.  Such consultation shall bind neither the applicant nor the Commission and statements made by Commission members shall not form a basis for disqualifying said members or invalidating any action taken.

Materials.  Materials presented for this discussion should include plats, site plans, drawings, photographs, or other sufficient information to allow for a meaningful understanding of the intended conceptual design. 

c. 	
Notice.  Such discussion may occur without necessity of giving formal, public notice as otherwise required under Section 12.6, B.5.c, but such discussions may occur only at formal meetings of the Commission. 


7. 	
Due Diligence.  The Commission may table, within the limits imposed by Section 12.6, A.4, final consideration of an application for the purposes of seeking advice, recommendations, or reports from professional, educational, cultural, civic, or other groups or persons as may be deemed necessary for the determination of a reasonable decision. 

8. 	
Appeals.  Any person or persons jointly or severally aggrieved by a decision of the Commission shall have a right to appeal to the Zoning Board of Adjustment.  Upon appeal, the Zoning Board of Adjustment shall review the decision of the Commission to determine whether the decision conforms to the provisions of the Historic District Zoning overlay and to these Rules of Procedure adopted thereunder.

E. 	When uncertainty arises as to the application of these provisions to a Commission member in particular circumstances, the Commission shall, upon the request of that member or another member of the Commission, vote on the question of whether that member should be disqualified.

SECTION G
SEPTIC SYSTEM ORDINANCE
ARTICLE I - PREAMBLE & HISTORY
A. Pursuant to authority granted under RSA Chapter 147, I, on April 12, 1976, the Amherst Board of
Health, consisting of Dr. James Starke and the Board of Selectmen, adopted these Septic System
Ordinance in order to promote public health, safety, and welfare of the citizens of the Town of
Amherst, New Hampshire. This ordinance, which became effective on May 15, l976, were
subsequently amended by the Board of Health on June 25, 2003, and May 28, 2014.
ARTICLE II - PURPOSE
A. The purpose of this ordinance is to prevent the pollution of water supplies, ground water, and
surface water of the Town of Amherst by reason of inadequate sewer or lack of proper wastewater
disposal system accommodations.
ARTICLE III - APPLICABILITY
A. No person shall construct any structure from which sewage or wastewater will discharge; nor
construct, repair, or alter any wastewater disposal system within the Town of Amherst without
prior approval of plans and specifications by both the Town of Amherst and the New Hampshire
Department of Environmental Services (NHDES) pursuant to authority of Chapter Env-Wq 1000
of the New Hampshire Code of Administrative Rules.
B. Conversion of Seasonal Dwellings. No person shall convert any structure, which here-to-date has
been maintained and/or occupied as a seasonal dwelling (such as a camp or cottage) to yeararound residential use prior to installation of an approved wastewater disposal system conforming
to the requirements of this ordinance and which has received a valid “Approval for Operation”
number issued by NHDES. If the lot is non-conforming with respect to minimum lot size, the
septic design may incorporate an approved effluent pre-treatment processor in the system. For the
purpose of this ordinance, the term “seasonal dwelling” shall mean a dwelling which:
1. Was listed as seasonal through the 1976 seasonal listings database, and as currently listed on
the assessing property record card; or
2. Has historically been occupied for not more than six (6) consecutive months during a given
calendar year.
 
§3 Town of Amherst Septic System Regulations §5
G-3
C. Change of Occupancy or Use. No person shall change the occupancy or use or increase occupant
loads of any structure prior to an evaluation by a licensed septic designer of current wastewater
disposal system capacity. If insufficient capacity is determined for the proposed occupancy, use,
or loading, a new wastewater disposal system design shall be required by both the Town of
Amherst and the NHDES prior to the issuance of any permits.
ARTICLE IV - PERMIT REQUIRED
A. Septic permits shall be obtained from the Town of Amherst and, if required, from the NHDES
prior to:
1. Alteration, repair, or replacement of any existing wastewater disposal system, including septic
tank replacements. New replacement tanks must be properly sized for existing (or proposed)
flow based on NHES requirements in effect at the time of replacement.
2. Construction of any new wastewater disposal system.
3. Construction of a structure from which wastewater will discharge. Building permits for
construction work shall not be issued unless and until both NHDES and local approvals for
the wastewater disposal system intended to serve that structure have been issued and are on
file at the Community Development Office.
4. Conversion of a seasonal dwelling to year-round residency.
5. Septic Evaluation is required for any change of use, occupancy, or increase in occupant loads.
If the results of the evaluation determine insufficient capacity of the existing system for the
proposed change of use, occupancy, or loading, a new septic system design must receive State
and Town approval for construction prior to issuance of a building permit. For commercial
uses, installation shall be required prior to the issuance of a certificate of occupancy. Loading
which exceeds current allowable lot loading standards shall not be permitted.

AMHERST STORMWATER REGULATION
ARTICLE I -- Purpose and Goals
Section 1.1 Purpose and Goals.
The purpose of this Regulation is to control runoff and soil erosion and sedimentation resulting
from site construction and development and to comply with US Environmental Protection Agency
(EPA) Stormwater Management legislation. This Regulation covers areas including but not limited
to: Urbanized Areas, Critical Areas and the area designated by the EPA as a Municipal Separate
Storm Sewer System (MS4) area. Subdivisions and site plans shall include plans for managing
stormwater and controlling erosion and sedimentation as provided below. Any errors or omissions
in these Regulations shall not exempt applications from complying with applicable State and
Federal Statutes. In the event of conflicting requirements, pursuant to NH RSA 676:14 the stricter
standard applies as stated in the Conflict and Severability and Conflicting Provisions sections of
Amherst’s Ordinance and Regulations. The regulation shall become effective upon adoption by the
Town of Amherst Board of Health, the Board of Selectmen, and the Planning Board, in accordance
with the provisions of RSA 147, 41:11, RSA 674:16 &17 and 674:36 & 44.
Section 1.2 Abbreviations/Definitions.

incorporated the same by reference as a requirement of its subdivision and site plan
regulations so that the plan and application contemplated hereunder should be presented to 
§1.4 Amherst Stormwater Regulation §1.4
I-5
the Planning Board in connection with any such application as well. Such submission to the
Planning Board shall be in addition to any requirements relating to stormwater drainage
system design that may also be contained in applicable subdivision and/or site plan
regulations.)
1. All measures in the plan shall meet as a minimum the Best Management Practices set
forth in the “Stormwater Management and Erosion and Sediment Control Handbook for
Urban and Developing Areas in New Hampshire, Rockingham County Conservation
District, NH Department of Environmental Services, Soil Conservation Service (now the
Natural Resources Conservation Service), August 1992, as amended from time to time.
Additional BMPs are available at the following locations:
a. http://www.des.state.nh.us/factsheets/wqe/wqe-6.htm - NHDES Environmental Fact
Sheet WD-WQE-6, (Soil Erosion and Sediment control on Construction Sites, 1996)
b. http://cfpub.epa.gov/npdes/stormwater/menuofbmps/menu.cfm - EPA National
Pollution Discharge Elimination System, (NPDES) (Stormwater Menu of Best
Management Practices (BMPs).
c. http://cfpub.epa.gov/npdes/stormwater/menuofbmps/con_site.cfm -EPA NPDES
(Construction Site Stormwater Runoff Control).
2. Whenever practical, natural vegetation shall be retained, protected or supplemented. The
stripping of vegetation shall be done in a manner that minimizes soil erosion.
3. Appropriate erosion and sediment control measures shall be installed prior to soil
disturbance.
4. The area of disturbance shall be kept to a minimum. Disturbed areas remaining idle for
more than thirty (30) days shall be stabilized.
5. Measures shall be taken to control erosion within the project area. Sediment in runoff
water shall be trapped and retained within the project area using approved measures.
Wetland areas and surface waters shall be protected from sediment.
6. Off-site surface water and runoff from undisturbed areas shall be diverted away from
disturbed areas where feasible or carried without erosion through the project area.
Integrity of downstream drainage systems shall be maintained.
7. Measures shall be taken to control the post-development peak rate of runoff so that it
does not exceed pre-development runoff for the two (2) year, twenty-four (24) hour
storm event and for additional storm event frequencies as specified in the design criteria
of the “Stormwater Management and Erosion and Sediment Control Handbook for
Urban and Developing Areas in New Hampshire.”
8. Priority should be given to preserving natural drainage systems including perennial and
intermittent streams, wetlands, swales, and drainage ditches for conveyance of runoff
leaving the project area.
§1.4 Amherst Stormwater Regulation §1.4
I-6
9. All temporary erosion and sediment control measures shall be removed after final site
stabilization. Trapped sediment and other disturbed soil areas resulting from the removal
of temporary measures shall be permanently stabilized within thirty (30) days unless
conditions dictate otherwise.
10. Naturally occurring streams, channels, and wetlands shall be used for conveyance of
runoff leaving the project area only after appropriate sedimentation control measures
have been employed.
B. Permanent Stormwater Management Design Criteria. The following standards shall be
applied in planning for stormwater management and erosion control as related to long-term
management of municipal water quality:
1. Under One (1) Acre of Disturbance.
a. Within the urbanized area (UA) will require a basic stormwater quality management
system. At a minimum, all stormwater must pass through basic pretreatment (beyond
catch basin sumps) prior to leaving the site.
b. Outside of the UA water quality measures will be required on a case-by-case basis.
2. Over One (1) Acre of Disturbance.
a. Within the UA requires a well thought out, systematic, permanent stormwater quality
management system. Latest technology and most up-to-date performance data must
be considered when selecting permanent control measures. As noted above, catch
basin sumps alone are not considered a valid water quality control measure.
Mechanical devices may be required to supplement any proposal. Maintenance
programs and schedules will be required as part of the proposal. Off-site water
quality control measures may require long-term escrow funds to cover future
maintenance expenses. Sites with appropriate separation to the seasonal high
groundwater table must also consider groundwater recharge. All groundwater
recharge systems will require on-site test pit and percolation test data to be submitted
as part of the review.
b. Outside the UA requires a basic systematic permanent stormwater quality
management system. Catch basin sumps alone are not considered a valid water
quality control measure.
3. Adjacent to the Wetlands Buffer (Any Size Disturbance).
a. Any new project adjacent to the wetlands buffer will require permanent water quality
control measures.
b. Projects involving redevelopment or expansion will be considered on a case-by-case
basis.
4. Municipal Projects. All municipal projects will also consider inclusion of water quality
control measures.
C. Permanent Stormwater Management Technical Design Criteria.
§1.4 Amherst Stormwater Regulation §1.4
I-7
1. All measures in the plan shall meet as a minimum the Best Management Practices set
forth in the “Stormwater Management and Erosion and Sediment Control Handbook for
Urban and Developing Areas in New Hampshire,” Rockingham County Conservation
District, NH Department of Environmental Services, Soil Conservation Service (now the
Natural Resources Conservation Service), August 1992, as amended from time to time.
2. The design of proposed features must consider the following:
a. Existing and proposed methods of handling stormwater runoff so that there will be
no increase in the amount of runoff that leaves the boundaries of the site. (The Board
of Health may permit an increase in off-site stormwater runoff on submission of a
detailed downstream study and on the recommendation of the Town.)
b. Engineering calculations used to determine drainage requirements based upon
twenty-five (25) year storm frequency, twenty-four (24) hour duration shall be
provided if the project will significantly alter the existing drainage patterns due to
such factors as the amount of new impervious surfaces (such as pavement and
building areas) being proposed. Closed drainage features must be sized for the ten
(10) year storm frequency. Culverts, major ditches, swales, and detention facilities
must be sized for the twenty-five (25) year storm frequency.
c. If the project will affect drainage flow to an existing roadway culvert, or if a
detention or retention area is proposed, a minimum of a twenty-five (25) year storm
shall be used to evaluate potential off-site effects. If a State owned or maintained
culvert is affected by the development, State of New Hampshire Department of
Transportation Guidelines shall be used for evaluation of the culvert.
d. All temporary erosion and sediment control measures shall be removed after final
site stabilization. Trapped sediment and other disturbed soil area resulting from the
removal of temporary measures shall be permanently stabilized within thirty (30)
days.
e. Velocities of less than ten (10) feet per second are required prior to entering a
sedimentation swale. The maximum design velocity within the swale shall be 1.0
feet per second during passage of the 10-year storm.
f. Flows less than ten (10) cubic feet per second are required prior to entering a
sedimentation swale.
g. All slopes equal to or steeper than 2:1 adjacent to a public right-of way must have
special stabilization details provided with the submission.
h. Velocities of ten (10) feet per second or less are desirable within a closed drainage
system. Higher velocities may be allowed provided special design criteria have been
used.
i. A minimum velocity of two feet per second (2 fps) is required within a closed
drainage system.
j. Proposed riprap within a public right-of-way shall be paced a minimum of twelve
(12) inches deep.
k. Seasonal high-water table elevations must be accounted for in all BMP design
criteria.
l. Drainage design should follow the guidelines presented in the “Stormwater
Management and Erosion and Sediment Control Handbook for Urban and 
§1.4 Amherst Stormwater Regulation §1.5
I-8
Developing Areas in New Hampshire”, as published by the New Hampshire
Department of Environmental Services, Rockingham County Conservation District

attend a mandatory preconstruction meeting with the Town at least two (2) weeks prior to
commencement of construction. Two (2) copies of the SWPPP (if required), SWMP,
associated construction documents, and Notice of Intent (if required) must be provided at
that time. All documents must bear the seal and signature of the registered Professional
Engineer preparing the documents. Prior to commencement of construction, the Board of
Health will confirm that the documents submitted meet the conditions of plan approval. An
appropriate notation will be made on the “official” construction set used by the Health
Officer.
B. The Town reserves the right to prepare and request the applicant’s acknowledgement of a
preconstruction checklist.
C. The applicant shall bear final responsibility for the installation, construction, inspection, and
disposition of all stormwater management and erosion control measures required by the
provisions of this Regulation.
D. The Board of Health shall require a bond or other security in an amount and with surety
conditions satisfactory to the Board, providing for the actual construction and installation of
such measures within a period specified by the Board of Health and expressed in the bond or
the surety.
E. The Town may require the owner or his authorized agent to deposit in escrow with the Town
an amount of money sufficient to cover the costs for inspection and any professional
assistance required for compliance site monitoring.
F. Site development shall not begin before the stormwater management and erosion control

hold responsibility for implementing the stormwater management and erosion control
plan.
H. Residential Development and Redevelopment.
1. The applicant is responsible for implementing the stormwater management and erosion
control plan. There are two (2) ways for the applicant to be removed from the
responsible party (in the Town’s jurisdiction):
a. The applicant completes the project in a satisfactory manner and files a Notice of
Termination (NOT) with the EPA in accordance with the terms of the Federal
requirements.
b. The applicant passes legal responsibility of the plan to another competent party. In
the case of a new subdivision where lots may be transferred to a different entity for
construction of the buildings, it is the applicant’s responsibility to ensure that the
applicant has a legal basis to require compliance by the new entity.
I. Individual Homeowner Development.
1. Once the homeowner has taken control of a subdivided property, the homeowner bears
responsibility for compliance with the approved stormwater management and erosion
control plan. If the homeowner is contracting building services to another person or

County Registry of Deeds, which shall provide document standards as amended and
adopted by the New Hampshire registers of deeds. The standards and any amendments
thereto shall include a statement of their effective date, and shall be posted in and
distributed by all registries of deeds for at least sixty (60) days prior to such effective
date.
3. In the event of any changes in Registry procedure or requirements, RSA 478:4-a shall
supersede the above requirements, and the applicant shall fulfill those requirements.
B. There shall further be a copy of the maintenance requirements on site during construction
activity. During the time of construction, a log and report must be submitted to the Town
twice each month, and within forty-eight (48) hours of any storm event with greater than one
(1) inch of rainfall. This report shall detail all inspections; any actions taken per the
construction stormwater management and erosion control plan, including the reasons for
doing so, dates of action, and follow up action required. After construction, this copy of the
maintenance requirements shall be given to a responsible party, either at the
maintenance/management company, or in the Homeowners’ Association. This party will be
responsible for preparing a yearly log and report, to be submitted to the Town no later than

C. For a cumulative disturbance of one (1) acre of land that EPA considers “construction
activity,” which includes, but is not limited to clearing, grading, excavation, and other
activities that expose soil typically related to landscaping, demolition, and construction of
structures and roads, a federal permit will be required. Consult EPA for specific rules. This
EPA permit is in addition to any state or local permit required. To apply, the entity or
individual responsible for construction site operations shall file a Notice of Intent (NOI)
with the EPA postmarked at least 24 hours prior to work beginning. EPA will respond
within two (2) weeks with a written permit, provided the NOI meets their criteria. A sample
NOI is provided in Section 4.3.
Section 1.12 Post-Construction Operation.
A. Stormwater Discharges Associated with Commercial/Industrial Activities.
1. Each commercial and industrial facility approved under this Regulation is required to
perform annual site inspections (at a minimum). The site inspection must be documented
and at a minimum should include: review of stormwater flow paths, condition of any
sediment or contaminant control devices, water quality notations, corrective actions and
time frames if unacceptable water quality runoff is noted, and the name and position of
the inspector. All records of the inspections must be made available to the Town of their
designee upon request.
B. Notification for Spills or Other Non-Stormwater Discharges.
1. As soon as any person responsible for a facility, site, activity, or operation has
information of any known or suspected release of pollutants or non-stormwater
discharges which are resulting or may result in illicit discharges or pollutants
discharging into stormwater, the Town of Amherst’s municipal storm system, state
waters, or waters of the United States, said person shall take all necessary steps to ensure
the discovery, containment, and cleanup of such release as to minimize the effects of the
discharge. (If said individual is not competent to assess, contain, or clean-up, that person
shall immediately notify another competent individual or firm.) If the substance poses an
immediate health or safety concern, the Town of Amherst Emergency Services must
immediately be notified. If the substance does not pose an immediate concern, the Town
of Amherst Board of Health should be notified. This notification should be made as soon
as possible, however, no later than twenty-four (24) hours post event. This notification
does not preclude and must be made in addition to any Federal or State required
notifications. The site operator/owner must be aware that discharges such as treated
swimming pool water are not allowed discharges unless appropriate measures have been
taken to reduce the treatment chemical concentrations in the water.
