PREFACE 
    This Code constitutes a recodification of the general and permanent ordinances of the Township of 
South Brunswick, New Jersey. 
    Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the board of health ordinances as set out 
in the 1975 Revised General Ordinances of the board of health, and the general ordinances of the 
township as set out in the 1988 Code, as supplemented, and subsequent ordinances through April 15, 
2003. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end 
thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time 
with the adoption of the Code. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this Code, the 
reader can locate any section of the 1975 Revised Ordinances of board of health or any section of the 
1988 Code, as supplemented, and any subsequent ordinance included herein. 
    The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order, and the various 
sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Notes which tie related sections of 
the Code together and which refer to relevant state law have been included. A table listing the state law 
citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this Code. 
Chapter and Section Numbering System 
    The chapter and section numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many 
state and local government codes. Each section number consists of two parts separated by a dash. The 
figure before the dash refers to the chapter number, and the figure after the dash refers to the position of 
the section within the chapter. Thus, the second section of chapter 1 is numbered 1-2, and the first 
section of chapter 6 is 6-1. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter, and at the same 
time new sections can be inserted in their proper place by using the decimal system for amendments. For 
example, if new material consisting of one section that would logically come between sections 6-1 and 6-
2 is desired to be added, such new section would be numbered 6-1.5. New articles and new divisions 
may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter 
embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the 
subject. The next successive number shall be assigned to the new article or division. New chapters may 
be included by using one of the reserved chapter numbers. Care should be taken that the alphabetical 
arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. 
Page Numbering System 
    The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon 
are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the volume. The number to the right of the colon 
represents the number of the page in that portion. In the case of a chapter of the Code, the number to the 
left of the colon indicates the number of the chapter. In the case of an appendix to the Code, the letter 
immediately to the left of the colon indicates the letter of the appendix. The following are typical parts of 
codes of ordinances, which may or may not appear in this Code at this time, and their corresponding 
prefixes:

Index 
    The index has been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under 
several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still 
others in language generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous 
cross references within the index itself which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item 
in which the user is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
    A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of 
the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up-to-date. Subsequent amendatory 
legislation will be properly edited, and the affected page or pages will be reprinted. These new pages will 
be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new 
pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
    Keeping this publication up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. 
As revised pages are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the 
amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher 
that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, 
that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
Acknowledgments 
    This publication was under the direct supervision of James S. Vaught, Supervising Editor, and Jody 
Wilson, Editor, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida. Credit is gratefully given to the 
other members of the publisher's staff for their sincere interest and able assistance throughout the

    The publisher is most grateful to Tammy L. Patterson, former Township Clerk, Barbara Gut,

progress of the work on this publication. It is hoped that their efforts and those of the publisher have

citizens and which will be a valuable tool in the day-to-day administration of the township's affairs.

the punishment of an act which is prohibited or which is declared to be unlawful or an offense or for 
the nonperformance of an act which is required to be done, the violation of any such provision shall 
be punished by a fine not exceeding $2,000.00 or by imprisonment for a term not exceeding 90 days 
or community service not exceeding 90 days or by both a fine and imprisonment or both a fine and 
community service. However, when the maximum penalty fixed by an applicable state statute is less 
than the penalty in this Code, the limitations of such state statute shall be applicable. A separate 
offense shall be deemed committed on each day during or on which a violation occurs or continues. 
(b) ?The imposition of a fine or imprisonment for a violation of this Code or of any ordinance of the 
township shall not be deemed to be in lieu of any other provision therein providing for revocation or 
suspension of any license or permit issued thereunder. 
(c) ?Where a fine in excess of $1,250.00 is sought to be imposed for a housing violation or for a zoning 
violation, the owner shall be provided with a 30-day period in which the owner has an opportunity to 
cure or abate the condition and the owner shall have an opportunity for a hearing before the court. 
After the 30-day period, the higher fine may be imposed if the court has determined that the 
abatement has not been substantially completed.

* Graduation rates for any particular year shall be calculated based on the number of enrollees who 
graduated in a given year divided by the total number of enrollees (and former enrollees) who could have 
been eligible to graduate in that year had they remained enrolled and timely completed the program. The 
term "total number of enrollees" shall be computed by counting the total number of persons enrolled in 
approved Apprenticeship Programs for each separate trade or craft approved by the State of New Jersey. 
For example, the total number of enrollees in the electrical trade would consist of all persons currently 
enrolled in an approved apprenticeship program for electricians in the State of New Jersey. If the New 
Jersey based trade or craft conducts education classes outside the state, those attendees shall count as 
enrollees for purposes of this subparagraph. Enrollees who withdraw for reasons of military service, 
residence relocation, death, sickness or hardship as approved by the teaching staff shall not be counted 
as enrollees for purposes of calculating the graduation rate.

discharged. 
(d) ?Discharges to be removed or contained. The owner, operator or person in charge of the facility or 
vehicle from which the discharge of hazardous substances occurs shall take all steps necessary to 
stop the discharge and remove or contain the hazardous substance so that under no circumstances 
can it reach the public water supply or pollute any stream of water used for domestic purpose or 
wells. 
(Rev. Ords. 1975, § BH:17-1.1—BH:17-1.4) 


Sec. 18-193. - Design criteria. 
(a) ?Site plan review. The health officer or sanitarian shall, as part of the site plan process of the 
planning board or zoning board of adjustment, review all site plans with the purpose of bringing to 
the attention of such board design aspects which would reduce the potential of the discharge of 
hazardous substances. The report of the health officer or sanitarian to such board shall be guided by 
the criteria in subsection (b) of this section. 
(b) ?Design criteria for storage facilities. Design criteria for storage facilities shall be as follows: 
(1) ?All portions or areas of a facility in which hazardous substances are stored, processed, 
manufactured or transferred shall be designed so that the discharges of hazardous substances 
will be prevented from flowing, draining or leaching into the waters of the township. 
(2) ?Where, by reason of the quantity of hazardous substances stored or the dangers posed to the 
public health by the nature of the hazardous substance, such substances pose a threat to the 
public safety, the site should include features to prevent the discharge of hazardous substances 
from reaching the waters of the township. These design features would include secondary 
containment and/or diversionary structures, including but not limited to the following: 
a. ?Dikes, berms or retaining walls sufficiently impermeable to contain spilled hazardous 
substances. 
b. ?Curbing. 
c. ?Gutters, culverts and other drainage systems. 
d. ?Weirs, booms and other barriers. 
e. ?Lined diversion ponds, lined lagoons and lined retention basins, holding tanks, sumps, slop 
tanks and other collecting systems. 
f. ?Drip pans. 
(3) ?Secondary containment and/or diversionary system structures or equipment must meet the 
following standards: 
a. ?The system must block all routes by which spilled hazardous substances could reasonably 
be expected to flow, migrate or escape into waters of the township from within the 
contained area. 
b. ?The system must have sufficient capacity to contain or divert the largest probable single 
discharge that could occur within the containment area, plus an additional capacity to 
compensate for any anticipated normal accumulation of rainwater and to provide a 
reasonable margin of safety if a tank failure occurs. 
c. ?In order to prevent the discharge of hazardous substances into groundwater, all 
components of the system shall be made of or lined with impermeable materials. Such 
material or liner must be maintained in an impermeable condition. 
d. ?No manufacturing area, processing area, transfer area, diked storage area or other storage 
area or secondary containment/diversion system appurtenant thereto shall drain into a 
watercourse or into a ditch, sewer, pipe or storm drain that leads directly or indirectly into a 
watercourse or public sewage treatment plant, unless: 
1. ?Provision is made to retain, by valves or other positive means, any accumulated 
rainwater until its condition can be ascertained; or 
2. ?Provision has been made to intercept any spilled hazardous substances in an 
approved industrial wastewater treatment or pretreatment facility or other approved 
facility. 
e. ?Catchment basins, lagoons and other containment areas should not be located in a 
manner that would subject them to flooding. 
f. ?Incompatible materials shall not be stored within the same containment area if there is a 
substantial likelihood of them mixing if spillage occurs. "Incompatible materials" are those 
which, if mixed, will create hazards greater than those posed by the individual substances 
alone, such as fire, explosion or generation of toxic fumes. This restriction does not apply 
to manufacturing or process areas where the substances are brought into proximity as part 
of a production process. 
g. ?All hazardous substances which are discharged into a secondary containment or diversion 
system shall be promptly removed by the owner, operator or person in charge of the 
facility. The secondary containment systems shall not be used for the storage of any 
product or substance, but shall be maintained in such a manner as to contain the 
discharge of hazardous substances. 
(c) ?Applicability; exceptions. The criteria in subsection (b) of this section shall be applicable to all 
facilities within the township, with the following exceptions: The board of health may temporarily 
exempt any existing facility from application of the criteria if the owner or operator establishes at a 
public meeting after due notice that nonapplication of the criteria would not be a danger to public 
health and the waters of the township or that the danger to public health and the waters of the 
township was so slight or remote so as not to justify the cost of the installation of devices to meet the 
criteria or standards of this division.

and details of the storage of hazardous substances shall be submitted to the board of health. 
No observation well shall be installed without the approval of the health officer. 
(3) ?The owner or operator shall sample the observation wells and submit samples to a state-
certified or equivalently certified test laboratory for analysis for determination as to whether or 
not any of the hazardous substances stored or used on his premises has reached the water 
supply and in what concentration. The owner or operator shall cause to be forwarded to the 
health officer a copy of the report directly and simultaneously with the report being forwarded to 
the owner or operator of the facility. 
(4) ?Copies of the report shall be maintained by the owner or operator at the site for purpose of 
inspection by the health officer or agent or employees of the board of health for a period of three 
years. 
(5) ?If the analysis shows any presence of hazardous substances in the observation well, the board 
of health shall be immediately notified. In such event the health officer shall have the authority 
to require additional sampling or analysis. 
(6) ?The health officer shall not order installation of observation wells if a leak of hazardous material 
could readily be detectible by personnel, product gauging or an automatic detection system or 
other means. The board of health may exempt an owner or operator from the requirement of 
such installation.

accommodate accumulated precipitation and to provide a reasonable margin of safety if tank 
failure occurs. 
(2) ?The areas beneath aboveground storage tanks shall be made of or surfaced with a material 
impermeable to passage and/or chemical attack by the stored hazardous substances under the 
conditions of storage prevailing within the tank. Existing bulk storage tanks may be temporarily 
exempted from this requirement by the board of health, taking into consideration the criteria and 
purposes of this division. 
(3) ?Pipes leading to and from aboveground tanks, which enter the tank below the liquid level, shall 
be equipped with valves sufficiently close to the tank that they can prevent the contents of the 
tank from escaping outside the secondary containment area if a pipe rupture occurs outside the 
containment area. 
(4) ?Aboveground tanks shall, at the expense of the owner, be subjected to periodic integrity 
testing, using a nationally recognized method, in the presence of the health officer, on a time 
schedule as may be determined by the board of health or more frequently if ordered by the 
health officer, who shall take into account the material of which the tank is constructed, the 
substances stored therein, soil conditions and other circumstances which affect tank life and the 
probability of leakage. Testing techniques shall take into account the tank design. Acceptable 
methods include hydrostatic or other liquid pressure testing, visual inspection or a system of 
nondestructive shell thickness testing. Where the latter system is used, comparison records of 
shell thickness reduction shall be maintained throughout the life of the tank. Tank supports and 
foundations shall be inspected as well. 
(5) ?There shall be no new construction of buried bulk storage tanks unless approval is granted by 
the health officer, upon proof that the tank meets the criteria of this division. The health officer 
shall be guided by but not limited to the flammability of the stored substance, adequate 
secondary containment, the relative risks of aboveground to belowground tanks and the general 
health and welfare of the community.

c. ?Observation wells. 
(9) ?Buried or partially buried bulk storage tanks shall be subjected to periodic integrity testing in a 
manner and on a schedule as specified by the board of health by hydrostatic or product-
pressure testing (that is, a Kent-Moore-type test) or an alternative method acceptable to the 
board of health which reflects the best practicable technology standards. 
(10) ?New construction of partially buried metallic tanks is prohibited unless approval is granted by 
the health officer upon proof that the tank and facility meet the criteria of this division. 
(11) ?If a tank is served by internal heating coils, such coils, the pipes leading to and from them and 
the facilities to which they connect must be designed so that any leakage passing from the tank 
into the heating coil system will be captured and contained in a settling tank, skimmer or other 
secondary containment or wastewater treatment system. 
(12) ?Tank installations should be equipped with fail-safe devices capable of detecting overfills and 
other types of spills, which devices can actuate valves or other shutdown mechanisms or which 
can summon human aid. Such devices shall be either: 
a. ?High liquid level alarms with an audible or visual signal designed to alert plant personnel of 
overfills; 
b. ?High liquid level pump cutoff devices designed to stop flow at predetermined levels; 
c. ?Direct communication between the tank gauger and pumping station; 
d. ?Fast-response systems for determining liquid levels, such as visible gauges, digital 
computer links and so forth; 
e. ?Interconnections between tanks, so that overfills are directed into other tanks; or 
f. ?Use of devices such as the ones in subsection (e)(12)a. through (e)(12)e. of this section 
shall be at the owner's or operator's option for tanks which are served by adequate 
secondary containment systems. For tanks which are not so served, the owner or operator 
shall specify which fail-safe devices he proposes to employ in order to provide the 
maximum practicable degree of spill detection and prevention. The health officer shall 
approve devices meeting the criteria of this division. 
(13) ?Mobile or portable storage tanks shall be positioned or located so as to prevent spills 
therefrom from reaching surface waters. If such tanks are used for longterm storage, they shall 
be protected by adequate secondary containment of sufficient capacity to contain or divert the 
contents of the largest single compartment or tank. Such tanks shall not be located in areas 
subject to periodic flooding or washout. 
(14) ?Existing bulk storage tanks for hazardous substances may be exempted by the board of 
health from any requirement of this subsection, compliance with which would necessitate 
substantial reconstruction or replacement of a tank. When substantial reconstruction or 
replacement of the tank, including relining, must be undertaken as the result of deterioration of 
the tank or in the course of normal plant improvements, the tank installation shall be upgraded 
to comply with all requirements of this subsection.

facilities shall be of a different size or type than those used for supplying potable water to the mobile 
food unit. The waste connection shall be located lower than the water inlet connection to preclude 
contamination of the potable water system. Liquid waste which is not discharged into the sewerage 
system shall be disposed of in such a manner as not to create a public health hazard or nuisance 
condition. Liquid waste shall not be discharged from the retention tank when the mobile food unit is 
in motion.

defined in N.J.A.C. 7:29. 
    Construction means any site preparation, assembly, erection, repair, alteration or similar action of 
buildings or structures. 
    dBC means the sound level as measured using the "C" weighting network with a sound level meter 
meeting the standards set forth in ANSI S1.4-1983 or its successors. The unit of reporting is dB(C). The 
"C" weighting network is more sensitive to low frequencies than is the "A" weighting network. 
    Demolition means any dismantling, destruction or removal of buildings, structures, or roadways. 
    Department means the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection. 
    Emergency work means any work or action necessary at the site of an emergency to restore or 
deliver essential services including, but not limited to, repairing water, gas, electricity, telephone, sewer 
facilities, or public transportation facilities, removing fallen trees on public rights-of-way, dredging 
navigational waterways, or abating life-threatening conditions or a state of emergency declared by a 
governing agency. 
    Impulsive sound means either a single pressure peak or a single burst (multiple pressure peaks) that 
has a duration of less than one second. 
    Minor violation means a violation that is not the result of the purposeful, reckless or criminally 
negligent conduct of the alleged violator; and/or the activity or condition constituting the violation has not 
been the subject of an enforcement action by any authorized local, county or state enforcement agency 
against the violator within the immediately preceding 12 months for the same or substantially similar 
violation. 
    Motor vehicle means any vehicle that is propelled other than by human or animal power on land.

activity. Examples include, but are not limited to: 
(1) ?A commercial, residential, industrial or public service property having boilers, incinerators, 
elevators, automatic garage doors, air conditioners, laundry rooms, utility provisions, or health 
and recreational facilities, or other similar devices or areas, either in the interior or on the 
exterior of the building, which may be a source of elevated sound levels at another category on 
the same distinct parcel of land; or 
(2) ?A building, which is both commercial (usually on the ground floor) and residential property, 
located above, below or otherwise adjacent to. 
    Noise control officer (NCO) means an employee of a local, county or regional health agency which is 
certified pursuant to the County Environmental Health Act (N.J.S.A. 26:3A2-21, et seq.) to perform noise 
enforcement activities or an employee of a municipality with a department-approved model noise control 
ordinance. All NCOs must receive noise enforcement training as specified by the department in N.J.A.C.

knowledgeable about their model noise ordinance and enforcement procedures. A noise control 
investigator may only enforce sections of the ordinance that do not require the use of a sound level meter. 
The employee must be acting within his or her designated jurisdiction and must be authorized to issue a 
summons. 
    Plainly audible means any sound that can be detected by an NCO or an NCI using his or her 
unaided hearing faculties of normal acuity. As an example, if the sound source under investigation is a 
portable or vehicular sound amplification or reproduction device, the detection of the rhythmic bass 
component of the music is sufficient to verify plainly audible sound. The NCO or NCI need not determine 
the title, specific words, or the artist performing the song.

of a dwelling unit that is part of a multi-dwelling unit building; or (c) on a multi-use property as defined 
herein, the vertical or horizontal boundaries between the two portions of the property on which different 
categories of activity are being performed (e.g., if the multi-use property is a building which is residential 
upstairs and commercial downstairs, then the real property line would be the interface between the 
residential area and the commercial area, or if there is an outdoor sound source such as an HVAC unit on 
the same parcel of property, the boundary line is the exterior wall of the receiving unit). Note: This 
definition shall not apply to a commercial source and a commercial receptor which are both located on the 
same parcel of property (e.g., a strip mall). 
    Sound production device means any device whose primary function is the production of sound, 
including, but not limited to, any musical instrument, loudspeaker, radio, television, digital or analog music 
player, public address system or sound-amplifying equipment. 
    Sound reduction device means any device, such as a muffler, baffle, shroud, jacket, enclosure, 
isolator, or dampener provided by the manufacturer with the equipment, or that is otherwise required, that 
mitigates the sound emissions of the equipment.

(b) ?Any person who violates any provision of this article shall be subject to a civil penalty for each 
offense of not more than the maximum penalty allowed pursuant to N.J.S.A. 40:49-5, which is 
$2,000.00 as of December 2014. If the violation is of a continuing nature, each day during which it 
occurs shall constitute an additional, separate, and distinct offense. 
(c) ?Upon identification of a violation of this article, the noise control officer or noise control investigator 
shall issue an enforcement document to the violator. The enforcement document shall identify the 
condition or activity that constitutes the violation and the specific provision of this article that has 
been violated. It shall also indicate whether the violator has a period of time to correct the violation 
before a penalty is sought. 
(d) ?If the violation is deemed by the noise control officer or noise control investigator to be a minor 
violation (as defined in section 42-137, a NOV shall be issued to the violator. 
(1) ?The document shall indicate that the purpose of the NOV is intended to serve as a notice to 
warn the responsible party/violator of the violation conditions in order to provide them with an 
opportunity to voluntarily investigate the matter and voluntarily take corrective action to address 
the identified violation. 
(2) ?The NOV shall identify the time period (up to 90 days), pursuant to the Grace Period Law, 
N.J.S.A. 13:1D-125 et seq., wherein the responsible party's/violator's voluntary action can 
prevent a formal enforcement action with penalties issued by the township. It shall be noted that 
the NOV does not constitute a formal enforcement action, a final agency action or a final legal 
determination that a violation has occurred. Therefore, the NOV may not be appealed or 
contested. 
(e) ?If the violation is deemed by the noise control officer or noise control investigator to be a non-minor 
violation, the violator shall be notified that if the violation is not immediately corrected a NOPA with a 
civil penalty of not more than the maximum penalty allowed pursuant to N.J.S.A. 40:49-5, which is 
$2,000.00 as of December 2014, will be issued. If a non-minor violation is immediately corrected, a 
NOV without a civil penalty shall still be issued to document the violation. If the violation occurs again 
(within 12 months of the initial violation) a NOPA shall be issued regardless of whether the violation 
is immediately corrected or not. 
(f) ?The violator may request from the noise control officer or noise control investigator, an extension of 
the compliance deadline in the enforcement action. The noise control officer or noise control 
investigator shall have the option to approve any reasonable request for an extension (not to exceed 
180 days) if the violator can demonstrate that a good faith effort has been made to achieve 
compliance. If an extension is not granted and the violation continues to exist after the grace period 
ends, a NOPA shall be issued. 
(g) ?The recipient of a NOPA shall be entitled to a hearing in the municipal court to contest such action. 
(h) ?The noise control officer or noise control investigator may seek injunctive relief if the responsible 
party does not remediate the violation within the period of time specified in the NOPA issued. 
(i) ?Any claim for a civil penalty may be compromised and settled based on the following factors: 
(1) ?Mitigating or any other extenuating circumstances; 
(2) ?The timely implementation by the violator of measures which lead to compliance; 
(3) ?The conduct of the violator; and 
(4) ?The compliance history of the violator. 
(j) ?No provision of this article shall be construed to impair any common law or statutory cause of action, 
or legal remedy there from, of any person for injury or damage arising from any violation of this 
article or from other law.

health and sanitary codes and also subject to all applicable regulations of the County of Middlesex, the 
New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection, and the United States Environmental Protection 
Agency. 
(Ord. No. 2008-29, § I, 5-13-2008) 


Sec. 42-227. - Interpretation. 
    The right to farm as it is used in this section includes the use of large irrigation pumps and 
equipment, aerial and ground seeding and spraying, large tractors, numerous farm laborers and the 
application of chemical fertilizers and projects for the control and elimination of insects, pests, weeds, 
fungus and other substances injurious to the farming process or for the purpose of producing from the 
land agricultural products, such as vegetables, grains, hay, fruits, fibers, potatoes, wood, trees, plants, 
shrubs, flowers and seeds. This right to farm shall also include the right to use land for grazing by 
animals, subject to the restrictions contained elsewhere in this Code for raising livestock. 
(Ord. No. 2008-29, § I, 5-13-2008) 


Sec. 42-228. - Hours and days not restricted.

Rutgers University School of Environmental and Biological Sciences (Agricultural Science program), may 
occur on holidays, weekdays and weekends, at night and in the day. 
(Ord. No. 2008-29, § I, 5-13-2008) 


Sec. 42-229. - Findings. 
    It is expressly found that whatever temporary inconveniences may be caused to others by such uses 
and activities so conducted are more than offset by the benefits from farming to the neighborhood and 
community and to society in general, by the preservation of open space, the beauty of the countryside 
and clean air and by the preservation and continuance of farming operations in South Brunswick 
Township and in New Jersey as a source of agricultural products for this and future generations.

Secs. 50-1—50-30. - Reserved. 


ARTICLE II. - FLOOD DAMAGE PREVENTION 


Sec. 50-31. - Statutory authorization. 
    The Legislature of the State of New Jersey has in N.J.S.A. 40:48-1, et seq., and N.J.S.A. 40:55D-1, 
et seq., delegated the responsibility to local governmental units to adopt regulations designed to promote 
public health, safety, and general welfare of its citizenry. 
(Ord. No. 2010-18, § I, 6-8-2010) 


Sec. 50-32. - Findings of fact. 
(a) ?The flood hazard areas of township are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life 
and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, 
extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base, all of 
which adversely affect the public health, safety, and general welfare. 
(b) ?These flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions in areas of special flood 
hazard which increase flood heights and velocities, and when inadequately anchored, causes 
damage in other areas. Uses that are inadequately floodproofed, elevated or otherwise protected 
from flood damage also contribute to the flood loss. 
(Ord. No. 2010-18, § I, 6-8-2010) 


Sec. 50-33. - Statement of purpose. 
    It is the purpose of this article to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare, and to 
minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to: 
(1) ?Protect human life and health; 
(2) ?Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects; 
(3) ?Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally 
undertaken at the expense of the general public; 
(4) ?Minimize prolonged business interruptions; 
(5) ?Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains, electric, 
telephone and sewer lines, streets, and bridges located in areas of special flood hazard; 
(6) ?Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of areas of 
special flood hazard so as to minimize future flood blight areas; 
(7) ?Ensure that potential buyers are notified that property is in an area of special flood hazard; and 
(8) ?Ensure that those who occupy the areas of special flood hazard assume responsibility for their 
actions. 
(Ord. No. 2010-18, § I, 6-8-2010) 


Sec. 50-34. - Methods of reducing flood losses. 
    In order to accomplish its purposes, this chapter includes methods and provisions for: 
(1) ?Restricting or prohibiting uses which are dangerous to health, safety, and property due to water 
or erosion hazards, or which result in damaging increases in erosion or in flood heights or 
velocities; 
(2) ?Requiring that uses vulnerable to floods including facilities which serve such uses, be protected 
against flood damage at the time of initial construction; 
(3) ?Controlling the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural protective 
barriers, which help accommodate or channel flood waters; 
(4) ?Controlling filling, grading, dredging, and other development which may increase flood damage; 
and, 
(5) ?Preventing or regulating the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert flood 
waters or which may increase flood hazards in other areas. 
(Ord. No. 2010-18, § I, 6-8-2010) 


Sec. 50-35. - Definitions.

unpredictable and where velocity flow may be evident. Such flooding is characterized by ponding or sheet 
flow. 
    Area of special flood hazard means the land in the floodplain within a community subject to a one 
percent or greater chance of flooding in any given year. 
    Base flood means the flood having a one percent chance of being equaled or exceeded in any given

Administration has delineated both the areas of special flood hazards and the risk premium zones 
applicable to the community. 
    Elevated building means a nonbasement building (i) built in the case of a building in an area of 
special flood hazard to have the top of the elevated floor elevated above the ground level by means of 
piling, columns (posts and piers), or shear walls parallel to the flow of the water, and (ii) adequately 
anchored so as not to impair the structural integrity of the building during a flood up to the magnitude of 
the base flood. In an area of special flood hazard "elevated building" also includes a building elevated by 
means of fill or solid foundation perimeter walls with openings sufficient to facilitate the unimpeded 
movement of flood waters. 
    Existing manufactured home means a unit of housing which consists of one or more transportable 
sections that are built on a permanent chassis; is designed to be used, when connected to utilities, as a 
dwelling; and is manufactured in accordance with the standards promulgated for a manufactured home by

local regulations, in any combination thereof, which provide standards for the purpose of flood damage 
prevention and reduction. 
    Floodway means the channel of a river or other watercourse and the adjacent land areas that must 
be reserved in order to discharge the base flood without cumulatively increasing the water surface 
elevation more than 0.2 foot. 
    Highest adjacent grade means the highest natural elevation of the ground surface prior to 
construction next to the proposed walls of a structure. 
    Historic structure means any structure that is: 
(a) ?Listed individually in the National Register of Historic Places (a listing maintained by the

(2) ?Directly by the Secretary of the Interior in States without approved programs; or 
(e) ?Designated as such pursuant to South Brunswick Code, chapter 56. 
    Lowest floor means the lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area [including basement]. An unfinished 
or flood resistant enclosure, useable solely for the parking of vehicles, building access or storage in an 
area other than a basement is not considered a building's lowest floor provided that such enclosure is not 
built so to render the structure in violation of other applicable nonelevation design requirements. 
    Manufactured home means a structure, transportable in one or more sections, which is built on a 
permanent chassis and is designed for use with or without a permanent foundation when attached to the 
required utilities. For floodplain management purposes, the term "manufactured home" also includes park 
trailers, travel trailers and other similar vehicles placed on a site for greater than 180 consecutive days. 
For insurance purposes, the term "manufactured home" does not include park trailers, travel trailers, 
recreational vehicles or other similar vehicles. 
    Manufactured home park or manufactured home subdivision means a parcel, or contiguous parcels, 
of land divided into two or more manufactured home lots for rent or sale.

which this article is derived. 
    Recreational vehicle means a vehicle which is [i] built on a single chassis; [ii] 400 square feet or less 
when measured at the longest horizontal projections; [iii] designed to be self-propelled or permanently 
towable by a light duty truck; and [iv] designed primarily not for use as a permanent dwelling but as 
temporary living quarters for recreational, camping, travel, or seasonal use. 
    Start of construction for other than new construction or substantial improvements under the Coastal 
Barrier Resources Act (P.L. No. 97-348) includes substantial improvements and means the date the 
building permit was issued, provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation, 
addition, placement, or other improvement was within 180 days of the permit date. The actual start means 
either the first placement of permanent construction of a structure on a site such as the pouring of a slab 
or footings, the installation of piles, the construction of columns, or any work beyond the stage of 
excavation, or the placement of a manufactured home on a foundation. Permanent construction does not 
include land preparation, such as clearing, grading and filling nor does it include the installation of streets 
and/or walkways, nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings or piers, or foundations or the 
erection of temporary forms, nor does it include the installation on the property of accessory buildings, 
such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main structure. For a 
substantial improvement, the actual start of construction shall be at the commencement of the first 
alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building, whether or not that alteration 
affects the external dimensions of the building. 
    Structure means a walled and roofed building, a manufactured home, or a gas or liquid storage tank 
that is principally above ground. 
    Substantial damage means damage of any origin sustained by a structure whereby the cost of 
restoring the structure to its before damaged condition would equal or exceed 50 percent of the market 
value of the structure before the damage occurred. 
    Substantial improvement means any reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, or other improvement of 
a structure, the cost of which exceeds 50 percent of the market value of the structure before the "start of 
construction" of the improvement. This term includes structures which have incurred "substantial 
damage", regardless of the actual repair work performed. The term does not, however, include either: 
(1) ?Any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing violations of state or local health, 
sanitary or safety code specifications which have been identified by the local code enforcement 
officer and which are the minimum necessary to assure safe living conditions; or 
(2) ?Any alteration of a "historic structure", provided that the alteration will not preclude the 
structure's continued designation as a "historic structure". 
    Variance means a grant of relief by the planning board from the requirements of this article, which 
permits construction in a manner that would otherwise be prohibited by this article because enforcement 
would result in unnecessary and unreasonable hardship.

(1) ?Generally, variances may be issued for new construction and substantial improvements to be 
erected on a lot of one-half acre or less in size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing 
structures constructed below the base flood level, providing items in subsections 50-45(d)(1) through 
(11) have been fully considered. As the lot size increases beyond the one-half acre, the technical 
justification required for issuing the variance increases. 
(2) ?Variances may be issued for the reconstruction, rehabilitation or restoration of structures listed on 
the National Register of Historic Places or the state inventory of historic places, upon a determination 
that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a 
historic structure and the variance is the minimum necessary to preserve the historic character and 
design of the structure. 
(3) ?Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any increase in flood levels 
during the base flood discharge would result. 
(4) ?Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary, 
considering the flood hazard, to afford relief. 
(5) ?Variances shall only be issued upon: 
(i) ?A showing of good and sufficient cause; 
(ii) ?A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship to the 
applicant; and, 
(iii) ?A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, 
additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create nuisances, cause fraud 
on or victimization of the public as identified in section 50-45(d), or conflict with existing local 
laws or ordinances. 
(6) ?Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice that the structure will be 
permitted to be built with a lowest floor elevation below the base flood elevation and that the cost of 
flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the reduced lowest floor 
elevation.

of the chapter to allow uses permitted within an historic district or on an individually designated 
historic site to be the same as those permitted in the underlying zone district. 
(b) ?These historic preservation regulations are intended to effect and accomplish the protection, 
enhancement and perpetuation of especially noteworthy examples or elements of the township's 
environment in order to: 
(1) ?Safeguard the heritage of the township by preserving resources which reflect elements of its 
cultural, social, economic and architectural history; 
(2) ?Encourage the continued use of historic sites and to facilitate their appropriate use; 
(3) ?Maintain and develop an appropriate and harmonious setting for the historic and architecturally 
significant buildings, structures, sites, objects, or districts within the township; 
(4) ?Stabilize and improve property values within the district and foster civic pride; 
(5) ?Promote the appreciation and conservation of historic settings and landmarks for the 
education, pleasure, and welfare of the population, and invite and encourage voluntary 
compliance with the purposes of this chapter; 
(6) ?Encourage beautification and private reinvestment; 
(7) ?Manage change by preventing alteration or new construction not in keeping with any historic 
district; 
(8) ?Discourage the unnecessary demolition of historic resources; 
(9) ?Recognize the importance of individual historic sites located outside of a district by urging 
property owners and tenants to maintain their properties in keeping with the requirement and 
standards of this chapter; 
(10) ?Encourage the proper maintenance and preservation of historic settings and landscapes; 
(11) ?Encourage appropriate alterations of historic sites; 
(12) ?Enhance the visual and aesthetic character, diversity, continuity and interest in the township; 
(13) ?Promote the conservation of historic sites and districts and to invite and encourage voluntary 
compliance.

(e) ?In addition to the buildings, structures, objects, and sites already identified as being within an 
historic districts, or individual historic sites, landmarks and archaeological sites, the commission shall 
consider for historic site or historic district designation any additional buildings, structures, objects, 
sites, and districts within the township which merit historic site or historic district designation and 
protection, possessing integrity or location, design, setting, materials, workmanship of association 
and being: 
(1) ?Of particular historic significance to the township by reflecting or exemplifying the broad 
cultural, political, economic, or social history of the nation, state, or community; or 
(2) ?Associated with historic personages important in national, state, or local history; or 
(3) ?The site of an historic event which had a significant effect on the development of the nation, 
state, or community; or 
(4) ?An embodiment of the distinctive characteristics of a type, period, or method of architecture or 
engineering; or 
(5) ?Representative of the work of an important builder, designer, artist or architect; or 
(6) ?Significant for containing elements of design, detail, materials, or craftsmanship which 
represent a significant innovation; or 
(7) ?Able or likely to yield information important in prehistory or history. 
(f) ?Based on its review or upon the recommendation of other municipal bodies or of concerned citizens, 
the commission may make a list of additional historic sites or historic districts recommended for 
designation. For each historic building, structure, site, object or archaeological site, there shall be a 
brief description of that building, structure, site, object or archaeological site, and the significance 
pursuant to the criteria set forth in this chapter, a brief description of its location and boundaries, and 
a map identifying the location of the cultural resource. Thereafter, the commission shall refer any 
property recommended for designation to the planning board and the township council. 
(g) ?The planning board shall within 45 days of receipt of the commission's recommendation consider 
each property for historic designation. Notice shall be provided pursuant to N.J.S.A. 40:55D-13 of a 
hearing concerning the master plan. In addition the planning board shall: 
(1) ?Notify each owner that his property is being considered for historic site designation and the 
reasons therefor; 
(2) ?Advise each owner of the significance and consequence of such designation, and advise him 
of his opportunities and rights to challenge or contest such a designation; 
(3) ?Notify each owner of the hearing. 
At least ten days before such hearing, a preliminary list and map showing each proposed additional 
historic site shall be published, together with a notice of the hearing, in an official newspaper of the 
township. At the hearing interested persons shall be entitled to present their opinions, suggestions and 
objections on the proposed recommendations for historic site designation. The planning board shall then 
prepare a concise report, including a list and a map of its recommendations and shall adopt an 
appropriate resolution setting forth each additional historic site to be designated in the master plan. Notice 
of the adoption of the resolution shall be provided by the commission to the township clerk. Within 20 
days of receipt of the resolution by the township clerk, the township council may introduce an ordinance 
amending the zoning chapter to designate each recommended historic site. The township council may 
disapprove designating an historic site by a vote of a majority of its full authorized membership. 
(h) ?Notwithstanding the above procedures, the township council may at any time, adopt, by affirmative 
vote of a majority of its authorized membership, a zoning chapter designating one or more historic 
sites, historic districts, or archaeological sites that are not based on identifications in the historic 
preservation plan element, provided the reasons for the action of the governing body are set forth in 
a resolution and recorded in the minutes of the governing body. 
(Ord. No. 44-04, § I, 8-3-2004; Ord. No. 05-05, § I, 2-22-2005; Ord. No. 07-06, § I, 2-28-06; 
Ord. No. 39-06, § I, 6-27-2006; Ord. No. 57-06, § I, 8-22-2006; Ord. No. 2010-3, § I, 2-23-2010; 
Ord. No. 2014-30, § I, 9-23-2014) 


Sec. 56-8. - Actions requiring review by the commission. 
    The commission shall hear such applications employing its procedures set forth in sections 56-11 
and 56-12 and the criteria set forth in section 56-13, and will render its findings in writing for the following: 
(1) ?Applications for development. The planning board and zoning board of adjustment shall refer to 
the commission every application and all accompanying documents, submitted to either board 
for development in a designated historic district, an individually designated historic site or 
archaeological site. This referral shall be made when the application for development is deemed 
complete or is scheduled for a hearing, whichever occurs sooner. Failure to refer the application 
as required shall not invalidate any hearing or proceeding. 
(2) ?Permits. Prior to undertaking any action affecting the exterior architectural appearance, which 
is not expressly exempted pursuant to section 56-9, of an historic site or an improvement within 
an historic district, the property owner shall complete and submit to the construction code official 
and commission secretary an application for a certificate of appropriateness. This includes, but 
is not limited to, permits for new construction, demolition, alterations, additions, or replacements 
affecting the exterior architectural appearance of an historic site or an improvement within an 
historic district. 
(3) ?Review when an application for development or building permit is not required. In the event that 
the zoning officer or the construction code official shall determine that a building permit and/or 
application for development involving any development activity that would effect an historic 
district or historic site is not needed, then the property owner and/or tenant of the property on 
which the exterior changes, alterations or improvements are proposed to be made shall make 
application directly to the commission for a certificate of appropriateness. 
(Ord. No. 44-04, § I, 8-3-2004) 


Sec. 56-9. - Actions not requiring review by commission. 
    Review by the commission is not required: 
(1) ?For changes to the interior of structures. 
(2) ?For ordinary repairs and maintenance which do not constitute a change to the architectural 
appearance of the structure. 
(3) ?The following are activities which do not require commission review according to this criteria: 
a. ?Repair of existing windows and doors, using the same material. Installation of storm 
windows and doors that are compatible with the architectural period or design of the 
subject structure. 
b. ?Maintenance and repair of existing roof material, involving no change in the design, scale, 
material or appearance of the structure. 
c. ?Repair of existing roof structures, such as cupolas, dormers and chimneys, using the same 
materials, which will not alter the exterior architectural appearance of the structure. 
d. ?Replacement in kind of existing shingles, clapboards, or other siding maintaining the 
architectural integrity of the structure. 
e. ?Maintenance and repair of existing shingles, clapboards or other siding, using the same 
materials that are being repaired or maintained. 
f. ?Repairs to existing signs, shutters, outdoor displays, fences, hedges, trees, landscape, 
street furniture, awnings, off-street driveway and parking materials and sidewalks, using 
the same material for those items noted above being repaired. 
g. ?Exterior painting. 
(4) ?If it is determined by the administrative officer or his/her designee that the application 
constitutes a minor application and the plan conforms to the requirements of this chapter. In 
such case, the administrative officer, with the concurrence of the chair of the historic 
preservation commission, may approve the application. 
(Ord. No. 44-04, § I, 8-3-2004; Ord. No. 2010-46, § I, 11-9-2010) 


Sec. 56-10. - Emergency repairs. 
    When a landmark, building, structure, or site located within an historic district or an individually 
designated historic site requires immediate emergency repair to preserve the continued habitability and/or 
the health and safety of its occupants or others, emergency repairs may be performed in accordance with 
applicable township codes, without first obtaining a certificate of appropriateness. Under such 
circumstances, the repairs performed shall only be such that are necessary to protect the health and 
safety of its occupants or others, and/or to maintain the habitability of the structure or building. A request 
for the commission's review shall be made within three working days of the onset of emergency work, and 
no work in addition to the emergency repairs shall be performed on the structure until an appropriate 
request for approval is made and approval is obtained in accordance with the procedures set forth in this 
chapter. All work done under this section shall conform to the Secretary of the Interior's Standards for 
Rehabilitation. Additionally, this does not relieve the applicant from the requirement of obtaining any and 
all other such permits as may be necessary and required to undertake the proposed emergency repair 
work. 
(Ord. No. 44-04, § I, 8-3-2004) 


Sec. 56-11. - Procedures for review of applications for development. 
(a) ?For all applications presented to the planning board and/or zoning board of adjustment which affect 
an historic site or an improvement within an historic district, the property owner shall submit an 
application for a certificate of appropriateness to either the planning board or zoning board of 
adjustment, as appropriate, along with the request for either board's approval. Such an application 
shall pertain solely to the proposed site review or zoning request. 
(b) ?The planning board or zoning board of adjustment shall forward to the commission a complete 
application for development as well as the application for a certificate of appropriateness. The 
commission shall be allowed at least 14 days from the day it receives a complete application to 
prepare its recommendations to either the planning board or zoning board of adjustment. Should the 
commission elect to make a recommendation it shall be conveyed through its delegation of one of its 
members or staff to testify orally at the hearing on the application and to explain any written report 
which may have been submitted. 
(c) ?The commission's recommendation shall focus on how the proposed undertaking would affect an 
historic site or architectural significance. A failure of the commission to make a recommendation to 
the planning board and/or zoning board of adjustment prior to the hearing date before said board 
shall not relieve the applicant's obligation to comply with the requirements of this chapter. 
(d) ?The commission, in addition to conducting reviews at its regularly scheduled meetings, may conduct 
emergency review meetings when necessary at the call of the chairperson to review an application 
on an accelerated basis. The emergency meetings may be held when any action requiring 
consideration of immediate or emergency nonordinary repair to preserve the continued habitability

height of windows in a building shall be visually compatible with the buildings and places to 
which it is visually related. 
d. ?Rhythm of spacing of buildings on streets. The relationship of the building to the open 
space between it and adjoining buildings shall be visually compatible with buildings and 
places to which it is visually related. 
e. ?Rhythm of solids to voids on facades fronting on public places. The relationship of solids to 
voids in such facades of a building shall be visually compatible with buildings and places to 
which it is visually related.

shutters, trim, siding, etc.) shall be repaired rather than replaced, wherever possible using 
the Secretary of the Interior's Standards for Rehabilitation. In the event replacement is 
necessary, the new material should match the material being replaced in composition, 
design, texture, and other visual qualities. Repair or replacement of missing architectural 
features should be based on accurate duplications of features substantiated by historic, 
physical, or pictorial evidence rather than conjectural designs or the availability of different 
architectural elements from other buildings or structures. 
e. ?Design of alterations. Contemporary design for alterations and additions to existing 
properties shall not be discouraged when such alterations and additions do not destroy 
significant historic, architectural, or cultural material and such design is compatible with the

the original siding, corner boards, trim, etc. shall be permitted. On contributing buildings, 
alternative siding may be used to surface facades if the substitute siding is similar in 
design, width, texture etc. to the current or original. In either case, materials should not 
endanger the physical condition or structural life of the building. It is always preferable to 
replace with historically correct materials. Architectural trim and adornments must be 
maintained.

openings shall be retained on character defining elevations. Window and door openings 
shall not be reduced to fit stock material. 
On key buildings, materials that effectively create an exact reproduction of the original

an attractive and desirable place in which to live. 
h. ?If it is within an historic district, the probable impact of its removal upon the ambience of the 
historic district. 
(5) ?In regard to an application to move any historic site, or to move any structure within an historic 
district, the following matters shall be considered: 
a. ?The historic loss to the site of original location and the historic district as a whole. 
b. ?The reasons for not retaining the building improvement or structure at its present location.

shall not be deemed to be final approval pursuant to this chapter. Such approval, however, shall be 
conditioned upon satisfaction of the requirements contained in this chapter and as otherwise 
required in any recommendation by the commission. Such approval shall neither cause nor prevent

(b) ?The application charge is a flat fee to cover direct administrative expenses and is nonrefundable. 
The escrow account is established to cover the costs of professional services, including but not 
limited to engineering, legal, planning and other expenses connected with the review of the 
submitted materials. In accordance with N.J.S.A. 40:55D-53 and N.J.S.A. 40:55D-53.1, sums not 
utilized in the review process shall be returned to the applicant. If additional sums are deemed 
necessary, the applicant shall be notified of the required additional amount and shall add such sum 
to the escrow. 
(c) ?Where one application for development includes several approval requests, the sum of the 
individual required fees shall be paid. 
(d) ?Each applicant for subdivision, site plan approval or any other land development matter shall agree, 
in writing, to pay all reasonable costs for professional review of the application, including costs 
incurred with any informal review of a concept plan which may have preceded the submission of a 
preliminary application. Additionally, each applicant shall agree, in writing, to pay all reasonable 
costs for the municipal inspection of the constructed improvements. All such costs for review and 
inspection must be paid before any construction commences, and all remaining costs must be paid 
in full before any occupancy of the premises is permitted or certificate of occupancy issued. All 
improvements and utility installations shall be inspected during the time of the installation under the 
supervision of the township engineer to ensure satisfactory completion. In accordance with section 
62-165(f), the cost of the inspection shall be the responsibility of the applicant, and he shall deposit 
with the township treasurer, prior to any construction commencement, for placement in a special 
trust fund account, a sum equal to five percent of the amount of the total improvement cost of the 
project, excluding the cost of the structure. The total improvement quantity estimate shall be 
prepared by the applicant's engineer and submitted to the township engineer for review, approval 
and cost, setting forth all requirements for improvements as required by board approval. Additionally, 
the applicant/obligor shall be required to deposit with the township treasurer, for placement in a 
special trust fund account, a sum equal to one percent of the amount of the total improved cost of the 
project, excluding the cost of the structure, to cover the estimated fees for the subsequent inspection 
of the improvements to obtain a release of performance guaranties. Sums not utilized in the 
inspection process shall be returned to the applicant. 
(e) ?If an applicant desires a court reporter, the cost of taking testimony and transcribing it and providing 
a copy of the transcript to the township shall be at the expense of the applicant, who shall arrange for 
the reporter's attendance. On all applications for major subdivision, site plan and a use variance for 
other than a single-family dwelling, the applicant shall arrange for a certified court reporter to attend 
all hearings, take and transcribe the testimony, a copy of which shall be provided to the township. 
The cost of taking testimony, transcribing it and providing a copy of the transcript to the township 
shall be at the expense of the applicant. 
(f) ?Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this section, any application for subdivision or site plan 
approval or any other land development matter submitted by a charitable, philanthropic, fraternal or 
religious, nonprofit organization holding a tax exempt status under the Federal Internal Revenue 
Code of 1954 (26 USC 501(c) or (d)) shall not be required to make payment in full of any escrow 
accounts but rather shall: 
(1) ?Pay 25 percent of the total escrow amount otherwise due when the application is submitted. 
(2) ?After the application is submitted, the applicant must at all times maintain on account a 
minimum of ten percent of the total escrow amount due in order to cover those items paid for 
out of the escrow account. 
(3) ?If the amount on deposit in the escrow account for the applicant should fall below the required 
ten-percent minimum, the applicant shall be required to replenish the escrow account so that a 
ten-percent balance of the total escrow amounts due is held on account by the township. 
(4) ?In determining whether an applicant qualifies for this reduction in escrow accounts, in addition 
to showing that it is a charitable, philanthropic, fraternal or religious, nonprofit organization 
holding a tax-exempt status as referred to in this subsection, the organization must also show 
that: 
a. ?It primarily serves the residents of the township; 
b. ?It promotes the public health, safety and welfare of the residents of the township. 
c. ?Collection of the fees would constitute an economic hardship upon the applicant; or 
d. ?The unique characteristics of the application make collection of the full fees substantially 
disproportionate to the regulatory costs applicable to reviewing the application. 
(g) ?Notwithstanding any other provision to the contrary in this section, any board of education shall be 
exempt from the payment of any fee charged under this chapter. 
(Code 1988, § 175-9; Ord. No. 65-94, §§ 1—3, 12-6-1994; Ord. No. 38-99, § II, 8-3-1999; Ord. 
No. 75-99, § 1, 12-14-1999; Ord. No. 58-03, § I, 7-15-2003; Ord. No. 2007-23, § I, 4-10-2007;

Sec. 62-42. - Hearings. 
(a) ?Required. The appropriate municipal agency shall hold a hearing on each application for 
development or adoption, revision or amendment of the master plan. The hearing shall be held on a 
date to be fixed by the secretary of the appropriate agency, but in no case shall the hearing be set 
later than the last date the municipal agency has, by ordinance, to act on the application. 
(b) ?Waiver of certain hearings. The municipal agency may waive notice and public hearings for minor 
subdivisions. 
(c) ?Rules. The planning board and zoning board of adjustment may make rules governing the conduct 
of hearings before themselves, which rules shall not be inconsistent with the provisions of the 
Municipal Land Use Law, N.J.S.A. 40:55D-1 et seq., or of this chapter. 
(d) ?Maps and documents. Any maps and documents for which approval is sought at a hearing shall be 
on file and available for public inspection at least ten days before the date of the hearing, during 
normal business hours, in the office of the secretary of the appropriate board. The applicant may 
produce other documents, records or testimony at the hearing to substantiate, clarify or supplement 
the previously filed maps and documents. 
(e) ?Oaths. The officer presiding at the hearing or such person as he may designate shall have power to 
administer oaths and issue subpoenas to compel the attendance of witnesses and the production of 
relevant evidence, including witnesses and documents presented by the parties, and the provisions 
of the County and Municipal Investigations Law, N.J.S.A. 2A:67-1 et seq., shall apply. 
(f) ?Testimony. The testimony of all witnesses relating to an application for development shall be taken 
under oath or affirmation by the presiding officer, and the right of cross examination shall be 
permitted to all interested parties through their attorneys, if represented, or directly, if not 
represented, subject to the discretion of the presiding officer and to reasonable limitations as to time 
and number of witnesses. 
(g) ?Evidence. Technical rules of evidence shall not be applicable to the hearing, but the board may 
exclude irrelevant, immaterial or unduly repetitious evidence. 
(h) ?Records. Each board shall provide for a transcript of proceedings to any interested party at that 
party's expense, with the cost for the transcript not to exceed the maximum permitted in N.J.S.A. 
2A:11-15. The transcript shall be certified to be accurate, in writing, by the transcriber. Any interested 
party may arrange for the services of a certified shorthand reporter to make a verbatim record of any 
proceedings; provided, however, that no such certified shorthand reporter shall be permitted to be 
seated for such purpose unless the reporter consents, on the record, to produce a transcript of the 
proceedings to be recorded within 25 days of a request for the transcript. A certified shorthand 
reporter may require that a deposit be paid prior to the preparation of any transcript, which deposit 
shall not exceed that which is permitted under the rules of court of the state. In no event shall the 
township or any official organ thereof be required to pay a deposit for the preparation of any 
transcript. 
(i) ?Voting by absent member. When any hearing before the municipal agency shall carry over two or 
more meetings, a member of the board who was absent for one or more meetings shall be eligible to 
vote on the matter upon which the hearing was conducted, notwithstanding his absence from one or 
more of the meetings; provided, however, that such board member has available to him a transcript 
or recording of the meeting from which he was absent and certifies, in writing, to the board that he 
has read such transcript or listened to such recording. 
(Code 1988, § 175-10)

of the hearing, may be made in the same manner as to a corporation without further notice to unit 
owners, co-owners or homeowners on account of such common elements or areas. 
(e) ?Notice to adjoining municipality. Notice of all hearings on applications for development involving 
property located within 200 feet of an adjoining municipality shall be given, by personal service or

(k) ?Notice to public utility, cable television company or local utility. Notice of hearings on applications 
requiring public notice pursuant to subsection (a) of this section shall be given, in the case of a public

public utility, cable television company or local utility or by mailing a copy of the notice by certified 
mail to the person whose name appears on the registration form at the address shown on that form. 
(l) ?Hearings by zoning board of adjustment or planning board. 
(1) ?Not less than ten days prior to the scheduled date for any public hearing by the zoning board of 
adjustment or the planning board on any application for development that may result in the

assessments within 30 days of the date of suspension, the permits shall automatically be

certificate, a stay would in the agency's opinion cause imminent peril to life or property. In such case 
proceedings shall not be stayed other than by order of the superior court, on application upon notice 
to such agency and on good cause shown.

decision, shall mail a copy thereof to the appellant and applicant or, if represented, to their attorneys,

action instituted by any state agency, political subdivision or other party to protect the public health 
and welfare or by a directive or order issued by any state agency, political subdivision or court of 
competent jurisdiction to protect the public health and welfare, the municipal agency shall process 
such application for development in accordance with this chapter. If such application for development 
complies with this chapter, the planning board or zoning board of adjustment shall approve such 
application conditioned on the removal of such legal barrier to development. 
(b) ?Approval subject to approval of other agencies. If the development proposed by an application for 
development requires an approval by a governmental agency other than the municipal agency, the

approval of such governmental agency, provided that the municipal agency shall make a decision on 
any application for development within the time period provided in this chapter or within an extension 
of such period as has been agreed to by the applicant, unless the municipal agency is prevented or

(Code 1988, § 175-38) 


Sec. 62-114. - Powers and duties. 
(a) ?Powers granted by law. The zoning board of adjustment shall have such powers as are granted by 
law to: 
(1) ?Hear and decide appeals where it is alleged by the appellant that there is error in any order, 
requirement, decision or refusal made by an administrative official or agency based on or made 
in the enforcement of the zoning provisions of this chapter. 
(2) ?Hear and decide requests for interpretation of the zoning map or zoning provisions of this 
chapter or for decisions upon other special questions upon which the board is authorized by this 
chapter to pass. 
(3) ?Where, by reason of exceptional narrowness, shallowness or shape of a specific piece of 
property or by reason of exceptional topographic conditions or physical features uniquely 
affecting a specific piece of property or by reason of an extraordinary and exceptional situation 
uniquely affecting a specific piece of property or the structures lawfully existing thereon, the 
strict application of any regulation in this chapter or ordinance would result in peculiar and 
exceptional practical difficulties to or exceptional and undue hardship upon the developer of 
such property, to grant, upon an application or an appeal relating to such property, a variance 
from such strict application of such regulation so as to relieve such difficulties or hardship; or 
where, in an application or appeal relating to a specific piece of property, the purposes of this 
chapter would be advanced by a deviation from the zoning ordinance requirements and the 
benefits of the deviation would substantially outweigh any detriment, to grant a variance to allow 
departure from the regulations of this chapter; provided, however, that the fact that a proposed 
use is an inherently beneficial use shall not be dispositive of a decision on a variance under this 
subsection; provided, however, that no variance from those departures enumerated in 
subsection (a)(4) of this section shall be granted under this subsection, and provided further that 
the proposed development does not require approval by the planning board of a subdivision, 
site plan or conditional use in conjunction with which the planning board has power to review a 
request for a variance. 
(4) ?In particular cases and for special reasons, to grant a variance to allow departure from 
regulations contained in this chapter to permit a use or principal structure in a district restricted 
against such use or principal structure, an expansion of a nonconforming use, deviation from a 
specification or standard pertaining solely to a conditional use, an increase in the permitted floor 
area ratio as defined in this chapter or an increase in the permitted density as defined in this 
chapter, except as applied to the required lot area for a lot for detached one- or two-dwelling-
unit buildings, which lot is either an isolated undersized lot resulting from a minor subdivision or 
a height of a principal structure which exceeds by ten feet or ten percent the maximum height 
permitted in the district for a principal structure. A variance under this subsection shall be 
granted only by affirmative vote of at least five members of the board of adjustment. 
(b) ?Decisions impairing intent of zoning plan. No variance or other relief may be granted under the 
terms of this section, including a variance or other relief involving an inherently beneficial use, 
without a showing that such variance or other relief can be granted without substantial detriment to 
the public good and will not substantially impair the intent and the purpose of the zone plan and 
zoning ordinance. In respect to any airport safety zones delineated under the Air Safety and Zoning 
Act of 1983, P.L. 1983, c. 260 (N.J.S.A. 6:1-80 et seq.), no variance or other relief may be granted 
under the terms of this section, permitting the creation or establishment of a nonconforming use 
which would be prohibited under standards promulgated pursuant to that act, except upon issuance 
of a permit by the state commissioner of transportation. 
(c) ?Referral to other agencies. Any application under any subsection of this section may be referred to 
any appropriate person or agency, including the planning board, for its report, provided that such 
reference shall not extend the period of time within which the zoning board of adjustment shall act. 
(d) ?Additional powers. The zoning board of adjustment shall, in addition to the powers specified in 
subsection (a) of this section, have the following powers: 
(1) ?Issuance of permit for structure in street or other public way. A majority of the full authorized 
membership of the board may, in a specific case, direct the issuance of a permit for a building 
or structure in the bed of a mapped street or public drainageway, flood control basin or public 
area reserved on the official map if it is satisfied that the parcel of land cannot yield a 
reasonable return to the owner unless a building permit is granted and the building or structure 
will increase the cost of opening such street as little as practicable or will tend to cause a 
minimum change of the official map. In directing the issuance of the permit, the board shall 
impose reasonable requirements as a condition of granting the permit so as to promote the 
health, morals, safety and general welfare of the public. 
(2) ?Issuance of permit for structure without access to street. The board may, upon application or 
appeal, direct the issuance of a permit for a building or structure not related to a street where it 
is satisfied that, if the permit is not granted, practical difficulty or unnecessary hardship would 
result and the circumstances of the case do not require the building or structure to be related to 
a street. The board may direct the issuance of such a permit subject to conditions that will 
provide adequate access for firefighting equipment, ambulances and other emergency vehicles 
necessary for the protection of health and safety and that will protect any future street layout 
shown on the official map or on a general circulation plan element of the municipal master plan. 
(3) ?Authority to exercise powers of planning board. The board of adjustment shall have the power 
to grant, to the same extent and subject to the same restrictions as the planning board, 
subdivision or site plan approval or conditional use approval whenever the proposed 
development requires approval by the board of adjustment of a variance pursuant to subsection 
(a)(4) of this section. The developer may elect to submit a separate application requesting 
approval of the variance and a subsequent application for any required approval of subdivision, 
site plan or conditional use. The separate approval of the variance shall be conditioned upon 
the grant of all required subsequent approvals by the board of adjustment. No such subsequent 
approval shall be granted unless such approval can be granted without substantial detriment to 
the public good and without substantial impairment of the intent and purpose of the zone plan 
and zoning ordinance. The number of votes of board members required to grant such 
subsequent approval shall be as otherwise provided in this chapter for the approval in question, 
and the special vote pursuant to subsection (a)(4) of this section shall not be required. 
(e) ?Power to reverse or modify decisions. In exercising its power to hear appeals, the board of 
adjustment may reverse or affirm, wholly or partly, or may modify the order, requirement, decision or 
determination appealed from and make such other requirement, decision or determination that 
should be made and, to that end, has all the powers of the administrative officer from whom the 
appeal was taken.

pertaining to the time for approval or denial of the final site plan. 
(d) ?Effect of final approval of subdivision plat or preliminary site plan for planned residential 
development. The effect of an approval of a final subdivision plat for a planned residential 
development shall be the same as that set forth in section 62-154(d) pertaining to the effect of final 
approval of major subdivision. The effect of an approval of a final site plan for a planned residential 
development shall be the same as that set forth in section 62-154(e) pertaining to expiration of the 
approval. 
(e) ?Final approval of sections or stages of planned residential development. Applications for final 
approval may be for the entire planned residential development or, to the extent set forth in the 
agreement for timing of the development between the developer, the board and the township council, 
for a section thereof. Applications shall be made within the time specified in the agreement for timing 
of the development. 
(f) ?Deviations from conditions of preliminary approval. Deviations from the conditions of preliminary 
approval shall be in accordance with the following: 
(1) ?Change of conditions beyond control of developer. The board may permit minimal deviations 
from the conditions of preliminary approval necessitated by change of conditions beyond the 
control of the developer, after the date of preliminary approval, without the developer being 
required to submit another application for development for preliminary approval. 
(2) ?Minimal deviation. For purposes of this subsection, a minimal deviation shall be a deviation 
which does not: 
a. ?Vary the proposed residential density or intensity of use by more than five percent within 
the maximum permitted. 
b. ?Involve a reduction of the area set aside for common open space nor the substantial 
relocation of such area. 
c. ?Increase by more than ten percent the floor area proposed for nonresidential use. 
d. ?Increase by more than five percent the total ground area covered by buildings nor involve a 
substantial change in the height of buildings. 
(3) ?New application for change. If the proposed change is not a minimal deviation, as defined in 
subsection (f)(2) of this section, the developer shall be required to submit another application for 
development for preliminary approval. 
(4) ?New application for preliminary approval. If the developer is required to submit another 
application for development for preliminary approval because the requested changes are not 
minimal deviations and if the developer has entered into an approved agreement for timing of 
the development as part of his original application for preliminary approval, he may submit a 
new application for preliminary approval for the entire development or for one or more sections 
of that development. 
(Code 1988, § 175-47) 


Sec. 62-159. - General development plan. 
(a) ?Short title. This section shall be known as the general development plan ordinance.

developer is seeking approval of a planned office/commercial development under section 62-1352 or 
a planned office/corporate development under section 62-1311 may submit a general development 
plan to the planning board prior to the granting of preliminary subdivision approval or preliminary site 
plan approval. For the purpose of this requirement, existing streets, rights-of-way for interior roads to 
be constructed, zone district boundary lines, utility lines and railroads shall not be deemed to divide 
acreage. 
(c) ?Plat required. Except for required reports and other written documentation, the general development 
plan shall be submitted in plat form at a scale of approximately one inch equals 200 feet or such 
other scale permitting the entire site to be shown on one sheet not larger than 42 inches by 60 
inches. Enlargements of portions of the plan may be submitted on separate sheets of the same size. 
(d) ?Contents. A general development plan shall include the following: 
(1) ?A general land use plan indicating the tract area and general locations of the land uses to be 
included in the planned development. The total amount of floor area to be provided and 
proposed land area to be devoted to such use shall be set forth. In addition, the proposed types 
of uses to be included in the planned development shall be set forth, and the land area to be 
occupied by each proposed use shall be estimated. The density and intensity of use of the 
entire planned development shall be set forth, and the floor area ratio shall be provided. 
(2) ?A circulation plan showing the general location and types of transportation facilities, including 
facilities for pedestrian access, within the planned development and any proposed 
improvements to the existing transportation system outside the planned development. 
(3) ?An open space plan showing the proposed land area and general location of parks and any 
other land area to be set aside for conservation and recreational purposes and a general 
description of improvements proposed to be made thereon, including a plan for the operation

districts as a result of the completion of the planned development. The fiscal report shall also 
include a detailed projection of property tax revenues which will accrue to the county, 
municipality and school district according to the timing schedule provided under this chapter, 
and following the completion of the planned development in its entirety. 
(10) ?A proposed timing schedule for a planned development whose construction is contemplated 
over a period of years, including any terms or conditions which are intended to protect the 
interests of the public and of the occupants of any section of the planned development prior to 
the completion of the development in its entirety. 
(11) ?An agreement between the developer, the planning board and the township relating to the 
planned development. 
(e) ?Time for decision when planning board reviews application for plan approval. The planning board 
shall grant or deny the general development plan within 95 days after submission of a complete 
application to the administrative officer or within such further time as may be consented to by the 
applicant. Failure of the planning board to act within the period prescribed shall constitute general 
development plan approval of the planned development. 
(f) ?Effect and duration of approval. The effect and the duration of approval shall be as follows: 
(1) ?The planned development shall be developed in accordance with the general development 
plan approved by the planning board notwithstanding any provision of the Municipal Land Use 
Law, N.J.S.A. 40:55D-1 et seq., or of any ordinance or regulation adopted pursuant thereto after 
the effective date of the approval. 
(2) ?The term of the effect of the general development plan approval shall be determined by the 
planning board using the guidelines set forth in subsection (f)(3) of this section, except that the 
term of the effect of the approval shall not exceed 20 years from the date upon which the 
developer receives final approval of the first section of the planned development. 
(3) ?In making its determination regarding the duration of the effect of approval of the general 
development plan, the planning board shall consider the following: 
a. ?The amount of floor area to be constructed; 
b. ?Prevailing economic conditions; 
c. ?The timing schedule to be followed in completing the development and the likelihood of its 
fulfillment; 
d. ?The developer's capability of completing the proposed development; 
e. ?The contents of the general development plan; and 
f. ?Any conditions which the planning board attaches to the approval thereof. 
(g) ?Modification of proposed timing schedule. If the developer seeks to modify the proposed timing 
schedule, such modification shall require the approval of the planning board. The planning board 
shall, in deciding whether or not to grant approval of the modification, take into consideration the 
following: 
(1) ?Prevailing economic and market conditions; 
(2) ?Anticipated and actual needs for residential and nonresidential space within the township and 
the region; and 
(3) ?The availability and capacity of public facilities to accommodate the proposed development. 
(h) ?Variations in location of land uses or increase in density or floor area ratio. The developer shall be 
required to gain the prior approval of the planning board if, after approval of the general development 
plan, the developer wishes to make any variation in the location of land uses within the planned 
development or to increase the density of residential development or the floor area ratio of 
nonresidential development in any section of the planned development. 
(i) ?Amendment or revision of plan; allowable reductions within original approval. Procedures for 
amendment or revision of the general development plan and allowable reductions within the original 
approval shall be as follows: 
(1) ?Except as provided under this section, once a general development plan has been approved by 
the planning board, it may be amended or revised only upon application by the developer 
approved by the planning board. 
(2) ?A developer, without violating the terms of the approval pursuant to this section, may, in 
undertaking any section of the planned development, after written notice to the planning and 
engineering department, reduce the amount of floor space by no more than 15 percent or 
reduce floor area ratio by no more than 15 percent. 
(j) ?Notice of completion of section of development; notice by township of nonfulfillment; hearing; 
termination of approval; causes. Notice of completion of a section of the development, notice by the 
township of nonfulfillment, hearing procedures and termination of approval shall be in accordance 
with the following: 
(1) ?Upon completion of each section of the development as set forth in the approved general 
development plan, the developer shall notify the administrative officer, by certified mail, as 
evidence that the developer is fulfilling his obligations under the approved plan. For the 
purposes of this subsection, "completion" of any section of the development shall mean that the 
developer has acquired a certificate of occupancy for every structure, as set forth in the 
approved general development plan and pursuant to section 15 of the Uniform Construction 
Code, N.J.S.A. 52:27D-133. If the township does not receive such notification at the completion 
of any section of the development, the township shall notify the developer, by certified mail, in 
order to determine whether or not the terms of the approved plan are being complied with. 
(2) ?If a developer does not complete any section of the development within eight months of the 
date provided for in the approved plan or if at any time the township has cause to believe that 
the developer is not fulfilling his obligations pursuant to the approved plan, the township shall 
notify the developer, by certified mail, and the developer shall have ten days within which to 
give evidence that he is fulfilling his obligations pursuant to the approved plan. The planning 
board thereafter shall conduct a hearing to determine whether or not the developer is in 
violation of the approved plan. If, after such a hearing, the planning board finds good cause to 
terminate the approval, it shall provide written notice of the termination to the developer, and the 
approval shall be terminated 30 days thereafter. 
(3) ?If a developer who has general development plan approval does not apply for preliminary 
approval for the planned development which is the subject of that general development plan 
approval within five years of the date upon which the general development plan has been 
approved by the planning board, the planning board shall have cause to terminate the approval. 
However, the planning board, in establishing the timing schedule pursuant to subsection (d)(10) 
of this section, and the township, in negotiating a developer's agreement relating to the planned 
development in accordance with subsection (d)(11) of this section, may allow for preliminary 
approval for a section of the planned development to be applied for subsequent to five years of 
the date upon which the general development plan has been approved by the planning board, 
provided at least one section of the planned development has been applied for within five years 
of the date upon which the general development plan has been approved by the planning 
board, in which case the planning board shall not have cause to terminate the general 
development plan approval as long as the developer shall fulfill his obligations under the 
approved plan. 
(k) ?Termination of approval upon completion of development. If a development which is the subject of 
an approved general development plan is completed before the end of the term of the approval, the 
approval shall terminate with the completion of the development. For the purposes of this section, a 
development shall be considered complete on the date upon which a certificate of occupancy has 
been issued for the final structure in the last section of the development in accordance with the 
timing schedule set forth in the approved general development plan and the developer has fulfilled 
all of his obligations pursuant to the approval. 
(Ord. No. 16-03, § II(175-47.1), 4-1-2003) 


Sec. 62-160. - Simultaneous review and approval of subdivisions and site plans. 
(a) ?Exceptions from subdivision requirements. The municipal agency, when acting upon applications for 
preliminary major or minor subdivision approval, shall have the power to grant such exceptions from 
the requirements for subdivision approval as may be reasonable and within the general purpose and 
intent of the provisions for subdivision review and approval of this chapter if the literal enforcement of 
one or more provisions of this chapter is impracticable or will exact undue hardship because of 
peculiar conditions pertaining to the land in question. 
(b) ?Exceptions from site plan requirements. The municipal agency, when acting upon applications for 
preliminary site plan approval, shall have the power to grant such exceptions from the requirements 
for site plan approval as may be reasonable and within the general purpose and intent of the 
provisions for site plan review and approval of this chapter if the literal enforcement of one or more 
provisions of this chapter is impracticable or will exact undue hardship because of peculiar conditions 
pertaining to the land in question. 
(c) ?Deviations for reasons beyond control of developer. The municipal agency may permit deviation 
from a final plan for development if caused by a change of conditions beyond the control of the 
developer after the date of final approval and the deviation would not substantially alter the character 
of the development or substantially impair the intent and purpose of the master plan and the zoning 
provisions of this chapter. 
(d) ?Authority to decide conditional use or site plan simultaneously with subdivision. The municipal 
agency shall have the power to review and approve or deny conditional uses, site plans, variances 
and subdivisions simultaneously with review for subdivision approval without the developer being 
required to make further application to the board or the board being required to hold further hearings. 
The longest time period for action by the board, whether it is for subdivision, conditional use or site 
plan approval, shall apply. Notice of a hearing for any combined application shall include notice of a 
hearing on all approvals sought. The board may permit the combined application for preliminary and 
final site plan approval, provided that notice of the public hearing specifies both approvals requested, 
and further provided that the time to act and the information provided shall be the same as if the 
applications were made consecutively. 
(e) ?Time for decision. The review by the municipal agency of a conditional use shall include any 
required site plan review, and the time period for action by the board on conditional uses shall apply 
to such site plan review. Failure of the board to act within the period prescribed shall constitute 
approval of the application, and a certificate of the administrative officer as to the failure of the board 
to act shall be issued on request of the applicant. 
(Code 1988, § 175-48) 


Sec. 62-161. - Taxation of land subject to preliminary or extended tentative approval. 
(a) ?Time for valuation for higher use. Any parcel of land receiving preliminary subdivision, site plan or 
planned residential development approval for a use other than agriculture or horticulture, 
notwithstanding its valuation, assessment and taxation as an agricultural or horticultural use 
pursuant to the provisions of the Farmland Assessment Act of 1964, N.J.S.A. 54:4-23.1 et seq., shall 
be valued, assessed and taxed as of January 1 of the year following such preliminary approval as 
other land in the taxing district, such value and assessment to be established and taxes paid in 
accordance with the provisions of sections 8 and 9 of the Farmland Assessment Act of 1964, 
N.J.S.A. 54:4-23.8, 54:4-23.9, provided that the provisions thereof shall apply serially to any 
development whose preliminary approval proposes construction in stages and a separate application 
for final approval for each stage, and only that stage of the development designated for the earliest 
application for final approval shall be valued, assessed and taxed as provided in this section until 
certificates of occupancy for 50 percent of the building permits in such stage have been issued, at 
which time the second stage shall be valued, assessed and taxed as provided in this section and so 
on until qualification for valuation, assessment and taxation pursuant to the provisions of the 
Farmland Assessment Act of 1964 lapses for the last stage of such development. 
(b) ?Revaluation following lapsed preliminary approval. Any parcel of land, otherwise qualifying as an 
agricultural or horticultural use pursuant to the provisions of the Farmland Assessment Act of 1964, 
N.J.S.A. 54:4-23.1 et seq., for which preliminary approval shall have lapsed pursuant to law or for 
which the owner thereof shall have made request, in writing, to the approving municipal body for 
rescinding of such preliminary and all subsequent approvals, shall be assessed, valued and taxed in 
the manner provided in the Farmland Assessment Act of 1964 as of January 1 of the year following 
such lapse or rescission. 
(c) ?Tolling of increased assessment during period of inability to develop. Any parcel of land to which the 
provisions of subsection (a) of this section are applicable but which cannot be developed because of 
the lack of available sanitary sewerage or water supply capacity necessary to serve such 
development shall be exempt from the operation of the provisions of subsection (a) of this section for 
the period from January 1 of the year following the calendar year in which such development 
becomes impracticable because of such lack of capacity to January 1 of the year following the 
calendar year in which such capacity becomes available. 
(d) ?Lands affected. The provisions of this section shall apply to any parcel of land designated as an 
agricultural or horticultural use, pursuant to the provisions of the Farmland Assessment Act of 1964, 
N.J.S.A. 54:4-23.1 et seq., which has tentative or subsequent planned unit development approval or 
site plan approval on August 1, 1976, which approval is thereafter extended in duration of time 
beyond the period approved therefor before August 1, 1976. 
(Code 1988, § 175-49) 


Sec. 62-162. - Open space dedication and maintenance. 
(a) ?Dedication of open space to township. The township may, at any time and from time to time, accept 
the dedication of land or any interest therein for public use and maintenance, although it shall not be 
a condition of the approval of a planned residential development that land proposed to be set aside 
for common open space be dedicated or made available to public use. Such land or interest shall be 
deemed accepted by the township only upon presentation and acceptance of a deed in a form which 
meets the approval of the township attorney, together with a certification from the tax collector that 
no municipal liens, taxes or assessments for local improvements are due, payable, delinquent or 
pending on such property or interest. Anyone seeking acceptance of any such land or interest after 
September 30 of any calendar year shall first deposit with the tax collector a sum equal to the 
estimated taxes on such property or interest for the calendar year next following. Nothing contained 
in this subsection shall be deemed to eliminate any right lawfully vested in the township council 
under N.J.S.A. title 54 to waive or forgive the payment of any taxes, municipal liens or assessments 
for local improvements. 
(b) ?Establishment of organizations to own and maintain open space. Any developer who submits any 
application for planned residential development or a residential cluster shall provide an organization 
for the ownership and maintenance of open space for the benefit of owners or residents of the 
development if the open space is not dedicated to the township or other governmental agency. Such 
organization shall not be dissolved and shall not dispose of any open space, by sale or otherwise, 
except to an organization conceived and established to own and maintain the open space for the 
benefit of such development, and thereafter such organization shall not be dissolved or dispose of 
any of its open space without first offering to dedicate the open space to the township. 
(c) ?Remedies of township when organization fails to maintain open space. If such organization shall fail 
to maintain the open space in a reasonable order and condition, the township council may serve 
written notice upon such organization or upon the owners of the development setting forth the 
manner in which the organization has failed to maintain the open space in reasonable condition. 
Such notice shall include a demand that the deficiencies of maintenance be cured within 35 days 
and shall state the date and place of a hearing thereon, which shall be held within 15 days of the 
notice. At such hearing the township council may modify the terms of the original notice as to 
deficiencies and may give a reasonable extension of time, not to exceed 65 days, within which they 
shall be cured. If the deficiencies set forth in the original notice or in the modification thereof shall not 
be cured within such 35 days or any permitted extension thereof, the township, in order to preserve 
the open space and maintain the open space, for a period of one year, may enter upon and maintain 
such land. Such entry and maintenance shall not vest in the public any rights to use the open space, 
except when the open space is voluntarily dedicated to the public by the owners. Before the 
expiration of such year, the township council shall, upon its initiative or upon the request of the 
organization theretofore responsible for the maintenance of the open space, call a public hearing 
upon 15 days' written notice to such organization and to the owner of the development, to be held by 
the township council. At the hearing such organization and the owners of the development shall 
show cause why such maintenance by the township shall not, at the election of the township, 
continue for a succeeding year. If the township council shall determine that such organization is 
ready and able to maintain the open space in a reasonable condition, the township shall cease to 
maintain the open space at the end of such year. If the township council shall determine that the 
organization is not ready and able to maintain the open space in a reasonable condition, the 
township may, in its discretion, continue to maintain the open space during the next succeeding year, 
subject to a similar hearing and determination in each year thereafter. The decision of the township 
council, in any case, shall constitute a final administrative decision, subject to judicial review. 
(d) ?Assessment of costs of maintenance by the township when open space is not dedicated to 
township. The cost of maintenance by the township shall be assessed pro rata against the properties 
within the development that have a right of enjoyment of the open space in accordance with 
assessed value at the time of imposition of the lien and shall become a lien and tax on such 
properties and shall be added to and be a part of the taxes to be levied and assessed thereon and 
enforced and collected with interest by the same officers and in the same manner as other taxes. 
(Code 1988, § 175-50) 


Sec. 62-163. - Reservation of public areas. 
(a) ?Designation on plat of public areas. Where the master plan or official map of the township provides 
for the reservation of designated streets, public drainageways, flood control basins or public areas 
within the proposed development, before approving a subdivision or site plan, the municipal agency 
may further require that such streets, ways, basins or areas be shown on the plat in locations and 
sizes suitable to their intended uses. 
(b) ?Acquisition of public areas by township. The municipal agency may reserve the location and extent 
of such streets, ways, basins or areas shown on the plat for a period of one year after the approval of 
the final plat or within such further time as may be agreed to by the developer. Unless, during such 
period or extensions thereof, the township shall have entered into a contract to purchase or shall 
have instituted condemnation proceedings according to law for the fee or a lesser interest in the land 
comprising the streets, ways, basins or areas, the developer shall not be bound by such reservations 
shown on the plot and may proceed to use such lands for private use in accordance with applicable 
development regulations. 
(c) ?Exception for required dedications. The provisions of this section shall not apply to streets and 
roads, flood control basins or public drainageways necessitated by the subdivision or land 
development and required for final approval. 
(d) ?Compensation to developer. The developer shall be entitled to just compensation for actual loss 
found to be caused by such temporary reservation and deprivation of use. In such instance, unless a 
lesser amount has previously been mutually agreed upon, just compensation shall be deemed to be 
the fair market value of an option to purchase the land reserved for the period of reservation, 
provided that determination of such fair market value shall include but not be limited to consideration 
of the real property taxes apportioned to the land reserved and prorated for the period of reservation. 
The developer shall be compensated for the reasonable increased cost of legal, engineering, or 
other professional services incurred in connection with obtaining subdivision approval or site plan 
approval, as the case may be, caused by the reservation. 
(e) ?Payment of compensation. Payment of compensation shall be in accordance with the following: 
(1) ?The planning board shall notify the developer, in writing, of its intention to reserve all or a 
portion of the land which is the subject of an application. Such notice may be included in a 
resolution of preliminary or final approval or may be given to the developer in a separate 
document. 
(2) ?When the period of reservation is ended, the planning board shall promptly notify the developer 
and the township council. No later than 45 days from the date on which the period of reservation 
is ended, the township council shall, by resolution, appoint an assessment commission to 
determine the amount of compensation to be paid by the township on account of the 
reservation. 
(3) ?The assessment commission shall be made up of three discreet freeholders, residents of the 
township, who are in no way interested in the subject property. No member of a municipal 
agency shall serve as an assessment commissioner. 
(4) ?Within 30 days of their appointment, the assessment commissioners shall inspect the property 
and shall fix a time and place for hearing all persons interested in the matter. Notice of the 
hearing shall be given by publication in the official newspaper of the township at least ten days 
prior to the date of the hearing and shall be served upon the property owner by mailing a copy 
thereof, by certified mail, to the property owner at his address as shown on the current tax 
duplicate. All persons interested or affected shall have ample opportunity to be heard, and all 
witnesses shall be examined under oath. Thereafter the commission shall determine the 
amount of a just and equitable award, based on the requirements of subsections (a) through (d) 
of this section, and shall certify and report the determination to the township council. 
(5) ?The township council shall thereafter consider the report and may adopt and confirm the report 
with or without alterations, as may seem proper to it, and may refer the matter back to the 
assessment commission for revision or correction before taking final action upon it. The 
township council shall fix a time and place for hearing all persons interested in the matter who 
may object to the amount of compensation reported by the assessment commission. Notice of 
the hearing shall be given by publication in the official newspaper of the township at least ten 
days prior to the date of the hearing and shall be served upon the property owner by mailing a 
copy thereof, by certified mail, to the property owner at his address as shown on the current tax 
duplicate. All persons interested or affected shall have an opportunity to be heard, and all 
witnesses shall be examined under oath. 
(6) ?When the report and award shall be adopted and confirmed, with or without alterations, it shall 
be deemed to be final and conclusive. Any person aggrieved by such award may, after the 
award has been confirmed by the township council, with or without alterations, appeal therefrom 
to the superior court. Appeals must be taken within 45 days of the day of confirmation by 
serving written notice upon the township clerk, or the right of appeal shall be deemed to be 
waived. 
(7) ?When the award is confirmed by the township council, the amount thereof shall, after such 
confirmation, be tendered to the person entitled thereto. If it is uncertain as to who is entitled 
thereto or if the township is unable to tender such an award by reason of the incapacity or 
absence of any person entitled thereto, or otherwise, or if any person refuses to accept or 
receive such award, the award may be paid into the superior court to be distributed to the 
person entitled thereto according to law. 
(8) ?The award shall be paid from the proceeds of a specific or general bonding ordinance, from a 
capital fund established for such purposes or from a general appropriation. If the award is not 
paid within two months of the date of confirmation, interest thereon from the date of confirmation 
shall be imposed at the same rate as may be imposed upon unpaid taxes in the township. 
(9) ?If it deems it equitable to do so, the township may credit the amount of taxes or other municipal 
assessments or liens due to the township against the amount of the award to be paid to the 
person entitled thereto. 
(Code 1988, § 175-51) 


Sec. 62-164. - Off-tract improvements required; construction; contributions. 
(a) ?Off-tract improvements required . Developers and land use applicants shall, as a condition of 
preliminary approval of a major subdivision or site plan application, and in those circumstances 
where a simultaneous application for preliminary and final approval is filed as a condition of such 
preliminary and final approval, be required to either construct, or pay for, the pro rata share of 
providing reasonable and necessary improvements to streets, water, sewerage and drainage 
facilities, and easements therefor, located outside the property limits of the subdivision or 
development but necessitated or required by construction within said subdivision or development. 
(1) ?The improvements included in this section shall include, but not be limited to, reasonable and 
necessary access easements, street and roadway improvements, storm water management 
facilities and easements, sanitary sewerage facilities and easements, drainage and flood control 
improvements and easements, water distribution facilities and all other related facilities, located 
outside the property limits of the subdivision or development but necessitated or required by 
construction improvements within such subdivision or development. 
(2) ?Such improvements shall be deemed reasonable and necessary when they are consistent with 
the circulation plan element and the utility service plan element of the township master plan. 
(b) ?Improvements to be constructed by and at the sole expense of the developer . 
(1) ?In cases where the reasonable and necessary need for off tract improvements is necessitated 
or required by the proposed development application and where no other property owners 
receive a special benefit thereby, the land use board shall require, as a condition of preliminary 
major subdivision or preliminary site plan approval, the applicant, at the applicant's expense, to 
provide for and construct such off tract improvements as if such improvements were on tract 
improvements. 
(2) ?Enlargement, repair, renovation and/or upgrading of existing off tract facilities solely 
necessitated by the proposed development shall not be deemed to be a special benefit to other 
property owners. 
(3) ?The full cost of these off tract improvements shall be included in the basis for calculating the 
size of the performance bond or other guarantee as specified and required by this chapter. 
(c) ?Other improvements to be constructed off tract . 
(1) ?In cases where an off tract improvement is necessitated by a proposed development 
application, and where it is determined by the land use board that other properties outside the 
proposed development will also be benefited by the improvements, the developer shall, at the 
discretion of the board, either provide for and construct such off tract improvements, with a right 
to receive reimbursement of any excess costs associated therewith, or pay its pro rata share of 
the cost of the off tract improvement as required for the proposed development, as a condition 
of preliminary major subdivision or preliminary site plan approval. 
(d) ?Installation of improvements by the applicant . 
(1) ?In cases where the off-tract improvements are to be constructed by the developer, the township 
council, land use board and the developer shall enter into a developer's agreement providing for 
the installation and construction of the off tract improvements by the applicant. 
(2) ?The applicant shall comply with all design, construction and inspection requirements and 
principles of any applicable state, county and local authority when providing the off-tract 
improvements. 
(3) ?Even where any off tract improvements were determined to benefit other properties outside the 
proposed development, the total cost of this improvement shall be included in the basis for 
calculating the amount of the performance bond or other guarantee required by this Chapter to 
be posted by the developer. 
(e) ?Installation of improvements by the township. 
(1) ?If the off tract improvements, in part or in whole, which benefit off tract owners are not to be 
constructed by the developer, but are necessitated by the proposed development application, 
the developer, no later than the time of final plan sign-off, shall pay and deposit in cash, its pro 
rata share of such off tract improvements. The monies paid by the developer pursuant to this 
section shall be paid to the Treasurer of South Brunswick, to be held in an interest bearing 
escrow account. 
(2) ?The township shall be permitted to utilize the monies paid by the developer toward the off tract 
improvements when a contract is awarded or the township otherwise undertakes to complete 
the off tract improvements. Any interest that may accumulate on the escrow deposit shall be 
credited to the developer and paid upon the release of any remaining balance of the escrow 
account once the off tract improvements have been completed. 
(3) ?In the event the township shall construct any off tract improvement as a local improvement 
under N.J.S.A. 40:56-1 et seq., the developer may be called upon to pay, in addition to the 
amount set forth above, the amount by which such property was especially benefited by the 
improvement. 
(4) ?Upon the completion of any off tract improvement which was installed by the township and 
which was required pursuant to this section, the developer's pro rata amount shall be calculated 
in accordance with the actual, as compared to the estimated, cost of the improvements. To the 
extent that such recalculation shall increase the required amount of any cash deposit made by 
the developer, the developer shall forthwith pay the amount of such increase to the township. 
To the extent that it shall decrease the required amount thereof, the township shall refund such 
decrease to the developer. 
(f) ?Standards for allocation of costs. The board, with the assistance of the township engineer and 
township staff, shall determine the proportionate or pro-rata amount of the cost of the improvements 
to be borne by each developer or applicant within a related and common area based on the following 
standards: 
(1) ?The total cost of the off-tract improvements. 
(2) ?The increase in the value of the properties affected. 
(3) ?The benefits conferred upon the developer. 
(4) ?The needs created by the development. 
(5) ?Population and land use projections for the general area of the development and other areas to 
be served by the off-tract improvements. 
(6) ?The estimated time for construction of the off-tract improvements. 
(7) ?The period of usefulness of the off-tract improvements. 
(g) ?Drainage. In addition to the standards for allocation of costs set forth in this section, the developer's 
pro rata costs for drainage facilities may also be based upon: 
(1) ?The proportionate relationship between the acreage for the development and the total acreage 
contributing to the drainage basins involved; 
(2) ?The proposed use of land within the subdivision or site plan and the amount of land area to be 
covered by impervious surfaces on the land within the subdivision or site plan; and 
(3) ?The use, condition, status and proposed future use of the remaining land area in the drainage 
basin. 
(h) ?Sewerage. In addition to the standards for allocation of costs set forth in this section, the 
developer's pro rata costs for sewerage facilities may be based upon: 
(1) ?The proportion that the development's total anticipated volume of sewerage effluent bears to 
the existing capacity of existing and projected sewage facilities; 
(2) ?The condition of lines and other appurtenances leading to and serving the development; 
(3) ?The types of effluent; 
(4) ?The use, condition, status and proposed future use of the remaining land in the sanitary sewer 
service area; and 
(5) ?Particular problems requiring special equipment or added costs for treatment. 
(i) ?Water. In addition to the standards for allocation of costs set forth in this section, the developer's pro 
rata costs for water supply and distribution facilities may be based upon: 
(1) ?The added facilities required by the total anticipated water use requirements of the 
development; 
(2) ?The condition of lines and other appurtenances leading to and serving the development; 
(3) ?The use, condition, status and proposed future use of the remaining land in the water service 
area; and 
(4) ?Particular problems requiring special equipment or added costs for delivery of water to the 
development. 
(j) ?Standards shall not be changed except under certain circumstances. The standards by which the 
board shall determine the proportionate or pro-rata amount of the cost of the improvements to be 
borne by each developer or applicant within a related and common area shall not be altered for that 
developer or applicant subsequent to preliminary approval, unless the application is significantly 
altered between the time of preliminary approval and final application. 
(k) ?Improvements to be based upon master plan. The capacity and design of proposed improvements 
shall be consistent with the circulation plan element and utility service plan element of the master 
plan. Costs shall be reasonably related to the added growth attributable to the applicant's 
development, and the maximum amount which may be charged to any development shall not exceed 
the applicant's fair share of the total improvement costs. The proportionate or pro rata amount of the 
cost of such improvements within a related or common area shall be based on the criteria set forth in 
this section. Off-tract improvements shall be consistent with those improvements identified in the 
circulation plan element and utility service plan element of the master plan as local improvements 
and shall include intersections between local and county or state streets. An applicant's pro rata 
share of off-tract improvements shall include a share of those improvements benefiting the applicant 
which are commenced or constructed by or for the township subsequent to the adoption of this 
section but prior to the applicant's preliminary major subdivision or site plan application and/or 
preliminary and final application if applied for simultaneously. 
(l) ?Developer's agreement; recordation. Where an applicant is required to construct or contribute to off-
tract improvements, the applicant shall enter into a developer's agreement with the township council 
and land use board, which shall indicate the applicant's pro rata share of off-tract improvement costs. 
The agreement shall also include a provision for credit or partial reimbursement to the applicant if off-
tract improvements are constructed by the applicant which specially benefit property other than that 
of the applicant, except that the applicant's right to reimbursement from owners of other property that 
has benefitted from said improvements shall terminate after ten years from the date of certification of 
actual costs for the off-tract improvements by the township engineer; provided, however, that if the 
applicant's pro-rata share shall have been determined on a phase-by-phase basis, then the ten year 
period shall apply to each phase, and shall run from the certification of actual costs by the township 
engineer as to each phase. The applicant shall record the developer's agreement, at its own 
expense, with the county clerk and shall file a copy of the recorded agreement with the township 
clerk. 
(m) ?Procedure for determining construction of off-tract improvements. 
(1) ?In cases where the need for any off-tract improvement is created by the proposed development 
and where the board determines that properties outside the development will also be benefited 
by the improvement, the board shall forthwith forward to the township council a list and 
description of all such improvements and the properties affected together with its request that 
the township council determine and advise the board of the procedure to be followed in the 
construction or installation thereof. The board shall defer final action upon the development plan 
until receipt of the township council's determination, or until the expiration of 90 days after the 
forwarding of such list and description to the township council without such determination 
having been made, whichever occurs first. 
(2) ?The township council, within 90 days after receipt of the list and description, shall determine 
and advise the board whether: 
a. ?The improvement or improvements are to be constructed or installed by the township: 
i. ?As a general improvement, the cost of which is to be borne at general expense (except 
as otherwise provided in this section as to the contribution thereto by the developer); 
or 
ii. ?As a local improvement, all or part of the cost of which is to be specially assessed 
against properties benefited thereby in proportion to benefits conferred by the 
improvements in accordance with N.J.S.A. 40:56-1 et seq., (except as otherwise 
provided in this section as to a contribution thereto by the developer); or 
b. ?The improvement or improvements are to be constructed or installed by the developer 
under a formula for partial reimbursement as set forth in this section. 
(3) ?If the township council shall determine that the improvement or improvements shall be 
constructed or installed under subsection (m)(2)a.i. of this section, the board shall estimate, with 
the aid of the township engineer or such other persons as have pertinent information or 
expertise regarding the amount, if any, by which the total cost thereof will exceed the total 
amount by which all properties, including the proposed development, will be specially benefited 
thereby, and the developer shall be liable to the township for such excess cost. 
(4) ?If the township council shall determine that the improvement or improvements shall be 
constructed or installed under subsection (m)(2)a.ii. of this section, the board shall estimate the 
difference between the total costs to be incurred and the total amount by which all properties to 
be benefited thereby, including the development property, will be specially benefited by the 
improvement, and the developer shall be liable to the township therefor, as well as for the 
amount of any special assessments against the development property for benefits conferred by 
the improvement or improvements. 
(5) ?If the township council shall determine that the improvement or improvements are to be 
constructed or installed by the developer under subsection (m)(2)b. of this section, the board 
shall estimate the amount of any excess costs, and the applicant shall be liable to the township 
therefor as well as for the amount of any special assessments against the development property 
for benefits conferred by the improvement or improvements. However, the developer shall be 
entitled to be reimbursed by the township for the amount of any special assessments against 
property other than the development property for benefits conferred by the improvement or 
improvements, if, as, and when the special assessments against such other property are 
received by the township. 
(6) ?If the township council shall not act upon the board's request within the 90 day period, the final 
decision as to off-tract improvement obligations shall be determined by the board in accordance 
with the standards set forth in this section. 
(n) ?Escrow accounts. Where the proposed off-tract improvement is to be undertaken at some future 
date, the moneys required for the improvement shall be deposited in a separate interest-bearing 
account, to the credit of the township, until such time as the improvement is constructed. If the off-
tract improvement is not commenced within ten years of deposit, all moneys and interest shall be 
returned to the applicant. An improvement shall be considered commenced if right-of- way 
acquisition and/or final engineering is in progress and the improvement is fully funded and committed 
to by the township. 
(o) ?Payment under protest. Where a developer pays the amount determined as its pro rata share under 
protest, it shall institute legal action within one year of such payment in order to preserve the right to 
a judicial determination as to the fairness and reasonableness of such amount. Failure to do so shall 
constitute a withdrawal of said protest and a waiver of any such claims. 
(p) ?Failure to pay pro-rata share. Should any party fail to pay its pro-rata share of the cost of required 
off-tract improvements as determined pursuant to this section, the amount due shall be deemed a 
municipal charge and debt collectible in the same way and manner as real property taxes in the 
State of New Jersey. The clerk shall certify the amount due to the tax collector, who shall record the 
same as a lien against the real property of the delinquent party. Payment in full of the amount of 
such lien shall be a condition of approval of any land use development application by such 
delinquent party or in which such delinquent party has an interest, and shall be a condition precedent 
to issuance of any construction permits, certificates of occupancy or other permits or approvals to 
such delinquent party, directly or indirectly. If a delinquent party already has commenced 
construction, then non-payment of the delinquent party's pro-rata share or any portion thereof shall 
be grounds for the township to stop such construction until the amount due and any accumulated 
interest assessed thereon shall have been paid in full.

anticipated that any construction, alteration or excavation work will impact upon a street, as that 
term is defined in chapter 98. 
(h) ?Performance guarantees. Performance guarantees, when required, shall be given in favor of the 
township in an amount to be determined by the township engineer, but not to exceed 120 percent of 
the cost of installation for the improvements, at least ten percent of which guarantee shall be in cash. 
The performance guarantee shall require completion of improvements within two years of the date of 
final approval, subject to extension for an additional two-year period by the township committee upon 
review of the adequacy of the guarantees by the township engineer. As a condition or as part of any 
such extension, the amount of the performance guarantees shall be increased or reduced, as the 
case may be, to an amount not to exceed 120 percent of the cost of installation as determined as of 
the time of the passage of the resolution granting the extension. Performance guarantees shall be 
reviewed and approved by the township attorney and township engineer prior to sign-off of final 
plans. 
(i) ?Release of performance guarantees. Performance guarantees shall be released in accordance with 
the following: 
(1) ?Completion of improvements. If the required improvements are not completed or corrected in 
accordance with the performance guarantee, the obligor and surety, if any, shall be liable 
thereon to the township for the reasonable cost of the improvements not completed or 
corrected, and the township may, either prior to or after the receipt of the proceeds thereof, 
complete such improvements. Such completion or correction of improvements shall be subject 
to the public bidding requirements of the Local Public Contracts Law, N.J.S.A. 40A:11-1 et seq. 
(2) ?Deeds of dedication, deeds of easement. Deeds of dedication and deeds of easement shall be 
submitted as follows: 
a. ?Prior to any request for release of performance guarantees, the developer shall submit 
executed but unrecorded deeds of dedication and/or deeds of easement, with metes and 
bounds descriptions, for all stormwater management easements, utility easements, 
conservation easements, sight triangles, and open space to be dedicated to the township. 
Where an open space is to be dedicated for a specific purpose as a condition of approval, 
the purpose of the dedication shall be stated in the deed of dedication. All sight triangle 
easements shall include language defining such easements as set forth in this chapter and 
provided by the planning department. Upon review and approval of the deeds by the 
director of planning, township engineer and township attorney, an ordinance proposing 
acceptance of the deeds shall be submitted for action by the township council. 
b. ?By operation of law, streets to be dedicated to public use are deemed accepted upon 
release of the performance guarantees. 
c. ?No lots or portions of lots dedicated to the township as open space or for future public use 
shall be removed from the tax rolls until an ordinance of acceptance has been adopted. 
Where the dedication is for future public use, such as roadway realignment or construction 
of a public facility, the township may defer acceptance of the dedication until such time as it 
is determined that the dedicated area will actually be required for such use. If it is 
determined that the dedicated area is not needed for public use, the dedication may be 
vacated by adoption of an appropriate ordinance by the township council. 
d. ?Upon acceptance, the township shall cause the deeds to be recorded in the office of the 
county clerk; the developer shall bear the cost of such recording at the rate charged to the 
township. 
e. ?Deeds of dedication for future public use which are not immediately accepted by township 
ordinance shall nevertheless be recorded in the office of the county clerk so as to provide 
public notice of the potential future use. The developer shall bear the cost of such 
recording at the rate charged to the township. The recording shall not serve as 
authorization to remove the property so dedicated from the tax rolls of the township. 
(3) ?Notification of completion; report of township engineer. Notice of completion and the inspection 
and report of the township engineer shall be in accordance with the following: 
a. ?Upon substantial completion of all required street improvements, except for the top course, 
and appurtenant utility improvements, and the connection of improvements to the public 
system, the obligor may request of the township council in writing, by certified mail 
addressed in care of the township clerk, that the township engineer prepare, in accordance 
with the itemized cost estimate prepared by the township engineer and appended to the 
performance guarantee pursuant to N.J.S.A. 40:55D-53a, a list of all uncompleted or 
unsatisfactorily completed improvements. If such a request is made, the obligor shall send 
a copy of the request to the township engineer. The request shall indicate which 
improvements have been completed and which improvements remain uncompleted in the 
judgment of the obligor. Thereupon the township engineer shall inspect all improvements 
covered by obligor's request and shall file a detailed list and report, in writing, with the 
township council and shall simultaneously send a copy thereof to the obligor not later than 
45 days after receipt of the obligor's request. 
b. ?The list prepared by the township engineer shall state, in detail, with respect to each 
improvement determined to be incomplete or unsatisfactory, the nature and extent of the 
incompleteness of each incomplete improvement or the nature and extent of, and remedy 
for, the unsatisfactory state of each completed improvement determined to be 
unsatisfactory. The report prepared by the township engineer shall identify each 
improvement determined to be complete and satisfactory together with a recommendation 
as to the amount of reduction to be made in the performance guarantee relating to the 
completed and satisfactory improvement, in accordance with the itemized cost estimate 
prepared by the township engineer and appended to the performance guarantee pursuant 
to N.J.S.A. 40:55D-53a. 
(4) ?Time for action by township council; copy of decision and engineer's report to obligor. The time 
for action by the township council and submission of a copy of the decision and the township 
engineer's report to the obligor shall be in accordance with the following: 
a. ?The township council, by resolution, shall either approve the improvements determined to 
be complete and satisfactory by the township engineer or reject any or all of these 
improvements upon the establishment in the resolution of cause for rejection and shall 
approve and authorize the amount of reduction to be made in the performance guarantee 
relating to the improvements accepted, in accordance with the itemized cost estimate 
prepared by the township engineer and appended to the performance guarantee pursuant 
to N.J.S.A. 40:55D-53a. This resolution shall be adopted not later than 45 days after 
receipt of the list and report prepared by the township engineer. Upon adoption of the 
resolution by the township council, the obligor shall be released from all liability pursuant to 
its performance guarantee, with respect to those approved improvements, except for that 
portion adequately sufficient to secure completion or correction of the improvements not 
yet approved, provided that 30 percent of the amount of the total performance guarantee 
posted may be retained to ensure completion and acceptability of all improvements. 
For the purpose of releasing the obligor from liability pursuant to its performance 
guarantee, the amount of the performance guarantee attributable to each approved 
improvement shall be reduced by the total amount for each such improvement, in 
accordance with the itemized cost estimate prepared by the township engineer and 
appended to the performance guarantee pursuant to N.J.S.A. 40:55D-53a, including any 
contingency factor applied to the cost of installation. If the sum of the approved 
improvements would exceed 70 percent of the total amount of the performance guarantee, 
the township may retain 30 percent of the amount of the total performance guarantee to 
ensure completion and acceptability of all improvements, as provided in this subsection. 
b. ?If the township engineer fails to send or provide the list and report as requested by the 
obligor pursuant to subsection (i)(3) of this section within 45 days from receipt of the 
request, the obligor may apply to the court in a summary manner for an order compelling 
the township engineer to provide the list and report within a stated time, and the cost of 
applying to the court, including reasonable attorney's fees, may be awarded to the 
prevailing party. 
If the township council fails to approve or reject the improvements determined by the 
township engineer to be complete and satisfactory or reduce the performance guarantee 
for the complete and satisfactory improvements within 45 days from the receipt of the 
township engineer's list and report, the obligor may apply to the court in a summary 
manner for an order compelling, within a stated time, approval of the complete and 
satisfactory improvements and approval of a reduction in the performance guarantee for 
the approvable complete and satisfactory improvements in accordance with the itemized 
cost estimate prepared by the township engineer and appended to the performance 
guarantee pursuant to N.J.S.A. 40:55D-53a, and the cost of applying to the court, including 
reasonable attorney's fees, may be awarded to the prevailing party. 
c. ?If the obligor has made a cash deposit with the township or approving authority as part of 
the performance guarantee, any partial reduction granted in the performance guarantee 
pursuant to this subsection shall be applied to the cash deposit in the same proportion as 
the original cash deposit bears to the full amount of the performance guarantee. 
(5) ?Failure of the township engineer or township council to act in a timely manner; obligor's 
remedy. The obligor's remedy for failure of the township engineer or township council to act in a 
timely manner shall be as follows: 
a. ?If the township engineer fails to send or provide the list and report as requested by the 
obligor within 45 days of the receipt of the request, the obligor may apply to the court in a 
summary manner for an order compelling the township engineer to provide the list and 
report within a stated time, and the cost of applying to the court, including reasonable 
attorney's fees, may be awarded to the prevailing party. 
b. ?If the Township council fails to approve or reject the improvements determined by the 
township engineer to be complete and satisfactory or reduce the performance guarantee 
for the complete and satisfactory improvements within 45 days from the receipt of the 
township engineer's report, the obligor may apply to the court in a summary manner for an 
order compelling, within a stated time, approval of the complete and satisfactory 
improvements and approval of a reduction in the performance guarantee for the 
approvable complete and satisfactory improvements in accordance with the itemized cost 
estimate prepared by the township engineer and appended to the performance guarantee, 
and the cost of applying to the court, including reasonable attorney's fees, may be awarded 
to the prevailing party. 
(6) ?Rejection of improvements. If any portion of the required improvements are rejected, the 
approving authority may require the obligor to complete or correct such improvements and, 
upon completion or correction, the obligor may again notify the township council of completion 
and request release of the performance guarantee. The same review procedure of notification 
as set forth in this subsection for the initial notification and request for release shall be utilized. 
(7) ?Right of obligor. Nothing in this subsection, however, shall be construed to limit the right of the 
obligor to contest, by legal proceedings, any determination of the township council or the 
township engineer. 
(8) ?Payment of inspection fees. The obligor shall reimburse the township for all reasonable 
inspection fees arising out of the foregoing inspection of improvements, provided that the 
township may require of the developer a deposit for the inspection fees in an amount not to 
exceed, except for extraordinary circumstances, the greater of $500.00 or five percent of the 
cost of improvements, which cost shall be determined pursuant to N.J.S.A. 40:55D-53.4. For 
those developments for which the inspection fees are less than $10,000.00, fees may, at the 
option of the developer, be paid in two installments. The initial amount deposited by a developer 
shall be 50 percent of the inspection fees. When the balance on deposit drops to ten percent of 
the inspection fees because the amount deposited by the developer has been reduced by the 
amount paid to the township engineer for inspection, the developer shall deposit the remaining 
50 percent of the inspection fees. For those developments for which the inspection fees are 
$10,000.00 or greater, fees may, at the option of the developer, be paid in four installments. The 
initial amount deposited by a developer shall be 25 percent of the inspection fees. When the 
balance on deposit drops to ten percent of the inspection fees because the amount deposited 
by the developer has been reduced by the amount paid to the township engineer for inspection, 
the developer shall make additional deposits of 25 percent of the inspection fees. The township 
engineer shall not perform any inspection if sufficient funds to pay for those inspections are not 
on deposit. 
(9) ?Payment by charitable, philanthropic, fraternal or religious nonprofit organization. 
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this section, any application for subdivision or site 
plan approval or any other land development matter submitted by a charitable, philanthropic, 
fraternal or religious nonprofit organization holding a tax exempt status under the Federal 
Internal Revenue Code of 1954 (26 USC 501(c) or (d)) shall not be required to make payment in 
full of any escrow accounts, but rather shall: 
a. ?Pay 25 percent of the total escrow amount otherwise due when the application is 
submitted. 
b. ?After the application is submitted, the applicant must at all times maintain on account a 
minimum of ten percent of the total escrow amount due in order to cover those items paid 
for out of the escrow account. 
c. ?If the amount on deposit in the escrow account for the applicant should fall below the 
required ten-percent minimum, the applicant shall be required to replenish the escrow 
account so that a ten-percent balance of the total escrow amounts due is held on account 
by the township. 
d. ?In determining whether an applicant qualifies for this reduction in escrow accounts, in 
addition to showing that it is a charitable, philanthropic, fraternal or religious nonprofit 
organization holding a tax-exempt status as referred to in this subsection, the organization 
must also show that: 
1. ?It primarily serves the residents of the township; 
2. ?It promotes the public health, safety and welfare of the residents of the township; 
3. ?Collection of the fees would constitute an economic hardship upon the applicant; or 
4. ?The unique characteristics of the application make collection of the full fees 
substantially disproportionate to the regulatory costs applicable to reviewing the 
application. 
(10) ?Approval by sections or phases. If final approval is by sections or phases of development as 
provided in this chapter, the provisions of this subsection shall be applied by section or phase. 
(j) ?Maintenance guarantees. Following completion of all required public and private improvements and 
as a condition of release of the performance guarantee, if any, the developer shall post a 
maintenance guarantee with the township clerk for maintenance of improvements which the 
municipal agency may deem necessary or appropriate, including streets, grading, pavement, gutters, 
curbs, sidewalks, bikeways, street lighting, shade trees and replacement trees required to comply 
with article IV of chapter 118, surveyor's monuments, water mains, culverts, storm sewers, sanitary 
sewers or other means of sewage disposal, drainage structures and improvements to public space. 
Maintenance guarantees shall not be required for items included under soil erosion and sediment 
control requirements or landscaping beyond a grass lawn, required shade trees and required 
screenings. This maintenance guarantee, which may be a surety bond and shall not, by operation of 
law, be all cash, shall not exceed 15 percent of the cost of the improvements and shall be posted for 
a period not to exceed two years after final acceptance of the improvements. Nothing contained in 
this subsection shall be construed to limit the township's ability to require entry into any maintenance 
agreements regarding on-site or offsite improvements.

(2) ?Site plan review. The review by the municipal agency of a conditional use shall include any 
required site plan review pursuant to this chapter. The time period for action by the municipal 
agency or conditional uses, pursuant to subsection (c)(1) of this section, shall apply to such site 
plan review. 
(3) ?Failure to act. Failure of the board to act within the period prescribed shall constitute approval 
of the application, and a certificate of the township clerk as to the failure of the board to act shall 
be issued on request of the applicant, and it shall be sufficient in lieu of the written endorsement 
or other evidence of approval, required in this section, and shall be so accepted by the county

application by the county planning board is required by N.J.S.A. 40:27-6.3, for a subdivision, or 
N.J.S.A. 40:27-6.6, for a site plan, the planning board shall condition any approval that it grants 
upon timely receipt of a favorable report on the application by the county planning board or 
approval by the county planning board by its failure to report thereon within the required time 
period. 
(Code 1988, § 175-54) 


Sec. 62-167. - Variance applications. 
(a) ?Application requirements. At least ten days and no more than 20 days prior to a regular meeting of 
the municipal agency, the applicant for a variance shall file the following documents with the

which is the subject of the application, drawn to scale, showing all locations, lot dimensions and 
dimensions of existing and proposed structures. 
(3) ?Certification by tax collector. The applicant shall submit a certificate by the tax collector that all 
municipal taxes due and owing by the applicant have been paid. 
(4) ?Application forms. The applicant shall submit three copies of a completed application form, 
which form shall be obtained from the secretary of the municipal agency. 
(5) ?Disclosure of ownership. Disclosure of ownership shall be pursuant to section 62-2838(b). 
(b) ?Application procedure. The application procedure shall be as follows: 
(1) ?Copies of application; review and report. The secretary of the municipal agency shall, within 
three days, forward a copy of the completed application to the planning director, the township 
engineer, the chairman of the subdivision and site plan review committee and such other 
officers as the board may direct and shall request each to review the application and to file a 
written report of his findings and recommendations prior to the next regular meeting of the 
board. 
(2) ?Notice of hearing. The applicant shall comply with the hearing and notice requirements of this 
chapter. 
(3) ?Copies of decision; publication. The secretary shall mail a copy of the decision of the board to 
the applicant or his attorney and to all other persons who have requested it, within ten days 
after approval has been granted or denied. The secretary shall also file a copy of the decision 
with the township clerk and shall cause a brief notice of the decision to be published in the 
official newspaper of the township. 
(4) ?Signatures required upon approval. If the application is approved, the approval shall be noted 
upon the plot plan and shall be signed by the chairman and the secretary of the board within ten 
days of the date of approval. 
(5) ?Approval limited to scope of application. In approving a use variance, the municipal agency 
shall approve only the use for which the applicant seeks approval. The extent of development, 
including the number of units or the size of units or structures, shall be determined only after the 
applicant has submitted an application for subdivision or site plan approval. Nothing in this 
section shall be construed to prevent the applicant from submitting applications for approval of a 
use variance and for approval of a subdivision or site plan simultaneously. 
(6) ?Site plan required for variance affecting three or more lots. In approving a variance, other than 
a use variance, which affects more than three lots, the municipal agency shall not approve the 
number of lots to be created or the number of units to be constructed thereon. Such 
determination shall be made only after the applicant has submitted an application for 
subdivision or site plan approval. Nothing in this section shall be construed to prevent the 
applicant from submitting an application for approval of other than a use variance and for 
approval of a subdivision or site plan simultaneously. 
(c) ?Time for approval when exercising certain powers of the planning board. Whenever an applicant for 
development requests relief pursuant to section 62-114(d), the board of adjustment shall grant or 
deny approval of the application within 120 days after submission by the developer of the complete 
application to the planning director or within such other time as may be consented to by the 
applicant. If the developer elects to submit separate consecutive applications, such provision shall 
apply to the application for approval of the variance. Approval for granting or denying any 
subsequent approval shall be as otherwise provided in this chapter. Failure of the board of 
adjustment to act within the period prescribed shall constitute approval of the application, and a 
certificate of the proper township official as to the failure of the board of adjustment to act shall be 
issued upon request of the applicant, and it shall be sufficient in lieu of the written endorsement or 
other evidence of approval required and shall be so accepted by the county recording officer for 
purposes of filing subdivision plats. Whenever review or approval of the application by the county 
planning board is required by N.J.S.A. 40:27-6.3, for a subdivision, or N.J.S.A. 40:27-6.6, for a site 
plan, the board of adjustment shall condition any approval that it grants upon timely receipt of a 
favorable report on the application by the county planning board or approval by the county planning 
board by its failure to report thereon within the required time. An application under this subsection 
may be referred to any appropriate person or agency, including the township planning board, for its 
report, provided that such reference shall not extend the period of time within which the board of 
adjustment shall act. 
(d) ?Expiration of variance. Any variance from the terms of this chapter granted by the board of 
adjustment or planning board permitting the erection or alteration of any structure or permitting a 
specified use of any premises shall expire by limitation, unless a construction permit for such 
construction or alteration shall have been issued or unless such permitted use has actually 
commenced within 12 months from the date of the judgment or determination of the board. However, 
the running of the period of limitation provided in this subsection shall be tolled from the date of the 
decision of an appeal from the decision of the board to the township council or to a court of 
competent jurisdiction, until the termination, in any manner, of such appeal or proceeding. No 
construction permit, once issued, shall be renewed without approval of the board which granted the 
initial variance. A variance approval may be extended for no more than 12 additional months beyond 
the expiration of the variance upon a finding by the board, at a duly noticed public hearing, that the 
character of the neighborhood, the general hardship, special reasons or other findings of fact upon 
which basis the variance was initially granted have not changed in the interim. 
(Code 1988, § 175-55; Ord. No. 65-94, § 6, 12-6-1994) 


Sec. 62-168. - Permits for buildings and structures in certain areas. 
(a) ?Issuance. For the purpose of preserving the integrity of the official map of the township, no permit 
shall be issued for any building or structure in the bed of any street or public drainageway, flood 
control basin or public area reserved pursuant to section 62-163, as shown on the official map or 
shown on a plat filed pursuant to this chapter before adoption of the official map, except as provided 
in this section. Whenever one or more parcels of land upon which is located the bed of such a 
mapped street or public drainageway, flood control basin or public area reserved pursuant to section 
62-163 cannot yield a reasonable return to the owner unless a building permit is granted, the 
municipal agency may, in a specific case, by an affirmative vote of a majority of the full authorized 
membership of the board, direct the issuance of a permit for a building or structure in the bed of such 
mapped street or public drainageway or flood control basin or public area reserved pursuant to 
section 62-163, which shall increase the cost of opening such street as little as practicable or tend to 
cause a minimum change of the official map. The board shall impose reasonable requirements as a 
condition of granting the permit so as to promote the health, morals, safety and general welfare of 
the public. Section 62-50 shall apply to applications or appeals pursuant to this section. 
(b) ?Building lot to abut street. Every building lot shall abut a street in accordance with the following: 
(1) ?No permit for the erection of any building or structure shall be issued unless the lot abuts a 
street giving access to such proposed building or structure. Such street shall have been duly 
placed on the official map or shall be: 
a. ?An existing state, county or municipal street or highway; 
b. ?A street shown upon a plat approved by the planning board; or 
c. ?A street on a plat duly filed in the office of the county recording officer prior to the passage 
of the ordinance from which this chapter is derived. 
(2) ?Before any such permit shall be issued, such street shall have been certified to be suitably 
improved to the satisfaction of the township council, or such suitable improvement shall have 
been ensured by means of a performance guaranty, in accordance with standards and 
specifications for road improvements approved by the township council as adequate in respect 
to the public health, safety and general welfare of the community in light of the special 
circumstance of the particular street. 
(c) ?Appeals. Where the enforcement of subsection (b) of this section would entail practical difficulty or 
unnecessary hardship or where the circumstances of the case do not require the building or structure 
to be related to a street, the municipal agency may, upon application or appeal, vary the application 
of subsection (b) of this section and direct the issuance of a permit subject to conditions that shall 
provide adequate access for firefighting equipment, ambulances and other emergency vehicles 
necessary for the protection of health and safety and that shall protect any future street layout shown 
on the official map or on a general circulation plan element of the municipal master plan. 
(Code 1988, § 175-56) 


Secs. 62-169—62-200. - Reserved. 


DIVISION 2. - STANDARDS AND PRINCIPLES 


Sec. 62-201. - Site development stormwater plans. 
    Standards and principles for site development stormwater plans are set forth in article VI of this 
chapter. 
(Code 1988, § 175-58; Ord. No. 2007-16, § I, 3-27-2007) 


Sec. 62-202. - Steep slopes. 
(a) ?Purpose. The purpose of this section is to regulate the intensity of use in areas of steeply sloping 
terrain in order to limit soil loss, erosion, excessive stormwater runoff, the degradation of surface 
water and to maintain the natural topography and drainage patterns of land. 
(b) ?Background. Disturbance of steep slopes results in accelerated erosion processes from stormwater 
runoff and the subsequent sedimentation of waterbodies with the associated degradation of water 
quality and loss of aquatic life support. Related effects include soil loss, changes in natural 
topography and drainage patterns, increased flooding potential, further fragmentation of forest and 
habitat areas, and compromised aesthetic values. It has become widely recognized that disturbance 
of steep slopes should be restricted or prevented based on the impact disturbance that steep slopes 
can have on water quality and quantity, and the environmental integrity of landscapes. 
(c) ?Applicability. This section shall be applicable to new development or land disturbance on a steep 
slope within the Township of South Brunswick. 
(d) ?Definitions. As used in this section, the following meaning of the indicated word(s) shall prevail: 
    "Disturbance" means the placement of impervious surface, the exposure or movement of soil or 
bedrock, or the clearing, cutting, or removing of vegetation. 
    "Impervious surface" means any structure, surface, or improvement that reduces or prevents 
absorption of stormwater into land, and includes porous paving, paver blocks, gravel, crushed stone, 
decks, patios, elevated structures, and similar structures, surfaces, or improvements. However, gravel 
and crushed stone incorporated into a recharge basin, trench or similar stormwater practice as infiltration 
material shall not be considered impervious. 
    "Redevelopment" means the construction of structures or improvements on areas which previously 
contained structures or other improvements. 
    "Steep slopes" means any slope equal to or greater than 20 percent as measured over any minimum 
run of ten feet. Steep slopes are determined based on contour intervals of two feet or less. 
(e) ?Designations of areas. The percent of slope (rise in feet per horizontal distance) shall be 
established by measurement of distance perpendicular to the contour of the slope. The percent of 
slope shall be calculated for each two-foot contour interval. For example, any location on the site 
where there is a one-foot rise over a ten-foot horizontal run constitutes a ten percent slope; a one 
and one-half-foot rise over a ten-foot horizontal run constitutes a 15 percent slope; a two-foot rise 
over a ten-foot horizontal run constitutes a 20 percent slope. 
(f) ?Steep slope limits. For steep slopes, any disturbance shall be prohibited except as provided below: 
(1) ?Redevelopment within the limits of existing impervious surfaces; and 
(2) ?New disturbance necessary to protect public health, safety or welfare, such as necessary linear 
development with no feasible alternative; to provide an environmental benefit, such as 
remediation of a contaminated site; to prevent extraordinary hardship on the property owner 
peculiar to the property; or to prevent extraordinary hardship, provided the hardship was not 
created by the property owner, that would not permit a minimum economically viable use of the 
property based upon reasonable investment. 
The applicant shall demonstrate through site plans depicting proposed development and topography that 
new disturbance is not located in areas with a 20 percent or greater slope. 
(g) ?Conflicts. 
(1) ?All other ordinances, parts of ordinances, sections of this Code or other local requirements that 
are inconsistent or in conflict with this section are hereby superseded to the extent of any 
inconsistency or conflict, and the provisions of this section shall apply. 
(2) ?This section shall be so construed as not to conflict with any provision of New Jersey or federal 
law. 
(3) ?The provisions of this section shall be cumulative with, and not in substitution for, all other 
applicable zoning, planning and land use regulations. 
(h) ?Enforcement, violation and penalties. A prompt investigation shall be made by the appropriate 
personnel of the Township of South Brunswick of any person or entity believed to be in violation 
hereof. If, upon inspection, a condition which is in violation of this section is discovered, a civil action 
in the special civil part of the superior court, or in the superior court, if the primary relief sought is 
injunctive or if penalties may exceed the jurisdictional limit of the special civil part, may be 
commenced by the filing and serving of appropriate process. Nothing in this section shall be 
construed to preclude the right of the Township of South Brunswick pursuant to N.J.S.A. 26:3A2-25, 
to initiate legal proceedings hereunder in municipal court. The violation of any subsection of this 
section shall constitute a separate and distinct offense independent of the violation of any other 
section or subsection, or of any order issued pursuant to this section. Each day a violation continues 
shall be considered a separate offense. Except as otherwise provided by law, and in addition to any 
penalties set forth in this section, any person violating any of the provisions of this section shall, upon 
conviction, be subject to the penalties in section 1-13, in the discretion of the judge before whom the 
case shall be heard. 
(Ord. No. 2011-22, § I, 7-26-2011) 


Sec. 62-203. - Steep slope avoidance. 
    Every application for site plan or subdivision approval shall contain an engineer's certification, 
indicating that any areas within the development which shall be disturbed during development shall not 
contain slopes in excess of 33 1/3 percent upon completion of the development. 
(Code 1988, § 175-58.2; Ord. No. 2011-22, § I, 7-26-2011) 


Sec. 62-204. - Subdivisions. 
(a) ?General design. The design of the subdivision shall be in harmony with and in furtherance of the 
purposes set forth in this chapter and shall conform to the master plan of the township and to the 
official map of the township. 
(b) ?Streets, sidewalks and alleys. Streets, sidewalks and alleys shall be designed in accordance with 
the following: 
(1) ?Street extensions. The arrangement of major arterial, secondary arterial, primary collector and 
secondary collector streets shall conform to the master plan and to the official map. 
(2) ?Design of minor streets. Minor streets shall be either loops or, where necessary because of the 
shape of a parcel of land, culs-de-sac. Loops shall return to the same collector and shall be so 
shaped that there is no possibility of their use by traffic having neither origin nor destination on 
the loop. Other requirements and characteristics are shown on diagram B attached to the 
ordinance from which this chapter is derived and made a part of this chapter. 
(3) ?Classification of streets. In any major subdivision, it shall be the duty of the municipal agency to 
classify proposed streets according to their types. The municipal agency shall base its 
classification upon the master plan, existing and proposed conditions in and near the 
subdivision, the table of street dimensions in subsection (b)(7) of this section. 
(4) ?Lots abutting primary and secondary arterials. In a subdivision abutting primary and secondary 
arterial streets, one of the following shall be required: 
a. ?A marginal access street shall be provided along the arterial street and shall be separated 
from it by a raised divider strip at least eight feet in width. 
b. ?The frontage shall be reversed so that the lots contiguous to such arterial street will front 
on an internal street, with a buffer strip at least 50 feet in width for planting provided along 
the arterial street. 
c. ?Such other means of separating through and local traffic and of providing a suitable buffer 
shall be provided as the planning board may determine to be appropriate. 
(5) ?Lots abutting primary and secondary collector streets. No lot created by a subdivision shall 
abut a primary or secondary collector street only. Access shall be provided only by reverse 
frontage on a minor, minor collector or marginal service street, but no additional screening or 
setback shall be required. 
(6) ?Dead-end streets. Dead-end streets and culs-de-sac shall not be longer than 600 feet and shall 
provide a turnaround at the end with a radius set forth in the table of street dimensions in 
subsection (b)(7) of this section. If a dead-end street is of a temporary nature, a similar 
turnaround shall be provided, and provision shall be made for future exits of the street and 
revision of the access right-of-way to adjoining properties. 
(7) ?Street dimensions. Dimensions of street shall be no less than those set forth in the table of 
street dimensions as follows:

traversed by a watercourse of any kind, including but not limited to a channel or a stream, the 
planning board may require that a stormwater and drainage easement along the watercourse be 
provided by the subdivider. The land which is the subject of such easement shall be a strip 
which conforms substantially to the floodplain of such watercourse along both sides of the 
watercourse or which extends along both sides of the watercourse to a width of 50 feet in each 
direction from the centerline of the watercourse or which is not less than any encroachment line 
established by a competent governmental authority, whichever is greater. However, if the 
location of such watercourse is at or near the boundary of the subdivision, the dimensions of the 
easement shall be modified so as to limit it to the confines of the subdivision. The easement 
shall be in a form approved by the township attorney and shall include provisions ensuring the 
following:

a. ?Easements may be required along all drainage and stormwater rights-of-way in the 
subdivision and may be required also along all streams or other watercourses along which 
drainage rights-of-way are not required. The easements are intended to help prevent the 
siltation of streams and other watercourses and the erosion of stream banks, other 
watercourses and adjacent lands. The land subject to a conservation easement shall be a 
strip at least 25 feet in width running adjacent to each side of the required drainage or 
stormwater rights-of-way or adjacent to each side of the stream if no drainage rights-of-way 
are reserved. The conservation easement shall contain provisions to restrict the removal of 
trees and ground cover, except for the following purposes:

waste material of any type within the limits of the easement. The easement shall be 
indicated on the plat and shall be marked on land by concrete monuments wherever the 
lines of the easement change direction or intersect lot lines. 
(4) ?Permits for use of public easements. Permits for the use of public easements may be issued in 
accordance with the following: 
a. ?Application; issuance. Owners of property which is subject to a municipal easement may 
apply to the construction official for a permit to erect, alter or convert a fence thereon. The 
construction official shall issue a permit, provided that the proposed use conforms to all 
other requirements of the zoning ordinance and other applicable codes and ordinances 
and provided that the intended use by the owner or the presence of the fence erected, 
altered or converted will not materially or unreasonably impair or interfere with the 
easement. The construction official may require appropriate conditions to the issuance of 
the permit as may be necessary to ensure that the easement will not be materially or 
unreasonably interfered with and to ensure that the easement or any public utility 
contained therein is adequately preserved and protected from injury. 
b. ?Denial or grant of permit; appeal. When the construction official determines that the 
application for the permit cannot meet the requirements of subsection (g)(4)a. of this 
section, he shall refuse to issue a permit and shall so notify the applicant, in writing, giving 
the reasons for denial. The applicant may appeal to the township council for a modification 
or reversal of the construction official's decision. Any interested party may appeal to the 
township council for a modification or reversal of the conservation official's decision to 
issue a permit for use of a public easement.

easement, wetlands, or wetlands transition area boundary lines prior to the 
commencement of construction, so as to prevent encroachment into these protected 
areas. 
3. ?A silt fence and hay bales shall be installed downslope from any construction 
disturbance adjacent to the wetlands and wetlands transition areas so as to prevent 
the transport of silt into these areas. 
4. ?The applicant or developer of the property shall not encroach into state-regulated 
wetlands, wetlands transition areas or stream buffers except for those activities 
specifically permitted by a NJDEP permit. 
5. ?All existing on-site vegetation within conservation easements, wetlands, and wetlands 
transition areas shall be preserved. 
(h) ?Areas for public use. Standards for the design of areas for public use shall be as follows:

•?Along an amorphously-shaped feature such as a wetland complex, through which water flows 
but which lacks a discernible channel, the riparian zone is measured landward of the feature's 
centerline; 
•?For areas adjacent to surface water bodies for which wetlands have been delineated per the 
Freshwater Wetland Protection Act Rules at N.J.A.C. 7:7A, the landward limit of the riparian 
zone shall be taken as the limit of the unmodified wetland transition area; and 
•?For areas adjacent to surface water bodies for which the floodway has been delineated per the 
Flood Hazard Area Control Act rules at N.J.A.C. 7:13-3 or the state's adopted floodway 
delineations, the riparian zone shall cover the entire floodway area plus 50 feet, or the area 
described in section 62-257(a)(1) or section 62-257(a)(2), whichever area has the greatest extent. 
Requests for alterations to the adopted delineations can be provided to the New Jersey 
Department of Environmental Protection for consideration if site specific information is 
available. 
(c) ?The applicant or designated representative shall be responsible for the initial determination of the 
presence of a riparian zone on a site, based on this section and a site evaluation, and for identifying 
the area of the riparian zone on any plan submitted to the township in conjunction with an application 
for a construction permit, subdivision, land development, or other improvement that requires plan 
submissions or permits. This initial determination shall be subject to review and approval by the 
municipal engineer, governing body, or its appointed representative, and, where required by state 
regulation, the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection. 
(d) ?All encroachments proposed into riparian zones in C1 waters shall comply with the requirements of 
the stormwater management rules at N.J.A.C. 7:8-5.5(h) and the Flood Hazard Area Control Act 
rules, N.J.A.C. 7:13, and shall be subject to review and approval by the New Jersey Department of 
Environmental Protection, unless exempt. For all other riparian zones, the following conditions shall 
apply: 
(1) ?All new major and minor subdivisions and site plans shall be designed to provide sufficient 
areas outside of the riparian zone to accommodate primary structures, any normal accessory 
uses appurtenant thereto, as well as all planned lawn areas. 
(2) ?Portions of lots within the riparian zone, and within the added protection area in conjunction 
with other regulatory lines such as stream encroachment and freshwater wetlands transition 
areas, must be permanently restricted by deed or conservation easement held by the Township 
of South Brunswick, its agent, or another public or private land conservation organization which 
has the ability to provide adequate protection to prevent adverse impacts within the riparian 
zone. A complete copy of the recorded conservation restriction that clearly identifies the deed 
book and pages where it has been recorded in the Office of the Clerk/Register of Deeds and 
Mortgages of Middlesex County must be submitted to the township. The applicant shall not 
commence with the project or activity prior to making this submittal and receiving actual 
approval of the plan modification and receipt of any applicable permits from the New Jersey 
Department of Environmental Protection. The recorded conservation restriction shall be in a 
form approved by the township and shall run with the land and be binding upon the property 
owner and the successors in interest in the property or in any part thereof. The conservation 
restriction may include language reserving the right to make de minimus changes to 
accommodate necessary regulatory approvals upon the written consent of the township, 
provided such changes are otherwise consistent with the purpose and intent of the conservation 
restriction. The recorded conservation restriction shall, at a minimum, include: 
•?A written narrative of the authorized regulated activity, date of issuance, and date of 
expiration, and the conservation restriction that, in addition, includes all of the prohibitions set 
forth at N.J.S.A. 13:8B-2b(1) through (7); 
•?Survey plans for the property as a whole and, where applicable, for any additional properties 
subject to the conservation restrictions. Such survey plans shall be submitted on the surveyor's 
letterhead, signed and sealed by the surveyor, and shall include metes and bounds descriptions of 
the property, the site, and the areas subject to the conservation restriction in New Jersey State 
Plan Coordinates, North American Datum 1983, and shall depict the boundaries of the site and 
all areas subject to the conservation restriction as marked with flags or stakes onsite. All such 
survey plans shall be submitted on paper and in digital CAD or GIS file on a media and format 
defined by the township. The flags or stakes shall be numbered and identified on the survey plan; 
and 
•?A copy or copies of deeds for the property as a whole that indicate the deed book and pages 
where it has been recorded in the Office of the Clerk/Register of Deeds and Mortgages of 
Middlesex County. 
(3) ?Any lands proposed for development which include all or a portion of a riparian zone shall as a 
condition of any major subdivision or major site plan approval, provide for the vegetation or 
revegetation of any portions of the riparian zone which are not vegetated at the time of the 
application or which were disturbed by prior land uses, including for agricultural use. Said 
vegetation plan shall utilize native and non-invasive tree and plant species to the maximum 
extent practicable. 
(4) ?For building lots which exist as of the effective date of this division, but for which a building 
permit or a preliminary site plan approval has not been obtained or is no longer valid, the 
required minimum front, side, and rear setbacks may extend into the riparian zone, provided 
that a deed restriction and/or conservation easement is applied which prohibits clearing or 
construction in the riparian zone. 
(5) ?All stormwater shall be discharged outside of but may flow through a riparian zone and shall 
comply with the standard for off-site stability in the "Standards for Soil Erosion and Sediment 
Control in New Jersey", established under the Soil Erosion and Sediment Control Act, N.J.S.A. 
4:24-39 et seq. (see N.J.A.C. 2:90-1.3). 
(6) ?If stormwater discharged outside of and flowing through a riparian zone cannot comply with the 
standard for off-site stability cited in subsection (d)(5) above, then the proposed stabilization 
measures must meet the requirements of the Flood Hazard Area Control Act rules at N.J.A.C. 
7:13-1 et seq., and have an approved flood hazard area permit. 
(7) ?At least 50 percent of all areas within the delineated added protection area contiguous to, but 
exclusive of the conservation easement area, must be left in a natural condition via the limit of 
disturbance or through mitigation. The allowable disturbed area and any mitigation area shall be 
revegetated with trees, shrubs, wildflowers, and grasses native to Central New Jersey. These 
areas can be counted towards required landscaped areas as per the zoning requirements. 
(Ord. No. 2011-23, § I, 7-26-2011) 


Sec. 62-258. - Variances. 
    To the extent allowed by the stormwater management rules (N.J.A.C. 7:8) and the Flood Hazard 
Area Control Act Rules (N.J.A.C. 7:13), new disturbances for projects or activities in the riparian zone 
established by this division may be allowed through the appropriate land use board review and approval 
of a variance, provided the disturbance is proposed to be located on a pre-existing lot (existing as of the 
effective date of this division) when there is insufficient room outside the riparian zone for the proposed 
use otherwise permitted by the underlying zoning; there is no other reasonable or prudent alternative to 
placement in the riparian zone, including obtaining variances from setback or other requirements that 
would allow conformance with the riparian zone requirements; and upon proof by virtue of submission of 
appropriate maps, drawings, reports and testimony, that the disturbance is: 
(a) ?Necessary to protect public health, safety or welfare, through which an applicant shall be 
deemed to have established compelling public need under this provision only if the applicant 
demonstrates there is no reasonable and feasible alternative available to meet the established 
public health or safety need; 
(b) ?To provide an environmental benefit that significantly outweighs the environmental damage 
caused by the loss of riparian zone; 
(c) ?To prevent extraordinary hardship on the property owner peculiar to the property; or 
(d) ?To prevent extraordinary hardship, provided the hardship was not created by the property 
owner, by not allowing a minimum economically viable use of the property based upon 
reasonable investment. 
(Ord. No. 2011-23, § I, 7-26-2011) 


Sec. 62-259. - Exceptions. 
    To the extent allowed under the stormwater management rules (N.J.A.C. 7:8) and the Flood Hazard 
Area Control Act Rules (N.J.A.C. 7:13), and subject to review and approval by the New Jersey 
Department of Environmental Protection to the extent required by those rules, the following disturbances 
for projects or activities in the riparian zone established by this division are allowed: 
(a) ?Redevelopment within the limits of existing impervious surfaces; 
(b) ?Linear development with no feasible alternative route; 
(c) ?Disturbance that is in accordance with a stream corridor restoration or stream bank stabilization 
plan or project approved by the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection; 
(d) ?Disturbance necessary to provide for public pedestrian access or water dependent recreation 
that meets the requirements of the Freshwater Wetlands Protection Act rules, N.J.A.C. 7:7A or 
the Flood Hazard Area Control Act rules, N.J.A.C. 7:13; or 
(e) ?Disturbance with no feasible alternative required for the remediation of hazardous substances 
performed with New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection or federal oversight 
pursuant to the Spill Compensation and Control Act, N.J.S.A. 58:10-23.11a et seq. or the 
Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980, 42 U.S.C. 
§§ 9601 et seq.

Sec. 62-260. - Appeals, conflicts and severability. 
(a) ?Any party aggrieved by the location of the riparian zone boundary determination under this division 
may appeal to the zoning officer. The party contesting the location of the riparian zone boundary 
shall have the burden of proof in case of any such appeal. 
(b) ?Any party aggrieved by any determination or decision of the zoning officer under this division may 
appeal to the Zoning Board of Adjustment of South Brunswick Township. The party contesting the 
determination or decision shall have the burden of proof in case of any such appeal. 
(c) ?Conflicts: All other South Brunswick Code Sections, ordinances, parts of ordinances, or other local 
requirements that are inconsistent or in conflict with this division are hereby superseded to the extent 
of any inconsistency or conflict, and the provisions of this division shall apply. 
(d) ?Severability: 
(1) ?Interpretation: This division shall be so construed as not to conflict with any provision of New 
Jersey or federal law. 
(2) ?Notwithstanding that any provision of this division is held to be invalid or unconstitutional by a 
court of competent jurisdiction, all remaining provisions of this division shall continue to be of full 
force and effect. 
(3) ?The provisions of this division shall be cumulative with, and not in substitution for, all other 
applicable zoning, planning and land use regulations. 
(Ord. No. 2011-23, § I, 7-26-2011) 


Sec. 62-261. - Enforcement. 
    A prompt investigation shall be made by the zoning officer or his designee of any person or entity 
believed to be in violation hereof. If, upon inspection, a condition which is in violation of this division is 
discovered, a civil action may be filed in the special civil part of the superior court, or in the superior court 
if the primary relief sought is injunctive or if penalties may exceed the jurisdictional limit of the special civil 
part, by the filing and serving of appropriate process. Nothing in this division shall be construed to 
preclude the right of the township pursuant to N.J.S.A. 26:3A2-25, to initiate legal proceedings hereunder 
in municipal court. The violation of any section or subsection of this division shall constitute a separate 
and distinct offense independent of the violation of any other section or subsection, or of any order issued 
pursuant to this division. Each day a violation continues shall be considered a separate offense, subject 
to the penalties set forth in section 62-4.

street is classified as a minor street, a 25-foot-wide buffer shall be provided. This buffer shall be 
an area of green space and shall consist of grass and landscaping, together with berming, that 
is consistent with the character of the area. Pedestrian walkways, stormwater detention facilities 
and access drives across the buffer area are permitted, as long as additional landscaping and 
berming can be provided.

procedures for planned development in sections 62-157 and 62-158, with the exception of the 
findings as to residents of the development. In lieu of complying with the procedures for planned 
development in sections 62-157 and 62-158, the applicant may apply for general development plan 
approval pursuant to section 62-159. 
(e) ?Approval in stages. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this chapter, the applicant may seek 
preliminary and/or final subdivision or site plan approval for planned office/corporate development in 
stages, pursuant to an approved staging plan and/or agreement for range of timing of development.

may be permitted in the front, side and rear setback areas of the development, provided that the 
arrangement of parking spaces on the lots is designed in a comprehensive manner and that 
landscaping is provided in accordance with the standards of this chapter. 
(g) ?Informal concept plan review. For a planned office/corporate development, the applicant may, and is 
encouraged to, present an informal concept plan for the entire tract for review by the planning board. 
(h) ?Reapproval required for substantial deviations. Except as otherwise provided in section 62-159, 
substantial deviations from preliminary approval will require reapproval of the preliminary approval by 
formal resolution of the planning board.

setbacks may be reduced by the planning board after the applicant has demonstrated that the 
proposed lot areas, lot widths, lot depths, lot frontages, front yard, side yard and rear yard 
setbacks are consistent and proportionately arranged within a cluster of structures. The 
applicant must also demonstrate that adequate light, air and open space surround each 
structure. In no case shall the distance between structures be less than 25 feet or the height of 
the structure, whichever is greater.

provided along the public street and any internal street classified as a collector roadway. If an 
internal street is classified as a minor street, a 25-foot-wide buffer shall be provided. This buffer 
shall be an area of green space and shall consist of grass and landscaping, together with 
berming. Pedestrian walkways, stormwater detention facilities and access drives across the 
buffer area are permitted, as long as additional landscaping and berming can be provided.

excluding any C-2 part of the tract and including any dedicated open space within the tract. 
Total tract coverage, including buildings, structures, paving, sidewalks, etc., shall not exceed 55 
percent of the total tract area, excluding any C-2 part of the tract and including any dedicated 
open space within the tract. These coverage requirements apply to the planned 
office/commercial development tract as a whole, excluding any C-2 part of the tract and 
including any dedicated open space within the tract. That portion of the tract set aside for 
commercial use shall conform to the C-2 requirements.

applications, at the time of a preliminary site plan submission a plan shall be submitted for the entire 
tract to be developed as a planned office/commercial development. 
(d) ?Compliance with procedures for planned development. In addition, the applicant shall comply with 
procedures for planned development in sections 62-157 and 62-158, with the exception of the 
findings as to residents of the development. 
(e) ?Final approval in stages. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this chapter, the applicant may 
seek final subdivision or site plan approval for a planned office/commercial development in stages, 
pursuant to an approved staging plan and/or agreement for range of timing of development which the 
applicant shall provide at the time of preliminary approval. 
(f) ?Off-street parking. Subject to the buffer requirements of subsection (b)(2) Of this section, parking 
may be permitted in the front, side and rear setback areas of the office and commercial portions of

units (rounded to the next higher number if 0.5 or greater) for affordable housing as said term is 
defined under the Fair Housing Act (FHA) and the Council on Affordable Housing's (COAH) rules. 
(b) ?Affordable housing compliance mechanisms. The developer of an age restricted residential 
community may choose to satisfy its affordable housing growth share obligation, as defined above, 
through the mechanisms permitted in COAH's rules, including, with the advanced written permission 
of the governing body of South Brunswick Township: 
(1) ?On-site housing production; 
(2) ?Off-site housing production in the township; 
(3) ?The purchase of an existing market-rate home at another location in South Brunswick 
Township and its conversion to an affordable price-restricted home in accordance with COAH's 
criteria, regulations and policies; 
(4) ?Participation in gut rehabilitation and/or buy-down/write-down, buy-down/rent-down programs; 
(5) ?Contribution in-lieu of providing affordable housing in connection; and/or 
(6) ?Any other compliance mechanism pursuant to COAH's rules pursuant to N.J.A.C. 5:94 et seq. 
Evidence of an approved compliance mechanism shall be produced to the approving board at the time of 
application filing and shall be a condition of all "completeness" determinations. Thereafter, the satisfaction 
of the affordable housing compliance mechanism shall be an automatic condition of all approvals that 
must be satisfied in accordance with COAH's phasing requirements pursuant to N.J.A.C. 5:94 et seq. 
(c) ?Compliance with COAH's rules. The affordable unit(s) to be produced pursuant to subsections (a), 
(b), and (c) of this section shall be available to a low income individual or household should only one 
affordable unit be required. Thereafter, each of the units shall be split evenly between low and 
moderate income individuals and households except in the event of an odd number in which event 
the unit shall be a low income unit. All affordable units shall strictly comply with COAH's rules and 
policies including, but not limited to, phasing, bedroom distribution, controls on affordability, range of 
affordability, affirmative marketing, income qualification, etc. It shall be the developer's responsibility, 
at its cost and expense, to arrange for an administering agency that may either be the South 
Brunswick Township Affordable Housing Office or some other entity approved by COAH and the 
township to ensure full COAH compliance and file such certifications, reports and/or monitoring 
forms as may be required by COAH to verify COAH compliance of each affordable unit. 
(d) ?Payments in lieu of construction. 
(1) ?Payments in lieu of the construction of affordable housing shall be based upon a proportionate 
share of the total project cost embodied in one or more pro-forma statements (pro-forma(s)) for 
the construction of an affordable housing development elsewhere within the Township of South 
Brunswick, which pro-forma(s) shall be on file in the office of the township clerk. The payment in 
lieu of construction to be made by the developer may be subject to negotiation with the 
township based upon the following considerations: the actual cost of buying down or subsidizing 
one or more existing or planned market priced dwelling units to achieve an average rent level 
affordable to a household earning 52.0 percent of median income; the actual land cost of site(s) 
earmarked for off-site affordable housing construction within the Township of South Brunswick; 
or reasonable and acceptable offers to substitute land, site preparation and/or construction 
services for all or a portion of the monetary payment otherwise required. 
(2) ?Regardless of the mechanism by which the applicant has been approved to satisfy the required 
number of affordable housing units pursuant to this section, any development or portion thereof 
that generates a fraction of an affordable housing unit as all or a portion of the obligation, shall 
be required to make a payment in lieu of construction for that fraction of a unit based on the pro-
rated cost of constructing an affordable housing unit in the Township of South Brunswick.

Sec. 62-1740. - Administration and enforcement. 
(a) ?Prior to the approval of any site plan, subdivision or variance for new construction of nonresidential 
uses, sufficient information shall be supplied to the director of planning and development concerning 
the proposed operation of the premises so as to enable a determination to be made as to whether or 
not the proposed use will be in compliance with the standards set forth in sections 62-1731 through 
62-1739. Such information shall be reviewed by the township fire marshal, planning director, 
township engineer, zoning officer, health officer and recycling coordinator, as applicable. Such 
review shall take place within timeframes provided for approval of applications; provided, however, 
that no application shall be deemed to be complete until such time as either the required information 
has been submitted to the director of planning and development or, in the alternative, until such time 
as arrangements for the submission of the necessary information are made with the director of 
planning and development. Any such arrangements must, in the opinion of the director of planning 
and development, allow sufficient time for review and reporting to the applicable board. Failure to 
substantially comply with such an arrangement, once made, shall cause the application to be 
deemed incomplete at the scheduled hearing, and the applicant shall be required to republish his 
application and renotify property owners within 200 feet of the proposed development. The process 
of this determination shall be known as tenancy review. 
(b) ?If the occupant of a particular structure is not known at the time of application, the property owner 
shall supply to the director of planning and development at such time as the occupant is known the 
information required in subsection (a) of this section. In such case a committee consisting of the 
township officials named in subsection (a) of this section shall have 20 days to review the information 
to determine compliance with the provisions of this section. In no case shall a certificate of 
occupancy be issued for any building until such information is made available to the director of 
planning and development and a determination on compliance is made. 
(c) ?Subsequent to the issuance of a certificate of occupancy and within six months thereof, the planning 
director, zoning officer, health officer, fire marshal, engineer and recycling coordinator, as applicable, 
shall inspect the premises to determine that the use does, in fact, conform to the performance 
standards. If any of such officials feels that such an inspection by his department is unnecessary in 
view of the nature of the use, he shall notify the building inspector, in writing, of that determination, 
which writing shall be deemed a waiver of inspection and approval by such official. Should any of 
such officials find that the use does not conform to any of the standards in this division, a 30-day 
notice for compliance shall be sent to the user by the zoning officer. Failure to correct deficiencies 
set forth in such notice within the time period ascribed shall constitute prima facie evidence of 
noncompliance with this subsection. Each day of noncompliance with the notice after the expiration 
of the time limits set forth therein shall constitute a distinct and separate violation of this subsection. 
(d) ?For the purpose of this section, any change of use or change of occupancy of the structure shall be 
dealt with as if the structure was a new one.

DIVISION 7. - SIGNS 


Sec. 62-1816. - Purpose. 
(a) ?It is the intent of this division to control the size, location, character and other pertinent features of 
exterior signs placed on private or public property. This division is designed to promote signs which 
are: 
(1) ?Compatible with surroundings and expressive of community and neighborhood character. 
(2) ?Orderly, readable and appropriate to the activity to which they pertain. 
(3) ?Nondistracting to motorists, so as not to contribute to traffic accidents. 
(b) ?This division is also designed to discourage signs which are: 
(1) ?Advertising, promoting or identifying an activity no longer in existence or operation. 
(2) ?In disrepair or of faulty construction, thereby threatening the safety and welfare of persons and 
property. 
(3) ?Overloaded or overstated, so as to defeat the sign's communicative purpose. 
(4) ?Contributing to visual pollution and clutter. 
(Code 1988, § 175-120) 


Sec. 62-1817. - Permit required. 
    No sign shall be permitted to be erected, structurally altered or relocated unless a written application 
has been made to the code enforcement agency and a permit therefor duly issued upon payment of the 
established corresponding fees. 
(Code 1988, § 175-122) 


Sec. 62-1818. - Permit applications and issuance. 
(a) ?Application for sign permits shall be made upon forms provided by the code enforcement agency. 
The application shall be accompanied by two prints or drawings, to scale, of the plans and 
specifications of any proposed sign, which include the sign's location, method of construction and 
materials that it consists of. Written consent of the property owner must be provided if anyone other 
than the owner submits an application for a sign permit. An applicant must supply the code 
enforcement agency with any additional information that shall be required to determine compliance 
with the state Uniform Building Code and other applicable regulations. 
(b) ?Upon the filing of a complete application for a sign permit, the code enforcement agency shall 
review the application and sign specifications to determine compliance with all the requirements of 
this division and other applicable regulations. Upon the submission of a complete application, the 
township construction official or other designated code enforcement agency staff member shall 
award a permit or deny an application for specified reasons, within 45 calendar days. Any issued 
sign permit shall be null and void after a period of one year from the date of issuance of the permit if 
the work has not been initiated to erect or construct the sign. 
(Code 1988, § 175-123) 


Sec. 62-1819. - Exemptions from permit requirement. 
    Sign permit requirements shall not apply to the following signs: 
(1) ?Nameplate signs. One nameplate sign, not more than 144 square inches in area, may be 
placed anywhere within a front yard. 
(2) ?House of worship, school or public building sign. A house of worship, school or other public or 
institutional building may have, for its own use, an announcement sign or bulletin board not to 
exceed 16 square feet in area. Prior to its erection, the code enforcement agency must

reduced by the municipal agency. 
(b) ?Screen planting shall consist of staggered rows of evergreen trees at least seven feet high and 
planted not more than ten feet on center. Trees shall be planted and maintained so as to obscure 
nonresidential activity from the residential district. In dense naturally wooded areas, the screen 
planting requirements may be modified by the municipal agency requiring supplemental plantings of 
evergreen trees to ensure an appropriate four-season screen. 
(c) ?Screen planting shall be located across the entire property parallel to the district boundary, as near 
as possible to existing residences, and may be within a residential or mixed-use district. However, 
evergreen plantings should not be allowed within the rear property lines of residential subdivisions 
where two rear lot lines abut, to allow for residents to install privacy fences.

resold, rented or rerented except to a household that has been qualified as a low- or moderate-
income household, respectively. However, nothing contained in this chapter, or in the rules and 
regulations of the affordable housing office, shall restrict or preclude any household which was 
classified by the authority as a low- or moderate-income household at the time it purchased a low- or 
moderate-income housing unit from continuing to own the unit after its income exceeds the income 
ceilings established by this chapter. 
(d) ?Every sale, resale and/or rental (as applicable) of an affordable housing unit shall include the 
following: 
(1) ?The contract for sale or resale of every affordable housing unit shall include a provision 
indicating that all closings of title shall take place in the offices of the affordable housing 
office or such other location as the affordable housing office shall designate. The 
affordable housing office shall receive notice of closing at least ten days prior to the date of

the terms, conditions and restrictions of the South Brunswick ordinances and affordable 
housing office regulations, including limitations on sale, rental and financing of the unit. 
(4) ?Lease agreements for rental units shall be in a form approved by the affordable housing 
office and shall contain a restriction prohibiting subletting without the written approval of the 
affordable housing office. 
(e) ?Developments containing affordable housing units shall provide that such units are reasonably well 
dispersed throughout the entire development, but in any case shall be subject to the following 
minimum standards for dispersal of lower-income units:

section shall be required to contain any lower-income units. In any section that contains lower-
income units, no more than one-third of the total number of units may be lower-income units. 
(2) ?The restrictions contained in subsection (e)(1) of this section shall not apply to any building or 
section when necessary to finance the development of the building or section through public or 
tax-exempt funding or to any building with lower-income units restricted to senior citizens, but in 
no event shall any one building or section developed pursuant to this subsection contain more 
than 150 lower-income units. 
(3) ?Lower-income units must be located so as to afford comparable access to transportation, 
community shopping, recreation and other amenities as are provided to other residents of the 
development. 
(4) ?The landscaping and buffers used around buildings and within sections containing lower-
income units shall not be different from those used in other portions of the development, and the 
landscaping and buffers used to separate such buildings and sections shall be the same as is 
used to separate other portions of the development.

(Code 1988, § 175-140; Ord. No. 5-03, § 175-140, 3-4-2003; Ord. No. 29-05, § I, 5-10-2005; 
Ord. No. 2009-30, § I, 7-28-2009) 


Sec. 62-1993. - Qualifications of purchaser or renter. 
    A prospective purchaser or renter of a low- or moderate-income housing unit must be qualified as a 
low- or moderate-income household by the affordable housing office prior to the purchase or rental of 
such unit. In making this determination, the affordable housing office shall apply the standards set forth in 
the rules and regulations governing eligibility of applicants for affordable housing. Any person considered 
to be an illegal alien pursuant to the Immigration and Nationality Act and/or the United States Citizenship 
and Immigration Services shall be prohibited from obtaining affordable housing assistance in South 
Brunswick. 
(Code 1988, § 175-141; Ord. No. 2009-30, § I, 7-28-2009; Ord. No. 2010-13, § I, 5-11-2010) 


Sec. 62-1994. - Determination of maximum sales price and rental charge. 
(a) ?Determination of price or charge by authority. Prior to the sale, resale, rental or rerental of a low- or 
moderate-income housing unit, the affordable housing office shall determine the maximum sales 
price or rental charge that may be charged for that size unit in each income category. 
(b) ?Maximum sales price. The following procedure shall apply to determine maximum sales prices: 
(1) ?The base price shall be determined as follows: 
a. ?A base price shall be calculated such that the sum of the monthly payments for principal; 
interest; taxes; fire, theft and liability insurance; and homeowners' association fees, if any, 
shall not exceed 28 percent of the low- or moderate-income ceiling determined in 
accordance with section 62-1993. A ten-percent down payment requirement and a 30-year 
mortgage term shall be assumed in making this calculation. 
b. ?In calculating the monthly interest payment, the affordable housing office shall apply the 
interest rate which it determines to be reasonably available locally to low- and moderate-
income households and shall review any documentation provided by the developer 
regarding financing which it contends is available to such households. If the developer or 
any other entity offers to buy down the prevailing interest rate and the terms of the 
buydown provide that the increase in interest rate charged does not exceed one-half of one 
percent per year during the period of the buydown, the interest rate for the first year of the 
buydown period shall be used in the calculation in this subsection to determine the monthly 
interest payment. If the increase in the interest rate exceeds one-half of one percent per 
year, the average interest rate for the period of the buydown shall be used. 
c. ?If the developer proposes that an adjustable rate mortgage (ARM) be used to calculate the 
monthly interest payment and the affordable housing office determines that such 
adjustable rate mortgages are reasonably available locally to lower-income homebuyers, 
the initial interest rate of that mortgage shall be used only if the maximum annual average 
increase does not exceed one-half of one percent. Otherwise, a rate which is the average 
of the initial interest rate and the highest possible rate in effect after three years or 1½ 
points less than the best available fixed mortgage rate, whichever is greater, shall be used. 
(2) ?In order to ensure that low- and moderate-income housing units are affordable by households 
whose income is less than the low- or moderate-income ceiling, the maximum sales price that 
may be offered for each such unit shall be determined as a percentage of the base price for that 
size unit in each income category as follows: 
a. ?For each of the following income categories for which a development has fewer than 100 
units, the following percentages shall be used in determining the maximum sales price: 
1. ?Low income: 90 percent of the base price. 
2. ?Moderate income: 90 percent of the base price. 
b. ?For each of the following income categories for which a development has 100 or more 
units, the following percentages shall be used in determining the maximum sales price: 
1. ?Low income: 95 percent of the base price for one-half of the units and 85 percent of 
the base price for one-half of the units. 
2. ?Moderate income: 95 percent of the base price for one-half of the units and 85 percent 
of the base price for one-half of the units. 
c. ?A unit offered at 85 percent of the base price shall not be offered for sale to any household 
whose income is greater than 95 percent of the low- or moderate-income ceiling, 
whichever is applicable. 
(3) ?Prior to final approval of any development subject to this section, the affordable housing office 
shall determine the maximum sales prices by unit size for the low- and moderate-income 
housing units in the development and shall so notify the developer. These prices shall remain in 
effect for a period of one year or until all of the low- or moderate-income housing units have 
been sold, whichever occurs first. The developer may request a modification of the maximum 
sales price by applying to the affordable housing office for recalculation of these prices based 
on substantial change in any of the factors used to calculate the price. 
(4) ?Prior to the resale of any low- or moderate-income housing unit, the affordable housing office 
shall determine the maximum sales price for that unit in accordance with a formula developed 
by the authority which takes into account increases in a generally accepted price or income 
index, capital improvements that render the unit suitable for a larger household and reasonable 
out-of-pocket costs of the sale as determined by the authority and which, to the extent feasible, 
ensures that resale prices will be consistent with the affordability standards set forth in 
subsection (b)(1) and (2) of this section. 
(c) ?Maximum rental charges. The following procedure shall apply to determine maximum rental 
charges: 
(1) ?A base rent shall be calculated such that the sum of the monthly rental payment, excluding 
utilities, does not exceed 30 percent of the low- or moderate-income ceiling determined in 
accordance with section 62-1993. 
(2) ?Affordability shall be determined as follows: 
a. ?In order to ensure that low- or moderate-income housing units are affordable by a range of 
households whose income is less than the low- or moderate-income ceiling, the maximum 
gross rent that may be charged for each unit shall be such that the average of the gross 
rents charged for that size unit in each income category does not exceed the following 
percentage of the base price for that size unit in each of the following income categories: 
1. ?Low income: 90 percent of the base price. 
2. ?Moderate income: 90 percent of the base price. 
b. ?In order to ensure affordability by a wider range of lower-income households, the affordable 
housing office shall encourage landlords to set individualized rents not to exceed 30 
percent of the tenant's actual income, provided that the average of such rents for each size 
unit does not exceed 90 percent of the base rent for that size unit in each income category. 
c. ?In devising a range of affordability for rental housing, the affordable housing office shall 
ensure, as best as practicable, the following distribution of rental charges for lower-income 
rental units: 
RENTAL STRATIFICATION 
Low Income 
½ of all units at 40% of the median income base 
½ of all units at 50% of the median income base 
Moderate Income 
1/3 of all units at 60% of the median income base 
1/3 of all units at 70% of the median income base 
1/3 of all units at 80% of the median income base 
(3) ?Once the maximum rental charges have been determined for the low- and moderate-income 
housing units, such charges shall not be increased without the prior written approval of the 
affordable housing office. The authority shall establish appropriate criteria and procedures for 
allowing periodic rental charge increases consistent with the affordability standards set forth in 
subsection (c)(1) and (2) of this section. No more than one rental charge increase shall be 
allowed for any unit or group of units within any 12-month period. 
(4) ?Market units and lower-income units in a development subject to the affordable housing 
requirements of this division shall be exempted from municipal rent control. 
(5) ?Nothing contained in this chapter shall prevent the township council from adopting rules and 
regulations for the affordable housing office not inconsistent with this chapter. Rules and 
regulations for the affordable housing office may be adopted which increase or decrease rents 
for units, subject to the regulations of this division based upon increases or decreases in the 
income level of the occupants as shall be, from time to time, determined by the affordable 
housing office and/or the council on affordable housing. 
(d) ?Relationship between household size and unit size. For the purpose of determining maximum sales 
prices and rental charges pursuant to subsections (b) and (c) of this section, the ceiling incomes of 
the following household sizes shall be used to determine the maximum prices for each of the 
following unit sizes:

(e) ?Maximum affordable price tables. The affordable housing office shall prepare and maintain tables of 
maximum affordable prices for low- and moderate-income households by unit size and a guide for 
determining maximum sales prices and rental charges for low- and moderate-income housing units. 
(Code 1988, § 175-142; Ord. No. 2009-30, § I, 7-28-2009) 


Sec. 62-1995. - Certificate of habitability compliance on resale or reoccupancy. 
(a) ?Prior to the transfer of title or occupancy to a dwelling unit which is classified as a low- or moderate-
income unit under the affordable housing standards of this chapter, the owner shall be required to 
obtain a certificate of habitability compliance in the following manner: 
(1) ?An application shall be filed with the code enforcement officer, setting forth the property 
location and the date of the proposed transfer of title or reoccupancy. 
(2) ?The code enforcement officer or his designee shall inspect the property and shall issue a 
certificate within six business days of receipt of the application. The certificate shall indicate 
whether or not the dwelling unit complies with the provisions of article VII of chapter 22. 
(b) ?For the purpose of making such inspections, the code enforcement officer or his designee shall be 
authorized to enter, examine and survey the dwelling unit at reasonable times and upon reasonable 
notice. 
(c) ?Whenever the code enforcement officer or his designee determines that there has been a violation 
of any provision of article VII of chapter 22 or any rule or regulation adopted pursuant thereto, he 
shall give notice of such violation to the person responsible therefor. Notice shall be deemed to be 
properly served upon any present or prior owner or occupant either by personal service or certified 
mail. The notice shall set forth the deficiencies and the time period within which repairs must be 
completed. 
(d) ?Inasmuch as affordable housing units are constitutionally mandated and the township desires that 
such units shall be properly maintained, no fee shall be charged for the application for, inspection of 
or issuance of a certificate of habitability compliance pursuant to this section. 
(e) ?If title to an affordable housing unit is transferred without the owner having first obtained a certificate 
of habitability compliance, both the prior owner and the new owner shall be subject to a fine of not 
more than $200.00 each. If there is a change in occupancy of an affordable housing rental unit prior 
to the landlord having first obtained a certificate of habitability compliance, the landlord shall be 
subject to a fine of not more than $200.00 for a first offense and not more than $500.00 for each 
subsequent offense, regardless of whether any subsequent offense is in connection with the same 
affordable housing rental unit or a different affordable housing rental unit owned by the same 
landlord. 
(Code 1988, § 175-142.1) 


Sec. 62-1996. - Association fees and special assessments. 
    For low- and moderate-income purchasers, the condominium or homeowners' association fees, and 
special assessments levied by such association, shall be 50 percent of the association fees or 
association special assessments for market units. The master deed for each inclusionary development 
shall regulate the low- and moderate-income unit fees in accordance with this section. Once established 
within the master deed, the percentage shall not be amended by the township, condominium association 
or homeowners' association without prior approval from the council on affordable housing. 
(Ord. No. 8-96, § 175-142.2, 6-4-1996; Ord. No. 58-96, 9-17-1996) 


Sec. 62-1997. - Expiration of restrictions; repayment; extension of restrictions. 
(a) ?Expiration of restrictions. Unless extended as set forth in subsection (c) herein, restrictions on low- 
and moderate-income sales and rental housing shall expire and terminate at the earliest of the 
following: 
(1) ?Thirty years from the date the restrictions initially encumber the unit; 
(2) ?The date upon which a judgment of foreclosure is entered in favor of a first purchase money 
mortgagee, except as provided in N.J.A.C. 5:80-26.11(d); or 
(3) ?The date after restrictions expire as set forth in subsection (a)(1) of this section when any 
affordable housing rental unit which continues to be occupied by a low- or moderate-income 
household becomes vacant. 
(b) ?Repayment. A repayment mortgage and a repayment note shall be executed in favor of the 
affordable housing office by a purchaser of a low- or moderate-income housing unit. The repayment 
mortgage and repayment note shall provide for repayment to the authority of 95 percent of the price 
differential at the first nonexempt transfer of title after the expiration of restrictions as set forth in 
subsection (a) of this section. The repayment mortgage shall be recorded simultaneously with the 
deed. The recorded original repayment mortgage, together with the original repayment note, shall be 
filed with the affordable housing office. 
(c) ?Extension of restrictions. The township shall have the right to determine that the most desirable 
means of promoting an adequate supply of low- and moderate-income housing is to extend the 
period of restrictions on low- and moderate-income sales and rental housing units beyond the period 
set forth in subsection (a) under such circumstances and by such means as may be permitted by 
law. Nothing contained herein shall prohibit the township from extending any restrictions upon mutual 
agreement between the township and the then owner of the unit. 
(Code 1988, § 175-143; Ord. No. 2009-30, § I, 7-28-2009; Ord. No. 2016-14 , § I, 6-28-16) 


Sec. 62-1998. - Limitations on restrictions if foreclosure occurs. 
(a) ?Notwithstanding the restriction on resale of low- or moderate-income housing units set forth in this 
division, there shall be no such restriction if foreclosure and resale by a first purchase money 
mortgagee after foreclosure occurs. Execution of foreclosure sales by any other class of creditor or 
mortgagee shall not result in a release of the affordable housing unit from the restrictions imposed 
thereon. 
(b) ?If a foreclosure sale occurs, the owner of the affordable housing unit shall be personally obligated to 
pay any surplus funds to the affordable housing office in accordance with the terms of the affordable 
housing agreement. 
(Code 1988, § 175-144; Ord. No. 2009-30, § I, 7-28-2009) 


Sec. 62-1999. - Affirmative marketing. 
    Developers of lower-income housing shall affirmatively market such housing to all segments of the 
lower-income population within the Mount Laurel housing region in which the township is located and to 
all qualified low- or moderate-income households, irrespective of race, color, religion, sex or national 
origin. Toward that end, the developer shall formulate and submit an affirmative marketing plan 
acceptable to the affordable housing office, which plan shall be incorporated into any approval of the 
development application. At a minimum, the plan shall provide for advertisement in newspapers with 
general circulation in the following urban core areas: Jersey City, Newark, Elizabeth, Paterson, New 
Brunswick and Perth Amboy. The plan shall also require the developer to notify the following agencies, on 
a regular basis, of the availability of any low- or moderate-income housing units: the Civil League of 
Greater New Brunswick, the Housing Coalition of Middlesex County, the Middlesex County Office of 
Community Development and other fair housing centers, housing referral organizations and government 
social service and public welfare departments located in the four-county region consisting of Middlesex, 
Somerset, Warren and Hunterdon counties. 
(Code 1988, § 175-145; Ord. No. 2009-30, § I, 7-28-2009) 


Sec. 62-2000. - Income ceiling exceptions. 
    Where a developer has diligently attempted to market a lower-income housing unit and that unit has 
not been sold within six months after issuance of the certificate of occupancy for that unit, the developer 
may seek relief under this section by submitting to the affordable housing office documentation of all 
efforts made to sell the unit and the hardship suffered by the continued vacancy. If the authority finds that 
the developer has made reasonably diligent efforts and has suffered hardship and that it is not realistic to 
expect sale to a qualified household within a reasonable time if sales efforts were to continue, the 
authority, in its sole discretion, may provide relief to the developer by permitting the unit to be offered for 
sale to a purchaser whose income level is up to 50 percent higher than the income ceiling fixed for the 
income category for which the unit was originally offered for sale. The unit shall, nevertheless, be sold at 
the maximum affordable price originally determined by the affordable housing office, and a covenant 
embodying the restrictions of section 62-1992(a), (b) and (c) shall be recorded with the deed for the sale 
of the property subject to the restriction of this division. 
(Code 1988, § 175-146; Ord. No. 2009-30, § I, 7-28-2009) 


Sec. 62-2001. - Development fees. 
(a) ?Findings and purpose. 
(1) ?In Holmdel Builder's Association V. Holmdel Township, 121 N.J. 550 (1990), the New Jersey 
Supreme Court determined that mandatory development fees are authorized by the Fair 
Housing Act of 1985 (the Act), N.J.S.A. 52:27D-301 et seq., and the State Constitution, subject 
to the Council on Affordable Housing's (COAH's) adoption of rules. 
(2) ?Pursuant to P.L.2008, c.46 section 8 (C. 52:27D-329.2) and the Statewide Non-Residential 
Development Fee Act (C. 40:55D-8.1 through 8.7), COAH is authorized to adopt and 
promulgate regulations necessary for the establishment, implementation, review, monitoring 
and enforcement of municipal affordable housing trust funds and corresponding spending plans. 
Municipalities that are under the jurisdiction of the council or court of competent jurisdiction and 
have a COAH-approved spending plan may retain fees collected from nonresidential 
development. 
(3) ?This section establishes standards for the collection, maintenance, and expenditure of 
development fees pursuant to COAH's regulations and in accordance P.L.2008, c.46, Sections 
8 and 32-38. Fees collected pursuant to this section shall be used for the sole purpose of 
providing low- and moderate-income housing. This Section shall be interpreted within the 
framework of COAH's rules on development fees, codified at N.J.A.C. 5:97-8. 
(b) ?Basic requirements. 
(1) ?This Section shall not be effective until approved by COAH pursuant to N.J.A.C. 5:96-5.1. 
(2) ?South Brunswick Township shall not spend development fees until COAH has approved a plan 
for spending such fees in conformance with N.J.A.C. 5:97-8.10 and N.J.A.C. 5:96-5.3. 
(c) ?Definitions. 
(1) ?The following terms, as used in this section, shall have the following meanings: 
i. ?"Affordable housing development" means a development included in the housing element 
and fair share plan, and includes, but is not limited to, an inclusionary development, a 
municipal construction project or a 100 percent affordable development. 
ii. ?"COAH" or the "council" means the New Jersey Council on Affordable Housing established 
under the Act which has primary jurisdiction for the administration of housing obligations in 
accordance with sound regional planning consideration in the state. 
iii. ?"Development fee" means money paid by a developer for the improvement of property as 
permitted in N.J.A.C. 5:97-8.3. 
iv. ?"Developer" means the legal or beneficial owner or owners of a lot or of any land proposed 
to be included in a proposed development, including the holder of an option or contract to 
purchase, or other person having an enforceable proprietary interest in such land. 
v. ?"Equalized assessed value" means the assessed value of a property divided by the current 
average ratio of assessed to true value for the municipality in which the property is 
situated, as determined in accordance with sections 1, 5, and 6 of P.L.1973, c.123 (C.54:1-
35a through C.54:1-35c). 
vi. ?"Green building strategies" means those strategies that minimize the impact of 
development on the environment, and enhance the health, safety and well-being of 
residents by producing durable, low-maintenance, resource-efficient housing while making 
optimum use of existing infrastructure and community services. 
(d) ?Residential development fees. 
(1) ?Imposed fees. 
i. ?Within all zoning district(s), residential developers, except for developers of the types of 
development specifically exempted below, shall pay a fee of 1.5 percent of the equalized 
assessed value for residential development provided no increased density is permitted. 
ii. ?When an increase in residential density pursuant to N.J.S.A. 40:55D-70d(5) (known as a 
"d" variance) has been permitted, developers may be required to pay a development fee of 
six percent of the equalized assessed value for each additional unit that may be realized. 
However, if the zoning on a site has changed during the two-year period preceding the 
filing of such a variance application, the base density for the purposes of calculating the 
bonus development fee shall be the highest density permitted by right during the two-year 
period preceding the filing of the variance application. 
Example: If an approval allows four units to be constructed on a site that was zoned for two 
units, the fees could equal one and a half percent of the equalized assessed value on the 
first two units; and the specified higher percentage up to six percent of the equalized 
assessed value for the two additional units, provided zoning on the site has not changed 
during the two-year period preceding the filing of such a variance application. 
(2) ?Eligible exactions, ineligible exactions and exemptions for residential development. 
i. ?Affordable housing developments, developments where the developer is providing for the 
construction of affordable units elsewhere in the municipality, and developments where the 
developer has made a payment in lieu of on-site construction of affordable units shall be 
exempt from development fees. 
ii. ?Developments that have received preliminary or final site plan approval prior to the 
adoption of a municipal development fee ordinance shall be exempt from development 
fees, unless the developer seeks a substantial change in the approval. Where a site plan 
approval does not apply, a zoning and/or building permit shall be synonymous with 
preliminary or final site plan approval for this purpose. The fee percentage shall be vested 
on the date that the building permit is issued. 
iii. ?Development fees shall be imposed and collected when an existing structure undergoes a 
change to a more intense use, is demolished and replaced, or is expanded, if the 
expansion is not otherwise exempt from the development fee requirement. The 
development fee shall be calculated on the increase in the equalized assessed value of the 
improved structure. 
iv. ?Developers of residential structures demolished and replaced as a result of a natural 
disaster shall be exempt from paying a development fee. 
(e) ?Nonresidential development fees. 
(1) ?Imposed fees. 
i. ?Within all zoning districts, nonresidential developers, except for developers of the types of 
development specifically exempted, shall pay a fee equal to two and one-half (2.5) percent 
of the equalized assessed value of the land and improvements, for all new nonresidential 
construction on an unimproved lot or lots. 
ii. ?Nonresidential developers, except for developers of the types of development specifically 
exempted, shall also pay a fee equal to two and one-half (2.5) percent of the increase in 
equalized assessed value resulting from any additions to existing structures to be used for 
nonresidential purposes. 
iii. ?Development fees shall be imposed and collected when an existing structure is 
demolished and replaced. The development fee of two and a half (2.5) percent shall be 
calculated on the difference between the equalized assessed value of the pre-existing land 
and improvement and the equalized assessed value of the newly improved structure, i.e. 
land and improvement, at the time a final certificate of occupancy is issued. If the 
calculation required under this section results in a negative number, the nonresidential 
development fee shall be zero. 
(2) ?Eligible exactions, ineligible exactions and exemptions for nonresidential development. 
i. ?The nonresidential portion of a mixed-use inclusionary or market rate development shall be 
subject to the two and a half (2.5) percent development fee, unless otherwise exempted 
below.

value resulting from alterations, change in use within existing footprint, reconstruction, 
renovations and repairs. 
iii. ?Nonresidential developments shall be exempt from the payment of nonresidential 
development fees in accordance with the exemptions required pursuant to P.L. 2008, c.46, 
as specified in the Form N-RDF "State of New Jersey Non-Residential Development 
Certification/Exemption" Form. Any exemption claimed by a developer shall be 
substantiated by that developer. 
iv. ?A developer of a nonresidential development exempted from the nonresidential 
development fee pursuant to P.L.2008, c.46 shall be subject to it at such time as the basis 
for the exemption no longer applies, and shall make the payment of the nonresidential 
development fee, in that event, within three years after that event or after the issuance of 
the final certificate of occupancy of the nonresidential development, whichever is later. 
v. ?If a property which was exempted from the collection of a nonresidential development fee 
thereafter ceases to be exempt from property taxation, the owner of the property shall remit 
the fees required pursuant to this section within 45 days of the termination of the property 
tax exemption. Unpaid nonresidential development fees under these circumstances may 
be enforceable by South Brunswick as a lien against the real property of the owner. 
(f) ?Collection procedures. 
(1) ?Upon the granting of a preliminary, final or other applicable approval, for a development, the 
applicable approving authority shall direct its staff to notify the construction official responsible 
for the issuance of a building permit. 
(2) ?For nonresidential developments only, the developer shall also be provided with a copy of 
Form N-RDF "State of New Jersey Non-Residential Development Certification/Exemption" to be 
completed as per the instructions provided. The developer of a nonresidential development 
shall complete Form N-RDF as per the instructions provided. The construction official shall 
verify the information submitted by the nonresidential developer as per the instructions provided

property which is subject to a development fee. 
(6) ?Within ten business days of a request for the scheduling of a final inspection, the municipal 
assessor shall confirm or modify the previously estimated equalized assessed value of the 
improvements of the development; calculate the development fee; and thereafter notify the 
developer of the amount of the fee. 
(7) ?Should South Brunswick fail to determine or notify the developer of the amount of the 
development fee within ten business days of the request for final inspection, the developer may 
estimate the amount due and pay that estimated amount consistent with the dispute process set 
forth in subsection (b) of section 37 of P.L. 2008, c.46 (C.40:55D-8.6). 
(8) ?Fifty percent of the development fee shall be collected at the time of issuance of the building 
permit. The remaining portion shall be collected at the issuance of the certificate of occupancy. 
The developer shall be responsible for paying the difference between the fee calculated at 
building permit and that determined at issuance of the certificate of occupancy.

i. ?A developer may challenge residential development fees imposed by filing a challenge with 
the county board of taxation. Pending a review and determination by the board, collected 
fees shall be placed in an interest bearing escrow account by South Brunswick Township. 
Appeals from a determination of the board may be made to the tax court in accordance

more lots or units shall set aside 12.5 percent of said units for affordable housing, as said term 
is defined under the FHA and COAH's rules.

received a determination of completeness on application for preliminary approval from the 
planning board or zoning board of adjustment proposing four or less lots or units shall pay an 
affordable housing development fee pursuant to section 62-2001, development fees. 
(b) ?Affordable housing compliance mechanisms . The applicant referred to in subsection (a) may 
choose to satisfy its affordable housing obligation(s) through the mechanisms permitted in COAH's 
rules, including, with South Brunswick Township's advanced written permission: 
(1) ?On-site housing production; 
(2) ?Off-site housing production in the township;

Evidence of a compliance mechanism that has been approved in writing by the township shall 
be produced to the planning or zoning board at the time of application filing and shall be a 
condition of all "completeness" determinations. Thereafter, the satisfaction of the affordable 
housing compliance mechanism shall be an automatic condition of all approvals that must be 
satisfied in accordance with COAH's phasing requirements pursuant to N.J.A.C. 5:93-5.6(d). 
(c) ?Compliance with COAH's rules . The affordable unit(s) to be produced pursuant to subsections (a) 
and (b) of this section shall be available to a low income individual or household should only one 
affordable unit be required. Thereafter, each of the units shall be split evenly between low and 
moderate income individuals and households except in the event of an odd number in which event 
the unit shall be a low income unit. All affordable units shall strictly comply with COAH's rules and 
UHAC requirements including, but not limited to, phasing, bedroom distribution, controls on 
affordability, range of affordability, affirmative marketing, income qualification, etc. It shall be the 
developer's responsibility, at its cost and expense, to arrange for an administering agency that may

monitoring forms as may be required by COAH to verify COAH compliance of each affordable unit. 
(d) ?Payments in lieu of construction . 
(1) ?Payments in lieu of the construction of affordable housing shall be based upon a proportionate 
share of the total project cost embodied in one or more pro-forma statements (pro-forma(s)) for 
the construction of an affordable housing development elsewhere within the township of South 
Brunswick, which pro-forma(s) shall be on file in the office of the township clerk. The payment in 
lieu of construction to be made by the developer may be subject to negotiation with the 
township based upon the following considerations: the actual cost of buying down or subsidizing 
one or more existing or planned market priced dwelling units to achieve an average rent level 
affordable to a household earning 52.0 percent of median income; the actual land cost of site(s) 
earmarked for off-site affordable housing construction within the Township of South Brunswick; 
or reasonable and acceptable offers to substitute land, site preparation and/or construction 
services for all or a portion of the monetary payment otherwise required. 
(2) ?Regardless of the mechanism by which the applicant has been approved to satisfy the required 
number of affordable housing units pursuant to this section, any development or portion thereof 
that generates a fraction of an affordable housing unit as all or a portion of the obligation, shall 
be required to make a payment in lieu of construction for that fraction of a unit based on the pro-
rated cost of constructing an affordable housing unit in the Township of South Brunswick.

development standards shall be required as part of the application process for a site plan or major 
subdivision or for issuance of a building permit on any undeveloped parcel with a cemetery or on any 
regulated parcel adjacent to a known cemetery: 
(1) ?A report prepared by an archaeologist determining the boundaries of the cemetery and stating 
the number of graves believed to be present and their location as determined from the use of 
minimally invasive investigation techniques, including but not limited to remote sensing methods 
and the use of metal probes. 
(2) ?A survey of the cemetery prepared by or under the direction of a registered surveyor showing 
the location of the boundaries of the cemetery based on an archaeologist's report. 
(3) ?A 50-foot buffer shall be provided around the perimeter of the outermost graves. The location 
of the graves must be determined by an archaeologist. The 50 foot buffer permits grading within 
its outermost 25 feet. No improvements other than cemetery fencing shall be permitted. Within 
that 50-foot buffer, an inner 25-foot natural undisturbed buffer shall be provided around the 
perimeter of the outermost graves. A cemetery fence, as detailed below, shall be placed within 
the outer 25 foot buffer. If a cemetery is not on but adjacent to the parcel to be developed, a 25-
foot natural undisturbed buffer measured from the perimeter of the outermost graves is 
required. Grading shall be permitted, but no structures other than fencing shall be permitted. 
(4) ?A temporary tree protection fence shall be installed on the outer perimeter of the 25-foot 
undisturbed buffer before any land disturbing activity occurs. If the cemetery is located on an 
adjacent parcel, the tree protection fence shall be located along common property lines. The 
temporary tree protection fence shall remain in place until construction is completed. 
(5) ?An aluminum or iron picket fence with a gate of a design approved by the land use board shall 
be constructed along the perimeter of a cemetery on a parcel for which land disturbing activity is 
sought. If the cemetery is located on an adjacent parcel, the fence shall be located interior to 
the required buffer and improvement setback or along the common property line(s) as may be 
approved by the land use board. The gate shall be four feet wide and have a latch. 
(6) ?Uninhibited daylight access to the cemetery shall be provided via a 20-foot graveled easement 
to the cemetery from the nearest public road. Such easement shall be recorded by deed in the 
office of the Middlesex County Clerk. 
(7) ?A maintenance plan for a cemetery located on the parcel for which approval is sought shall be 
provided by the applicant. Such plan shall be approved by the land use board and shall identify 
a responsible party to implement and maintain the maintenance plan. 
(8) ?The location of a cemetery, as identified by the surveyor, shall be included on the approved 
plans and recorded plat as applicable. 
(9) ?A small plaque/marker with the name of the cemetery, date range of burials and any other 
historical information may be placed on the cemetery fence, as required by the land use board.

ARTICLE VI. - STORMWATER MANAGEMENT[38] 

Footnotes: 
--- (38) --- 
Editor's note— Ord. No. 2007-15, § I, adopted March 27, 2007, repealed art. VI, which consisted of §§ 
62-2571—62-2577, pertained to surface water management and was derived from Code 1988, §§ 175-
186, 175-186.1, 175-186.2, 175-187, 175-187.1, 175-187.2, and 175-188. 
Cross reference— Utilities, ch. 114. 


Sec. 62-2571. - Scope and purpose. 
(a) ?Policy statement. Flood control, groundwater recharge, and pollutant reduction shall be 
accomplished by maximizing the use of nonstructural or low impact techniques before relying on 
structural best management practices (BMPs). Structural BMPs should be integrated with 
nonstructural stormwater management strategies and proper maintenance plans in order to minimize 
the use of structural BMPs. Nonstructural strategies include both environmentally sensitive site 
design and source controls that prevent pollutants from being placed on the site or from being 
exposed to stormwater. Source control plans should be developed based upon physical site 
conditions and the origin, nature, and the anticipated quantity or amount of potential pollutants. 
Multiple stormwater management BMPs may be necessary to achieve the established performance 
standards for water quality, quantity, and groundwater recharge. 
(b) ?Purpose. It is the purpose of this article to promote the public health, safety and general welfare and 
to allow the natural recharge of groundwater supplies, protect the ecological health and function of 
streams and the quality of the waters, alleviate hazards to health and property from stormwater 
runoff and minimize public and private losses due to stormwater runoff damage. Neither property 
owners whose land is at a lower elevation nor neighboring property owners nor the public at large 
should bear the cost incident to stormwater runoff damage caused by land disturbance. Rather, 
these costs should be borne in the first instance by the individual property owner or developer who 
engages in the disturbance which may result in increased or altered stormwater runoff. 
(c) ?Applicability. 
(1) ?This article shall be applicable to all site plans and subdivisions for the following developments 
that require preliminary site plan or subdivision review: 
a. ?Nonresidential developments; and 
b. ?Aspects of residential developments that are not pre-empted by the residential site 
improvement standards at N.J.A.C. 5:21. 
c. ?A permit for any land disturbance or construction. 
(2) ?This article shall also be applicable to all developments undertaken by the Township of South 
Brunswick. 
(3) ?The following developments shall be exempt from the requirements of this article: 
a. ?Sites to be used for agricultural or gardening purposes. 
b. ?Residential sites with less than one acre of land disturbance and that are not part of any 
larger development project. 
(4) ?The development review board may waive the requirements of this article on site plans or 
subdivisions that ultimately disturb less than one acre of land or increase impervious surface by 
less than one-quarter acre, upon the recommendation of the township engineer, where it is 
satisfied that the proposed activity will not result in stormwater runoff damage. 
(d) ?Compatibility with other permit and ordinance requirements. Development approvals issued for 
subdivisions and site plans pursuant to this article are to be considered an integral part of 
development approvals under the subdivision and site plan review process and do not relieve the 
applicant of the responsibility to secure required permits or approvals for activities regulated by any 
other applicable code, rule, act, or ordinance. In their interpretation and application, the provisions of 
this article shall be held to be the minimum requirements for the promotion of the public health, 
safety, and general welfare. This article is not intended to interfere with, abrogate, or annul any other 
ordinances, rule or regulation, statute, or other provision of law except that, where any provision of 
this article imposes restrictions different from those imposed by any other ordinance, rule or 
regulation, or other provision of law, the more restrictive provisions or higher standards shall control.

measures necessary to meet these standards shall be incorporated into the design, along with 
the practicable nonstructural strategies. 
(2) ?The standards in this article apply only to developments as described in subsection 62-2571(c) 
and are intended to minimize the impact of stormwater runoff on water quality and water 
quantity in receiving water bodies and maintain groundwater recharge. 
(3) ?Stormwater runoff within a site shall ultimately leave the site in the same drainage area and 
watershed in which it originally drained and shall be released in such a manner as to not 
increase erosion of adjacent properties. 
(4) ?The minimum design and performance standards for storm sewer collection systems are as 
follows: 
a. ?Storm sewer collection systems shall be designed to handle the 25-year storm event. 
b. ?The last stormwater inlet and storm sewer pipe reach prior to discharge into a stormwater 
management basin shall be designed to handle the 100-year storm event. 
c. ?The maximum velocity at storm sewer pipe outlets for all design storm events shall be 
seven feet per second. 
(5) ?To the maximum extent feasible, all stormwater control measures shall be constructed prior to 
beginning other land disturbance activities. 
(6) ?All stormwater control measures shall be completed and stabilized prior to certification of 
completion by the township engineer and acceptance by the Township of South Brunswick. 
(7) ?Where applicable, an applicant shall certify through a licensed engineer that proposed 
stormwater management facilities have been designed in a manner consistent with dam safety 
and other design standards in accordance with the then-current state of the art for such 
structures and in accordance with any and all standards which may be required by law or 
regulation. 
(8) ?Grading plans shall be required as follows: 
a. ?A certified grading plan shall be submitted by the developer prior to the issuance of a 
building permit. The grading plan shall show no less than a two-percent slope for surface 
runoff, not to exceed an overland flow length of 200 feet; alternatively, lawn inlets must be 
provided. Grading plans showing slopes exceeding four percent must be approved for 
erosion protection by the township engineer. 
b. ?Prior to the issuance of more than 80 percent of the certificates of occupancy for each 
block, a certified as-built grading plan shall be submitted by the developer, indicating that 
the approved grading plan is being complied with. For purposes of this subsection, the 
term "block" shall be defined as a portion of the site bounded by streets, highways, rivers 
and prominent streams as such shall be depicted on the official tax map of the Township of 
South Brunswick. 
(9) ?The 100-year water surface elevation in all stormwater management basins and facilities shall 
be located a minimum of one foot below any adjacent proposed and existing basement floor 
elevations. 
(10) ?The basement floor elevation of any proposed dwelling units or other buildings shall be 
located at least two feet above the seasonal high groundwater table, including consideration of 
groundwater mounding due to infiltration BMPs. 
(11) ?Stormwater management basins and facilities shall be constantly maintained by the owner to 
ensure continual functioning of the systems at design capacity and to prevent the health 
hazards associated with debris buildup and stagnant water. In no case shall water be allowed to 
remain in any facility long enough to constitute a mosquito-breeding disease or any other type 
of health problem, unless approved as a multifunction facility to include water such as a pond. 
Failure to maintain stormwater management basins and facilities to the degree that mosquito or 
other noxious pest habitats develop is a violation of the Mosquito Extermination Act, NJSA 26:9-
1 et seq., and shall subject the Owner to civil sanctions by the Township Health Department.

(d) ?A waiver from strict compliance with the groundwater recharge, stormwater runoff quantity, and 
stormwater runoff quality requirements of subsections 62-2574f) and 62-2574(g) may be obtained for 
the enlargement of an existing public roadway or railroad; or the construction or enlargement of a 
public pedestrian access, provided that the following conditions are met: 
(1) ?The applicant demonstrates that there is a public need for the project that cannot be 
accomplished by any other means; 
(2) ?The applicant demonstrates through an alternatives analysis, that through the use of 
nonstructural and structural stormwater management strategies and measures, the option 
selected complies with the requirements of subsections 62-2574(f) and 62-2574(g) to the 
maximum extent practicable; 
(3) ?The applicant demonstrates that, in order to meet the requirements of subsections 62-2574(f)

(4) ?The applicant demonstrates that it does not own or have other rights to areas, including the 
potential to obtain through condemnation lands not falling under subsection 62-2574(d)(3) within 
the upstream drainage area of the receiving stream, that would provide additional opportunities 
to mitigate the requirements of subsections 62-2574(f) and 62-2574(g) that were not achievable 
on-site. 
(e) ?Nonstructural stormwater management strategies. 
(1) ?To the maximum extent practicable, the standards in subsections 62-2574(f) and 62-2574(g) 
shall be met by incorporating nonstructural stormwater management strategies set forth at 
subsection 62-2574(e) into the design. The applicant shall identify the nonstructural measures 
incorporated into the design of the project. The New Jersey Nonstructural Stormwater 
Management Strategies Point System (NSPS), as set forth in subsection 62-2579(c)(10), shall 
be utilized to determine if the "maximum extent practicable" requirement has been met. If the 
applicant contends that it is not feasible for engineering, environmental, or safety reasons to 
incorporate any nonstructural stormwater management measures identified in paragraph (2)

(2) ?Nonstructural stormwater management strategies incorporated into site design shall: 
a. ?Protect areas that provide water quality benefits or areas particularly susceptible to erosion 
and sediment loss; 
b. ?Minimize impervious surfaces and break up or disconnect the flow of runoff over 
impervious surfaces; 
c. ?Maximize the protection of natural drainage features and vegetation; 
d. ?Minimize the decrease in the "time of concentration" from pre-construction to post

NJSA. 4:24-39 et seq., and implementing rules. 
(3) ?Site design features identified under subsection 62-2574(e)(2)i.2. above shall comply with the 
following standard to control passage of solid and floatable materials through storm drain inlets. 
For purposes of this paragraph, "solid and floatable materials" means sediment, debris, trash, 
and other floating, suspended, or settleable solids. For exemptions to this standard see 
subsection 62-2574(e)(3)c. below. 
a. ?Design engineers shall use either of the following grates whenever they use a grate in 
pavement or another ground surface to collect stormwater from that surface into a storm 
drain or surface water body under that grate: 
1. ?The New Jersey Department of Transportation (NJDOT) bicycle safe grate, which is 
described in Chapter 2.4 of the NJDOT Bicycle Compatible Roadways and Bikeways 
Planning and Design Guidelines (April 1996); or 
2. ?A different grate, if each individual clear space in that grate has an area of no more 
than seven square inches, or is no greater than 0.5 inch across the smallest 
dimension. 
Examples of grates subject to this standard include grates in grate inlets, the grate portion 
(non-curb-opening portion) of combination inlets, grates on storm sewer manholes, ditch 
grates, trench grates, and grates of spacer bars in slotted drains. Examples of ground 
surfaces include surfaces of roads (including bridges), driveways, parking areas, bikeways, 
plazas, sidewalks, lawns, fields, open channels, and stormwater basin floors. 
b. ?Whenever design engineers use a curb-opening inlet, the clear space in that curb opening 
(or each individual clear space, if the curb opening has two or more clear spaces) shall 
have an area of no more than seven square inches, or be no greater than two inches 
across the smallest dimension. 
c. ?This standard does not apply: 
1. ?Where the Development Review Board determines that this standard would cause 
inadequate hydraulic performance that could not practicably be overcome by using 
additional or larger storm drain inlets that meet these standards; 
2. ?Where flows from the water quality design storm as specified in subsection 62-
2574(g)(1) are conveyed through any device (e.g., end of pipe netting facility or 
manufactured treatment device), that is designed, at a minimum, to prevent delivery of 
all solid and floatable materials that could not pass through one of the following: 
i. ?A rectangular space 4 5/8 inches long and 1½ inches wide (this option does not 
apply for outfall netting facilities); or 
ii. ?A bar screen having a bar spacing of 0.5 inches. 
3. ?Where flows are conveyed through a trash rack that has parallel bars with one-inch 
spacing between the bars, to the elevation of the water quality design storm as

4. ?Where the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection determines, pursuant 
to the New Jersey Register of Historic Places Rules at N.J.A.C. 7:4-7.2(c), that action 
to meet this standard is an undertaking that constitutes an encroachment or will 
damage or destroy the New Jersey Register listed historic property. 
(4) ?Any land area used as a nonstructural stormwater management measure to meet the 
performance standards in subsections 62-2574(f) and 62-2574(g) shall be dedicated to the 
Township of South Brunswick, subjected to a conservation restriction filed with the Middlesex 
County Clerk's office, or subject to an approved equivalent restriction that ensures that measure 
or an equivalent stormwater management measure approved by the development review board 
is maintained in perpetuity. 
(5) ?Guidance for nonstructural stormwater management strategies is available in the New Jersey 
Stormwater Best Management Practices Manual. The BMP Manual may be obtained from the 
address identified in section 62-2577, or found on the department's website at 
www.njstormwater.org. 
(f) ?Erosion control, groundwater recharge and runoff quantity standards. 
(1) ?This subsection contains minimum design and performance standards to control erosion, 
encourage and control infiltration and groundwater recharge, and control stormwater runoff 
quantity impacts of development. 
a. ?The minimum design and performance standards for erosion control are those established 
under the Soil Erosion and Sediment Control Act, NJSA. 4:24-39 et seq. and implementing 
rules. 
b. ?The minimum design and performance standards for groundwater recharge are as follows: 
1. ?The design engineer shall, using the assumptions and factors for stormwater runoff 
and groundwater recharge calculations at section 62-2575, either: 
i. ?Demonstrate through hydrologic and hydraulic analysis that the site and its 
stormwater management measures maintain 100 percent of the average annual 
pre-construction groundwater recharge volume for the site; or 
ii. ?Demonstrate through hydrologic and hydraulic analysis that the increase of 
stormwater runoff volume from pre-construction to post-construction for the two-
year storm is infiltrated. 
2. ?This groundwater recharge requirement shall be subject only to the restrictions on 
groundwater recharge in subsection 3. below. 
3. ?The following types of stormwater shall not be recharged: 
i. ?Stormwater from areas of high pollutant loading. High pollutant loading areas are 
areas in industrial and commercial developments where solvents and/or 
petroleum products are loaded/unloaded, stored, or applied, areas where 
pesticides are loaded/unloaded or stored; areas where hazardous materials are 
expected to be present in greater than "reportable quantities" as defined by the 
United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) at 40 CFR 302.4; areas 
where recharge would be inconsistent with department approved remedial action 
work plan or landfill closure plan and areas with high risks for spills of toxic 
materials, such as gas stations and vehicle maintenance facilities; and 
ii. ?Industrial stormwater exposed to "source material." "Source material" means any 
material(s) or machinery, located at an industrial facility, that is directly or 
indirectly related to process, manufacturing or other industrial activities, which 
could be a source of pollutants in any industrial stormwater discharge to 
groundwater. Source materials include, but are not limited to, raw materials; 
intermediate products; final products; waste materials; by-products; industrial 
machinery and fuels, and lubricants, solvents, and detergents that are related to 
process, manufacturing, or other industrial activities that are exposed to 
stormwater. Site design shall minimize the potential for exposure of stormwater 
to "source material." 
4. ?The design engineer shall assess the hydraulic impact on the groundwater table and 
design the site so as to avoid adverse hydraulic impacts. Potential adverse hydraulic 
impacts include, but are not limited to, exacerbating a naturally or seasonally high 
water table so as to cause surficial ponding, flooding of basements, or interference 
with the proper operation of subsurface sewage disposal systems and other 
subsurface structures in the vicinity or downgradient of the groundwater recharge 
area. 
c. ?In order to control stormwater runoff quantity impacts, the design engineer shall, using the 
assumptions and factors for stormwater runoff calculations at section 62-2575, 
demonstrate the following: 
1. ?For stormwater leaving the site, post-construction runoff hydrographs for the two-, ten-
, and 100-year storm events do not exceed, at any point in time, the pre-construction 
runoff hydrographs for the same storm events. However, should the design engineer 
sufficiently demonstrate to the satisfaction of the township engineer that it is physically 
infeasible to meet these requirements, then the design engineer shall complete one of 
the following: 
i. ?Demonstrate through hydrologic and hydraulic analysis that there is no increase, 
as compared to the pre-construction condition, in the peak runoff rates of 
stormwater leaving the site for the two-, ten-, and 100-year storm events and that 
the increased volume or change in timing of stormwater runoff will not increase 
flood damage at or downstream of the site. This analysis shall include the 
analysis of impacts of existing land uses and projected land uses assuming full 
development under existing zoning and land use ordinances in the drainage 
area; 
ii. ?Design stormwater management measures so that the post-construction peak 
runoff rates for the two-, ten- and 100-year storm events are no greater than 50, 
75 and 80 percent, respectively, of the preconstruction peak runoff rates. The 
percentages apply only to the post-construction stormwater runoff that is 
attributable to the portion of the site on which the proposed development or 
project is to be constructed. 
2. ?Any application for a new agricultural development shall be submitted to the 
appropriate soil conservation district for review and approval in accordance with the 
requirements of this section and any applicable soil conservation district guidelines for 
stormwater runoff quantity and erosion control. For the purposes of this section, 
"agricultural development" means land uses normally associated with the production 
of food, fiber and livestock for sale. Such uses do not include the development of land 
for the processing or sale of food and the manufacturing of agriculturally related 
products. 
(g) ?Stormwater runoff quality standards. 
(1) ?Stormwater management measures shall be designed to reduce the post-construction load of 
total suspended solids (TSS) in stormwater runoff by 80 percent of the anticipated load from the 
developed site, expressed as an annual average. Stormwater management measures shall only 
be required for water quality control if an additional one-quarter acre of impervious surface is 
being proposed on a development site. The requirement to reduce TSS does not apply to any 
stormwater runoff in a discharge regulated under a numeric effluent limitation for TSS imposed 
under the New Jersey Pollution Discharge Elimination System (NJPDES) rules, N.J.A.C. 7:14A, 
or in a discharge specifically exempt under a NJPDES permit from this requirement. The water 
quality design storm is 1.25 inches of rainfall in two hours. Water quality calculations shall take 
into account the distribution of rain from the water quality design storm, as reflected in Table 1. 
The calculation of the volume of runoff may take into account the implementation of 
nonstructural and structural stormwater management measures.

(2) ?For purposes of TSS reduction calculations, Table 2 below presents the presumed removal 
rates for certain BMPs designed in accordance with the New Jersey Stormwater Best 
Management Practices Manual. The BMP Manual may be obtained from the address identified 
in section 62-2577, or found on the department's website at www.njstormwater.org. The BMP 
Manual and other sources of technical guidance are listed in section 62-2577. TSS reduction 
shall be calculated based on the removal rates for the BMPs in Table 2 below. Alternative 
removal rates and methods of calculating removal rates may be used if the design engineer 
provides documentation demonstrating the capability of these alternative rates and methods to 
the development review board. A copy of any approved alternative rate or method of calculating 
the removal rate shall be provided to the department at the following address: Division of 
Watershed Management, New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection, P.O. Box 418, 
Trenton, New Jersey 08625-0418. 
(3) ?If more than one BMP in series is necessary to achieve the required 80 percent TSS reduction 
for a site, the applicant shall utilize the following formula to calculate TSS reduction: 
R = A + B - (AXB)/100 
Where 
R = total TSS percent load removal from application of both BMPs, and 
A = the TSS percent removal rate applicable to the first BMP 
B = the TSS percent removal rate applicable to the second BMP

(4) ?If there is more than one onsite drainage area, the 80 percent TSS removal rate shall apply to 
each drainage area, unless the runoff from the subareas converge on site in which case the 
removal rate can be demonstrated through a calculation using a weighted average. 
(5) ?Stormwater management measures shall also be designed to reduce, to the maximum extent 
feasible, the post-construction nutrient load of the anticipated load from the developed site in 
stormwater runoff generated from the water quality design storm. In achieving reduction of 
nutrients to the maximum extent feasible, the design of the site shall include nonstructural 
strategies and structural measures that optimize nutrient removal while still achieving the 
performance standards in subsections 62-2574(f) and 62-2574(g). 
(6) ?Additional information and examples are contained in the New Jersey Stormwater Best 
Management Practices Manual, which may be obtained from the address identified in section 
62-2577. 
(7) ?Special water resource protection areas shall be established along all waters designated 
Category One at N.J.A.C. 7:9B, and perennial or intermittent streams that drain into or upstream 
of the Category One waters as shown on the USGS Quadrangle Maps, in the County Soil 
Surveys or in NJDEP GIS data sets for streams and other open waters, within the associated 
HUC14 drainage area. These areas are established for the protection of water quality, aesthetic 
value, exceptional ecological significance, exceptional recreational significance, exceptional 
water supply significance, and exceptional fisheries significance of those established Category 
One waters. These areas shall be protected as follows: 
a. ?The applicant shall preserve and maintain a special water resource protection area in 
accordance with one of the following: 
1. ?A 300-foot special water resource protection area shall be provided on each side of 
the waterway, measured perpendicular to the waterway from the top of the bank 
outwards or from the centerline of the waterway where the bank is not defined, 
consisting of existing vegetation or vegetation allowed to follow natural succession. 
2. ?Encroachment within the designated special water resource protection area under 
subsection 1. above shall only be allowed where previous development or disturbance 
has occurred (for example, active agricultural use, parking area or maintained lawn 
area). The encroachment shall only be allowed where applicant demonstrates that the 
functional value and overall condition of the special water resource protection area will 
be maintained to the maximum extent practicable. In no case shall the remaining 
special water resource protection area be reduced to less than 150 feet as measured 
perpendicular to the top of bank of the waterway or centerline of the waterway where 
the bank is undefined. All encroachments proposed under this subparagraph shall be 
subject to review and approval by the department. 
b. ?All stormwater shall be discharged outside of and flow through the special water resource 
protection area and shall comply with the standard for off-site stability in the "Standards For 
Soil Erosion and Sediment Control in New Jersey," established under the Soil Erosion and 
Sediment Control Act, NJSA. 4:24-39 et seq. 
c. ?If stormwater discharged outside of and flowing through the special water resource 
protection area cannot comply with the Standard For Off-Site Stability in the "Standards for 
Soil Erosion and Sediment Control in New Jersey," established under the Soil Erosion and 
Sediment Control Act, NJSA. 4:24-39 et seq., then the stabilization measures in 
accordance with the requirements of the above standards may be placed within the special 
water resource protection area, provided that: 
1. ?Stabilization measures shall not be placed within 150 feet of the Category One 
waterway; 
2. ?Stormwater associated with discharges allowed by this section shall achieve a 95 
percent TSS post-construction removal rate; 
3. ?Temperature shall be addressed to ensure no impact on the receiving waterway; 
4. ?The encroachment shall only be allowed where the applicant demonstrates that the 
functional value and overall condition of the special water resource protection area will 
be maintained to the maximum extent practicable; 
5. ?A conceptual project design meeting shall be held with the appropriate department 
staff and soil conservation district staff to identify necessary stabilization measures; 
and 
6. ?All encroachments proposed under this section shall be subject to review and 
approval by the department. 
d. ?Paragraph (g)(7) does not apply to the construction of one individual single-family dwelling 
that is not part of a larger development on a lot receiving preliminary or final subdivision 
approval on or before February 2, 2004, provided that the construction begins on or before 
February 2, 2009. 
e. ?All other waters in the Township of South Brunswick not classified as Category One shall 
be subject to the requirements of section 62-248, Stream corridor protection.

(2) ?The design engineer shall utilize the DelMarVa Unit Hydrograph (peak rate factor of 285) in 
agricultural watersheds in the coastal plain areas of the Township of South Brunswick, that are 
categorized by flat topography (slopes less than five percent), porous soils, low relief, and 
significant surface storage in swales and depressions, as stated in the Natural Resources 
Conservation Service New Jersey Bulletin No. NJ210-3-1. The NRCS Standard Unit 
Hydrograph should be used in all other areas where the DelMarVa Unit Hydrograph does not 
apply. 
(3) ?For the purpose of calculating runoff coefficients and groundwater recharge, there is a 
presumption that the pre-construction condition of a site or portion thereof is a wooded land use 
with good hydrologic condition. The term "runoff coefficient" applies to both the NRCS 
methodology at subsection 62-2575(a)(1)a. and the rational and modified rational methods at 
subsection 62-2575(a)(1)b. A runoff coefficient or a groundwater recharge land cover for an 
existing condition may be used on all or a portion of the site if the design engineer verifies that 
the hydrologic condition has existed on the site or portion of the site for at least five years 
without interruption prior to the time of application. If more than one land cover have existed on 
the site during the five years immediately prior to the time of application, the land cover with the 
lowest runoff potential shall be used for the computations. In addition, there is the presumption 
that the site is in good hydrologic condition (if the land use type is pasture, lawn, or park), with 
good cover (if the land use type is woods), or with good hydrologic condition and conservation 
treatment (if the land use type is cultivation). 
(4) ?In computing preconstruction stormwater runoff, the design engineer shall account for all 
significant land features and structures, such as ponds, wetlands, depressions, hedgerows, or 
culverts, that may reduce preconstruction stormwater runoff rates and volumes. 
(5) ?In computing stormwater runoff from all design storms, the design engineer shall consider the 
relative stormwater runoff rates and/or volumes of pervious and impervious surfaces separately 
to accurately compute the rates and volume of stormwater runoff from the site. To calculate 
runoff from unconnected impervious cover, urban impervious area modifications as described in 
the NRCS Technical Release 55 - Urban Hydrology for Small Watersheds and other methods 
may be employed. 
(6) ?If the invert of the outlet structure of a stormwater management measure is below the flood 
hazard design flood elevation as defined at N.J.A.C. 7:13, the design engineer shall take into 
account the effects of tailwater in the design of structural stormwater management measures. 
(b) ?Groundwater recharge may be calculated in accordance with the following: The New Jersey 
Groundwater Recharge Spreadsheet (NJGRS), a Microsoft Excel-based computer spreadsheet 
program. The NJGRS program is available for download at the NJDEP Stormwater Management 
website.

and the recorded documents as needed. 
(10) ?The person responsible for maintenance identified under subsection 62-2581(b)(3) above 
shall retain and make available, upon request by any official of the Township of South 
Brunswick having administrative, health, environmental, or safety authority over the site, the 
maintenance plan and the documentation required by subsections 62-2581(b)(8) and 62-
2581(b)(9) above. 
(c) ?Nothing in this section shall preclude the Township of South Brunswick from requiring the posting of

Sec. 62-2582. - Mitigation requirements. 
(a) ?If a proposed development requests a variance or exemption from strict compliance with the 
groundwater recharge, stormwater quantity and stormwater quality requirements outlined in section 
62-2574, the applicant must implement a mitigation project that shall be subject to approval of the 
township engineer, development review board and governing body. 
(b) ?Selection of an appropriate mitigation project for a requested variance or exemption must adhere to 
the following requirements: 
(1) ?The project must be within the same area that would contribute to the receptor impacted by the 
project. Note that depending on the specific performance standard waived, the sensitive 
receptor and/or the contributory area to that receptor may be different. If there are no specific 
sensitive receptors that would be impacted as the result of the grant of the waiver/exemption, 
then the location of the mitigation project can be located anywhere within the township, and 
should be selected to provide the most benefit relative to an existing stormwater problem in the 
same category (quality, quantity or recharge). 
(2) ?Legal authorization must be obtained to construct the project at the location selected. This 
includes the maintenance and any access needs for the project in the future. 
(3) ?The project should be close to the location of the original project, and if possible, be located 
upstream at a similar distance from the identified sensitive receptor. This distance should not be 
based on actual location, but on a similar hydraulic distance to the sensitive receptor. For 
example, if the project for which a waiver is obtained discharges to a tributary, but the closest 
location discharges to the main branch, it may be more beneficial to identify a location 
discharging to the same tributary. 
(4) ?For ease of administration, if sensitive receptors are addressed, it is preferable to have one 
location that addresses any and all of the performance standards waived, rather than one 
location for each performance standard. 
(5) ?It must be demonstrated that implementation of the mitigation project will result in no adverse 
impacts to other properties. 
(6) ?Mitigation projects that address stormwater runoff quantity can provide storage for proposed 
increases in runoff volume, as opposed to a direct peak flow reduction. 
(c) ?The following information shall be required for each request for a variance or exemption from the 
aforementioned performance standards: 
(1) ?Impact from noncompliance. Provide a table quantifying what would be required for the project 
to achieve the standards, the extent to which this value will be achieved on site and the extent 
to which the value must be mitigated off site. 
(2) ?Narrative and supporting information regarding the need for the waiver including: 
a. ?The waiver cannot be due to a condition created by the applicant. If the applicant can 
comply with the design and performance standards outlined in section 62-2574 through a 
reduction in the scope of the project, the applicant has created the condition and a waiver 
cannot be issued. Demonstrate that the need for a waiver is not created by the applicant. 
b. ?Provide a discussion and supporting documentation of the site conditions peculiar to the 
subject property that prevent the construction of a stormwater management facility that 
would achieve full compliance with the design and performance standards. Site conditions 
may include soil type, the presence of karst geology, acid soils, a high groundwater table, 
unique conditions that would create an unsafe design, as well as conditions that may 
provide a detrimental impact to public health, welfare and safety. 
c. ?Demonstration that the grant of the requested waiver/exemption would not result in an 
adverse impact that would not be compensated for by off site mitigation. 
(3) ?Sensitive receptor: Identify the sensitive receptor(s) related to the performance standard from 
which a waiver is sought. Demonstrate that the mitigation site contributes to the same sensitive 
receptor. 
(4) ?Design of the mitigation project: Provide the design details of the mitigation project. This 
includes, but is not limited to, drawings, calculations and other information needed to evaluate 
the mitigation project. 
(5) ?Responsible party: List the party or parties responsible for the construction and the 
maintenance of the mitigation project. Documentation must be provided to demonstrate that the 
responsible party is aware of, has authority to, and accepts the responsibility for construction 
and maintenance. Under no circumstance shall the responsible party be an individual single-
family homeowner. Selection of a project location that is under township authority avoids the 
need to obtain authority from a third party for the construction and future maintenance of the 
project. 
(6) ?Maintenance: Include a maintenance plan that addresses the maintenance criteria at N.J.A.C. 
7:8-5.8. In addition, if the maintenance responsibility is being transferred to the township or 
another entity, the entity responsible for the cost of the maintenance must be identified. The 
township may provide the option for the applicant to convey the mitigation project to the 
township, if the applicant provides for the cost of maintenance in perpetuity. 
(7) ?Permits: Any and all necessary local, state or other applicable permits for the mitigation 
measure or project must be obtained prior to the Township approval of the project for which 
mitigation is being provided. 
(8) ?Construction: Demonstrate that the construction of the mitigation project coincides with the 
construction of the proposed project. A certificate of occupancy or final approval by the township 
for the project requiring mitigation cannot be issued until the mitigation project or measure 
receives final approval.

and maintain all public and private streets, roads and highways, where feasible, to meet the needs of all 
users, including enabling safe access and mobility of pedestrians, bicyclists, transit vehicle users and 
motorists of all ages and abilities. 
(Ord. No. 2015-5 , § I, 4-14-2015) 


Sec. 62-2797. - Definition. 
    "Complete street" is defined as a means to provide safe access for all users by designing and 
operating a comprehensive, integrated, connected, multi-modal network of transportation options. 
(Ord. No. 2015-5 , § I, 4-14-2015) 


Sec. 62-2798. - Policy. 
    All public and private street, road and highway projects, both new construction and reconstruction 
(excluding maintenance) shall be designed and constructed following these "Complete streets" 
requirements in order to safely accommodate travel by pedestrians, bicyclists, public transit, and 
motorized vehicles and their passengers, with special priority given to pedestrian safety: 
(1) ?Create a comprehensive, integrated, connected, multi-modal network of streets, roads and 
highways by providing proper connections to bicycling and walking trip generators, such as 
employment, education, residential, recreational and public facilities, as well as retail and transit 
facilities. 
(2) ?Provide safe and accessible accommodations for existing and future pedestrian, bicycle and 
transit facilities. 
(3) ?Establish a procedure for the township to evaluate transportation projects and site plan reviews 
for complete streets inclusion according to length of project, local community support, 
environmental constraints, right-of-way limitations, funding resources and bicycle and/or 
pedestrian compatibility. 
(4) ?Transportation facilities shall be designed and constructed as long term investments and shall 
anticipate likely future demand for bicycling and walking facilities and not preclude the provision 
of future improvements. 
(5) ?Designs shall address the need for bicyclists and pedestrians to cross corridors. Even where 
bicyclists and pedestrians may not commonly use a particular travel corridor that is being 
constructed or improved, they need to be able to cross the corridor safely. The design of 
intersections and bridges shall accommodate bicyclists and pedestrians in a manner that is 
accessible and safe. 
(6) ?Design bicycle and pedestrian facilities to the best standards currently available, including 
practices contained in the New Jersey Roadway Design Manual, the AASHTO Guide for the 
Development of Bicycle Facilities, the AASHTO Guide for the Planning, Design and Operation 
of Pedestrian Facilities, the Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices and others as related. 
(7) ?Bicycle improvements on private and public local, county and state roadways shall be 
compatible, to the extent possible, with the then current South Brunswick Bikeways Plan Map 
contained in the Open Space and Recreation Plan Element of the township master plan. 
(8) ?Provisions shall be made for pedestrians and bicyclists when closing streets, roads, highways, 
bridges or sidewalks for construction projects as outlined in NJDOT Policy #705—
Accommodating Pedestrian and Bicycle Traffic During Construction. 
(9) ?Improvements shall also consider connections for safe routes to schools, safe routes to transit, 
trail crossings and areas or population groups with limited transportation options. 
(10) ?Improvements shall comply with Title VII Environmental Justice, Americans with Disabilities 
Act (ADA) and complement the context of the surrounding community.

    A request for an exemption from the requirements of this Complete Streets Policy shall be presented 
in writing to the township council, which shall have the final decision on such requests. Any such request 
shall be documented with supporting data that indicates the reason for the requested exemption. 
Exemptions are limited to the following conditions: 
(1) ?Pedestrian and bicycle facilities shall not be required where they are prohibited by law, such as 
where non-motorized users are prohibited on the roadway. 
(2) ?Public transit facilities shall not be required on streets not serving as transit routes and the 
desirability of transit facilities will be determined on a project specific basis. 
(3) ?There is insufficient space in an existing right-of way to design a complete street. 
(4) ?There is a scarcity of population, travel and attractors, both existing and future, indicating an 
absence of need for such accommodations. 
(5) ?The cost of pedestrian, public transit, and/or bicycle facilities cause an increase in project costs 
in excess of five percent, as determined by engineering estimates, that would have to be funded 
with local tax dollars, unless specifically approved by the township council. 
(6) ?Significant adverse environmental or social impacts outweigh the positive effects of the 
infrastructure improvements required to comply with this Complete Streets Policy. 
(7) ?The safety or timing of a project is compromised by following the requirements of this Complete 
Streets Policy. 
(8) ?An exemption request for reasons other than those listed above must be documented with 
supporting data, must be reviewed by the township engineer and be approved by the township 
council.

ARTICLE XV. - REZONING OF PROPERTY REQUESTS 


Sec. 62-2901. - Purpose. 
    While not specifically required under the Municipal Land Use Law, the township has determined that 
a procedure should be established whereby an applicant may apply through proper township channels for 
the rezoning of property. By the standards hereinafter established, an applicant is required to submit 
documentary evidence and proofs which show the appropriateness of rezoning. Rezoning is a legislative 
act left to the sole discretion of the township council; the township, however, has established this 
procedure whereby the township council may obtain sufficient information in order to make a proper and 
legal determination on the request. An applicant desiring to have the township council rezone certain 
property within the community shall file an application for rezoning with the township manager, which 
shall be processed and considered pursuant to the provisions of this article. The township council shall 
not consider an application for rezoning unless and until compliance with the substantive and procedural 
requirements of this article are fulfilled. 
(Ord. No. 2008-13, § II, 3-11-2008) 


Sec. 62-2902. - Application; form; contents; fees.

(4) ?A brief narrative statement concerning whether and how the proposed amendment or alteration 
will further any of the purposes sought to be advanced under the Municipal Land Use Law, 
N.J.S.A. 40:55D-2. 
(5) ?A brief narrative statement concerning: 
a. ?Whether and how the proposed amendment or alteration promotes the general health, 
safety and welfare of the community or the region of which it is a part; and 
b. ?Why the purposes sought to be advanced by the amendment or alteration would not be 
addressed in a statutorily recognized application for development. 
(6) ?The address, block and lot description, size, dimensions and current zoning district designation 
of the property in question.

physical features.

any regional or indigenous need for low- to moderate-income housing, how this need was 
determined and what the extent of this need is.

restricted areas. 
(11) ?Utilizing the property survey and any restrictions to development, project the maximum build 
out for the site for each permitted use under the existing as well as the proposed zoning.

(b) ?If the proposed amendment is in contemplation of specific development, the application shall be 
accompanied by a concept plan conforming, at a minimum, with the data required in this chapter for 
a minor site plan/subdivision. The plan shall not be deemed to bind either the applicant or the 
township on any subsequent development application, but is required merely to demonstrate the 
feasibility of the proposed development in accordance with the requested amendment or alteration 
and the impact which such development will have on adjacent properties, the zoning district in issue 
and the goals, objectives, policies and assumptions set forth in the township's master plan. 
(c) ?A complete application for rezoning shall consist of 25 copies of a properly completed application for

by the planning board within 35 days of referral. The applicant, at all times, shall bear the burden of

involved. The planning board may require correction of any information found to be in error or 
submission of additional information not specified in this article or in any revisions in the 
accompanying documents as are necessary to make an informed decision as to whether the 
requirements necessary for recommendation to the township council for rezoning have been met. 
(b) ?Report. Subsequent to action by the planning board, a written recommendation by the planning 
board shall be forwarded to the township manager, with a brief statement concerning whether the 
township council should or should not grant the application for rezoning. 
(Ord. No. 2008-13, § II, 3-11-2008) 


Sec. 62-2904. - Review standards. 
    Each application for rezoning shall specifically address and meet the burdens established by the 
following standards: 
(1) ?Necessity. No application for rezoning shall be granted where it is determined that an existing 
method for development exists whereby the applicant could obtain the relief sought without the 
necessity of a rezoning. 
(2) ?Master plan. No application for rezoning shall be granted which substantially disrupts the 
findings and conclusions addressed within the master plan, unless the planning board 
determines that it is in the best interest of the township to amend the master plan based on 
changed circumstances which challenge the principles upon which the master plan was based. 
(3) ?Benefit to township. The applicant shall demonstrate that the proposed rezoning will 
substantially benefit the township and the goals to be achieved by proper planning, and will not 
unduly burden the planned and orderly growth of the township or place an undue exaction upon 
the township facilities required to service the area. The planning board shall have the option to 
recommend, and the township council may require, an applicant to enter into a developer's 
agreement addressing extraordinary off-site, off-tract impacts that would be implicated by a 
proposed rezoning with respect to specific development for which a concept plan is required 
pursuant to this article. 
(4) ?Advancement of regulatory purposes. No application for rezoning shall be granted unless it 
addresses and advances one or more of the purposes sought to be advanced within the 
Municipal Land Use Law, N.J.S.A. 40:55D-2. 
(5) ?Regional need. No application for rezoning shall be granted if it is determined that it would 
frustrate or impede the township's efforts to provide and implement its required share of low- to 
moderate-income housing within the township. 
(6) ?General standards. No application for rezoning shall be granted unless it is determined that it 
promotes the general health, safety and welfare concerns of the township. 
(Ord. No. 2008-13, § II, 3-11-2008) 


Sec. 62-2905. - Action by township council. 
(a) ?Receipt of report. Subsequent to receipt of the planning board's report, the township manager will 
cause the application for rezoning to be placed on an agenda of the township council. 
(b) ?Hearing procedure. At the township council meeting scheduled as set forth in subsection (a) above, 
the township council shall review the application for rezoning, any accompanying documents in 
support of or against the application, and the report of the planning board. 
(c) ?Determination. At the conclusion of its review of the application, the township council shall make a 
decision as to whether it will grant or deny, in whole or in part, the application for rezoning. If the 
township council agrees that affirmative action should be taken on the application for rezoning, it 
shall authorize the preparation of a zoning ordinance amendment which addresses the request by 
the application for rezoning. Such an amendment may be consistent with, contrary to or a 
modification of the recommendations of the planning board and/or the applicant's request for a 
rezoning.

ARTICLE V. - RENT CONTROL 


Sec. 78-211. - Applicability.

the township. 
(Code 1988, § 220-1) 


Sec. 78-212. - Definitions. 
    The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this article, shall have the meanings ascribed 
to them in this section, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning: 
    Base rent means the total rent charged, less real estate taxes, space fees, parking fees, capital 
improvement surcharges and other adjustments and surcharges allowable by this article. 
    Capital improvement means and includes the creation, development, construction or replacement of 
a significant component of the rental property or equipment reasonably necessary to the efficient 
operation and/or management of the rental facility: (i) which is deemed depreciable under the Internal 
Revenue Code; (ii) which is for the operation or preservation of the structure or park; and (iii) which usage 
or benefit is intended for the general tenancy of the rental facility. By way of illustration, a capital 
improvement may include the following or a portion thereof but shall not be limited to the renovation or 
replacement of existing roads, parking lots, curbs, sidewalks, water and sewer lines, HVAC systems 
and/or components; resurfacing of exterior building walls; roof replacement; rewiring of an entire building; 
renovation or modernization of all bathrooms or kitchens in a building; replacement of all windows in a 
building; and installation or upgrading of elevators. 
    Dwelling unit means that space actually rented or offered for rent for living purposes, including but 
not necessarily limited to an apartment, condominium unit or mobile home space. 
    Fair net operating margin means the net operating margin of the rental premises which shall be 
deemed unfair if it is less than 40.00 percent of the gross annual income of the rental premises. The 
landlord shall be entitled to a rent increase sufficient to produce a fair net operating margin of 40.00 
percent of gross annual income. 
    Gross annual income means all income resulting directly or indirectly from the rental operation of the 
property or building including income which could have resulted from residential vacancies, unless such 
vacancies resulted from market conditions. In addition, it includes but is not limited to all rent, whether 
from residential or nonresidential transactions received or collectible, including any rent from a less-than-
arms-length transaction; the landlord's share of interest for administrative expenses on security deposits; 
all earnings from commissions, laundry equipment and supplies and vending machines; earnings from the 
sale of fuel oil, gas, LP fuel or electricity; deductions from security deposits; entrance fees, hookup fees, 
late fees, pet fees, parking fees, garage fees, key charges, finder's fees and charges for the use of 
recreational areas; amounts received from successful real estate tax appeals; income from rebates, tax 
surcharges, capital improvement surcharges, rent surcharges and hardship surcharges for the year 
immediately prior to the date the application is filed, computed on an annual basis. Where a residential 
rental unit is occupied in whole or in part rent free, the full rental value of the unit shall be considered and 
included. All income, as defined, shall be computed on an annual, calendar-year basis. 
    Landlord means an owner, lessor, sublessor, receiver, trustee, executor, assignee or other person 
receiving or entitled to receive rent for the use or occupancy of the whole or part of a housing space. 
    Net operating margin means, for the purposes of a rent control board hearing, the amount by which 
gross annual income exceeds annual operating expenses on the date the hardship petition is filed, 
computed on an annual basis during the test year. The test year means the most recent calendar or fiscal 
year, if a landlord brings a petition within three months of the end of either. Otherwise, a landlord must 
petition for a hardship increase which includes the most recent 12 consecutive months. The 12-month 
period shall not end earlier than the 30 days before an application is filed. 
    Reasonable and necessary operating expenses means all expenses, calculated on an accrual basis, 
actually paid by a landlord for a residential rental property during the comparable period used for the 
gross annual income, which expenses are reasonable and necessary for the operation and maintenance 
of the residential rental property, subject to the provisions and limitations of section 78-217. Real estate 
taxes and water and sewer charges may be included as expenses and must be paid in full as of the date 
of the application, unless good cause for nonpayment is shown. Reasonable and necessary operating 
expenses shall also include supplies; administrative costs; advertising; legal and auditing fees; dues to 
professional organizations; telephone services; office expenses; management fees; heating fuel; 
electricity; water; sewage disposal; building services; security; grounds maintenance; repairs; painting

theft or boiler explosion, except Federal Housing Administration, Veterans' Administration or other 
mortgage insurance; payroll; and wages and recreational amenities, but shall exclude depreciation, 
mortgage interest except as otherwise provided, and amortization. Penalties, fines or interest payments 
shall not be included. 
    Residential rental property means any building or structure, such as a house, building, apartment, 
mobile home or land in a mobile home park, rented or offered for living or dwelling purposes, together 
with all privileges, services, furnishings, furniture, equipment facilities and improvements connected with 
the use or occupancy of such property, except as exempt under section 78-213. 
    Tenant means a lessee, assignee, sublessee, licensee or other person entitled to the possession or 
to the use and occupancy of the whole or part of any residential rental property. 
(Code 1988, § 220-2; Ord. No. 72-96, § 1, 12-17-1996; Ord. No. 5-97, § 1, 3-18-1997)

mail, return receipt requested, or by personal delivery, with an affidavit of service to the board, ask

as determined by the board until such time as the landlord proves to the board that the deficiency 
has been corrected, and such payment shall constitute fulfillment of the tenant's payment obligation 
during that time. Where a reduction in rent has been ordered for a past deficiency, the tenant shall

be found by the board, until the total credit has been exhausted.

(a) ?The permittee under this article shall, at all times and at his own expense, preserve and protect from 
injury any adjoining property by providing proper foundations and taking other measures suitable for 
the purpose. Where, in the protection of such property, it is necessary to enter upon private property 
for the purpose of taking appropriate protective measures, the permittee shall obtain written 
permission from the owner of the private property for that purpose. 
(b) ?The permittee shall, at his own expense, shore up and protect all buildings, walls, fences or other 
property likely to be damaged during the progress of the excavation work and shall be responsible 
for all damage to public or private property or highways resulting from his failure to properly protect 
and carry out the work. 
(c) ?Whenever it may be necessary for the permittee to trench through any lawn area, the permittee shall 
comply with section 98-50(a)(4). All construction and maintenance work shall be done in a manner 
calculated to leave the lawn area clean of earth and debris and in a condition as nearly as possible 
to that which existed before the work began. 
(d) ?Where utility installations require services of existing users to be interrupted, the utility company 
shall notify the users of the periods of time when the services will not be available. This notice shall 
be given at least 24 hours prior to the interruption of service, except in an emergency. 
(e) ?Where the permittee or utility company will perform any work behind the curb line, either within the 
township right-of-way or on private property, the permittee or utility company shall provide written 
notice to the property owner at least 24 hours prior to beginning the work, except in an emergency.

railed on each side so that foot passengers can pass over safely at all times. 
(Code 1988, § 225-14) 


Sec. 98-40. - Barriers and lighting. 
    The permittee under this article shall erect such fence, railing or barriers about the site of the 
excavation work as shall prevent danger to persons using the township streets or sidewalks. These 
protective barriers shall be maintained until the work shall be completed or the danger removed. At 
twilight, there shall be placed upon the place of excavation and upon any excavated materials, structures 
or other obstructions to streets, suitable and sufficient lights which shall be kept burning throughout the 
night during the maintenance of the obstructions. It shall be unlawful for anyone to remove, tear down the 
fence, railing or other protective barriers or any lights provided for the protection of the public. 
(Code 1988, § 225-15) 


Sec. 98-41. - Attractive nuisance.

    All material excavated from trenches and piled adjacent to the trench or in any street shall be piled 
and maintained in such manner as not to endanger those working in the trench or pedestrians or users of 
the streets and so that as little inconvenience as possible is caused to those using streets and adjoining 
property. Where the confines of the area being excavated are too narrow to permit the piling of excavated 
material beside the trench, such as might be the case in a narrow alley, the director of public works 
and/or the township engineer shall have the authority to require that the permittee haul the excavated 
material to a storage site and then rehaul it to the trench site at the time of backfilling. It shall be the 
permittee's responsibility to secure the necessary permission and make all necessary arrangements for 
all required storage and disposal sites. 
(Code 1988, § 225-17; Ord. No. 2015-41 , § I, 11-24-2015)

fails to furnish the necessary labor and materials for these repairs, the director of public works and/or 
township engineer shall have the authority to cause the necessary labor and materials to be furnished by 
the township or its contractor. Such cost shall be charged against the permittee, and the permittee shall 
also be liable on his bond therefor. 
(Code 1988, § 225-18; Ord. No. 2015-41 , § I, 11-24-2015) 


Sec. 98-44. - Easements. 
    Before undertaking work in the township pursuant to this article, any person desiring to excavate 
trenches shall file right-of-way easement maps or alignment sheets with the director of public works. It 
shall be the responsibility of any person undertaking any excavation in a public or private right-of-way in 
the township to confine all of his work within the right-of-way. However, nothing in this section shall be 
construed to prevent the person undertaking the excavation from reaching a private agreement with an 
adjacent property owner for additional work space and utilizing this space. Where any person undertakes 
any excavation in a public or private right-of-way in a developed residential area of the township, he shall 
place adequate fencing within the right-of-way prior to the starting of any excavation to prevent any 
person from having access to the excavation area thus fenced. 
(Code 1988, § 225-19; Ord. No. 2015-41 , § I, 11-24-2015) 


Sec. 98-45. - Cleanup operations. 
    As the excavation work progresses pursuant to this article, all streets and private properties shall be 
thoroughly cleaned of all rubbish, excess earth, rock and other debris remaining from the work. All 
cleanup operations at the location of the excavation shall be accomplished at the expense of the 
permittee and shall be completed to the satisfaction of the township. The director of public works and/or 
township engineer may order at any time, and in any event immediately after completion of the work, the 
permittee, at his own expense, to clean up and to remove all refuse and unused materials resulting from 
the work. Upon failure to do so within 24 hours after having been notified to do so, weather permitting, 
and the absence of any other unnatural hardship which prevents immediate compliance, the work may be 
done by or at the direction of the township. The township shall reimburse itself from the cash deposit, and 
the cost thereof shall be charged to the permittee. The permittee shall also be liable for the cost under the 
surety bond provided. 
(Code 1988, § 225-20; Ord. No. 2015-41 , § I, 11-24-2015) 


Sec. 98-46. - Protection of watercourses. 
    The permittee under this article shall provide for the flow of all watercourses, sewers or drains 
intercepted during the excavation work and shall replace them in as good condition as he found them or 
shall make such provisions for them as the township may direct. The permittee shall not obstruct the 
gutter of any street but shall use all proper measures to provide for the free passage of surface water. 
The permittee shall make provision to take care of all surplus water, muck, silt, slickings or other runoff 
pumped from excavations or resulting from sluicing or other operations and shall be responsible for any 
damage resulting from his failure to so provide. 
(Code 1988, § 225-21; Ord. No. 2015-41 , § I, 11-24-2015) 


Sec. 98-47. - Breaking through pavement. 
    Whenever it is necessary to break through existing pavement for excavation purposes and where 
trenches are to be four feet or over, pavement in the base shall be removed to at least six inches beyond 
the outer limits of the subgrade that is to be disturbed in order to prevent settlement, and a six-inch 
shoulder of undisturbed material shall be provided on each side of the excavated trench. The face of the 
remaining pavement shall be approximately vertical. A power-driven concrete saw shall be used to permit 
complete breakage of concrete pavement without ragged edges. Asphalt paving shall be scored or 
otherwise cut in a straight line. 
(Code 1988, § 225-22) 


Sec. 98-48. - Tunnels. 
    Tunnels or boring under pavement shall be permitted except when, in the discretion of the township, 
the tunnel or boring would endanger public safety. 
(Code 1988, § 225-23; Ord. No. 2015-41 , § I, 11-24-2015) 


Sec. 98-49. - Backfilling. 
(a) ?Compaction; use of fire hydrants for water settling. Backfilling in any street opened or excavated 
pursuant to an excavation permit issued under this article shall be compacted to a degree equivalent 
to that of the undisturbed ground in which the trench was dug. Compacting shall be done by 
mechanical tappers or vibrators, by relining in layers or by water settling as required by the soil in 
question and sound engineering practices recognized in the construction industry. The decision as to 
whether a trench shall be backfilled by water settling shall be at the township's discretion, based 
upon such engineering practices. When water is taken from a fire hydrant, the permittee shall assign 
one person to operate the hydrant and shall make certain that the person has been instructed by the 
township utilities department in the operation of the hydrant. The township utilities department shall 
likewise be notified at both the beginning and end of the job so that the condition of the fire hydrants 
can be checked on both occasions. Any damage done to the hydrant during the excavation shall be 
the responsibility of the permittee. Water shall be paid for by the permittee on the terms agreed upon 
with the township utilities department. 
(b) ?Backfilling by water settling. When backfilling is done by water settling, excavated materials above 
utility installations shall be deposited uniformly in layers of not more than five feet in thickness and 
shall be thoroughly flooded. During the flooding, the water shall be allowed to flow slowly to the 
trench from high points and shall be worked down to the full depth of the layer of backfill with bars. 
All bars used shall be long enough to extend entirely through the layer being filled and shall be 
forced down through the loose backfill material. As the bars are withdrawn, the water shall be 
allowed to flow downward around the bar. The channel or hole formed by the bar shall be kept open 
and the water kept running into it until the fill has settled. All work shall be done in such manner as to 
obtain a relative compaction through the entire depth of the backfill of not less than that existing 
adjacent to the excavation. 
(c) ?Dry backfilling. Backfilling up to the first 18 inches above the top of the utility pipes or similar 
installations shall be done with thin layers. Each layer is to be tamped by manual or mechanical 
means. Layers that are hand tamped shall not exceed four inches in thickness. Layers that are 
power tamped shall not exceed six inches in thickness, except as determined by the township. All 
remaining backfill located in the roadway and shoulder areas shall be compacted in a maximum of 
12-inch layers with a mechanical tamper. Backfilling of all pipes of over 24 inches in diameter shall 
be carried up to the spring line of the pipe in three-inch layers, with each layer moistened and 
thoroughly tamped with suitable mechanical equipment. The backfill around all pipes 24 inches or 
less in diameter shall be flooded or tamped as specified in this subsection, to a depth of 18 inches 
above the top of the pipe before any additional backfilling is placed thereon. 
(d) ?Backfill material. Wherever any excavation for the laying of pipe is made through rock, the pipe shall 
be laid six inches above the rock bottom of the trench and the space under, around and six inches 
above the pipe shall be backfilled with bank run gravel or approved material of equal quality. All 
material not suitable for backfill material, determined as such by the township, shall be removed from 
the work site by the permittee. Select fill required in place of unsuitable backfill material shall be bank 
run gravel, three-fourths-inch road stone or an approved material of equal quality. The regulations 
set forth in this subsection shall not apply if in conflict with either state or federal laws or regulations. 
(e) ?Backfilling at surface. Backfilling material shall be brought to the grade of the required temporary 
pavement placement. In lawn areas, the temporary surface shall be graded to meet the adjacent 
level of the ground surface, or if, in the opinion of the township, settlement of the excavated surface 
can be expected, the contractor or permittee shall place a mound of topsoil sufficient to compensate 
for the calculated settlement, according to the estimates of the township, above the excavations. 
(Code 1988, § 225-24; Ord. No. 2015-41 , § I, 11-24-2015) 


Sec. 98-50. - Restoration of surface. 
(a) ?Responsibility of permittee. The permittee under this article shall restore the surface of all streets, 
roads, shoulder areas and lawn areas that are broken into or damaged as a result of the excavation 
work to their original condition in accordance with the following specifications: 
(1) ?Pavement areas. The following shall apply: 
a. ?Temporary restoration. The permittee shall immediately upon backfilling and compaction of 
the trench place a two-inch layer of FABC-1 bituminous stabilized base course or 
equivalent. If conditions warrant, in the opinion of the township , the permittee shall place 
four inches of 1½-inch road stone as a base material prior to placing the bituminous 
stabilized base or equivalent. The permittee shall maintain the condition and grade of the 
temporary pavement at all times until the placing of permanent paving. The temporary 
pavement shall remain in place approximately three months or as directed by the township. 
b. ?Permanent restoration. The temporary pavement shall be removed to the depth of 
approximately eight inches below the adjacent road surface. All edges should be trimmed 
as required prior to placing the permanent pavement. All surfaces of existing pavements, 
casings and structures should be tack coated with an asphalt oil. The permittee shall then 
place six inches of bituminous stabilized base course in one layer, compacting the material 
to a grade of two inches below the adjacent roadway. The permittee shall then place two 
inches of SM-1 surface course to the level of the adjacent pavement. 
(2) ?Shoulder restoration. The permittee shall immediately upon backfilling and compaction of the 
trench place an eight-inch layer of 1½-inch road stone to the level of the existing shoulder 
surface. The trench shall be maintained and kept to the existing shoulder grade by the addition 
of road stone as required. 
(3) ?Driveway openings. The permittee shall replace all driveways under the requirements of 
pavement or shoulder restoration specifications, depending upon the type of the original 
pavement. 
(4) ?Lawn areas. The permittee shall sod or seed as directed by the township all lawn areas 
disturbed during the construction operation. 
(b) ?Incomplete or defective work. Acceptance or approval of any excavation work by the township shall 
not prevent the township from asserting a claim against the permittee and his surety under the 
required surety bond for incomplete or defective work if discovered within 24 months from the 
completion of the excavation work. The presence of any township employee or consultant during the 
performance of any excavation work shall not relieve the permittee of his responsibilities.

Sec. 98-51. - Restoration by township; responsibility for maintenance. 
(a) ?If the permittee under this article shall have failed to restore the surface of the street or other 
disturbed area to its proper condition upon the expiration of the time fixed by the permit or shall 
otherwise have failed to complete the excavation work covered by the permit, the township shall 
have the right to direct completion of all work and things necessary to restore the street or other 
disturbed areas and to otherwise complete the excavation work. 
(b) ?The permittee shall be liable for the actual cost thereof and an additional 25 percent of the cost in 
addition for general overhead and administrative expenses. The township shall have a cause of 
action for all fees, expenses and amounts paid out and due it for the work and shall apply in payment 
of the amount due it any funds of the permittee deposited as provided in this article, and the 
township shall also enforce its rights under the permittee's surety bond provided pursuant to this 
article. 
(c) ?It shall be the duty of the permittee to guarantee and maintain the site of the excavation work in the 
same condition it was prior to the excavation for two years after restoring it to its original condition. 
(Code 1988, § 225-26; Ord. No. 2015-41 , § I, 11-24-2015) 


Sec. 98-52. - Open trenches. 
    The following shall apply to open trenches: 
(1) ?Total distance. Except by special permission of the township, no trench in streets shall be 
excavated further in advance of pipelaying nor left unfilled where pipe has been laid more than 
a total distance of 200 feet. 
(2) ?Time left open. No trench for pipelaying in streets or elsewhere shall be kept open longer than 
reasonably necessary for the completion of pipelaying and backfilling. If, in the judgment of the 
township, the trench is left open for such an unreasonable length of time as to constitute a 
safety hazard, the trench shall be refilled by the township at the expense of the person 
responsible for the trench upon two working days' notice in writing having been given to such 
person. 
(Code 1988, § 225-27; Ord. No. 2015-41 , § I, 11-24-2015)

covered by the excavation permit and shall promptly complete this work and restore the street to its 
original condition, or as near as may be, as soon as practicable and in any event not later than the date 
specified in the excavation permit. In the event that the permitee does not complete the work by the 
completion date specified in the permit, then a new application must be filed requesting an extension of 
the time beyond the date specified for completion of the work. For each day beyond the expiration date of 
the permit that the excavation in the street is not completed and restored to its original condition, the 
permittee shall be assessed the following penalties: 
(1) ?Days 1—3: $250.00 per day; 
(2) ?Days 4—7: $500.00 per day; 
(3) ?Days 8—10: $750.00 per day;

fraction thereof. 
b. ?Simultaneous construction/alteration. When sidewalks, curbs, curb cutouts, driveways or 
streets are to be constructed/altered simultaneously, only one permit fee shall be required. 
c. ?Inspection fee. If the estimated cost of the alteration or construction is less than $1,000.00, 
there shall be no inspection fee. On all alterations and construction, the estimated cost of 
which exceeds $1,000.00, the township shall charge a fee for all inspection services done 
in behalf of an applicant or permittee. The inspection fee shall be computed from a 
schedule of charges based upon anticipated actual costs. This schedule shall be posted for 
public inspection in the office of the department of public works. 
(2) ?Surety bonds. The following surety bonds shall accompany an application for a 
construction/alteration permit: 
a. ?Construction and maintenance . When the estimated cost of the project exceeds 
$1,500.00, a maintenance and construction bond shall be filed with the application for a 
permit in an amount equal to the estimated cost of the project and conditioned that such 
work shall be done in accordance with the township's standard specifications. Once the 
project has been completed and inspected to the satisfaction of the township, the bond will 
be released unless the project involved a disturbance of roadway pavement, in which case 
the bond shall be held by the township for a period of 12 months after satisfactory 
completion and inspection. 
b. ?Failure of compliance by permittee. When a permittee shall be in default or shall fail to 
comply with the requirements of this article, the director of public works may order the 
completion of the work by the township or its contractor and shall recover all costs related 
thereto from the permittee as permitted by law. 
c. ?Indemnity. The director of public works shall have the authority to require an applicant to 
file a bond conditioned to protect and save harmless the township from all claims for 
damages to property or injury to persons by reason of the construction/alteration work. 
(b) ?Excavation permits. Fees, bonds and cash deposits for excavation permits shall be as follows:

b. ?All inspection fees for excavation work with a cost above $500.00 are to be estimated by 
the director of public works, based upon anticipated actual costs. This schedule shall be 
posted for public inspection in the office of the department of public works. Upon 
notification of such estimates, the applicant shall deposit the fees with the township 
treasurer to be held in escrow by the township until all work is completed. The township 
treasurer will notify the department of public works upon receipt of the fees. Any balance 
remaining after all work is completed is to be returned to the permittee after actual 
inspection fees are deducted. If at any time the deposited inspection fees are deemed to 
be inadequate, the permittee shall be given 48 hours to replace the fees in the escrow 
account in the amount deemed necessary by the director of public works. If the appropriate 
amount is not deposited with the township treasurer within 48 hours of notification, all 
inspections and/or review of the work shall be suspended pending receipt of the required 
funds. 
(2) ?Excavation permit fees. A permit fee shall be charged by the township for the issuance of an 
excavation permit which shall be in addition to all other fees for permits or charges relative to 
any proposed construction work. The excavation permit fee shall be $10.00 and shall 
accompany the written application for the excavation permit. 
(3) ?Surety bond. Before an excavation permit is issued, the applicant shall deposit with the 
township clerk a surety bond in the amount of a minimum of $10,000.00, payable to the 
township, unless the cost of the construction is estimated to be less than $250.00 in value. In 
such case, the director of public works may waive the surety bond requirement if, in his opinion, 
it is unnecessary. The required surety bond must be: 
a. ?With good and sufficient surety; 
b. ?By a surety company authorized to transact business in the state; 
c. ?Satisfactory to the township attorney in form and substance; and 
d. ?Conditioned upon the permittee's compliance with this article and to secure and hold the 
township and its officers harmless against any and all claims, judgments or other costs 
arising from the excavation and other work covered by the excavation permit or for which 
the township, the township council or any township officer may be made liable by reason of 
any accident or injury to persons or property through the fault of the permittee, either in not 
properly guarding the excavation or for any other damage or injury resulting from the 
negligence of the permittee, and further conditioned to fill up, restore and place in good 
and safe condition as near as may be to its original condition and to the satisfaction of the 
township all openings and excavations made in streets and to maintain any street where 
the excavation is made in as good condition for the period of 24 months after the work shall 
have been done, usual wear and tear excepted, as it was in before the work shall have 
been done. Any settlement of the surface within the two-year period shall be deemed 
conclusive evidence of defective backfilling by the permittee. 
Nothing contained in this subsection shall be construed to require the permittee to maintain any 
repairs to pavement made by the township if such repairs should prove defective. Any owner of 
real estate repairing or engaging another to repair his own sidewalk shall not be required to give 
this bond. Recovery on this bond for any injury or accident shall not exhaust the bond, but it 
shall in its entirety cover any or all future accidents or injuries during the excavation work for 
which it is given. If any suit or claim is made against the township by reason of the negligence 
or default of the permittee, upon the township's giving written notice by certified mail, return 
receipt requested, to the permittee of the suit or claim, any final judgment against the township 
requiring it to pay for such damage shall be conclusive upon the permittee and his surety. A 
bond may be given under this provision, which shall remain in force for two years, conditioned 
as provided in this subsection in the amount above and in other respects specified, but 
applicable as to all excavation work in the streets by the principal in the bond during the term of 
two years from the given date. 
(4) ?Cash deposits. The application for an excavation permit shall be accompanied by a separate 
cash deposit in addition to all of the other fees made payable to the township for deposit with 
the township treasurer as follows: a sum equal to $6.00 per square yard of surface of each 
excavation to be made in streets which have been paved; $3.00 per square yard of shoulder 
opening; $9.00 per square yard for sidewalks; $2.00 per square yard for lawn area opening; and 
$4.00 per linear foot for curb replacement. No deposit shall be less than $100.00. Any person 
intending to make openings, cuts or excavations in streets may make and maintain with the 
township treasurer a general deposit in the sum of $1,000.00, and the person so depositing it 
shall not be required to make the special deposits provided in this subsection. However, if the 
cost of the excavation work shall exceed $1,000.00, he shall be required to adhere to the 
standards as set forth in this subsection, and the persons making a general deposit shall also 
be required to comply with all other applicable provisions of this section. If the permittee fails to 
make the necessary repairs or to complete the proper refilling of the opening and the excavation 
work, under the excavation permit, any special or general deposit shall serve as security for the 
repair and performance of work necessary to put the street in as good a condition as it was prior 
to the excavation. Upon the permittee's completion of the work covered by the permit in 
conformity with this section, as determined by the township, two-thirds of the cash deposit, 
except for a general deposit, shall be promptly refunded by the township to the permittee; 
provided, however, that the township shall retain a minimum of $100.00, and the balance shall 
be refunded by the township to the permittee upon the expiration of the 24-month period 
following the completion of the excavation work and provided, further, that the township may 
use any or all of the deposit to pay the cost of any work the township performs to restore or 
maintain the street as provided if the amount refunded to the permittee shall be reduced by the 
amount thus expended by the township.

DIVISION 2. - TRAFFIC CONTROL FOR STREET AND HIGHWAY CONSTRUCTION AND MAINTENANCE 


Sec. 110-81. - Findings; adoption of manual. 
(a) ?The township council hereby finds and declares that problems of traffic control occur when traffic 
must be moved through or around road or street construction, maintenance operations and utility 
work, above or below ground, which requires blocking the roadway and obstructing the normal flow 
of traffic and that such obstructions are or can become dangerous when not properly controlled. In 
order to better promote the public health, safety, peace and welfare, it is necessary to establish 
controls and regulations directed to the safe and expeditious movement of traffic through 
construction and maintenance zones and to provide safety for the workforces performing these 
operations. 
(b) ?The Township of South Brunswick does hereby adopt the current Manual on Uniform Traffic Control 
Devices, known as M.U.T.C.D. (current edition), except as supplemented and amended in this 
division, as it controls and regulates whenever construction, maintenance operations or utility work 
obstructs the normal flow of traffic. Any person, contractor or utility who fails to comply with the 
provisions of the M.U.T.C.D. while performing such work is in violation of this division. 
(Ord. No. 26-05, § I, 5-10-2005) 


Sec. 110-82. - Pre-construction meeting. 
    It shall be the responsibility of the person, contractor or, for a public utility, as required under the 
public utility agreement, N.J.S.A. 16:25-9.2, wishing to conduct work on, under or above the roadway to 
contact the Traffic Bureau of the South Brunswick Police Department to arrange a pre-construction 
meeting in order to submit plans for the safe movement of traffic during such period of construction or 
work. Any person, contractor or utility who fails to comply with this section prior to the start of such work 
or whose plans are not approved by the traffic bureau of the police department is in violation of this 
division. 
(Ord. No. 26-05, § I, 5-10-2005) 


Sec. 110-83. - Emergency-contact telephone numbers; correction of hazardous conditions by township. 
    Under this division the person, contractor or utility shall provide the traffic bureau with at least two 
emergency-contact phone numbers to be called if emergency problems occur at the construction or 
maintenance site prior to the start of any work. If, for any reason, emergency contacts cannot be reached 
or if the emergency-contact person does not respond to a call from the South Brunswick Police 
Department to correct a hazardous condition, the Township of South Brunswick may respond to correct 
such hazardous condition. The reasonable fees for such emergency services by the Township of South 
Brunswick shall be charged to the person, contractor or utility responsible for such condition. 
(Ord. No. 26-05, § I, 5-10-2005) 


Sec. 110-84. - Time limits. 
    There shall be no construction, maintenance operations or utility work on any roadway in the 
Township of South Brunswick before the hours of 9:00 a.m. or after 4:00 p.m. This time limit may be 
adjusted to permit work prior to 9:00 a.m. or after 4:00 p.m. by the officer in charge of the Traffic Bureau 
of the South Brunswick Police Department. If it is determined by the officer in charge of the South 
Brunswick Police Department Traffic Bureau that the construction or maintenance operations prior to 9:00 
a.m. or after 4:00 p.m. would substantially delay traffic or cause a safety or health hazard, the work shall 
then be permitted only between 9:00 a.m. and 4:00 p.m. 
(Ord. No. 26-05, § I, 5-10-2005) 


Sec. 110-85. - Road closings and detours. 
    Road closings and/or traffic detours shall not be permitted under this division, unless approved by 
the Township of South Brunswick Police Traffic Bureau. 
(Ord. No. 26-05, § I, 5-10-2005) 


Sec. 110-86. - Traffic directors. 
    Traffic directors shall be posted at all construction or maintenance sites when determined by the 
Township of South Brunswick Police Traffic Bureau that the directors are necessary to provide for the 
safe and expeditious movement of traffic pursuant to this division. 
(Ord. No. 26-05, § I, 5-10-2005) 


Sec. 110-87. - Stop work. 
    The Traffic Bureau of the South Brunswick Police Department shall have the authority to stop work, 
including the removal of equipment and vehicles, stored material within the street right-of-way, backfilling 
of open excavations and/or other related work, in order to abate any nuisance and/or safety hazard or for 
any violation of this division. The cost to abate any hazardous conditions shall be borne by the person, 
contractor or utility responsible for such condition. 
(Ord. No. 26-05, § I, 5-10-2005) 


Sec. 110-88. - Violation and penalties. 
(a) ?Any person, contractor or utility who commits a violation of this division shall, upon conviction 
thereof: 
(1) ?For a first offense, pay a fine of not less than $100.00 nor more than $500.00 and/or be 
imprisoned for a term not exceeding 90 days; 
(2) ?For a second offense, pay a fine of not less than $250.00 and/or be imprisoned for a term not 
exceeding 90 days; and 
(3) ?For a third or subsequent conviction, pay a fine of not less than $500.00 and/or be imprisoned 
for a term not exceeding 90 days. 
(b) ?A separate offense shall be deemed committed on each day during or on which a violation occurs or 
continues.

large volumes of waste discharge to install suitable meters to record flows and, in addition, any 
suitable regulating device for equalizing the greater discharge. 
(d) ?Discontinuance of service. The discontinuance of service regulations are as follows: 
(1) ?By users. All agreements covering water supply or sewage service shall continue in force 
unless and until the receipt of reasonable notice, in writing, of the desire to terminate the 
contract. Water service to any premises may be temporarily terminated upon the written request 
of the applicant. In such case, the existing agreement and the quarterly base charge for water 
and the quarterly flat charge for sewer service shall remain in effect unless the director of 
utilities or the utility collector or the water and/or sewer operations/revenue supervisor approves 
a physical disconnection. 
(2) ?By township. Service may be discontinued for any of the following reasons: 
a. ?A misrepresentation in an application. 
b. ?A willful waste of water through improper or imperfect pipes, fixtures or otherwise and a 
failure to make repairs within the time specified by the director of utilities or his 
representative. 
c. ?A failure to comply with restrictions imposed under this section. 
d. ?A use of water for any property or purpose other than described in the application.

other unavoidable cause, the township shall have the right to cut off the water supply 
temporarily in order to make necessary repairs and connections. The township will use all 
reasonable and practical measures to notify the user of such discontinuance of service. In such 
case, the township shall not be liable for any damage or inconvenience experienced by the user 
for any claim against it, at any time, for any interruption of service lessening the supply, for 
inadequate pressure, for poor quality of water or for any causes beyond its control. When the 
supply of water is to be temporarily interrupted, notice will be given, when practical, to all users 
affected by the temporary interruption of service, stating the probable duration of the interruption 
and also the purpose of the interruption. 
(4) ?Reserve supply. The township shall have the right to reserve a sufficient supply of water, at all 
times, in storage to provide for fire and other emergencies or may restrict or regulate the 
quantity of water used by the customer if a scarcity occurs or whenever the public welfare may 
so require. 
(5) ?Renewal of service after discontinuance. Service will be renewed, under a proper application, 
when the conditions under which such service was discontinued have been corrected and upon 
the payment of all proper charges or amounts, provided in the rate ordinance adopted by the 
township council, due from the applicant. 
(6) ?Responsibility. It is agreed by the parties receiving public fire service, private fire service or any 
other service that the township does not assume any liability as insurer of property or person 
and that the township does not guarantee any special service, pressure, capacity or facility 
other than is permitted by the ordinary and changing operation conditions of the township as 
they exist from day to day. It is agreed by the parties receiving service that the township shall be 
free and exempt from any and all claims for injury to any person or property by reason of fire, 
water or failure to supply water pressure or capacity. 
(e) ?Extension of lines. No extension of the township lines shall be made except under the following

(1) ?The extensions must be approved by the engineer or the director. 
(2) ?All construction of such extensions shall be under the supervision and subject to the approval 
of the township engineer and director. 
(3) ?Rights-of-way or easements must be provided for all extensions and facilities that become 
township property. The township council, upon the advice of the engineer or the director, shall 
determine which extensions will become the sole property of the township. Such rights-of-way 
or easements shall be reviewed by the engineer or director to determine the accuracy of the 
descriptions and then shall be forwarded by the engineer to the township clerk for recording and 
filing. 
(f) ?Registration of quantity by meter. The quantity recorded by the meter shall be conclusive on both the 
user and the township, except when the meter has been found to be registering inaccurately or has 
ceased to register. In such cases the quantity may be determined by the average registration for the 
four preceding billing quarters of the meter when in proper working order. 
(g) ?Notice of injury or malfunction of meter. The user shall immediately notify the township of injury to or 
malfunction of the meter, as soon as known by the user. 
(h) ?Right of entry. The properly identified authorized agents of the department shall have the right of 
access, upon notice, to the premises served at all reasonable hours for the purpose of reading 
meters, examining fixtures and pipes, observing the manner of using water and for any other 
purpose which is proper and necessary in the conduct of the department's business. 
(i) ?Turning water on or off or using water from fire hydrant without permission. No plumber, owner, 
tenant or other unauthorized person shall turn the water on or off at any corporation stop, curbstop or 
meter valve; disconnect or remove the meter; or open or remove water from a public fire hydrant 
without the written consent of the director. 
(j) ?Limitations on agents or employees. No agent or employee of the department has authorization to 
bind it by any promise, agreement or representation not provided for in this section. 
(k) ?Damage claims. Damage claim regulations are as follows: 
(1) ?In all contracts for general or special water or sewer service, it is expressly understood and 
agreed that no claims will be made against the township for damage to life or property by 
reason of the breaking of any service pipe, water fixture, meter or appliance within the user's 
premises, unless caused by the negligence of the township or its employees, nor for any 
damage done due to the failure of the water supply for any cause beyond the township's 
control. 
(2) ?All users having boilers upon their premises, depending upon the pressure of the water in the 
township's pipes needed to keep them supplied, are cautioned against the danger of collapse, 
and all such damage must be borne exclusively by the user. 
(3) ?No water will be furnished to any premises where any possibility exists of the interconnection of 
the water furnished by the township with water from any other source, nor will the township 
permit its mains or service pipes to be connected in any way to any piping, tank, vat or other 
apparatus containing liquid, chemical or any other matter which may flow back into the 
township's service pipes or mains and consequently endanger the water supply. It is the 
responsibility of the owner to perform annual inspections of the backflow prevention devices 
under the observation of the township code enforcement department. Copies of the inspection 
report will be filed with the water operations division and the state department of environmental 
protection. 
(l) ?Complaints. Complaints with respect to the character of the service furnished or the reading of the 
meters or of the bills rendered must be made at the department's office, either orally or in writing, 
and a record of such complaint will be kept by the department, noting the following: 
(1) ?The name and address of the complainant; 
(2) ?The date; 
(3) ?The nature of the complaint; and 
(4) ?The remedy. 
(m) ?Alterations and repairs. No alteration or repair to any part of the sewer and water system or any 
connection thereto shall be made except by duly authorized representatives or employees of the 
township nor without application for such having been made to the township and approved by the 
plumbing subcode official and upon compliance with the National Standard Plumbing Code. 
(n) ?Emergency sanitary pipeline and pump station repairs. As the necessity may arise, if a sanitary 
sewer line or a sanitary sewer pump station experiences a major failure, the township shall have the 
right to order a temporary shutdown of operations of any or all facilities which convey wastewater 
into or though the sanitary sewer lines or pump stations affected by the major failure in order to 
promptly make repairs. For purposes of this section, a "major failure" shall be any condition which 
causes an inability to safely pump or convey sanitary sewerage through the township's sanitary 
sewer system. Operation shutdown orders will be based on the wastewater flows generated by the 
facility and the capacity impact on said lines or pump stations. The township will use all reasonable 
and practical measures to notify the user in advance, if possible, in the event a shutdown order is 
necessary, stating the probable duration of the operations shutdown as well as the reason for the 
shutdown order. Nothing contained herein, however, shall prohibit the township from ordering an 
immediate shutdown of operations, without advance notice, in the event of an emergency. In the 
event of any shutdown of operations, the township will not be liable for any damage, loss or 
inconvenience experienced by the user or for any claims of whatever nature arising out of the 
shutdown.

(Code 1988, § 257-5; Ord. No. 12-97, § 257-5, 5-6-1997) 


Sec. 114-36. - Service charges. 
    Water and sewer service charges are payable to the township as set forth in division 2 of this article. 
(Code 1988, § 257-6) 


Sec. 114-37. - Water service. 
    Water service regulations shall be as follows: 
(1) ?Connection. The owner of every existing building or structure, other than a single-family 
residence, and the owner of a single-family residence for which a building permit has been 
issued prior to the effective date of Ordinance No. 17-71, which may be occupied or used by 
human beings and which is located on property which either contains or abuts upon a road or 
easement in which is located a water pipeline, shall, within 60 days after a notice to connect is 
served upon such owner by the director or prior to an occupancy permit's being granted, 
whichever is sooner, connect such building or structure to the water pipeline, unless a written 
extension is granted by the director for good cause. 
(2) ?Service line. The township will make connections to its mains and furnish, install and maintain 
all service lines to and including the curbstop and box, which will be placed inside the curbline, 
all of which service lines shall remain the sole property of the township and shall not be 
trespassed on or interfered with in any respect. 
(3) ?Size and kind of service line. The township engineer, after consultation with the director, the 
water operations supervisor and the plumbing and fire subcode officials, shall determine the 
size and kind of service line from the main to the curbstop or meter pit and from the curbstop or 
meter pit to the property to be served for domestic or industrial use. Type K copper, flared, 
underground-type or acceptable plastic shall be used throughout for services up to and 
including two inches in diameter. For larger services, ductile iron cement pipe meeting American 
Water Works Association standards for water pipes shall be used. The pipe from the curbstop to 
the property shall be furnished, installed and maintained by the owner of the property; shall be 
laid in a straight line at right angles to the curbline with the building limits of the structure to be 
served; and shall be at least four feet below the surface of the ground when final grading of the 
property has been completed. If a user wishes a connection of a larger size service line from the 
main to the curbstop or meter pit than the township considers necessary, he shall pay the 
difference in cost between the larger line and the size deemed necessary by the township, as 
computed and determined by the engineer. 
(4) ?Separate trench. No service pipe shall be laid in the same trench with a gas pipe, drain or 
sewer pipe or any other facility of any public utility company nor within three feet of any open 
excavation, vault, cesspool or septic tank; nor shall the location be in conflict with any sidewalk 
or driveway running at right angles to the front of the building. The location and laying of the 
separate pipe shall comply with section 10-6.2 of the National Standard Plumbing Code. 
(5) ?Renewal of service lines. Where the renewal of the service line from the main to the curbstop 
or meter pit is found to be necessary, the township will renew the service in the same location 
as previously used. If the property owner or user, for his own convenience, desires the new 
service line at some other location and agrees to pay all expenses of such relocation in excess 
of the cost of laying the service line in the same location as previously used and cutting off and 
disconnecting the old service line, the township will lay the new service line at the location 
desired. 
(6) ?Maintenance by user. All connections, service lines and fixtures furnished by the user shall be 
maintained by him in good order, and all valves, meters and appliances furnished and owned by 
the township and on the property of the user shall be protected properly and cared for by the 
user. All leaks in the service or any other pipe or fixture in or upon the premises supplied must 
be repaired immediately by the owner or occupant of the premises. The user shall be 
responsible for notifying the director of the party engaged by such user to do any maintenance 
work on the user's service line prior to work being commenced, and the party shall not backfill 
any trench until the work has been inspected and approved by the director's representative. Any 
work not acceptable shall be immediately removed and replaced by work which is acceptable. 
(7) ?User's responsibility. The township shall in no event be responsible for maintaining any portion 
of the service line owned by the user or for damage done by water escaping therefrom or from 
lines or fixtures on the user's property. The user shall, at all times, comply with applicable 
municipal regulations with respect thereto and make changes therein required by reason of 
change in grade, relocation of mains or otherwise. 
(8) ?Property supplied by single service line. A single service line may serve more than one 
structure or building on the same property, provided that: 
a. ?The one service line is adequate to serve those structures as determined and approved by 
the plumbing official in accordance with the Uniform Construction Code. 
b. ?Each structure has separate controls/valves. 
c. ?All the water is metered according to separate uses and occupancies as required by 
subsection (11) of this section. 
(9) ?Single service line with two or more users. Where two or more users are supplied through a 
single service line, any violation of this section with respect to either or any of the users shall be 
deemed a violation as to all. Unless the violation is corrected after reasonable notice, the 
director may take such action as can be taken for a single user, except that such action will not 
be taken until an innocent user who has not violated this section has been given a reasonable 
opportunity, not exceeding 90 days, to attach his pipe to a separately controlled service 
connection. 
(10) ?Special application. An application for a supply of water for building or other special purposes, 
except on a lot or premises already supplied with a metered water connection, must be signed 
by the owner or his duly authorized agent and shall be interpreted to mean that the water is to 
be used from the builder's hydrant and shall not be introduced into any of the house fixtures. 
(11) ?Metering of all water service. Each water service from the curbstop or meter pit to a property 
shall be metered. The township engineer, after consultation with the director, shall determine 
the size and location of the meters and the number of units to be serviced by each meter in 
accordance with the plumbing code and fire safety requirements as defined in the Uniform 
Construction Code and the National Fire Protection Code. 
(12) ?Location. After the applicant has provided space for the meter, which will be readily 
accessible and will provide proper protection for the meter, and has had the plumbing arranged 
to receive the meter at a convenient point approved by the plumbing subcode official and so 
positioned as to meter and control the entire supply, the township will have the meter set, 
except for a meter larger than one inch, which will be set by the user. When it is not practical to 
place the meter within a building, a brick, concrete or other approved meter box or pit, fitted with 
a suitable and approved type of cover, shall be built inside the property line by the user. The 
meter pit shall be fitted with an approved ladder and sump pump. The size and dimensions of 
the pit or box shall be approved by the engineer and shall provide adequate access to the meter 
and permit its ready installation or removal. All newly installed meters shall have remote reading 
meters. As to existing meters, the director and/or utility collector shall have the authority to 
require the installation of a remote reading meter in the interest of safety and/or for convenience 
in reading the meter. 
(13) ?Valves required. A ball or gate valve shall be placed by the user of the service line directly 
ahead of the meter and another on the outlet side of the meter. A suitable and approved 
checkvalve should be placed by the user between the valve and the meter. When a checkvalve 
is installed, a safety valve should be inserted at some convenient point in the house piping to 
relieve excess pressure due to heating water, as required by section 10.16 of the National 
Standard Plumbing Code. Pressure regulators will be required when pressure exceeds 55 
pounds per square inch. 
(14) ?Responsibility for damage. Meters will be maintained by the department so far as ordinary 
wear and tear are concerned, but damage resulting from freezing, hot water or external causes 
due to the negligence of the user shall be paid for by the customer. 
(15) ?Cost of reinstallation. The user shall pay a charge for the reinstallation or changing of a meter 
when the meter is removed due to damage caused by anything other than ordinary wear and 
tear. 
(16) ?Base charge. Each meter is installed subject to a fixed quarterly meter base rate charge per 
unit, in accordance with the current adopted rate ordinance, for which no quantities of water will 
be furnished. Such base rate shall be nonabatable for nonusers of water and noncumulative 
against subsequent consumption. The rates for meters will be set forth by the director and 
collector of utilities, and the cost of the meters shall be revised annually. A copy of the list shall 
be filed with the township clerk. This base charge section for nonusage will not apply in the case 
of swim club pools during the first and fourth quarters of the calendar year, provided that there 
is no use during such quarters, nor shall it apply where there has been an approval of a physical 
termination of service by the township in accordance with section 114-34(d)(1) and (2). 
(17) ?Allowable uses. Allowable uses shall be as follows: 
a. ?Public fire hydrants. Only persons in possession of a permit issued by the director, with the 
exception of the fire department in case of fire, shall take water from any public fire 
hydrant. An applicant for a permit to use a public fire hydrant shall provide the director with 
the location of the hydrant to be utilized, the hours the hydrant is to be utilized and the 
length of time the hydrant is to be utilized. Upon completion of the application, the applicant 
shall pay the appropriate fees to the water and sewer revenue division, after which the 
permit will be issued by the director. Use of the hydrant shall occur only during the times 
provided to the director at the time of application. The director shall determine if the use of 
a water meter is necessary, and, if so, the meter shall be provided by the water operations 
division. 
b. ?Private fire protection appliances. No person shall take water from any private fire hydrant 
or fire appliance unless for the purposes of extinguishing fires, training or testing. If training 
or testing occurs, notification to and approval of the fire official shall be necessary prior to 
the flow of any water. 
c. ?Enforcement. Enforcement of this subsection shall be by the director, the water operations 
supervisor and/or the fire official. 
(18) ?Tampering. It shall be unlawful for any person not authorized by the director to tamper with, 
alter or injure any part of the township waterworks or supply system or any meter. 
(19) ?Industrial and commercial water and fire service. All applications for industrial and commercial 
water and fire service must be accompanied by two sets of plans showing complete water 
service piping proposed for approval by the plumbing and fire subcode officials. No work shall 
commence on the proposed installation prior to such approval. The connection of the water 
piping of four inches or larger to the public mains shall be inspected and approved by the 
township engineer; all other water piping shall be inspected by the construction code agency. All 
water and fire service piping shall be installed in conformance with the Uniform Construction 
Code and any other applicable codes or ordinances. Prior to the issuance of the certificate of 
occupancy where a fire service installation is required and in all other situations where a fire 
service installation is required, the fire subcode official will provide the water and sewer revenue 
office with the size of the fire line, number of hydrants and sprinkler heads and any other 
pertinent information, along with the final approval date of each necessary for billing purposes. 
(20) ?Meter pits. A meter pit shall be required if determined necessary by the director or the water 
operations supervisor after review and approval of the construction plans submitted to the water 
operations division. 
(21) ?Separate fire service line. If a separate fire service line is required by the applicant, the 
domestic water service must be run through a meter and the fire service through a detector 
checkvalve with a bypass meter. 
(22) ?Expense of material. All material, including but not limited to valves, piping, meters, anchors, 
gauges and meter pits, and all labor required to install the material for the complete installation, 
beginning at the connection to be made at the township's main, shall be furnished by the 
applicant at no expense to the township.

an exemption of the provisions of this section under either of the following circumstances: 
(1) ?Connection of the house, building or structure to the sanitary sewer line cannot be 
accomplished without installing a pump station, blasting bedrock, acquiring an easement or 
right-of-way to cross an adjoining property or crossing a watercourse, railway, major highway or 
other significant obstacle; or 
(2) ?The house, building or structure is serviced by a private septic system which was installed after 
January 1, 1990. 
(e) ?Exemption procedure. The health officer or his designee shall review applications for exemption, 
shall conduct an inspection/test of the private system, and shall not grant an exemption unless he is 
satisfied that the private system is in good working order and only after the director of utilities, or his 
designee, agrees to the exemption. The owner thereafter shall be required to pump out the private 
septic system every three to five years, supplying the health officer with proof of the pumping, and 
arrange for inspection of the private septic system by the health officer every two years. All costs 
associated with these requirements shall be borne by the owner. 
(f) ?Termination of exemption. The exemption shall terminate as follows: 
(1) ?All exemptions granted under subsection (d)(1) of this section shall be permanent in nature, 
subject to the provisions of this article. 
(2) ?All exemptions granted under subsection (d)(2) of this section shall terminate ten years from 
the effective date of Ordinance No. 14-01 (or on April 9, 2011), subject to the provisions of this 
article. 
(3) ?All exemptions granted under subsections (d)(1) and (2) of this section shall terminate if the 
private septic system fails or if, in the discretion of the health officer, the private septic system 
poses a threat to the health, safety and welfare of the occupants of the structure or surrounding 
properties. 
(g) ?Payment of rates. All owners shall pay the sewer rates prevailing at the time of connection to the 
public sewer system. The water and sewer revenue department shall be permitted to set up time 
payments, or other type of payment plan, for owners required to connect to the sanitary sewer 
system by this section. 
(h) ?Hardship petition. The owner of any house, building or structure which shall be required to connect 
into the public sewer system pursuant to the provisions of this article may, within ten days of receipt 
of notification of the required connection, petition the township manager for relief from the required 
connection. 
(1) ?All petitions must be in writing and shall be signed by the petitioner. The petitioner must set 
forth all facts and matters relied upon and shall specifically state the extent of the relief 
requested. 
(2) ?If it appears to the township manager that good cause has been shown by the petitioner that an 
undue financial hardship will be imposed upon the owner, the manager may, in his discretion, 
grant a reasonable extension of time within which the required connection must be made. 
Extensions of time to connect may be for a period no greater than 12 months in duration. A 
petitioner may, however, file a subsequent petition for one further extension of time, not to 
exceed an additional 12 months in duration, provided that the petition is filed at least ten days 
prior to the expiration date of the extension date previously granted. 
(i) ?General regulations. General sewer service regulations shall be as follows: 
(1) ?Service connection. The applicant, upon payment of all sewer service charges, all sewer facility 
charges and all other charges pertinent to application for service, permit fees and inspection 
fees, shall make the connection to the township mains and shall install all service laterals from 
the connection to the applicant's site at the applicant's expense. 
(2) ?Size and kind of service lateral. The township reserves the right to determine the size and kind 
of the service lateral from the main to the curbline, from the curbline to the property to be served 
or from the main in a right-of-way to the property to be served. Laterals of all sizes shall be 
constructed in accordance with the National Standard Plumbing Code and the township's 
standards as recorded in the township engineer's office. The service lateral from the curb area 
cleanout to the property shall be furnished, installed and maintained by the owner of the 
property; shall be laid in a straight line, if practical, from the point of connection to the main, 
where the main is in a right-of-way, or from the end of the township-constructed service lateral 
to the structure to be served; and shall be at least four feet below the surface of the ground 
when final grading of the property has been completed. That portion of the service lateral 
installed and maintained by the owner shall be installed by a registered plumber and shall be 
inspected and approved by the township's plumbing subcode official prior to backfilling the 
trench; otherwise, any construction not approved shall be immediately removed and 
reconstructed in an approved manner. 
(3) ?Separate trench. No service lateral shall be laid in the same trench with any gas pipe or any 
other facility of any public utility company nor within three feet of any open excavation, service 
lateral, vault or meter pit, nor shall the location be in conflict with any sidewalk or driveway 
running at right angles to the front of the building. 
(4) ?Maintenance by users . All service laterals, cleanout stand pipes, connections and fixtures 
located on the property served shall be maintained in good order and shall be the property of 
the user and shall be protected and properly cared for by the user. All leaks in the service lateral 
or any other pipe or fixture in or upon the premises served must be repaired immediately by the 
owner or occupant of the premises. The user shall be responsible for securing a plumbing 
permit prior to commencing any work, and the party shall not backfill any trench until the work 
has been inspected and approved by the plumbing subcode official. Any work not acceptable 
shall be immediately removed and replaced by work which is acceptable. 
(5) ?User's responsibility . The township shall not be responsible for maintaining any portion of the 
service lateral or fixtures or be responsible for any blockages in any portion of the lateral 
between the structure served and the curb area cleanout, which included the lateral cleanout 
stand pipe, as described in subsection (i) (2) of this section, or for damage done by sewage 
escaping therefrom. In circumstances where the curb area cleanout is located outside of the 
dedicated public right-of-way, the user owns and is responsible for the service lateral and 
cleanout up until the point where the dedicated public right-of-way begins. The user shall, at all 
times, comply with applicable township regulations with respect thereto and make changes 
therein required by reason of the relocation of mains or otherwise. 
(6) ?Township's responsibility . The township shall be responsible for maintaining all domestic 
laterals four to five inches in diameter located in a dedicated public right-of-way provided that a 
curb area cleanout, as described in subsection (i) (2) of this section, is provided by the property 
owner at his expense. The property owner is responsible for maintaining the sewer lateral 
cleanout standpipe as well as the rest of the lateral up to the house. In circumstances where the 
curb area cleanout is located outside of the dedicated public right-of-way, the user owns and is 
responsible for the service lateral and cleanout up until the point where the dedicated public 
right-of-way begins. The township will install a cleanout at the property owner's request for a fee 
of $950.00, if there is not already an existing cleanout. The installation fee may be paid in full or 
may be paid in three installments, the first two at $325.00 each and the final installment of 
$300.00, which will be added to the sewer account. Any unpaid balance of each installment will 
be subject to all the rules of nonpayment. Following installation of the curb area cleanout, the 
township will assume full responsibility for the care, cleaning, repair or replacement of the 
service lateral between the sewer main and the edge of the dedicated public right-of-way, but 
not including the service lateral cleanout standpipe. The township reserves the right to deny this 
request if the depth of the lateral, soil conditions, groundwater conditions, and/or surrounding 
obstacles in the location of the cleanout excavation site make it impractical for the township to 
perform such work. 
(7) ?System improvements. The township may install a curb area cleanout without the property 
owner's request when portions of the collection system are being upgraded or replaced. The 
property owner will be assessed a minimum cost of $120.00 which shall be added to his sewer 
account and may be paid in full or in three equal installments of $40.00 each. Any unpaid 
balance of each installment will be subject to all the rules on nonpayment. 
(8) ?Property served by single service lateral. A service lateral from the curb or the main in a right-
of-way to a property shall not serve more than one property, as generally described and 
classified in section 114-37(8), but any such property, upon proper application of the owner, 
may be served by two or more service laterals, each of which, for billing purposes, shall be 
considered as being one user account. 
(9) ?Single service lateral with two or more users. Where two or more users are served through a 
single service lateral, any violation of this subsection with respect to either or any of the users 
shall be deemed a violation as to all. Unless the violation is corrected after reasonable notice, 
the township may take such action as may be taken for a single user, except that such action 
will not be taken until an innocent user, who has not violated this subsection, has been given a 
reasonable opportunity, not to exceed 90 days, to connect his pipe to a separately controlled 
service lateral. 
(10) ?Prohibited connections. Any connection resulting in stormwater, groundwater, runoff water or 
other inflow or infiltration entering the sanitary system is expressly prohibited. All other 
connections must be made pursuant to the National Standard Plumbing Code. 
(11) ?Special connections. Service laterals shall be installed in conformance with the detailed plans 
and specifications submitted to the engineering department by the applicant. Review and 
approval of those plans and specifications by the engineer or his designee must precede 
installation. Installation shall conform to the National Standard Plumbing Code. The installation 
of service laterals greater than six inches and all force mains shall be inspected and approved 
by the engineering department. Installation of service laterals six inches and under shall be 
inspected and approved by the plumbing subcode official. 
(12) ?Infiltration . If it is found that there is infiltration caused by a broken lateral, stand pipe, open 
joints, sump pump connection or some other problem with the user's piping, it shall be reported 
and repaired immediately by the user or owner. 
(13) ?Industrial service. Service to an industrial facility shall require the following: 
a. ?The township will accept industrial wastes into the sanitary sewer system upon approval by 
the township utilities department of an application for service, and under and subject to the 
provisions appearing in this subsection. The application must set out, in detail, the 
characteristics of the wastes, the flow conditions which shall govern and the conditions with 
respect to the physical connection. It will be the policy of the township to consider each 
application on its own merits and to establish specific conditions applicable to the particular 
situation for each. No connection shall be made prior to written approval by the utilities 
department and satisfaction of any conditions required for connection. 
b. ?Prior to approving an application for a connection involving the acceptance of industrial 
wastes, the applicant shall submit complete data with respect to the following: 
1. ?The average, maximum and minimum rates of flow to be expected daily and 
seasonally. 
2. ?A flow diagram, showing the points of application of chemicals, the type and quantity 
of each chemical used per day and per shift, a schedule of operations, the expected 
chemical characteristics of the untreated wastes and the point of connection to the 
sewer system. The normal situation will require the separation of and separate points 
of connection for domestic sewage and industrial wastes from each industrial 
establishment. 
(14) ?Prohibited wastes. Wastes containing the following substances or possessing the 
characteristics listed will not be accepted: 
a. ?Any vapors or steam. 
b. ?Any fluids with temperatures in excess of 150 degrees Fahrenheit. 
c. ?Any fluid wastes which contain in excess of 100 parts per million of fat, oil or grease, either 
vegetable or mineral. 
d. ?Any volatile, explosive or flammable substances, such as benzene, gasoline, naphtha, fuel 
oil or similar substances. 
e. ?Any solid or viscous matter which may cause any interference with the flow of sewage, 
such as ashes, cinders, sand, mud, straw, shavings, metal, glass, rags, feathers, tar, 
plastics, wood, paunch manure, hair or similar substances. 
f. ?Any fluid wastes having a pH value less than 5.5 or in excess of 9.0 or possessing other 
properties capable of causing damage or hazard to sewers, structures, the treatment 
process, equipment or operating personnel. 
g. ?Any wastes containing toxic or poisonous substances in sufficient concentration to interfere 
with the sewage treatment process, to cause injury to animals or persons or to create an 
unacceptable condition in the receiving stream. 
h. ?Any noxious or malodorous gas or substance which is capable of causing a public 
nuisance. 
i. ?Any grease, fatty material, offal or garbage. 
j. ?Milk or any liquid milk waste products in quantities in excess of ten gallons per each 24-hour 
period. 
k. ?Any water or waste which may contain radioactive materials. 
(15) ?Grease, oil and sand separators. When, in the opinion of the plumbing subcode official, 
grease, oil and sand interceptors or oil reclaimers are required, they shall be provided and 
maintained at the expense of the owner in a continuously efficient operating condition. Grease 
and oil interceptors shall be constructed of impervious materials, capable of withstanding abrupt 
and extreme changes in temperature. They shall be watertight and substantially constructed 
and equipped with readily removable access covers. Where deemed necessary, cold-water 
sprays shall be installed. The design and pertinent data shall be submitted to the plumbing 
subcode official for review and approval prior to construction or installation. Separators must be 
constructed entirely on the property of the owner. 
(16) ?Prohibited discharges. No person shall discharge or cause to be discharged to any sanitary 
sewer within the township any of the following: 
a. ?Stormwater, surface water or groundwater or unpolluted industrial process waters of any 
kind. 
b. ?Water from any swimming pool or air conditioning system. 
c. ?Industrial or commercial waste, except as provided in subsection (i)(17) of this section. 
d. ?Discharges from rain drains or sump pumps. 
(17) ?Preliminary treatment. Preliminary treatment may be required as follows: 
a. ?The township reserves the right to require preliminary treatment where the chemical 
characteristics of the proposed industrial wastes, in the opinion of the director or in the 
opinion of the department of environmental protection or the appropriate regional sewerage 
authority, make such preliminary treatment desirable or mandatory. Some of the 
characteristics which may dictate preliminary treatment are as follows: 
1. ?A five-day biochemical oxygen demand in excess of 300 parts per million. 
2. ?Suspended solids in excess of 300 parts per million. 
3. ?An average daily flow in excess of two percent of the rated capacity of the treatment 
plant. 
4. ?The presence of arsenic, barium, cadmium, chloride, chromium, copper, cyanide, 
fluoride, iron, lead, magnesium, manganese, nickel, nitrate, selenium, sulfate, zinc or 
pH values outside the acceptable limits described in this subsection. 
b. ?When it is agreed that the industrial waste will be received following preliminary treatment, 
drawings and specifications shall be submitted for approval, showing all pertinent details of 
the construction proposed to accomplish the treatment, to include details of the indicator-
recorder-register type of fluid meter, and the housing to be used, to meter the flow of 
industrial wastes, and also details of the control manhole to be constructed on the 
industrial waste connection within the sidewalk area. The control manhole shall be 
provided with adequate access manhole covers of an approved type, through which 
access shall be possible to township personnel at all times. Drawings, specifications, 
reports, etc., shall be submitted in quadruplicate and shall be prepared by a registered 
professional engineer. 
c. ?Where preliminary treatment facilities are required, they shall be provided and continuously 
maintained in an effective operating condition at all times, at the expense of the industry. 
d. ?Each industry connected shall be responsible for maintaining a quality of effluent from its 
premises which conforms to the provisions established in the South Brunswick Utilities 
Code of Ordinances. Sampling and analysis shall be done to conform to accepted practice 
and in accordance with the current edition of Standard Methods for the Examination of 
Water and Wastewater, published by the American Public Health Association, the 
American Water Works Association and the Water Environment Federation. 
e. ?The cost of preparing and submitting this data for consideration by the township shall be 
borne by the industry. Likewise, the cost of sampling and analysis to determine compliance 
with the established limits outlined in the South Brunswick Utilities Code of Ordinances 
section 114-63 shall be borne by the industry, although conducted by the director and/or 
the sewer operation division supervisor. Invoices for industrial sampling performed by the 
township will be sent on a quarterly basis for lab analysis of wastewater samples to be 
performed at a NJ certified laboratory. 
(18) ?Control manhole. Industries permitted to connect to township sewers, even though not initially 
being required to provide preliminary treatment, shall be required to provide a control manhole 
or meter, as described in this subsection. 
(19) ?Industrial waste meters and waste samplers. Where the owner provides its own water supply 
entirely separate from that supplied by the township or provides from its own sources a portion 
of the water consumed on the premises which eventually finds its way into the sewer system of 
the township, all provisions of subsections (i)(1) through (18) of this section will apply. This does 
not relieve the owner from the requirement to furnish, install and maintain a meter of the 
indicator-register-record type to measure the discharge of industrial waste as provided in this 
subsection. All costs of furnishing, installing and maintaining the industrial waste flow meter 
shall be borne by the owner. 
(20) ?Inspection of industrial wastes. Each industry discharging industrial waste into the sewer 
system of the township shall provide facilities and means whereby the waste being discharged 
may be inspected by designated employees of the sewer operation division for the purpose of 
determining the character of its waste, its concentration and its rate of flow. Determination of 
character, concentration and rate of flow by the director and/or sewer operation division 
supervisor shall be binding for the purpose of computing rental charges. Samples may be 
collected and evaluated pursuant to standard methods of analysis for the purpose of 
determining the quality and quantity of such industrial waste. 
(21) ?Schedule of discharge of industrial wastes. Each industry discharging industrial waste into the 
sewer system of the township shall adopt a schedule of discharge of such waste, which 
schedule is subject to the approval of the director or engineer, to the end that peak 
concentration of sewage flows shall be minimized, giving due consideration to the capacities of 
the sewer system and to the necessities of factory production. 
(22) ?Change of discharge operations. If the industrial waste discharged by any industry interferes 
with the efficiency of the operation of the sewer system of the township or with the disposal of 
sewage flowing therein or newly increases the cost of the operation of such system, such 
industry shall be required by the director or engineer to: 
a. ?Reduce its peak discharge. 
b. ?Construct an equalizing tank. 
c. ?Partially pretreat the wastes. 
d. ?Eliminate troublesome wastes. 
e. ?Use any approved means to produce industrial waste of a quality acceptable to the director 
or engineer before such waste can be discharged into the sewer system of the township. 
(23) ?Penalty or discontinuance. If any industry fails to conform to the regulations in this subsection 
or fails to comply with any terms set forth in the South Brunswick Township Utilities Code of 
Ordinances, which failure causes damage of any sort to the township or the township's 
employees, the township shall determine the extent of the damage and bill the industry 
accordingly. If such bill is not paid within five calendar days from the date of the bill, legal action 
may be instituted to enforce collection, or the township may resort to termination of the 
connection after giving 24 hours' notice or to termination of the water supply. The township 
reserves the right to terminate sanitary sewer service upon one year's written notice for 
repeated failure to comply with the rules and regulations of the township. 
(24) ?Industrial waste meters. Where the industry provides its own water supply, entirely separate 
from that supplied by the township, or provides from its own source a portion of the water 
consumed on the premises, which eventually finds its way into the sewer system of the 
township, the industry must provide, at its own expense, a water meter or sewage flow meter or 
both, for the purpose of measuring the discharge of industrial waste. All such meters must be 
approved as to their type and installation by the engineer. The provisions of the rate section 
shall apply to the measured discharge of industrial waste. 
(25) ?Privately owned and operated sanitary sewer pump stations. The owner and NJDEP licensed 
operator of any privately owned and operated pump station is responsible for all maintenance 
and repairs associated with the pump station. This responsibility also applies to the force mains 
in which the wastewater is conveyed from the pump station, up until it transitions to gravity in a 
township owned manhole located in the South Brunswick Township Sanitary Sewer Collection 
System. 
(26) ?Registering of privately owned and operated sanitary sewer pump stations. The owner and 
NJDEP licensed operator of any privately owned and operated pump stations are required to 
register with both the South Brunswick Township Health Department and Utilities Department 
(Sewer Division), providing up to date contact information. Any change in ownership of the 
pump station, or change in NJDEP licensed operator shall be reported to both the South 
Brunswick Township Health Department and Utilities Department (Sewer Division) immediately. 
The owner/operator is required to post a current telephone number of an emergency contact 
conspicuously on site at the pump station.

Sec. 114-61. - General regulations. 
    The following charges, water and sewer system fees, rents and regulations for the connection with 
and the use and services of the water and sewer system are hereby fixed and prescribed for each 
building or structure or group of buildings or structures which may have a connection with the water 
and/or sewer system, and the township shall bill the charges, fees and rents to the owner as described in 
subsection (9)a. of this section: 
(1) ?Disputed account involving accuracy of meter. If an account is disputed involving the accuracy 
of a meter, such meter will be tested upon the request of the user in conformity with the 
provisions of this section. If, when so tested, the meter is found to have an error in registration 
of three percent or more, the bills will be increased or decreased correspondingly. 
(2) ?Rules for requesting meter test. When a meter is removed after installation, at the request of 
the user, for testing, the following rules shall apply: 
a. ?The township shall, upon written request of a user and payment of the test fee, if he so 
desires, in his presence or in the presence of his authorized representative, make a test of 
the accuracy of his meter. When a user desires, either personally or through a 
representative, to witness the testing of a meter, he may require the meter to be sealed in 
his presence before removal, which seal shall not be broken until the test is made in his 
presence. If the meter so tested shall be found to be accurate within the limits specified in 
this section, the test fee shall be retained by the township, but if not so found the cost 
therefor shall be borne by the township, and the test fee shall be returned. 
b. ?A report of such test shall be made to the customer, and a complete record of such test 
shall be kept by the township. 
(3) ?Meters. Procedures for reading, furnishing, reinstalling and testing meters are as follows: 
a. ?Reading. The water and sewer revenue division shall read or cause to be read every water 
meter used in the township at such times as are necessary that the bills may be sent out at 
the proper time. A final reading done at the request or on behalf of the customer shall 
require the payment of a fee of $30.00. Final readings done by or on behalf of the township 
for township-owned property shall be exempt from this fee. 
b. ?Furnishing. All initial installations of meters will be furnished and installed by the township. 
All water meter installations shall have an outside register, and, additionally, outside

times and at all reasonable hours. All water meters shall be furnished by the township in 
accordance with the current year meter bid prices plus handling charges, and the cost shall 
be paid by the applicant. All fees are payable at the time of application for service, prior to 
the issuance of a building permit or plumbing permit, except as to fire service lines. The 
director or engineer shall approve the installation and type of meter and meter size as 
requested by the applicant. No water shall be turned on unless a water meter has been 
installed and a final inspection of the installation of this meter has been approved by the 
plumbing inspector. Unmetered water will be a violation of this article and subject to all 
fines as described. 
c. ?Cost of reinstallation. The charge for reinstallation of a meter shall be $35.00 for meters 
one inch in diameter or smaller, and for meters larger than one inch $35.00 for the first inch 
and $10.00 for each additional inch or fraction thereof. 
d. ?Testing meters. Any township water meter shall be taken out and tested upon complaint of 
the consumer, upon payment of a charge of $35.00 for a meter one inch in diameter or 
smaller and for meters larger than one inch $35.00 for the first inch and $10.00 for each 
additional inch or fraction thereof. Any actual cost to the township beyond these fees shall 
be billed and collected from user, including the cost of any outside testing required. If, upon 
such test, the meter is not within three percent of being accurate, it shall be repaired or 
replaced and the charge returned to the consumer. 
e. ?Broken meters. If a meter gets out of order and fails to register, the consumption will be 
charged at the rate of the average daily consumption as shown by the meter when in order. 
(4) ?Substitution of charges. The rates and charges fixed by this division shall be in lieu of and in 
substitution for any other water and sewer charges made by any other agency for such quarter 
or any succeeding period. 
(5) ?Quarterly billing. Bills for such charges and rents shall be rendered to the owner of each 
premises quarterly as soon as may be practicable after the beginning of each billing quarter. 
Sewer rents shall be charged three months in advance of the current billing date, except for 
commercial and industrial accounts. 
(6) ?Liens. The charges and rents shall draw interest and shall be a lien upon the premises until 
paid, and the township shall have and exercise the remedies for the collection thereof, with 
interest, costs and penalties provided in N.J.S.A. 40:63-8 and 40:62-78 and as it has by law for 
the collection of taxes upon real estate. Charges for water and sewer shall be a lien upon the 
premises as provided by statute. 
(7) ?Responsibility of owners. Owners of premises will be held responsible for the water and sewer 
rents charged to their tenants. 
(8) ?Turn-on/Turn-off charge. When water is turned on or turned off from any premises because of 
a violation of this section or for nonpayment of a bill or upon the customer's request, during the 
hours of 8:30 a.m. to 3:30 p.m. Monday through Friday, a charge of $25.00 shall be added to 
the customer's account. If service is to be turned on or turned off after 3:30 p.m. or on 
weekends or holidays, a charge of $87.00 shall be added to the customer's account. 
(9) ?Bills and payment. Bills shall be issued and payment shall be made in accordance with the 
following: 
a. ?Place of payment. Bills are payable at the water and sewer revenue division. 
b. ?Bills rendered and due. Regular meter readings will be made prior to the 15th day of the 
billing month. For extra strength sewer billing, the testing shall be made one month prior to

by the township. If fire districts are created by the township, initial billings in the year 
first succeeding creation shall be rendered semiannually and thereafter quarterly. 
2. ?All users connected to the water and sewer system will be billed and shall pay, in each 
billing quarter, the base charge plus all usage in accordance with subsection (9)c. of 
this section and section 114-62(e)(4) and (5). 
3. ?Interim, final or adjustment bills may be issued as necessary or as determined by the 
utility collector. The township reserves the right to revise billing dates. 
4. ?All bills are due and payable on presentation or delivery. 
c. ?Delinquent bills. If a bill remains unpaid for a period of over ten days after presentation, it 
shall be classified as delinquent. If a bill remains unpaid 14 days after being classified as 
delinquent, service may be discontinued at any time after having given not less than five 
days' notice. If service is thus discontinued, it will not be restored until all unpaid bills, 
statutory interest and all charges, as provided for in N.J.S.A. 40:62-77 and 40:62-79, 
including the turn-on charge, are paid. 
d. ?Abatement. No abatement on meter bills will be made for leaks or for water wasted by 
damaged fixtures. 
(10) ?Purposes and establishment of sewer user charges. The township council hereby authorizes 
the director and the engineer to review, make recommendations and adjust the rate schedule 
and charges by user class, type of use, flow, biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), suspended 
solids (SS), chlorine demand (CD) and such other criteria as they shall deem appropriate and 
necessary. The township council also authorizes the director and the engineer to establish a 
technical advisory subcommittee, including representatives of various types of classes of users, 
on the sanitary sewer system. 
(Code 1988, § 257-10; Ord. No. 71-94, 12-20-1994; Ord. No. 2013-5, § I, 3-26-2013) 


Sec. 114-62. - Water charges. 
(a) ?Connection fees. The applicant shall pay a water connection fee of $575.00 at the time of 
application for each connection, up to and including two-inch connections, to the water system 
installed by the township. All service charges, connection fees, facility charges and meter or other 
charges shall be paid at the time of application for service, prior to the issuance of a building permit 
or plumbing permit, subject to the following: 
(1) ?This fee will apply to all service connections constructed in earth excavations up to a maximum 
depth of eight feet. When rock excavation is encountered and/or groundwater or where 
additional material is needed, as the director shall determine, or where the depth of the 
excavation exceeds eight feet or where open cuts are not permitted or require additional labor, 
equipment or materials, the applicant will be responsible for the payment of any additional costs 
which may result therefrom. These additional costs will be certified by the director and billed by 
the water and sewer revenue division. 
(2) ?All connections larger than two inches shall be installed by the applicant at the applicant's 
expense. Inspection of the installation will be made by an authorized representative of the 
township. 
(3) ?All wet taps and connections made to the water system by owners of major subdivisions, 
townhouses, student dorms, apartments, mobile home parks and commercial and industrial 
properties shall be made by the owners at their expense. 
(4) ?No connection fee shall be charged for connections installed by the applicant at the applicant's 
expense or for connections provided as part of a group line of a project under a water 
assessment ordinance, which are included in the project engineer's certification of costs for the 
project. The township engineer will petition property owners of assessment lines prior to 
construction to determine those interested in connecting to the system. Interested property 
owners must respond within 30 days and pay the applicable facility and service fees. During this 
period all connection fees will be waived. Any request to connect to the assessment line after 
the 30-day period will require payment of the applicable rates for the connection, facility and 
service fees. 
(b) ?Facility charge. The water facility charge shall be as follows: 
(1) ?All applicants for connection to the water system will be required to pay a facility charge 
representing a fair-share payment toward the capital costs of the existing water system. All 
applicants will be required to pay a facility charge based on each equivalent residential unit 
(ERU) times the water facility charge for residential units at the rate of $2,518.00 per ERU. 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, an equivalent residential unit (ERU) shall be as calculated in 
accordance with state statutes. This charge shall be paid at the time of application for 
connection. Other than exempted one- or two-family dwellings, all single-unit structures and 
separate lines for fire service and lawn sprinkler service shall be based on each connection size 
as follows:

(2) ?Applicants for other than single-family residential units are required to submit an estimate of the 
average daily flow. This estimate shall, subject to review and modification by the director of 
utilities, be used to determine the equivalent residential units (ERU) per structure for the 
purpose of calculating the facility charge, as described in subsection (b)(1) of this section. 
(3) ?If, during the three years subsequent to connection, the average daily flow exceeds the original 
estimate by more than ten percent, the then-current owner of the structure will be required to 
pay an additional facility charge, which will be that amount equal to the ERU or portion thereof 
based on the excess usage times the water facility charge then in effect. 
(4) ?Expansion or change of an existing use through construction which requires a building permit 
and which increases use by 200 gallons or more per day or 73,000 gallons or more per year will 
require payment of a facility charge based on the increase in usage and will be considered a 
new application for service. Estimates of the increased use are required and subject to the 
provisions for new uses set forth in this subsection. 
(c) ?Fees paid on assessment projects; connections provided. The water and sewer revenue division will 
provide the engineer with a list of all fees paid on a water assessment project. Those owners of 
properties affected by the water assessment project will be provided with a three-fourths-inch service 
lateral, unless such property owner specifically requests a larger size connection and pays the 
appropriate fee. The engineer shall file with the utility collector a certified list of all such connections 
provided on all projects under a water assessment ordinance. All fees and charges as set forth in 
this section are payable at the time of application for service, building permit or plumbing permit, 
unless the connection was provided as stated. 
(d) ?Initial service charge. Each new water user shall pay an initial service charge of $65.00 per unit at 
the time of application for service, building permit or plumbing permit to the township. Thereafter, the 
rates for water service in this section shall apply. New users applying for both water and sewer 
service at the same time shall pay one charge of $75.00. Student dormitories or buildings consisting 
of five units or more shall be calculated on the basis of $65.00 per building metered. If units are 
individually metered, the service charge of $65.00 per unit metered shall be due and payable 
immediately. 
(e) ?Minimum domestic service rates. Minimum domestic service rates shall be as follows: 
(1) ?Each meter is installed subject to a fixed quarterly customer base charge in accordance with 
this subsection, for which no quantities of water are included. 
(2) ?The quarterly customer base charge for all one-family residential dwellings with five-eighths-
inch by three-fourths-inch meters shall be $15.03 per quarter, with no water allowance. 
(3) ?The quarterly customer base charge for multiunit residential or multiunit commercial or a 
combination of the two classes of users, serviced through a single water meter, shall be 
determined by the product of the number of units by the quarterly customer base charge for a 
five-eighths/three-fourths-inch meter as established in this rate schedule. 
(4) ?All other classes of users will be subject to the following quarterly customer base charges:

shall apply to the consumed maximum at the second tier rate, and so forth. 
(6) ?The water and sewer revenue division shall provide a reduction in the amount of 20 percent of 
the periodic rates, rentals, or other charges for water supply service charged to or collected 
from a reduced rate user. 
(f) ?Private fire service. Connections and charges for private fire service water lines shall be as follows: 
(1) ?Domestic and fire service water lines shall be supplied by separate connections to the public 
water mains, except for multibuilding complexes with eight-inch or larger on-site water mains. 
The separate connections for the domestic and fire sprinkler supply may be made to on-site 
mains, subject to the curbstop or services control valve being located in a public area, 
accessible to the township during normal working hours. In all cases, an exemption shall be 
approved by the fire subcode official and director. 
(2) ?The fees for private fire service shall be as follows: 
a. ?For each private yard or wall hydrant: $349.08.

c. ?For each 2½-inch standpipe: $168.69. 
(3) ?In addition to the fees in subsection (f)(2) of this section, a per-annum surcharge of $2.14 per 
sprinkler head will also be applied. The rate per annum surcharge for each private fire hydrant 
not connected to a metered service line is $371.10. 
(4) ?Detector check meters required under section 114-37(21) shall be billed based upon quarterly 
readings. There shall be no charge for the first 3,000 gallons consumed in each quarter, which 
amount shall be allowed for testing purposes. Any excess consumption over the 3,000 gallons 
will be charged at a rate of $13.48 per 1,000 gallons for water and $8.32 per 1,000 gallons for 
sewer. The sewer charge shall be based on the water usage reading. If water is consumed to 
fight a fire, the fire official shall file a report with the water and sewer revenue division indicating 
the amount of water so used, which amount shall be deducted from the reading before the 
quarterly charges are calculated. Any consumption, approved by the fire official, over the 
allowed 3,000 gallons or the allowed consumption for firefighting, will be billed at the water 
usage rate of $1.75 per 1,000 gallons. Due to the nature of the water use approved by the fire 
official, no sewer charge will be billed. 
(5) ?Responsibility for fire service during residential construction. For all residential construction, the 
developer shall post a separate bond to guarantee payment of fire hydrant fees during the 
course of construction. The bond shall be posted at the same time and in the same manner as 
performance bonds for other improvements are posted pursuant to chapter 62, except that no 
cash portion or inspection fees shall be required. The bond shall be posted for a period of two 
years, which period shall be extended in the same manner as other performance bonds are 
extended pursuant to chapter 62. No performance bonds, including the fire hydrant bonds, shall 
be released until all hydrant fees have been paid. 
a. ?The amount to be bonded for fire hydrant fees shall be calculated as follows: 
1. ?Total number of fire hydrants for the development times $371.10 per hydrant times 
five (average number of years for buildout) for developments of 125 homes/units or 
more; or 
2. ?Total number of fire hydrants for the development times $371.10 per hydrant times 
three (average number of years for buildout) for developments of less than 125 
homes/units. 
b. ?Where development is in phases or sections, the fire hydrant fee bonds shall be posted by 
phase or section for the hydrants in that phase or section. 
(6) ?Billing for fire service during residential construction shall be in accordance with the following: 
a. ?Billing for fire hydrant fees shall commence on the date the water supervisor advises the 
water and sewer revenue division, in writing, that each individual hydrant has been tested 
and deemed operational. 
b. ?The fee for fire service shall be $371.10 per hydrant per year, payable in quarterly 
installments as billed by the water and sewer revenue division. 
c. ?The developer shall be responsible for payment of all fire hydrant fees until they are 
reduced or terminated as set forth in this subsection. 
d. ?Unpaid delinquent fire hydrant fees shall become a lien on real property and shall accrue 
interest in the same manner as permitted by law for real property taxes. The water and 
sewer revenue officer shall provide the information, and the tax search officer shall include 
unpaid fire hydrants fees in the tax search report for lots on which fire hydrants are located 
in single-family residential developments. Such fees shall be paid at the closing of title from 
the developer to the purchaser. 
(7) ?Reduction and termination of fire service billing and bonds shall be in accordance with the 
following: 
a. ?For single-family residential developments on streets to be dedicated to public use, when 
50 percent or more of the temporary and permanent certificates of occupancy have been 
issued for those lots on which the fire hydrants are located, and provided that the fire 
hydrant fees for all hydrants in the development, section, or phase, as the case may be, 
are paid, the developer may request the water and sewer revenue division to reduce the 
hydrant billing by 50 percent for the development, phase, or section, as the case may be. 
Such a request shall be in writing, with copies to the township engineer and township clerk. 
Upon receipt of confirmation that the certificates of occupancy have been issued for the 
hydrant lots and that all fees are paid up to date, the water and sewer revenue supervisor 
shall direct that the hydrant billing be reduced by 50 percent. The effect of the reduction 
shall be that billing shall terminate for those hydrants on the lots with temporary or 
permanent certificates of occupancy which are enumerated in the reduction request, and 
the remaining hydrants shall be billed in full ("the reduced bill"). The township council may 
authorize, by resolution, a corresponding 50 percent reduction in the fire hydrant fee bond 
if requested in writing by the developer. The developer shall be responsible for payment of 
the reduced bill until development is complete and the public improvements, including the 
fire hydrants, have been accepted by the township. No further reductions shall be granted 
prior to release of all performance bonds, including the fire hydrant fee bonds. 
b. ?For private communities where improvements are constructed to township specifications 
for public improvements and the developer has granted easements to the township to 
access and service water mains and fire hydrants, the developer may request, in writing, a 
50 percent reduction in hydrant billing when 50 percent or more of all temporary and 
permanent certificates of occupancy have been issued for the development, phase, or 
section, as the case may be, in which the hydrants are located and provided that the 
hydrant fees for all hydrants in the development, phase, or section are paid. The same 
procedure for billing reduction and bond reduction shall be followed as is set forth in 
subsection (f)(7)a. of this section for single-family residences. The obligation for payment 
of the reduced bill by the developer or the homeowners' association, as agreed between 
those parties, shall continue until the development, phase, or section, as the case may be, 
has been turned over to the homeowners' association for management and control 
pursuant to N.J.S.A. 46:8B-12.1d. The developer shall notify the water and sewer revenue 
division, in writing, of the date control is transferred. Thereafter, the fire hydrants shall be 
deemed to be public improvements for billing purposes and shall be maintained by the 
township. The developer may also request release of the fire hydrant fee bond upon 
transfer of control to the homeowners' association, provided that all fire hydrant fees billed 
to the developer, including any arrearages and accrued interest thereon, are paid in full at 
the time of the request. 
c. ?For existing private communities and those private communities under construction where 
control has been turned over to a homeowners' association at the time of adoption of the 
ordinance from which this subsection is derived, where improvements are not constructed 
to township specifications for public improvements and/or no easements exist giving the 
township access to water lines and fire hydrants, each private community shall continue to 
be billed for the private fire hydrants but shall be reimbursed for the full cost of fire hydrant 
service pursuant to the spirit of the Condominium Services Act, N.J.S.A. 40:67-23.2 et seq. 
The private community shall remain responsible for maintenance of the private hydrants, 
which shall not be deemed to be public improvements by reason of this subsection. The 
water and sewer revenue supervisor may, with the approval of the utility collector, 
terminate billing for private fire hydrants for the private communities which are the subject 
of this subsection in lieu of collecting fees for the private hydrants and refunding the same 
amounts pursuant to the spirit of the Condominium Services Act. However, no private 
community subject to this subsection shall be eligible for reimbursement of private hydrant 
fees incurred prior to January 1, 1996. Only those private communities whose fire hydrant 
billing is paid up to date, including all arrearages and accrued interest, to and including 
service to December 31, 1995, shall be eligible for termination/reimbursement pursuant to 
this subsection. 
d. ?Reduction of the billing and/or the hydrant fee bond pursuant to subsections (f)(7)a. and 
(f)(7)b. of this section shall not be construed as acceptance by the township of any 
improvement, including the fire hydrants. Such acceptance shall only occur by operation of 
law upon release of the performance bonds in the case of single-family residence 
developments or as described in subsection (f)(7)b. of this section for certain private 
communities. 
(8) ?The provisions of subsections (f)(5), (6), and (7) of this section shall apply to all residential 
development for which preliminary approval is granted on or after October 1, 1995. Developers 
of residential properties which have received at least preliminary approval prior to October 1, 
1995, and who wish to avail themselves of the billing reduction provisions of subsection (f)(7) of 
this section, may request in writing that the water and sewer revenue division apply those 
provisions to their fire hydrant billing. Prior to subsection (f)(7) of this section taking effect as 
requested for a particular development, phase, or section, however, the developer shall: 
a. ?Post the appropriate fire hydrant fee bond pursuant to subsection (f)(5) of this section; 
b. ?Pay all fire hydrant fees, including arrearages and accrued interest, to the effective date of 
the reduction; and 
c. ?If the request includes a request for reduction in billing pursuant to subsection (f)(7)a. or 
(f)(7)b. of this section, provide the water and sewer revenue division with a list of the lot 
numbers on which fire hydrants are located in single-family developments, with an 
indication of which of those lots have had certificates of occupancy issued or, for private 
communities, the number of certificates of occupancy issued as of the date of the request 
and the total number of units in the development. Where development of single-family 
residences or private communities is by phase or section, the information regarding 
certificates of occupancy shall be provided for the phase or section to which the provisions 
of subsection (f)(7) of this section are to be applied. 
(g) ?Hydrant use permits. Hydrant use permits are required as follows: 
(1) ?Metered water. A permit for metered water from a hydrant shall be obtained in accordance with 
the following: 
a. ?The use of water for building purposes and other construction directly in connection 
therewith by the builder, contractor or agent shall be metered. It shall be unlawful for any 
person, other than an employee of the department of utilities, the police department, the 
fire companies of the township, volunteer companies of those bordering the township for 
public purposes and volunteer fire companies from other townships under the direction of a 
township volunteer fire company, to operate or take water from any hydrants owned by the 
township. All customers making application for a five-eighths-inch construction meter shall 
obtain and complete a form from the water operations division. Upon completion and 
approval, the applicant will submit this form and shall pay a service fee of $65.00, plus a 
deposit of $250.00 to the water and sewer revenue division prior to the issuance of a 
hydrant use permit. The permit shall be issued by the water operations division upon 
presentation of a paid receipt for the fee and deposit. This permit will be valid for one year 
only, at which time the meter must be returned for a final reading and a final billing. Upon 
return of the meter, a report shall be submitted to the water and sewer revenue division 
from the water operations division. This report shall include all pertinent information relating 
to the applicant and meter, including the customer, the date and reading when the meter 
was returned. The water and sewer revenue division will calculate the billing based on 
such report. Upon payment of the bill, a voucher shall be prepared and submitted for 
refund of the deposit to the applicant. 
b. ?If renewal of a meter is requested, within the one-year timeframe allowed, an additional 
service fee of $65.00 will be required, as well as payment of all outstanding charges. The 
original deposit of $250.00 shall continue to be held by the water and sewer revenue 
division. 
c. ?If the meter is not returned within the one year allowed or is lost or stolen, the applicant will 
be responsible for the cost and replacement of the meter, no refund will be executed, and 
the meter base water charge and a service charge will be collected until the date of the 
police report documenting such theft or the date of a report from the water operations 
division documenting the date of such loss. 
(2) ?Unmetered water. If a permit is issued where a meter is not deemed necessary, the gallonage 
that is estimated to be used will be charged at the rate of $2.45 per 1,000 gallons but not less 
than $61.32 per permit. 
(h) ?Swimming pools. The charge for filling swimming pools shall be at the rate of $4.09 per 1,000 
gallons, but not less than $36.71 per pool. Pool filling will be performed by the appropriate fire 
company. 
(i) ?Fee for final readings. $30.00

Sec. 114-63. - Sewer charges. 
(a) ?Connection fees. Fees for sewer connections shall be charged as follows: 
(1) ?All sanitary sewer connections made to the sewer system by the applicant shall be made at the 
applicant's expense. All other fees will be charged and payable by the applicant. 
(2) ?No connection fee shall be charged for connections provided as part of a group line of a project 
under a sewer assessment ordinance, which are included in the project engineer's certification 
of costs for the project. The township engineer will petition property owners of assessment lines 
prior to construction to determine those interested in connecting to the system. Interested 
property owners must respond within 30 days and pay the applicable facility and service fees. 
During this time all connection fees will be waived. Any request to connect to the assessment 
line after the 30-day period will require payment of the applicable rates for the facility and 
service fees. Within 60 days from the completion date of the installed line, it will be mandatory 
for the applicant to make application for a plumbing permit and connect into the township 
system. 
(b) ?Facility charge. The sewer facility charge shall be as follows: 
(1) ?All applicants for connection to the sewer system will be required to pay a facility charge 
representing a fair-share payment toward the capital costs of the existing sewer system. All 
applicants will be required to pay a facility charge based on each equivalent residential unit 
(ERU) times the sewer facility charge for residential units at the rate of $5,078.00 per ERU. 
Notwithstanding the preceding, an equivalent residential unit (ERU) shall be as calculated in 
accordance with state statutes. This charge shall be paid at the time of application for 
connection. 
(2) ?At the time of submitting an application for service, the nonindividual residential applicant will 
be required to submit an estimate of the anticipated maximum day demand on the system. 
(3) ?For applicants other than single-family residential units, the sewer connection or extension 
application (TWA form), approved by the engineer, shall be submitted. This flow shall, subject to 
the review and modification by the director of utilities, be used to determine the equivalent 
residential units (ERUs) per structure for the purpose of calculating the facility charge as 
described in subsection (b)(1) of this section. 
(4) ?If, during the three years subsequent to connection, the average daily flow exceeds the original 
estimate in the TWA form by more than ten percent, the then-current owner of the structure will 
be required to pay an additional facility charge, which will be that amount equal to the ERU or 
portion thereof based on excess usage times the sewer facility charge then in effect. 
(5) ?Expansion or change of an existing use through construction which requires a building permit 
and which increases use by 200 gallons or more per day or 73,000 gallons or more per year will 
require payment of a facility charge based on the increase in usage and will be considered as a 
new application for service. Estimates of the increased use are required and subject to the 
provisions for new uses set forth in this subsection. 
(c) ?Initial service charge. Each new sanitary sewer user shall pay an initial service charge of $65.00 per 
unit at the time of application for service, building permit or plumbing permit to the township. 
Thereafter, the rates contained in this section for sanitary sewer service shall apply. New users 
applying for both water and sewer service at the same time shall pay one charge of $75.00. Student 
dormitories or buildings consisting of five units or more shall be calculated on the basis of $65.00 per 
building metered. If units are individually metered, the service charge of $65.00 per unit metered

(4) ?The strength of wastewater discharged into the sewer system by industrial users shall be 
determined from test samples taken of the industries' wastewater discharges, in accordance 
with accepted sampling and testing procedures. The weight of excess pollutants, in pounds per 
quarter, shall be determined by the application of the excess sewage strength, in milligrams per 
liter, to the quarterly flows, as determined elsewhere in this division, in million gallons times the 
factor of 8.345 pounds per gallon. The testing for sewage strength shall be done by a state-
licensed laboratory. 
(5) ?Industrial and commercial users which have been identified as special waste dischargers or 
high-strength users or both, by one of the regional sewerage or utility authorities of which the 
township is a member or customer, shall be assessed a special waste charge and/or high-
strength user charge, which will be billed to the user on a monthly or quarterly basis, as 
determined by the utility collector. The special waste charge shall be calculated at 140 percent 
of the special waste charge allocated to the user and billed to the township by either of the 
regional sewerage authorities of which the township is a member. The special waste charge 
billed by the authority to the township is based upon the authority's costs in its current year's 
budget to cover monitoring, testing and allocated administrative costs and to reflect the 
authority's exposure to risk in accepting special waste. The additional percentage billed by the 
township to the user over and above that for which the township is billed by the authority 
represents the township's cost to cover monitoring, testing, maintenance, administrative costs 
and to reflect the township's exposure to risk in accepting special waste. Bills to industrial and 
commercial users under this subsection shall supersede any charge which otherwise would be 
billed to the user by the township under the subsection (g) of this section which pertains to 
surcharge rates. 
(g) ?Surcharge rates. Large users shall be surcharged for the actual BOD in excess of 300 milligrams 
per liter, the actual SS in excess of 300 milligrams per liter, the actual S in excess of 30 milligrams 
per liter and the actual CD in excess of 15 milligrams per liter. The chargeable rates of BOD, SS, S, 
CD, TKN and P, as calculated, shall be used as the surcharge rate. 
(h) ?Swim club pools. The charge to swim club pools for discharging into the sanitary sewer system shall 
be based on the rate of $48.46 for the first 10,000 gallons of water used and $4.04 per 1,000 gallons' 
overage or $86.16 per quarter, whichever is greater, except that swim club pools may apply for 
installation of a product meter in accordance with subsection (i)(3) of this section. 
(i) ?Partial service. Commercial or industrial consumers obtaining partial service from the township shall 
submit plans for the placement of meters for determining sewer charges to the township engineer for 
approval in accordance with the following: 
(1) ?When the township does not provide the water supply but does provide sewer service, a meter, 
approved by the township, shall be furnished and installed by the owner, at the owner's 
expense, and shall be so located that it will measure all water used which is eventually 
discharged into the township's sewer system. The quarterly charge shall be equal to that 
determined by application of the charges listed in this section. 
(2) ?When the township provides only a part of the water consumed but does provide the only 
sewer service to the premises, a separate meter, approved by the township, shall be furnished 
and installed by the owner, at the owner's expense, and shall be so located that it will measure 
all water used from the private source of supply and which is discharged into the township's 
sewer system, in addition to the meter installed on the service connection supplied by the 
township. The charge for sewer service shall be equal to that determined by the application of 
the rates in this section to the sum of the water meter readings, considered as though all water 
service was furnished by the township. 
(3) ?When the township furnished all of the water consumed, but only part of the water consumed is 
discharged into the township's sewer system, the piping shall be so arranged that the portion of 
the water consumed which is not eventually discharged into the sewer system shall be 
separately metered by a township-purchased meter, installed and approved by the township but 
purchased at the expense of the owner. The charge for sewer service shall be equal that 
determined by the application of the rates in this section to the net amount discharged into the 
sewer system. 
(4) ?When the township furnished only part of the water consumed and does not provide the only 
sewer service for the premises, meters, approved by the township, shall be furnished and 
installed by the owner, at the owner's expense, and shall be so located as to determine the 
quantity of water supplied from the private source and also so located as to meter that portion of 
the total water supplied which is not eventually discharged into the township's sewer system. 
The charge for sewer service shall be equal to that determined by the application of the rates in 
this section to the net quantity discharged into the sewer system. 
(5) ?Where sewer meters are used, copies of all flow data charts will be filed with the sewer 
supervisor monthly. 
(6) ?All meters used for measuring sewage flow will be certified as to their accuracy yearly or 
sooner if requested by the township, at the expense of the user. Certifications must be filed with 
the sewer supervisor. 
(j) ?Sewer line disconnection. The fee for the closing of a sewer line or lateral to a building shall be 
$100.00 for a temporary disconnection for a period not exceeding one year and $200.00 for a 
permanent disconnection. This fee is to be paid upon application for a demolition permit. 
(k) ?Strength measurement. Measurement of strength of sewage for commercial and industrial users 
shall be as follows: 
(1) ?Commercial and industrial users' sewage shall be monitored, as required, by sewage sampling 
to determine the wastewater strength and characteristics. The characteristics of the sewage 
shall be determined from actual sampling or other approved means and shall be based upon an 
analysis made in accordance with the procedures outlined in the latest edition of Standard 
Methods for the Examination of Water and Wastewater, published by the American Public 
Health Association, the American Water Works Association, and the Water Environment 
Federation. The township may require the installation and maintenance of automatic samplers, 
at the expense of the property owner, to obtain representative samples during a calendar 
quarter or as may be required. The number of samples collected for billing for extra-strength 
sewage charges shall not be less than five per calendar quarter. 
(2) ?Excess BOD, SS, CD, S, TKN and P weight will be determined and charged by the following

such trees, the cost of the posts and boxes or guards used for their protection and the cost of the 
removal of any tree or part thereof dangerous to public safety shall, if the commission shall so 
determine in accordance with uniform rules and regulations promulgated for this purpose, be a 
charge upon the real estate in front of which the tree shall be planted or removed as an improvement 
thereof. Such cost, if it is so determined that it shall be paid by the owner, shall be determined by the 
commission, shall be certified by it to the township tax collector, and shall thereafter become and be 
a lien upon the real estate. It shall be included in the next tax bill rendered to the owner thereof and

ordinances. 
(b) ?In addition to the fine authorized by subsection (a) of this section, any person who removes or 
otherwise destroys a tree in violation of a municipal ordinance may also be required to pay a 
replacement assessment to the township. The replacement assessment shall be the value of the 
removed/destroyed tree plus the installation cost of the replacement tree. The value of the 
removed/destroyed tree shall be the value of the tree as determined by the appraisal of a trained 
forester or certified tree expert retained by the commission for that purpose. In lieu of an appraisal by 
a trained forester, the commission may adopt a formula and schedule based upon the number of 
square inches contained in a cross section of the trunk of the tree multiplied by a predetermined 
value per square inch, not to exceed the value according to accepted current standards. The square 
inch cross section shall be calculated from the diameter at breast height and, if there is a multiple-
stem tree, each trunk shall be measured and an average shall be determined for the tree. For the 
purpose of this subsection, the term "diameter at breast height" shall mean the diameter of the tree 
taken at a point 4½ feet above ground level. The commission shall modify the value of the tree 
based upon its species variety, its location and its condition at the time of removal or destruction.

hedges or other plant life, and the cost shall be computed and given to the township manager. The 
township manager shall examine this certificate of costs and, if found correct, shall cause the cost as 
shown thereon to be charged against the lands. The amount so charged shall forthwith become a 
lien upon such lands and shall be added to and form part of the taxes next to be assessed and 
levied upon such lands, to bear interest at the same rate as other taxes, and shall be collected and 
enforced by the same officers and in the same manner as taxes. 
(b) ?Subsection (a) of this section is in addition to penalties for violation, which may be assessed under

ARTICLE IV. - TREES 


Sec. 118-121. - Purpose. 
    The township council, having found that indiscriminate, uncontrolled and excessive destruction, 
removal and cutting of trees upon lots and tracts of land within the township causes increased drainage 
control costs, increased soil erosion, decreased fertility of the soil, increased buildup of atmospheric 
carbon and increased dust tending to decrease property values, all of which render land unfit and 
unsuitable for its most appropriate use and adversely affects the health, safety and general welfare of the 
inhabitants of the township, desires in this article to regulate and control indiscriminate and excessive 
cutting of trees within the township; preserve the maximum possible number of trees in the course of 
development of a site; protect larger, older specimens of trees; and provide a plan for replacement of 
trees. 
(Code 1988, § 240-1)

poorest specimens of trees so as to permit land development while retaining the maximum number of 
larger and healthier specimens of trees. 
    Average wooded acre means the average wooded acre at a site, which shall be determined as 
follows: 
(1) ?A selective inventory, by size and species, of all trees having a DPM of six inches or greater 
shall be conducted using a minimum of one-tenth-acre plots, which shall be staked or visibly 
marked to allow for township inspection. 
(2) ?The location of the inventory plots shall be determined by the applicant, subject to township 
approval, by using a grid overlay drawn to the same scale as the site plan submitted with the 
application. 
(3) ?A representative five percent of the wooded acres proposed to be cleared shall be inventoried. 
Where two acres or less are proposed to be cleared, a minimum of one-tenth acre shall be 
inventoried. 
    Board means the municipal agency, either the planning board or zoning board of adjustment, which 
has jurisdiction over the proposed land development application. 
    Clearcutting means the removal of all standing trees on a lot or portion of a lot.

yield of crops while using acceptable farming methods. Prime farmland produces the highest yields and 
requires minimal amounts of energy and economic resources, and farming it results in the least damage 
to the environment. 
    Replacement plan means a specific plan for replacement of removed trees in accordance with the 
provisions of this article. 
    Replacement tree means a warranted nursery-grown, certified tree properly balled and marked with

by measuring the largest diameter stem at a point six inches above the crotch or point of separation of the 
multistemmed tree. Multistems occurring four feet above the ground or higher shall be treated as a single-
stem tree. Any species not qualifying as a tree under this definition shall be considered a stem and shall 
not fall within the purview of this article. 
    Wooded acres permitted for development means those wooded lands within a lot or tract which are 
not specifically excluded by any federal, state, county or municipal law or ordinance; deed restriction; or 
covenant running with the land. For purposes of this article, those lands specifically eliminated from 
consideration as wooded acres permitted for development include but are not limited to wetlands as

b. ?Any trees with a DBH of 16 inches or greater left standing in areas designated for removal 
or trees planted in compliance with other requirements of this Code shall be credited 
against the total replacement count in the same number as the number of replacement 
trees which are required by tree size as set forth in the table in subsection (b)(2)a. of this 
section. The species or type of replacement trees shall be selected from the shade tree 
commission list in section 62-154(g)(7) or shall be the same as the species removed from 
the tract under consideration. 
(3) ?In lieu of planting all of the replacement trees on site, the planning department may permit the 
applicant to contribute an amount equal to the current cost of each replacement tree not 
planted, as determined by the planning department to a fund established by the township for 
tree preservation and tree plantings on any publicly owned property. The developer may apply 
this option to up to 40 percent of the required number of replacement trees; all requests to make 
contributions in lieu of planting replacement trees in excess of 40 percent of the required 
number of replacement trees must be approved by the planning department. Payment of the 
cash portion of the tree removal obligation is required prior to: 
a. ?The final plan or deed sign off by the board secretary; or, 
b. ?The issuance of a building permit; or, 
c. ?The disturbance of land; 
Whichever of these conditions are earliest. 
(4) ?Where an applicant claims that the cost of the required number of replacement trees, as 
determined by the formula in subsection (b)(1) of this section, would impose a hardship, the 
board may, in its discretion, reduce the required number of replacement trees by ten percent of 
the total obligation as determined by subsection (b)(1) of this section. In support of such a claim, 
the applicant shall submit written cost estimates from three sources for board review. Each 
estimate shall include the species, size, number and price of the replacement trees. As to each 
request for relief pursuant to this subsection, the board shall consider the following: 
a. ?Unique natural features such as topography, drainage, aquifer recharge soils, wetlands 
and floodplains, stands of rare or substantially mature trees, and the like. 
b. ?The location of necessary improvements. 
c. ?The extent of lands to be dedicated to the township. 
d. ?The legal status of the applicant, such as profit-making, nonprofit, charitable, or 
quasimunicipal volunteer organizations such as fire companies and rescue squads. 
e. ?Whether the relief can be granted without substantial detriment to the public good and will 
not substantially impair the intent and purpose of this article. 
(c) ?Where development is to take place in stages, phases, sections or other similarly delayed manner, 
the applicant shall: 
(1) ?Submit all information required in subsection (a) of this section for the tract to be developed at 
the time of initial application for major subdivision or site plan approval, together with the 
application fee based upon the section of the tract to be developed. Permits shall be issued on 
a section-by-section basis. 
(2) ?Before removal of any trees in a specific stage, phase or section, submit the inventory and

equally visible and protective device installed along the dripline of the trees but not less than six feet 
from the tree trunks. 
(b) ?The grade of the land located along the dripline shall not be raised or lowered more than six inches,

using trees with a minimum DPM of 1¾ inches, for accidentally removed or damaged trees which 
have a DBH from eight to less than 16 inches and in accordance with subsection (b)(2) of this

be approval of a request for reduction in the number of replacement trees. All requests for 
reduction in the number of replacement trees must be specifically approved by the board. 
(b) ?The planning department may refer the application to the environmental commission for its report

(6) ?Giving false or misleading information to passengers; drivers to use most direct route. No driver 
of a taxicab shall induce any person to employ him by knowingly misinforming or misleading

(5) ?The charges for the towing and storage and the times during which the vehicle may be 
redeemed; and 
(6) ?Contact information for the Division of Consumer Affairs (1-800-242-5864 prompt #4). 
(b) ?The property owner and the tow company have a contract for the towing and the property 
owner has authorized the towing company to remove the particular vehicle. 
(c) ?The requirements do not apply to a single-family home or an owner-occupied multi-unit 
structure, and the signage requirements are different for a residential community with clearly 
marked assigned spaces for residents. 
(d) ?The Predatory Towing Prevention Act and this section further prohibit towing companies from 
the following: 
(1) ?Failing to release a vehicle hooked or lifted, but not actually removed from private 
property, upon request of the vehicle's owner; 
(2) ?Paying for information about vehicles parked without authorization; 
(3) ?Refusing to accept an insurance company check or a debit card, charge card, credit card 
or personal check for towing or storage services; if the towing company ordinarily accepts 
such payment at its place of business.

ordinances which precede December 15, 1993, but which were never included in the 1975 
Revised General Ordinances or the 1988 Code, as supplemented, for various reasons. Ordinances 
adopted since December 15, 1993, and not listed herein, have been omitted as repealed,
