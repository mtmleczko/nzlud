PREFACE 
    This Code constitutes a complete republication of the general and permanent ordinances of the City of Tupelo, Mississippi. 
    Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the ordinances adopted by the city council. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this Code, the reader can locate any section of any ordinance included herein. 
    The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order, and the various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Notes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state law have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this Code. 
Chapter and Section Numbering System 
    The chapter and section numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and local government codes. Each section number consists of two parts separated by a dash. The figure before the dash refers to the chapter number, and the figure after the dash refers to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the second section of chapter 1 is numbered 1-2, and the first section of chapter 6 is 6-1. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter, and at the same time new sections can be inserted in their proper place by using the decimal system for amendments. For example, if new material consisting of one section that would logically come between sections 6-1 and 6-2 is desired to be added, such new section would be numbered 6-1.5. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject. The next successive number shall be assigned to the new article or division. New chapters may be included by using one of the reserved chapter numbers. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. 
Page Numbering System 
    The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The numbers to the left of the colon represent a certain portion of the volume. The number to the right of the colon represents the number of the page in that portion. In the case of a chapter of the Code, the number to the left of the colon indicates the number of the chapter. In the case of an appendix to the Code, the letter immediately to the left of the colon indicates the letter of the appendix. The following are typical parts of codes of ordinances, which may or may not appear in this Code at this time, and their corresponding prefixes: 
CHARTER CHT:1 CHARTER COMPARATIVE TABLE CHTCT:1 CODE 1:1 CODE APPENDIX A:1 CODE COMPARATIVE TABLES CCT:1 STATE LAW REFERENCE TABLE SLT:1 CHARTER INDEX CHTi:1 CODE INDEX CDi:1 LAND DEVELOPMENT CODE INDEX LDCi:1  
Indexes 
    The indexes have been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the indexes themselves which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which the user is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
    A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up-to-date. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited, and the affected page or pages will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the republication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
    Keeping this republication up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the republication. As revised pages are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
Acknowledgments 
    This publication was under the direct supervision of W. Eric Grant, Vice-President, Elizabeth Buutler and Janet Cramer, Editors, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida. Credit is gratefully given to the other members of the publisher's staff for their sincere interest and able assistance throughout the project. 
    The publisher is most grateful to Daphne Holcombe, Chief Financial Officer, and the other members of the city staff for their cooperation and assistance during the progress of the work on this publication. It is hoped that their efforts and those of the publisher have resulted in a Code of Ordinances which will make the active law of the city readily accessible to all citizens and which will be a valuable tool in the day-to-day administration of the city's affairs.

Comments from each person shall be limited to five (5) minutes, unless otherwise voted upon by the council, and questions and answers from the council shall not count against the citizen's time Comments also may be submitted in writing prior to or during the public hearing.

Unless otherwise provided by law (or policy as applicable), requests for such appeals must be made in writing and filed with the city clerk, the clerk of the council or the council president within forty-five (45) days after the action or order being appealed.

Personnel grievances and appeals shall be handled by the executive branch and shall not be heard by the council. 
(3)  Citizen hearing. Any citizen of the city, business owner or property owner within the city, may request that a matter be placed on the agenda for the purpose of bringing a matter before the city council for subsequent council action provided that he or she submits a written and signed request to the council president or the mayor describing the nature of his or her request. Such request must be received before 5:00 p.m. on Thursday prior to the next scheduled council meeting.

(Ord. of 4-19-05(1), § V) 
Sec. 2-136. - Designation of landmarks, landmark sites, and historic districts. 
    By ordinance, the City of Tupelo may establish landmarks, landmark sites, and historic districts within the area of its jurisdiction. Such landmarks, landmark sites, or historic districts shall be designated following the criteria as specified in section 2-132. 
(1)  The commission shall initiate a continuing and thorough investigation of the archaeological, architectural, cultural, and historic significance of the City of Tupelo's resources. The findings shall be collected in a cohesive format, made a matter of public record, and made available for public inspection. The commission shall work toward providing complete documentation for locally designated historic districts that would include: 
a.  An inventory of all property within the boundary of the district, with photographs of each building and an evaluation of its significance to the district. Building evaluations are to be used only as a reference or guide and shall not be used as the determining factor for issuing or denying a certificate or appropriateness. 
b.  An inventory which would be in format consistent with the statewide inventory format of the Historic Preservation Division of the Mississippi Department of Archives and History (SHPO). 
(2)  The commission shall advise the City of Tupelo on the designation of historic districts, landmarks, or landmark sites and submit or cause to be prepared ordinances to make such designation. 
(3)  A resource or resources may be nominated for designation upon motion of three (3) members of the commission or by an organization interested in historic preservation or by an owner of the property being nominated. A nomination shall contain information as specified by the commission. The commission must reach a decision on whether to recommend a proposed nomination to the City of Tupelo within six (6) months in the case of a historic district and two (2) months in the case of either a landmark or landmark site. 
(4)  If the commission votes to recommend to the City of Tupelo the designation of a proposed resource, it promptly forwards to the City of Tupelo its recommendation, in writing, together with an accompanying file.

The Mississippi Department of Archives and History may comment by letter, telephone, e-mail or in person through designated staff. The City of Tupelo shall provide to the Mississippi Department of Archives and History the dates of the next two (2) public meetings at which action on the designation of such a district might be taken so that the Mississippi Department of Archives and History may comment in a timely manner. Failure of the Mississippi Department of Archives and History to comment by the date of the second such meeting shall relieve the City of Tupelo of any responsibility for awaiting and responding to such analysis, and the City of Tupelo may at any time thereafter take any necessary action to create the proposed historic district. 
a.  If a proposed ordinance is to designate a landmark or landmark site, it may be presented to the City of Tupelo with a recommendation that it be adopted without submission to the Mississippi Department of Archives and History.

An updated list and map shall be maintained by such agencies and made available to the public.

Sec. 2-137. - Certificates of appropriateness. 
    No exterior feature of any resource shall be altered, relocated, or demolished until after an application for a certificate of appropriateness of such work has been approved by the commission. Likewise, no construction which affects a resource shall be undertaken without a certificate of appropriateness. Therefore, 
(1)  The commission shall serve as a review body with the power to approve and deny applications for certificates of appropriateness. 
(2)  In approving and denying applications for certificates of appropriateness, the commission shall seek to accomplish the purposes of this article. 
(3)  A certification of appropriateness shall not be required for work deemed by the commission to be ordinary maintenance or repair of any resource. 
(4)  All decisions of the commission shall be in writing and shall state the findings of the commission, its recommendations, and the reasons therefore. 
(Ord. of 4-19-05(1), § VII) 
Sec. 2-138. - Criteria for issuance of certificates of appropriateness. 
    The commission and the City of Tupelo shall use the following criteria in granting or denying certificates of appropriateness: 
(1)  General factors: 
a.  Architectural design of existing building, structure, or appurtenance and proposed alteration; 
b.  Historical significance of the resource; 
c.  General appearance of the resource; 
d.  Condition of the resource; 
e.  Materials composing the resource; 
f.  Size of the resource; 
g.  The relationship of the above factors to, and their effect upon the immediate surroundings and, if within a historic district, upon the district as a whole and its architectural and historical character and integrity. 
(2)  New construction: 
a.  In advance of new construction, steps shall be taken to insure evaluation of possible archaeological resources, as set forth in the Mississippi Antiquities Act. 
b.  The following aspects of new construction shall be visually compatible with the buildings and environment with which the new construction is visually related, including but not limited to: The height, the gross volume, the proportion between width and height of the facade(s), the proportions and relationship between doors and windows, the rhythm of solids to voids created by openings in the facade, the materials, the textures, the colors, the patterns, the trims, and the design of the roof. 
c.  Existing rhythm created by existing building masses and spaces between them shall be preserved. 
d.  The landscape plan shall be compatible with the resource, and it shall be visually compatible with the environment with which it is visually related. Landscaping shall also not prove detrimental to the fabric of a resource, or adjacent public or private improvements like sidewalks and walls. 
e.  No specific architectural style shall be required. 
(3)  Exterior alteration: 
a.  All exterior alterations to a building, structure, object, site, or landscape feature shall be compatible with the resource itself and other resources with which it is related, as is provided in section 2-138(1) and (2), and the original design of a building, structure, object, or landscape feature shall be considered in applying these standards. 
b.  Exterior alterations shall not affect the architectural character or historic quality of a landmark and shall not destroy the significance of landmark sites. 
(4)  In considering an application for the demolition of a landmark or a resource within a historic district, the following shall be considered:

Replacement plans for this purpose shall include, but shall not be restricted to, project concept, preliminary elevations and site plans, and completed working drawings for at least the foundation plan which will enable the applicant to receive a permit for foundation construction. 
f.  Applicants that have received a recommendation for demolition shall be permitted to receive such demolition permit without additional commission action on demolition, following the commission's recommendation of a permit for new construction. Permits for demolition and construction shall be issued simultaneously if requirements of section 2-138(2), are met, and the applicant provides financial proof of his ability to complete the project. 
g.  When the commission recommends approval of demolition of a resource, a permit shall not be issued until all plans for the site have received approval from all appropriate City of Tupelo boards, commissions, departments and agencies. 
(Ord. of 4-19-05(1), § VIII) 
Sec. 2-139. - Procedures appropriateness for issuance of certificates of appropriateness. 
    Anyone desiring to take action requiring a certificate of appropriateness concerning a resource for which a permit, variance, or other authorization from either the City of Tupelo building official or the City of Tupelo is also required, shall make application therefore in the form and manner required by the applicable code section or ordinance. Any such application shall also be considered an application for a certificate of appropriateness and shall include such additional information as may be required by the commission. After receipt of any such application, the City of Tupelo building official shall be assured that the application is proper and complete. No building permit shall be issued by the City of Tupelo building official which affects a resource without a certificate of appropriateness. In the event that a building permit need not be obtained for a building, structure, or object to be erected within a historic district or on a landmark or landmark site, a certificate of appropriateness is still required before such building, structure, or object may be erected. Thereafter, such application shall be reviewed in accordance with the following procedure: 
(1)  When any such application is filed, the City of Tupelo building official shall immediately notify the commission chairman or vice-chairman, if the chairman is unavailable, of the application having been filed. 
(2)  If at the time of filing of an application, there is not a commission meeting already scheduled within thirty (30) days of this filing, the chairman or vice-chairman shall set a time and date, which shall be not later than fifteen (15) days after the filing of the application for a hearing by the commission, and the City of Tupelo building official shall be so informed. 
(3)  The applicant shall, upon request, have the right to a preliminary conference with commission staff for the purpose of making any changes or adjustments to the application which might be more consistent with the commission's standards. 
(4)  Not later than eight (8) days before the date set for the said hearing, the City of Tupelo building official shall mail notice thereof to the applicant at the address in the application and to all members of the commission. 
(5)  Notice of the time and place of said hearing shall be given by publication in a newspaper having general circulation in the community at least ten (10) days before such hearing and/or by posting such notice on the bulletin board in the lobby of City of Tupelo Hall. 
(6)  At such hearing, the applicant for a certificate of appropriateness shall have the right to present any relevant evidence in support of the application. Likewise, the governing body shall have the right to present any additional relevant evidence in support of the application. 
(7)  The commission shall have the right to recommend changes and modifications to enable the applicant to meet the requirements of the commission. 
(8)  Within not more than twenty-one (21) days after the hearing on an application, the commission shall act upon it, either approving, denying, on [or] deferring action until the next meeting of the commission, giving consideration to the factors set forth in section 2-138 hereof. Evidence of approval of the application shall be by certificate of appropriateness issued by the commission and, whatever its decision, notice in writing shall be given to the applicant and the City of Tupelo building official. Whenever a local historic preservation commission shall deny or recommend denial of a certificate of appropriateness, the commission must state the reasons for such denial in writing. Thereafter, an applicant may resubmit a new application at any time, except that an applicant must wait six (6) months whenever an application for a certificate of appropriateness is denied for a landmark property of statewide or national significance and notice of any second or subsequent application must be sent to the Mississippi Department of Archives and History as well as to the local historic preservation commission. 
(9)  In all cases of applications affecting National Historic Landmarks, at least two-thirds ( 2/3 ) of the members of the commission must approve a certificate of appropriateness in order for it to be granted. 
(10)  The issuance of a certificate of appropriateness shall not relieve an applicant for a building permit, special use permit, variance, or other authorization from compliance with any other requirement or provision of the laws of the City of Tupelo concerning zoning, construction, repair, or demolition. 
(11)  Denial of a certificate of appropriateness shall be binding upon the City of Tupelo building inspector or the agency responsible for issuing building permits and shall prevent the issuance of other building permits for the same parcel until a certificate of appropriateness is approved. A certificate of appropriateness may be required for work which does not require a building permit. A certificate of appropriateness may be evidenced by either a written and dated letter to an owner or applicant or such a letter accompanied by a signed and dated stamp on the face of any and all architectural or project drawings prepared for a project. 
(12)  A certificate of appropriateness shall expire after six (6) months if work has not begun. 
(Ord. of 4-19-05(1), § IX) 
Sec. 2-140. - Unreasonable economic hardship. 
    When a claim of unreasonable economic hardship is made due to the effect of this article, the owner of record must present evidence sufficient to prove that as a result of the preservation commission's action he is unable to obtain a reasonable return or a reasonable beneficial use. The owner of record shall submit by affidavit to the commission for its review at least the following information: 
(1)  Date the property was acquired by its current owner;

(8)  Appraisals of the property obtained within the previous two (2) years; and 
(9)  Income and property tax factors affecting the property. 
    The preservation commission may require that an applicant furnish additional information relevant to its determination of unreasonable economic hardship. 
    The preservation commission may receive and consider studies and economic analyses from other City of Tupelo agencies and from private organizations relating to the property in question. 
    Should the commission determine that the owner's present return is not reasonable, it must consider whether there are other uses currently allowed that would provide a reasonable return and whether such a return could be obtained through investment in the property for rehabilitation purposes. 
    Should the applicant satisfy the commission that he will suffer an unreasonable economic hardship if a certificate of appropriateness is not approved, such certificate must be approved. 
(Ord. of 4-19-05(1), § X) 
Sec. 2-141. - Appeals. 
    An applicant who desires to appeal a decision of the preservation commission may appeal directly to the planning committee by notifying the planning department in compliance with Section 6.2.4 of the Development Code. An applicant who desires to appeal a decision of the planning committee may appeal directly to the City Council of the City of Tupelo by notifying the clerk of the city council within thirty (30) days after the decision is rendered by the planning committee.

Sec. 2-143. - Demolition by neglect. 
(a)  Any resource which is a landmark and all resources within a historic district shall be preserved by the owner or such other person or persons as may have the legal custody or control thereof against decay and deterioration and free from unreasonable structural defects. The owner or other person having legal custody and control thereof shall repair such resource if it is found to have one or more of the following defects: 
(1)  Deterioration to the extent that it creates or permits a hazardous or unsafe condition as determined by the City of Tupelo's building inspector. 
(2)  Deterioration, as determined by the building inspector, of a building characterized by one or more of the following:

e.  Members of walls or other vertical supports that are insufficient to carry imposed loads with safety; 
f.  Members of ceilings, roofs, ceiling and roof supports, or other horizontal members which sag, split, or buckle due to defective material, workmanship, or deterioration; 
g.  Members of ceilings, roofs, ceiling and roof supports, or other horizontal members that are insufficient to carry imposed loads with safety; 
h.  Fireplaces or chimneys which list, bulge, or settle due to defective material, workmanship, or deterioration; or 
i.  Any fault, defect, or condition in the building which renders the same structurally unsafe or not properly watertight. 
(b)  If the commission makes a preliminary determination that a resource is being demolished by neglect, it shall direct the City of Tupelo building official to notify the owner or owners of the resource of this preliminary determination, stating the reasons therefore, and shall give the owner of record thirty (30) days from the date of mailing of such notice or the posting thereof on the property, whichever comes later, to commence work to correct the specific defects as determined by the commission. 
Said notice shall be given as follows: 
(1)  By certified mail, restricted delivery, mailed to the last known address of the record owner or owners as listed on the City of Tupelo and/or county tax rolls; or 
(2)  If the above mailing procedure is not successful, notice shall be posted in a conspicuous, protected place on the resource. 
(c)  If the owner or owners fail to commence work within the time allotted as evidenced by a building permit, the commission shall notify the owner or owners in the manner provided above to appear at a public hearing before the commission at a date, time, and place to be specified in said notice, which shall be mailed or posted at least thirty (30) days before said hearing. For the purpose of insuring lawful notice, a hearing may be continued to a new date and time. The commission shall receive evidence on the issue of whether the subject resource should be repaired and the owner or owners may present evidence in rebuttal thereto. If, after such hearing, the commission shall determine that the resource is being demolished by neglect, it may direct the City of Tupelo building official to bring misdemeanor charges against the owner or owners if the necessary repairs are not completed within ninety (90) days of the determination by the commission that the subject building or structure is being demolished by neglect. 
(d)  The City of Tupelo, in addition to the powers specified in MCA 1972, § 21-19-11(1), as amended, if the Historic Preservation Division of the Department of Archives and History concurs, may make repairs necessary to correct demolition by neglect, and the cost of such repairs shall become a lien against the property in accordance with the Mississippi State Code of 1972 as amended. 
(Ord. of 4-19-05(1), § XIII) 
Sec. 2-144. - Public safety exclusion. 
    None of the provisions of this article shall be construed to prevent any action of construction, alteration, or demolition necessary to correct or abate the unsafe or dangerous condition of any resource, or part thereof, where such condition has been declared unsafe or dangerous by the City of Tupelo building official or the fire department and where the proposed actions have been declared necessary by such authorities to correct the said condition; provided, however, that only such work as is necessary to correct the unsafe or dangerous condition may be performed pursuant to this section. In the event any resource designated as a landmark or located within a historic district, shall be damaged by fire or other calamity to such an extent that it cannot be repaired and restored, it may be removed in conformity with normal permit procedures and applicable laws, provided that: 
(1)  The City of Tupelo building official concurs with the property owner that the resource cannot be repaired and restored and so notifies the commission in writing. 
(2)  The preservation commission, if in doubt after receiving such notification from the City of Tupelo building official, shall be allowed time to seek outside professional expertise from the state historic preservation office and/or an independent structural engineer before issuing a certificate of appropriateness for the demolition. The commission may indicate in writing by letter to the City of Tupelo building official that it will require a time period of up to thirty (30) days for this purpose, and, upon such notification to the City of Tupelo building official, this section shall be suspended until the expiration of such a delay period. 
(Ord. of 4-19-05(1), § XIV) 
Sec. 2-145. - Enforcement and penalties.

(1)  Civil penalty. 
a.  Any person who constructs, alters, relocates, or demolishes any resource in violation of this article shall be required to restore the resource to its appearance or setting prior to the violation. Any action to enforce this provision shall be brought by the City of Tupelo. This civil remedy shall be in addition to, and not in lieu of, any criminal prosecution and penalty. 
b.  If construction, alteration, or relocation of any resource occurs without a certificate of appropriateness, then the license of the company, individual, principal owner, or its or his successor in interest performing such construction, alteration, or relocation shall be revoked for a period of three (3) years. 
c.  If demolition of a resource occurs without a certificate of appropriateness, then any permits on subject property will be denied for a period of three (3) years. No permit will be issued for any structure or structures proposed for the same parcel which would require a footprint larger than the footprint of the demolished structure or structures. In addition, the owner must rebuild on the site using as much of the original building material as possible, and in general following the same form. In addition, unauthorized demolition of a portion of a structure shall not serve as justification for a demolition permit whenever it can be shown that restoration or rehabilitation would still be feasible. In addition, the applicant shall not be entitled to have issued to him by any City of Tupelo office a permit allowing any curb cuts on subject property for a period of three (3) years from and after the date of such demolition. 
d.  If a historic landmark or landmark site of statewide or national significance is demolished without review and approval by a local historic preservation commission, no permit for any construction on the parcel from which the landmark or landmark site has been removed may be issued for a period of up to twenty-four (24) months. 
e.  If demolition of a resource occurs without a certificate of appropriateness, then the license of the company, individual, principal owner, or its or his successor in interest performing such demolition shall be revoked for a period of five (5) years. 
(2)  Criminal penalty. Any persons, firm or corporation violating any provision of this ordinance shall be guilty of a misdemeanor, and each shall be deemed guilty of a separate violation for each day during which any violation hereof is committed. Upon conviction, each violation shall be fined not less than ten dollars ($10.00) nor more than five hundred dollars ($500.00). Each day that a violation continues to exist shall constitute a separate offense.

Sec. 2-146. - Appropriations. 
    The City of Tupelo is authorized to make appropriations to the commission necessary for the expenses of the operation of the commission and may make additional amounts available as necessary for the acquisition, restoration, preservation, operation, and management of historic properties. 
(Ord. of 4-19-05(1), § XVI) 
Sec. 2-147. - Title to property acquired. 
    All property acquired by funds appropriated by the City of Tupelo shall be acquired in the name of the City of Tupelo unless otherwise provided by the City of Tupelo. So long as owned by the City of Tupelo, properties may be maintained by or under the supervision and control of the City of Tupelo. However, all property acquired by the commission from funds other than those appropriated by the City of Tupelo may be acquired and held in the name of the commission, the City of Tupelo, or both. Whenever the commission shall hold title to properties in its own name, such properties shall be administered in accordance with this and other City of Tupelo ordinances. 
(Ord. of 4-19-05(1), § XVII) 
State Law reference- Authority of municipality regarding real property, MCA 1972, § 21-17-1. 
Sec. 2-148. - Non-restrictive clause. 
    Nothing in this article shall be construed to prevent the regulation or acquisition of property, improved or unimproved, by the State of Mississippi or any of its political subdivisions, agencies, or instrumentalities or by the United States of America or any of its political subdivisions, agencies, or instrumentalities. Furthermore, the City of Tupelo of hereby acknowledges that the Mississippi State Antiquities Law (MCA 1972, § 39-7-1 et seq., as amended in 1983), provides for the sensitive treatment of publicly owned property, improved or unimproved, shown to possess certain architectural, historical, or archaeological significance, which are designed by the Board of Trustees of the Mississippi Department of Archives and History as Mississippi Landmarks. Whenever the City of Tupelo proposes to rehabilitate, alter, or enlarge a Mississippi Landmark (or proposes similar actions which would affect a Mississippi Landmark), the City of Tupelo shall submit its plans to the Mississippi Department of Archives and History for review and compliance. 
(Ord. of 4-19-05(1), § XVIII) 
Sec. 2-149. - Disqualification of members by conflict of interests. 
    Because the City of Tupelo may possess few residents with "experience in the individual fields of history, architecture, architectural history, archaeology, urban planning, law, or real estate," and in order not to impair such residents from practicing their trade for hire, members of the commission are allowed to contract their services to an applicant for a certificate of appropriateness, and, when doing so, must expressly disqualify themselves from the commission during all discussions for that application. In such cases, the City of Tupelo shall, upon the request of the chairman of the commission or the vice-chairman in his stead, appoint a substitute member who is qualified in the same field as the disqualified member, and who will serve for that particular case only. If no qualified resident of the City of Tupelo is able to substitute for the disqualified member, the City of Tupelo may appoint, in this case only, a qualified substitute who is a resident of Mississippi but not a resident City of Tupelo. If any member of the commission must be disqualified due to a conflict of interest on a regular and continuing basis, the chairman or the vice-chairman, in his stead, shall encourage the member to resign his commission seat. Failing this resignation, and, if the commission member continues to enter into conflict of interest situations with the commission, the chairman or vice-chairman of the commission shall encourage the City of Tupelo to replace the member. Likewise, any member of the commission who has an interest in the property in question or in property within three hundred (300) feet of such a property, or who is employed with a firm that has been hired to aid the applicant in any matter whatsoever, or who has any proprietary, tenancy, or personal interest in a matter to be considered by the commission shall be disqualified from participating in the consideration of any request for a certificate of appropriateness involving such a property. In such cases, a qualified substitute shall be appointed as provided above.

(3)  This section does not apply to establishments which allow the consumption or sale of beer, light wine, and/or alcoholic beverages under the authority of any other state law or local code.

(5)  The property owner who leases property for an event shall comply with all state laws and local codes that govern the operation of an establishment which has an on-premises retailer's permit issued by the alcoholic beverage control division, including, but not limited to, chapters governing the hours of operation, the consumption of alcohol by minors, the presence of minors on the premises, entertainment, the conduct of patrons, and any disturbance of the peace. In addition to complying with all applicable chapters pertaining to on-premises retailers, no person may possess any beer, light wine, or alcoholic beverage in an open container, upon the premises permitted under this section (including the land, buildings, parking lot or other improvement under the possession or control of the property owner) except during the hours that establishments with on-premises retailer's permits are allowed to sell beer, light wine, or alcoholic beverages.

This section in no way limits or abrogates any other chapter. 
(6)  Any person violating the provisions of this section shall be guilty of a misdemeanor and may be fined not exceeding a sum of five hundred dollars ($500.00) for the first offense, or one thousand dollars ($1,000.00) for any subsequent offense, and/or sentenced to serve up to ninety (90) days in jail for the first offense, or up to six (6) months for any subsequent offense.

    The Legislature of the State of Mississippi has in Title 17, Chapter 1, Mississippi Code of 1972 Annotated delegated the responsibility to local government units to adopt regulations designed to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare of its citizenry. Therefore, the City Council of Tupelo, Mississippi does hereby adopt the following floodplain management regulations. 
(Ord. of 2-2-10(1), § 2) 
Sec. 11-2. - Findings of fact. 
(a)  Tupelo, Mississippi is subject to periodic inundation, which results in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare. 
(b)  These flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions, both inside and outside the identified special flood hazard areas, causing increases in flood heights and velocities and by the occupancy in flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods or hazardous to other lands which are inadequately elevated, floodproofed, or otherwise unprotected from flood damages. 
(Ord. of 2-2-10(1), § 2) 
Sec. 11-3. - Statement of purpose. 
    It is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to: 
(1)  Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety, and property due to water or erosion hazards, which result in damaging increases in erosion or in flood heights or velocities; 
(2)  Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction; 
(3)  Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural protective barriers which are involved in the accommodation of flood waters; 
(4)  Control filling, grading, dredging, and other development which may increase erosion or flood damage; and

(Ord. of 2-2-10(1), § 2) 
Sec. 11-4. - Objectives. 
    The objectives of this article are: 
(1)  To protect human life and health;

(4)  To minimize prolonged business interruptions; 
(5)  To minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located in floodplains; 
(6)  To help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of flood prone areas in such a manner as to minimize flood blight areas; and 
(7)  To ensure that potential homebuyers are notified that property is in a floodprone area. 
(Ord. of 2-2-10(1), § 2) 
Sec. 11-5. - Methods of reducing flood losses. 
    In order to accomplish its purposes, this chapter includes methods and provisions for: 
(1)  Restricting or prohibiting uses which are dangerous to health, safety, and property due to water or erosion hazards, or which result in damaging increases in erosion or in flood heights or velocities; 
(2)  Requiring that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction; 
(3)  Controlling the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural protective barriers, which help accommodate or channel flood waters;

Cross reference- Definitions and rules of construction generally, § 1-2. 

Sec. 11-6. - Definitions. 
    Unless specifically defined below, words or phrases used in this chapter shall be interpreted so as to give them the meaning they have in common usage and to give this chapter it's most reasonable application. 
    A Zone is the area of special flood hazard without base flood elevations determined. 
    A1-A30 and AE zone is the area of special flood hazard with base flood elevations determined. 
    Accessory structure (appurtenant structure) means a structure, which is located on the same parcel of property as the principal structure and the use of which is incidental to the use of the principal structure. Accessory structures should constitute a minimal investment, may not be used for human habitation, and be designed to have minimal flood damage potential. Examples of accessory structures are detached garages, carports, storage sheds, pole barns, and hay sheds. 
    Addition (to an existing building) means any walled and roofed expansion to the perimeter or height of a building. Any addition shall be considered new construction. If the addition is more than fifty (50) percent of the market value of the structure, then the addition and the existing structure are now new construction. 
    AH zone is an area of one percent chance of shallow flooding where depths are between one to three feet (usually shallow ponding), with base flood elevations shown. 
    AO zone is an area of one percent chance of shallow flooding where depths are between one to three feet (usually sheet flow on sloping terrain), with depth numbers shown. 
    Appeal means a request for a review of the Floodplain Administrator's interpretation of any provision of this chapter or a request for a variance. 
    AR/A1-A30, AR/AE, AR/AH, AR/AO, and AR/A zones are SFHAs that result from the decertification of a previously accredited flood protection system or levee that is in the process of being restored to provide a one percent chance or greater level of flood protection. After restoration is complete, these areas will still experience residual flooding from other flooding sources.

    Floodplain means any land area susceptible to being inundated by flood waters from any source. 
    Floodplain management means the operation of an overall program of corrective and preventive measures for reducing flood damage and preserving and enhancing, where possible, natural resources in the floodplain, including but not limited to emergency preparedness plans, flood control works, floodplain management regulations, and open space plans. 
    Floodplain administrator is the individual appointed to administer and enforce the floodplain management regulations. 
    Floodplain management regulations means this chapter and other zoning ordinances, subdivision regulations, building codes, health regulations, special purpose ordinances, and other applications of police power which control development in flood-prone areas. This term describes federal, state, or local regulations in any combination thereof, which provide standards for preventing and reducing flood loss and damage. 
    Floodproofing means any combination of structural and nonstructural additions, changes, or adjustments to structures, which reduce or eliminate flood damages to real estate or improved real estate property, water, and sanitary facilities, structures, and their contents. A Flood Emergency Operation Plan and an Inspection and Maintenance Plan must be provided by the design professional for the building. Only non-residential buildings in A Zones can be floodproofed.

    Hardship (as related to variances of this chapter) means the exceptional difficulty that would result from a failure to grant the requested variance. The City Council of Tupelo, Mississippi that the variance is exceptional, unusual, and peculiar to the property involved. Mere economic or financial hardship alone is NOT exceptional. Inconvenience, aesthetic considerations, physical handicaps, personal preferences, or the disapproval of one's neighbors likewise cannot, as a rule, qualify as an exceptional hardship. All of these problems can be resolved through other means without granting a variance, even if the alternative is more expensive, or requires the property owner to build elsewhere or put the parcel to a different use than originally intended. 
    Hazard potential means the possible adverse incremental consequences that result from the release of water or stored contents due to failure of a dam or mis-operation of a dam or appurtenances. The hazard potential classification of a dam does not reflect in any way on the current condition of a dam and its appurtenant structures (e.g. safety, structural integrity, and flood routing capacity). 
    High hazard dam means a class of dam in which failure may cause loss of life, serious damage to residential, industrial, or commercial buildings; or damage to, or disruption of, important public utilities or transportation facilities such as major highways or railroads. Dams which meet the statutory thresholds for regulation that are proposed for construction in established or proposed residential, commercial, or industrial areas will be assigned this classification, unless the applicant provides convincing evidence to the contrary. A development permit is required for a structure and any associated fill downstream from a dam at any location where flooding can be reasonably anticipated from principal or emergency spillway discharges, or from overtopping and failure of the dam.

Acceptable mitigation measures are floodproofing (nonresidential), relocation, elevation, demolition, or any combination thereof. All renewal and new policies with effective dates on or after June 1, 1997, include ICC coverage. 
    Letter of Map Change (LOMC) is an official FEMA determination, by letter, to amend or revise effective Flood Insurance Rate Maps, Flood Boundary and Floodway Maps, and Flood Insurance Studies. LOMCs are broken down into the following categories: 
    Letter of Map Amendment (LOMA). An amendment based on technical data showing that a property was incorrectly included in a designated SFHA, was not elevated by fill (only by a natural grade elevation), and will not be inundated by the one percent chance flood. A LOMA amends the current effective FIRM and establishes that a specific property is not located in a SFHA. 
    Letter of Map Revision (LOMR). A revision based on technical data that, usually due to man-made changes, shows changes to flood zones, flood elevations, floodplain and floodway delineations, and planimetric features. One common type of LOMR, a LOMR-F, is a determination concerning whether a structure or parcel has been elevated by fill above the BFE and is, therefore, excluded from the SFHA. 
    Conditional Letter of Map Revision (CLOMR). A formal review and comment by FEMA as to whether a proposed project complies with the minimum NFIP floodplain management criteria. A CLOMR does not revise effective flood insurance rate maps, flood boundary and floodway maps, or flood insurance studies.

    Levee system means a flood protection system which consists of a levee, or levees, and associated structures, such as closure and drainage devices, which are constructed and operated in accordance with sound engineering practices. For a levee system to be recognized, the following criteria must be met. All closure devices or mechanical systems for internal drainage, whether manual or automatic, must be operated in accordance with an officially adopted operation manual (a copy of which must be provided to FEMA by the operator when levee or drainage system recognition is being sought or revised). All operations must be under the jurisdiction of a Federal or State agency, an agency created by Federal or State law, or an agency of a community participating in the NFIP. 
    Low hazard dam means a class of dam in which failure would at the most result in damage to agricultural land, farm buildings (excluding residences), or minor roads. 
    Lowest adjacent grade means the elevation of the sidewalk, patio, deck support, or basement entryway immediately next to the structure and after the completion of construction. It does not include earth that is placed for aesthetic or landscape reasons around a foundation wall.

    One percent flood (aka 100-year flood) is the flood that has a one percent chance of being equaled or exceeded in any given year. Any flood zone that begins with the letter A or V is subject to inundation by the one percent chance flood. Over the life of a 30-year loan, there is a twenty-six (26) percent chance of experiencing such a flood within the SFHA.

    Regulatory floodway means the channel of a river or other watercourse and the adjacent land areas that must be reserved in order to discharge the base flood without cumulatively increasing the water surface elevation more than one foot. 
    Repair means the reconstruction or renewal of any part of an existing building for which the start of construction commenced on or after the effective date of a floodplain management regulation adopted by a community and all such regulations effective at the time of permitting must be met. 
    Repetitive loss means flood-related damages sustained by a structure on two (2) separate occasions during a ten (10) year period for which the cost of repairs at the time of each such flood event, on the average, equals or exceeds twenty-five (25) percent of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred. 
    Repetitive Loss Property is any insurable building for which two (2) or more claims of more than one thousand dollars ($1,000.00) were paid by the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) within any rolling 10-year period, since 1978. At least two (2) of the claims must be more than ten (10) days apart but, within ten (10) years of each other. A RL property may or may not be currently insured by the NFIP. 
    Section 1316 means that Section of the National Flood Insurance Act of 1968, as amended, which states that no new flood insurance coverage shall be provided for any property that FEMA finds has been declared by a duly constituted state or local zoning authority or other authorized public body to be in violation of state or local laws, regulations, or ordinances that are intended to discourage or otherwise restrict land development or occupancy in flood-prone areas. 
    Severe repetitive loss structure means any insured property that has met at least one of the following paid flood loss criteria since 1978, regardless of ownership: 
(1)  Four (4) or more separate claim payments of more than five thousand dollars ($5,000.00) each (including building and contents payments); or 
(2)  Two (2) or more separate claim payments (building payments only) where the total of the payments exceeds the current market value of the property. 
In either case, two (2) of the claim payments must have occurred within ten (10) years of each other. Multiple losses at the same location within ten (10) days of each other are counted as one loss, with the payment amounts added together.

The costs for determining substantial improvement include the costs of additions. This term includes structures which have incurred repetitive loss or substantial damage, regardless of the actual repair work performed. 
    The term does not apply to: 
(1)  Any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing violations of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications which have been identified by the local code enforcement official and which are the minimum necessary to assure safe living conditions, provided that said code deficiencies were not caused by neglect or lack of maintenance on the part of the owner; or 
(2)  Any alteration of a "historic structure" provided that the alteration will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a "historic structure." 
    Substantially improved existing manufactured home parks or subdivisions means manufactured home parks or subdivisions where the repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation or improvement of the streets, utilities and pads equals or exceeds fifty (50) percent of the value of the streets, utilities and pads before the repair, reconstruction or improvement commenced.

(d)  Base flood elevation data shall be provided for all new subdivision proposals and other proposed development (including manufactured home parks and subdivisions), which is greater than five (5) lots or five (5) acres, whichever is the lesser. 
(e)  Where only a small portion of the subdivision lot or lots is in an 'A' Zone special flood hazard area inundated by one hundred (100) year flood with no base flood elevations determined and there is sufficient ground slope on the site to avoid possible flooding of structures in zone X areas determined to be outside five hundred (500) year floodplain. The floodplain administrator may waive the requirement for a study to determine the base flood elevations. 
(f)  In order for the floodplain administrator to consider waiving the requirement of section 11-26(d) the applicant must provide an accurate topographic data and map for the lot or lots in question certified by a licensed land surveyor and/or professional civil engineer indicating sufficient detail to allow a thorough review by the floodplain administrator. 
(g)  Each proposed parcel must have a designated buildable pad or site above the one (1) percent chance floodplain. The distance of the buildable pad or site above the one (1) percent chance floodplain shall depend on the slope of the ground and in accordance with the following table: 
Distance in feet from Zone A [one percent chance floodplain] Minimum Slope from Zone A - one percent floodplain to ground level at pad 20 5% 30 3.33% 40 2.50% 50 2.0% 60 1.67% 70 1.43% 80 1.25% 90 1.11% 100 1.0%

Sec. 11-27. - Critical facilities. 
    Construction of new and substantially improved critical facilities shall be located outside the limits of the special flood hazard area (one (1) percent chance floodplain). Construction of new critical facilities shall be permissible within the SFHA if no feasible alternative site is available. Critical facilities constructed within the SFHA shall have the lowest floor elevated three (3) feet above the base flood elevation at the site (or to the 0.2 percent chance flood elevation whichever is greater). Floodproofing and sealing measures must be implemented to ensure that toxic substances will not be displaced by or released into floodwaters. Access routes elevated to or above the base flood elevation shall be provided to all critical facilities to the maximum extent possible. Critical facilities must not only be protected to the 0.2 percent chance flood, but must remain operable during such an event.

(Ord. of 2-2-10(1), § 2) 
Sec. 11-30. - Variance procedures. 
    In passing upon such applications, the department of development services shall consider all technical evaluations, relevant factors, and standards specified in other sections of this chapter, and: 
(1)  The evaluation must be based on the characteristics unique to that property and not be shared by adjacent parcels. The characteristics must pertain to the land itself, not to the structure, its inhabitants, or its owners; 
(2)  Variances should never be granted for multiple lots, phases of subdivisions, or entire subdivisions; 
(3)  The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the injury of others; 
(4)  The danger of life and property due to flooding or erosion damage; 
(5)  The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner and the community; 
(6)  The importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to the community; 
(7)  The necessity of the facility to be at a waterfront location, where applicable; 
(8)  The availability of alternative locations for the proposed use which are not subject to flooding or erosion damage; 
(9)  The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated development; 
(10)  The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan and floodplain management program for that area; 
(11)  The safety of access to the property in times of flood for ordinary and emergency vehicles; 
(12)  The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise, and sediment transport of the floodwaters and the effects of wave action, if applicable, expected at the site; and 
(13)  The costs of providing governmental services during and after flood conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water systems, and streets and bridges and culverts. 
(14)  Upon consideration of factors listed above, and the purpose of this chapter, the planning committee may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes of this chapter. 
(15)  Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result. 
(Ord. of 2-2-10(1), § 2) 
Sec. 11-31. - Conditions for variances. 
(1)  Variances shall only be issued when there is: 
a.  A showing of good and sufficient cause; 
b.  A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship; and 
c.  A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public expense, create nuisance, cause fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances. 
(2)  The provisions of this chapter are minimum standards for flood loss reduction; therefore any deviation from the standards must be weighed carefully. Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary deviation from the requirements of this chapter, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief. In the instance of a Historic Structure, a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary so as not to destroy the historic character and design of the building. (See article VI, section 11-33) 
(3)  Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice specifying the difference between the base flood elevation and the elevation to which the lowest floor is to be built and stating that the cost of flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the reduced lowest floor elevation. 
(4)  The Floodplain Administrator shall maintain the records of all appeal actions and report any variances to the Federal Emergency Management Agency and Mississippi Emergency Management Agency upon request. (See article VI, section 11-32) 
(5)  Upon consideration of the factors listed above and the purposes of this chapter, the planning committee may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes of this chapter. 
(6)  Variances shall not be issued "after the fact." 
(Ord. of 2-2-10(1), § 2) 
Sec. 11-32. - Variance notification. 
    Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice over the signature of a community official that: 
(1)  The issuance of a variance to construct a structure below the base flood elevation will result in increased premium rates for flood insurance up to amounts as high as twenty-five dollars ($25.00) for one hundred dollars ($100.00) of insurance coverage; and 
(2)  Such construction below the base flood level increases risks to life and property. A copy of the notice shall be recorded by the floodplain administrator in the Office of the Chancery Clerk of Lee County, Mississippi and shall be recorded in a manner so that it appears in the chain of title of the affected parcel of land. 
The floodplain administrator will maintain a record of all variance actions, including justification for their issuance, and report such variances issued in the community's biennial report submission to the Federal Emergency Management Agency. 
(Ord. of 2-2-10(1), § 2) 
Sec. 11-33. - Historic structures. 
    Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of "historic structures" only upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a "historic structure" and the variance is the minimum to preserve the historic character and design of the structure. 
(Ord. of 2-2-10(1), § 2) 
Sec. 11-34. - Special conditions. 
    Upon consideration of the factors listed in article VI, and the purposes of this chapter, the planning committee may attach such conditions to the granting of variances, as it deems necessary to further the purposes of this chapter.

Sec. 17-145. - Administrative adjudication hearing.

(d)  In an administrative adjudication hearing, the issues must be proved at the hearing by a preponderance of the evidence.

A person who fails to attend the administrative hearing, however, forfeits any rights of appeal. 
(f)  It shall be an affirmative defense to the imposition of civil liability under this article, to be proven by a preponderance of the evidence, that: 
(1)  The traffic-control signal was not in proper position and sufficiently legible to an ordinarily observant person; 
(2)  The operator of the motor vehicle was acting in compliance with the lawful order or direction of a police officer; 
(3)  The operator of the motor vehicle violated the instructions of the traffic-control signal so as to yield the right-of-way to an immediately approaching authorized emergency vehicle; 
(4)  The motor vehicle was being operated as an authorized emergency vehicle and that the operator was acting in compliance with state statutes in operation thereof. 
(5)  The motor vehicle was a stolen vehicle and being operated by a person other than the owner of the vehicle without the effective consent of the owner; 
(6)  The license plate depicted in the recorded image of the violation was a stolen plate and being displayed on the motor vehicle other than the motor vehicle for which the plate had been issued; or 
(7)  The presence of ice, snow, unusual amounts of rain or other unusually hazardous road conditions existed that would make compliance with this article more dangerous under the circumstances than non-compliance. 
(8)  The person who received the notice of violation was not the owner of the motor-vehicle at the time of the violation. 
(g)  To demonstrate that at the time of the violation the motor vehicle was a stolen vehicle or the license plate displayed on the motor vehicle was a stolen plate, the owner must submit proof of acceptable to the hearing officer that the theft of the vehicle or license plate had not been timely reported to the appropriate law enforcement agency. 
(h)  Notwithstanding anything in this article to the contrary, a person who fails to pay the amount of a civil penalty or to contest liability in a timely manner is entitled to an administrative adjudication hearing on the violation if: 
(1)  The person files an affidavit with the hearing officer stating the date on which the person received the notice of violation that was mailed to the person, if such date was later than five (5) days from the date of the notice; and 
(2)  Within the same period required by subsection 17-144(c)(7)b. for a hearing to be timely requested but measured from the date the mailed notice was received as stated in the affidavit filed under subsection (h)(1), the person requests an administrative adjudication hearing. 
(i)  A person who is found liable after an administrative adjudication hearing may appeal that finding of civil liability to the Municipal Court by filing an notice of appeal with the clerk of the Municipal Court. The notice of appeal must be filed not later than the 31st day after the date on which the administrative adjudication hearing officer entered the finding of civil liability. Unless the person, on or before the filing of the notice of appeal, posts a bond in the amount of the civil penalty and any late fees, an appeal does not stay the enforcement of the civil penalty. An appeal shall be determined by the Municipal Court by trial de novo. The affidavits submitted under subsection 17-145(d) shall be admitted by the municipal judge in the trial de novo, and the issues must be proved by a preponderance of the evidence. A person found liable by the Municipal Court shall pay an appellate filing fee of fifty dollars ($50.00) in addition to the civil penalty and any other fees due the city. 
(Ord. of 1-16-07, § 1) 
Sec. 17-146. - Order. 
(a)  The hearing officer at any administrative adjudication hearing under this article shall issue an order stating: 
(1)  Whether the person charged with the violation is liable for the violation; and 
(2)  If liable, the amount of any civil penalty, late penalty, and administrative adjudication cost assessed against the person. 
(b)  The orders issued under subsection (a) may be filed with the office of the hearing examiner. The hearing examiner shall keep the orders in a separate index and file. The orders may be recorded using microfilm, microfiche, or data processing techniques. 
(Ord. of 1-16-07, § 1) 
Sec. 17-147. - Effect of liability, exclusion of civil remedy. 
(a)  The imposition of civil penalty under this article is not a criminal conviction for any purpose, and is not reflected on the owner's permanent driving record. 
(b)  A civil penalty may not be imposed under this article on the owner of a motor vehicle if the operator of the vehicle was arrested or was issued a citation and notice to appear by a law enforcement officer for the same violation. 
(c)  An owner who fails to pay the civil penalty or to timely contest liability for the penalty is considered to admit liability for the full amount of the civil penalty stated in the notice of violation mailed to the person. 
(d)  The city attorney is authorized to file suit to enforce collection of a civil penalty imposed under this article.

No opening or excavation of a cross trench shall extend beyond the centerline of the road before being backfilled, compacted and the surface of the roadway temporarily restored. All trenches will be backfilled in six-inch lifts and compacted with vibratory mechanical compaction. No excavation shall take place unless the mechanical vibratory compactor is actually on the site. All utility facilities shall be located sufficiently ahead of trench excavation work to avoid damage of those facilities and to permit their relocation, if necessary. Storm drains, pipe culverts or other facilities encountered shall be adequately protected by the permittee. If the work performed interferes with the established drainage system of any street, road, or alley, adequate provision shall be made by the permittee to provide proper drainage during construction and to restore the existing system, all to the satisfaction of the city engineer or his designee. No dewatering equipment, wells, points, or piping shall occupy the traveled portion of roadways unless specifically approved and adequately protected to the satisfaction of the city engineer or his designee. Effluent from dewatering systems shall be discharged in such a manner that erodible soils are not adversely affected. All silt sediments being carried in the dewatering effluent must be intercepted prior to effluent discharge into any drainage system through use of a sedimentation basin designed to allow retention of discharge for sufficient time to render such waters free of suspended silt and sediments. The use of screening devices in lieu of sedimentation basin must receive specific approval from the city engineer or his designee and be employed only for minor flows. Any gravel, earth or other excavated material which is caused to roll, flow, or wash upon any road shall be removed from the roadway after deposit and such removal shall not occur more than twelve (12) hours therefrom. In the event the earth, gravel or other excavated material so deposited is not removed, the city or another on behalf of the city may remove the material and any and all costs incurred shall be paid by the permittee or applied from his or her bond. The permittee shall employ construction methods and rests that will keep flying dust to the minimum to the satisfaction of the city engineer or his designee. At the first sign of precipitation, all work on the shoulders and traveled way of streets and alleys shall stop and they shall be cleared of all dirt, gravel, and loose materials and the area backfilled until the weather permits resumption of work. 
    Where directed by the city engineer or his designee, the permittee shall use hydro excavation to verify depths and locations of existing utilities. 
(2)  Backfilling. Before backfilling of any cuts, trenches, or openings in streets, roads, or rights-of-way, the permittee shall request an inspection by the city engineer or his designee. All backfill material will be free from cinders, ashes, refuse, vegetable or organic matter, boulders, rocks or stones, wet material, or other materials which renders same unsuitable to obtain a firm and compact cover for the installed pipe. The backfill shall be placed in layers not to exceed six (6) inches and each layer shall be thoroughly compacted to not less than ninety-five (95) percent of the maximum dry density as defined by a Standard Proctor Test. Flowable fill will be substituted for compacted back-fill when directed by the city engineer or his designee. A Standard Proctor Test (ASTM D698) shall be conducted by an independent soil testing firm and the results given to the city engineer or his designee. The cost of this test shall be borne by the permittee or the person, firm, or corporation doing the backfill.

    Whenever applicants propose work or construction in the same block or area of the city, the city shall condition permits for such work in a manner that maximizes coordination and minimizes the total period of construction. Such work may be conditioned to require the applicants to participate in a single excavation with the bond to reflect the pro rata share of the work. Applicants may seek a waiver of the joint excavation requirements with respect to a particular excavation. Within twenty (20) calendar days of receipt of a written request for a waiver, the city engineer or his designee shall render a decision upon such a request, taking into account the impact of the proposed excavation on the neighborhood and the public health, safety, welfare, and convenience.

Where there has been a fifty (50) percent or greater surface area impacted, the permittee will be required to resurface the entire lane within the construction area. 
(b)  Where the excavation is perpendicular to the direction of traffic, the permittee shall resurface the length of the excavation from curb line to curb line or the length of the excavation plus the excavation influence area extending on each end of the excavation, whichever is less. This resurface shall also include the excavation area plus the excavation influence area on each side of the excavation. 
(c)  Where a raised median is present and the excavation is perpendicular to the direction of traffic, the permittee shall resurface either from the raised median to the curb line, or for the length of the excavation, plus the excavation influence area extending on each end of the excavation, whichever is less. This resurface shall also include the excavation plus the excavation influence area on each side of the excavation. 
(2)  Restoration. In addition to any required resurfacing, any areas affected by work or construction shall be restored within three (3) days of completion of work or construction on the property or areas affected thereby so that each such property or area shall, to the best extent possible, be placed in the same or better condition it was in prior to the commencement of work or construction. Such restoration shall include, but not be limited to, the replacement of all markings and/or striping per the current Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices and city construction standards and the re-sodding of like or higher-quality turf or replacement of similar vegetation that was adversely affected or damaged by the work as well as the replacement or restoration of any and all sidewalks, driveways, shoulders, curbs, curb cuts, manholes, and any other improvements. The city engineer may allow an extension of the three-day restoration period if an applicant demonstrates that it is unable to obtain sufficient materials to complete the necessary repairs within that time. If such an extension is granted, the applicant shall maintain the area in a safe and passable condition until materials are available for necessary repairs.

13.  TERMINATION OF SERVICE: The Tupelo Water & Light Department may discontinue service for the violation of any of its Schedule of Rules and Regulations or of the Schedule of Rates and Charges. The Tupelo Water & Light Department may also discontinue service to customer for the theft of services or the appearance of theft devices on the premises of customer, for safety or to be compliant with any State of Mississippi or City of Tupelo regulations that require disconnection for safety reasons. Any and all electrical and water services will be discontinued to customers with past due accounts except as provided in this rule. Payment in full (including late fee charges or service charges) will be required before service is restored. An additional deposit amount may also be required. The termination of service by Tupelo Water & Light Department for any reason stated in this rule does not release the customer from the obligation for any amount due to Tupelo Water & Light Department, including the payment of minimum bills as specified in contracts. 
    If payment is not received by the due date, Tupelo Water & Light Department may discontinue service fifteen (15) days after the due date for residential customers and ten (10) days after the due date for general power customers (commercial and industrial) after provision of a late notice by mail informing the customer of the electric service or the water service disconnection date and the available rights and remedies to dispute the bill with Tupelo Water & Light Department, including the address, 333 Court Street, Tupelo, MS 38804, and the Customer Service telephone number, 662-841-6470.

    Tupelo Water & Light Department evaluates weather conditions daily at www.weathertap.com for the Tupelo service area. In the event the forecasted temperature is expected to exceed 96 degrees Fahrenheit (F) with a heat index greater than 100 degrees, or is expected to be below 30 degrees (F) on that day, Tupelo Water & Light Department will postpone the disconnection of service of residential customers due to non-payment. Where disconnection is postponed due to an extreme weather condition, the postponement will not extend beyond the extreme weather condition. 
    Upon Tupelo Water & Light Department's approval of the "Request for Medical Waiver" form, disconnection of service will be postponed for 30 days from the original due date to allow customer time to make payment or alternative shelter arrangements. The "Request for Medical Waiver" form must be completed by a medical doctor or nurse practitioner licensed to practice in the State of Mississippi, certifying that the disconnection of electric service would create a life-threatening medical situation for the customer or other permanent resident of the customer's household. It is the responsibility of the customer to ensure that the form has been approved by Tupelo Water & Light Department. A life threatening medical condition does not relieve a customer of the obligation to pay for electric service, including any late fees or service charges incurred or other applicable charges. Tupelo Water & Light Department will only grant this postponement for termination two (2) times in a twelve (12) month period. If full payment of the past due amount, including all late fees and service charges is not received by the end of the thirty (30) day postponement period, electric service will be disconnected without further notice.

    The following conditions and standards apply to all such work: 
(1)  Private property owners on which a stream or ditch lies or which is adjacent to that portion on which the work is to be performed must sign a form prescribed by the director of public works requesting the work and giving permission to enter the private property for such purpose. The city shall determine on what portion of the stream or ditch the work shall be performed to effectuate the efficient and safe flow of water; 
(2)  All such private property owners shall be responsible for removing any obstruction, objects or vegetation that the city deems necessary or convenient to perform the work;

    Approved means accepted by the authority responsible as meeting an applicable specification stated or cited in this article or as suitable for the proposed use. 
    Auxiliary water supply means any water supply on or available to the premises other than the purveyor's approved public water supply. These auxiliary waters may include water from another purveyor's public potable water supply or any natural sources, such as a well, spring, river, stream, harbor, and so forth; used waters; or industrial fluids. These waters may be contaminated or polluted, or they may be objectionable and constitute an unacceptable water source over which the water purveyor does not have sanitary control. 
    Backflow means the reversal of normal flow direction where water flows from the intended point of delivery towards the supply. 
    Back pressure backflow means backflow caused by a lower pressure in the potable supply than at the point of delivery. Back siphonage backflow means backflow caused by a negative pressure in the potable supply line. Backflow preventor means a device or means designed to prevent backflow or back-siphonage, most commonly categorized as air gap, double check valve assembly, and reduced pressure principle device. Residential dual check, atmospheric vacuum breaker, hose bib vacuum breaker, and pressure vacuum breaker are also backflow preventors, but are not approved for use under this article.

This enforcement code shall also apply to public and private nuisances: Grass and weeds, cisterns, rubbish, dilapidated fences, outside toilets, dilapidated buildings, other debris, cesspools and standing water. The intent of this enforcement code is to establish base standards for enforcing the City of Tupelo Code of Ordinances. 
(Ord. of 10-17-06(2), § 1) 
Sec. 28-3. - Commencement of action. 
(a)  The planning and community development department is assigned the primary responsibility of enforcing this chapter and is granted the authority expressly and impliedly needed and necessary for enforcement.

(c)  The planning and community development department is authorized to recommend reasonable and necessary rules and regulations to carry out the provisions of this article which shall be approved by resolution of the city council. 
(Ord. of 10-17-06(2), § 1) 
Sec. 28-4. - Remedies and penalties. 
(a)  Cumulative remedies. The remedies herein are cumulative when there are separate violations and the city may proceed under one (1) or more of such remedies when there is more than one (1) violation. Remedies and penalties will be pursued by the city in conformance with the rules and regulations adopted pursuant to this chapter. 
(b)  Civil sanction. Any person who causes, permits, facilitates or aids or abets any violation of any provision of the codes and chapters or who fails to perform any act or duty required by the codes and chapters is subject to a civil sanction of not less than one hundred dollars ($100.00) nor more than one thousand dollars ($1,000.00) but total fines shall not exceed one thousand dollars ($1,000.00) per day for each property. In addition to the amount of the fine imposed, there is imposed a default penalty in the amount of fifty dollars ($50.00) should the defendant fail to appear and answer for a violation of the codes and chapters within the time period stated on the citation or fails to appear at the time and place set by the hearing officer for a matter arising under this chapter. 
(c)  Criminal misdemeanor. Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (b) above, any person who causes, permits, facilitates or aids or abets any violation of any provision of the codes and chapters or who fails to perform any act or duty required by the codes and chapters is guilty of a Class 1 misdemeanor. The city prosecutor is authorized to file a criminal misdemeanor complaint in the Tupelo Municipal Court for violation of this chapter. A rental agent or property manager may avoid criminal liability by forwarding a copy of the notice to comply to the owner if it is sent by certified mail/return receipt requested within two (2) days of receiving the notice to comply. 
(d)  Separate offenses. Each day any violation of any provision of the codes and chapters or the failure to perform any act or duty required by the codes and chapters, shall constitute a separate violation or offense. 
(e)  Property owner. For the purpose of enforcement of the codes and chapters, the owner of record, as recorded by the Lee County Tax Assessor's office, of the property upon which the violation exists, shall be presumed to be a person having lawful control over the property. If more than one (1) person shall be recorded as the owner of the property, said persons shall be jointly and severally presumed to be persons having lawful control over the property. This presumption shall not prevent enforcement of the provisions of the codes and chapters against any person specified in subsection (b) or (c) of this section. 
(f)  Abatement. In addition to any other sanction or penalty authorized under subsection (b) or (c) of this section, the designated hearing officer may issue an order directing the owner, occupant, rental agent, property manager or responsible person to abate the violation or authorize the city to abate the condition giving rise to the violation. The costs of such abatement shall be the responsibility of the owner of the property where the violation occurred and may be collected as a lien against the property found to be in violation. Where the city abates the violation, the governing authority at its next regular meeting, may, by resolution, adjudicate the actual cost of abating the violation and may impose a penalty of one thousand five hundred dollars ($1,500.00) or fifty (50) percent of such actual cost, whichever is more. The cost and any penalty may be come a civil debt against the property owner, or, at the option of the governing authority, an assessment against the property. 
(Ord. of 10-17-06(2), § 1) 
Sec. 28-5. - Notice to comply.

(3)  By publication in newspaper of general circulation in the city if the property owner or his address are unknown. 
(d)  Additional notice required; hearing not required.

If the city does elect to give any additional hearing in any instance, it shall not thereby become obligated to give such additional hearing thereafter in the same or other situations. Nothing in this section shall require a second hearing within twelve (12) months prior to commencement of civil or criminal violation proceedings. However, if the city does not give an additional hearing, ten (10) days written notice must be given by U.S. mail to the last known address of the property owner before the city abates a violation on the property.

Customers outside the municipal limits, but served by city water services, shall pay a monthly sewer bill equal to one hundred fifty (150) percent of each respective customer's total monthly water bill for the months of January through December, where sanitary sewer lines are available. 
Provided, however, if any sewer customer outside the municipal limits who is served exclusively by city water services produces two hundred thousand (200,000) gallons or more of wastewater per day to be processed through the city wastewater facility, such customer shall pay an amount for monthly sewer service equal to one hundred (100) percent of such customer's monthly water bill. Sewer customers outside the municipal limits who are not served by city water services exclusively shall pay a monthly sewer bill equal to one hundred fifty (150) percent of what their monthly water bill would be if city water rates applied to such customer's actual water usage, provided that the water association which provides water service to such customers will provide to the city the monthly water meter readings for all of its customers served by city sewer without charge to the city or by other agreement. If the water association which provides water service to city sewer customers who are outside the municipal limits will not provide water meter readings, then the city sewer customers will pay a monthly sewer fee in an amount equal to one hundred fifty (150) percent of the average monthly water bill for residential customers of the certificated area of the Tupelo Water and Light Department from the previous calendar year. This flat rate will be adjusted at the beginning of each calendar year.

1.5 Transitional Rule

(1) Existing Unlawful Uses and Structures

A structure or use not lawfully existing at the time of the adoption of this Code is deemed lawful as of the effective date of this Code, if it conforms to all of the requirements of this Code. However, if such structure or use does not conform to all of the requirements of this Code, then such structure or use remains unlawful hereunder.

(2) Uses Rendered Nonconforming

When a lot is used for a purpose that was a lawful use before the effective date of this Code, and this Code or any amendment no longer classifies such use as either a permitted use or conditional use in the zoning district in which it is located, such use is deemed a nonconforming use and shall be controlled by the provisions of this Code.

(3) Buildings, Structures, and Lots Rendered Nonconforming

Where any building, structure, or lot which existed on the effective date of this Code does not meet all standards in this Code or any amendment, such building, structure, or lot is deemed nonconforming and shall be controlled by the provisions of this Code.

1.6 Previously Granted Variances and Conditional Uses

Any development for which a variance or conditional use has been granted before the effective date of this Code, or before the effective date of any amendment that renders the development nonconforming, may be carried out according to the granted variance or conditional use. It shall be deemed lawfully existing under the terms of this Code, if:

However, any restrictive covenants applicable to said subdivisions that require a greater yard than required by this subsection shall take precedence.

(3) No Subdivision whose approval is more than five (5) years old prior to the submittal of Construction Plans will be allowed to develop. Preliminary plat approval shall be obtained through the requirements contained in this Code.

1.8 Previously Issued Building Permit

Any development for which a building permit has been issued before the effective date of this Code, or before the effective date of any amendment that renders the development nonconforming, may be carried out according to that building permit and shall be deemed lawfully existing under the terms of this Code, if:

(1) The permit was validly issued; and,

(2) The permit has not expired.

(3) This Section shall not apply where the property owner consents to making the development conform to the requirements of this Code, or any amendment thereto, which would make the development nonconforming.

(1) If any court of competent jurisdiction invalidates any provision of this Code, then such judgment shall not affect the validity and continued enforcement of any other provision of this Code. If any court of competent jurisdiction invalidates the application of any provision of this Code, then such judgment shall not affect the application of that provision to any other building, structure, or use not specifically included in that judgment. If any court of competent jurisdiction judges invalid any condition attached to the approval of an application for development approval or the approval of a conditional use, then such judgment shall not affect any other conditions or requirements attached to the same approval which are not specifically included in that judgment.

CHAPTER 2. DEFINITIONS AND RULES OF CONSTRUCTION
2.1 General Rules of Construction

The following rules shall apply for construing or interpreting the terms and provisions of this Code.

In their application, the provisions of this Code shall be held to be the minimum requirements for the promotion and protection of the public health, safety and general welfare, and shall be construed to achieve the purposes for which this Code is adopted.

In the event of any conflict between the limitations, requirements, or standards contained in different provisions of this Code and applying to an individual use or structure, the more restrictive provision shall apply. However, the regulations for overlay districts which are set forth in Chapter 5 shall control in the event of any conflict between those regulations and the regulations which are set forth in Chapter 4 for the underlying zoning district, regardless of whether they are more strict or less strict than the regulations for the underlying district.

In the event of a conflict or inconsistency between the text of this Code and any caption, figure, illustration, table, or map contained herein, the text shall control.

The words shall, must, and will, are mandatory in nature, establishing an obligation or duty to comply with the particular provision. The word may is permissive in nature. Words used in the present tense include the future tense. Words used in the singular number include the plural number and the plural number includes the singular number, unless the context of the particular usage clearly indicates otherwise. Words used in the masculine gender include the feminine gender, and vice versa.

Any act authorized by this Code to be carried out by a specific official of the City is implicitly authorized to be carried out by a designee of such official.

2.2 Interpretation of District Boundaries

Where uncertainty exists with respect to the boundaries of the zoning districts shown on the Official Map of Zoning Districts, the following rules shall be used to interpret the Official Map:

(1) Where the Official Map shows a zoning district boundary line located within or following a street or alley right-of-way, railroad or utility line right-of-way, easement, or waterway, the district boundary shall be considered to be in the center of the right-of-way, easement, or waterway. If the actual location of such right-of-way, easement, or waterway, as indicated in a recorded legal description of such, varies slightly from the location shown on the Official Map, then the actual location shall control.

(2) Where the Official Map shows a boundary line as being located a specific distance from a street line or other physical feature, this distance shall control.
Where the Official Map shows a district boundary to approximately coincide with a property line or municipal border, the property line or municipal border shall be considered the district boundary, unless otherwise indicated on the map.

(3) Where the Official Map shows a district boundary to not coincide or approximately coincide with any street, alley, railroad, waterway, or property line, and no dimensions are shown, the location of the boundary shall be determined by use of the scale appearing on the Official Map.

(4) Where the Official Map shows a district boundary dividing a lot, each part of the lot shall be used in conformity with the standards established by this Code for the zoning district in which that part is located.

2.3 Conflict or Inconsistency with Other Laws, Covenants, or Deed Restrictions

This Code is not intended to abrogate any other law, code, regulation, or permit.

CHAPTER 4. BASE ZONING DISTRICTS
4.1 Purpose and Intent.
The City of Tupelo has zoning districts covering all land in the city limits. Zoning protects the rights of property owners and allows them the reasonable use of their property insofar as the use does not negatively affect the health, safety, or welfare of abutting properties or the neighborhood. Zoning permits particular land uses where they are most appropriate, considering public utilities, road access, natural resources or constraints, and the established development pattern.
In order to carry out the purposes of this Code and to allow appropriate uses in different districts, the City shall be divided into the following zoning districts, the boundaries of which shall be shown on the Official Map of Zoning Districts:
(1) Agriculture/Open Space Protection (A/O)
(2) Low-Density Residential (LDR)
(3) Medium-Density Residential (MDR)
(4) Mixed-Use Residential (MUR)
(5) Mixed-Use Downtown (MUD)
(6) Mixed-Use Commercial Corridor (MUCC)
(7) Mixed-Use Activity Center (MUAC)
(8) Mixed-Use Employment (MUE)
(9) Regional Commercial (RC)
(10) Industrial (I)
4.2 Relationship of Base Zoning Districts to Overlay Districts
Lands within the City may also be classified into one of the overlay districts set forth in Chapter 5: Overlay Districts and Permitted Uses. Where the property is classified in an overlay district as well as a base zoning district, then the standards governing development in the overlay district shall apply in addition to the standards governing development in the underlying district. In the event of an express conflict between the standards set forth in the base zoning district and the overlay district, the stricter standard shall apply.

4.3 Allowable Uses, Compatible Uses, Flexible Uses, and Prohibition of Uses Not Expressly Listed
No use shall be established in any zoning district unless it is expressly designated by this Code as a permitted use, compatible use, flexible use, or temporary use. The range of uses allowed as permitted, compatible, or flexible uses in each zoning district may be found in Table 4.3. In the event of a conflict between Table 4.3 and the text of this Code, the text shall control. The range of uses allowed as temporary uses may be found in Chapter 7: Accessory and Temporary Structures and Uses.
4.4 Annexed Lands
The zoning district designation for areas added to the Citys jurisdiction through annexation beyond the Citys existing jurisdiction shall be determined as follows:
If the property annexed is not subject to any zoning standards, the property shall not be subject to any use restrictions imposed by this Code until such time as the City has properly zoned the property at which time all restrictions and regulations contained in the Code shall apply. Prior to such zoning becoming effective, all other standards contained in this Code other than use restrictions shall apply.
If the property annexed is subject to zoning regulations, the property shall be designated by the City Council after recommendation by the Planning Committee. All standards of this Code for said zoning classification shall apply to this annexed property immediately upon said annexation and zoning district designation by the City Council.

4.5 Zoning Map

The Official Map of Zoning Districts, along with all notations, references, and other information shown, is now incorporated into and made part of this Code. As part of this Code, the Official Map of Zoning Districts shall be amended only by the procedures set forth in this Code.

4.6 Agriculture/Open Space Protection District (AO)

4.6.1 Purpose and Intent

The objective of the Agriculture/Open Space Protection District (AO) is to preserve environmentally sensitive land areas such as floodplains and agricultural areas which are not suitable for dense development and which are generally outside of areas served by public water and sanitary sewer systems. The types of uses, area and intensity of development permitted in this district are designed to protect agricultural and open space uses, including very low density single-family residences and accessory uses.

4.6.2 Development Emphasis

This district shall allow agriculture and very low density residential uses and shall have very limited development impact, particularly land clearing, hardscape and higher intensity uses. Residential development should be of high quality and environmentally sustainable design due to the environmental sensitivity of land in this district, much of which is floodplain or flood hazard area. It should include appropriate design tools or amenities to compensate for converting valuable open space. These may include a connected street system, side or rear garages, clustering of residential houses, environmental set aside areas, and low-impact stormwater management techniques.

 

4.6.3 Flexibility Options

Lot sizes and development standards may be reduced to allow a higher percentage of protected open space through cluster subdivision design. Setbacks may be reduced where rear access is provided by an alley. Low-impact stormwater management practices may substitute for curb and gutter. Sidewalk or street connectivity requirements may be reduced or waived if connectivity is provided by an alternative pedestrian or cyclist path.

4.6.4 Special Requirement

Land in the AO districts which is classified as flood hazard area may be rezoned for other use only upon a finding by the City Engineer that the proposed development would have no significant adverse impact on flood elevations.

4.7 Low-Density Residential District (LDR)

4.7.1 Purpose and Intent

The objective of the Low-Density Residential District (LDR) is to provide an area of low-density residential uses and to transition between more densely developed neighborhoods and the Agricultural-Open Space areas. This district may be located in the more sparsely developed areas of the city where rural, low-density development patterns exist and where utility services and other infrastructure may not be able to accommodate a higher density. Landowners may develop large lot single family units or cluster development on smaller lots to conserve open space, views, and other natural features.

 

4.7.2 Development Emphasis

This district shall allow low-density residential uses and also limit development impact, particularly land clearing; impervious surfaces such as buildings and parking lots, and higher intensity uses. Development in this district shall protect the character of existing single-family housing and offer large lot housing to residents and potential new residents. Residential development should be of high quality and environmentally friendly design, offering appropriate amenities to compensate for the conversion of open space. Walking or biking trails or other outdoor recreational amenities are appropriate. Development standards in this district shall encourage clustering of houses, the creation of environmental set aside areas, and low impact stormwater management techniques. Standards shall discourage cul-de-sacs, single access developments, and front loaded garages.

4.7.3 Flexibility Options

Lot sizes and development standards may be reduced to allow a higher percentage of protected open space through cluster subdivision design. Setbacks may be reduced where rear access is provided by an alley. Low-impact stormwater management practices may substitute for curb and gutter. The sidewalk requirements may be waived if connectivity is provided by walking paths, bike trails, or a similar amenity. The street connectivity requirement may be reduced or waived if connectivity is provided by off-site multi-use paths or similar amenity.

4.8 Medium Density Residential District (MDR)

4.8.1 Purpose and Intent

The objective of the Medium Density Residential District (MDR) is primarily to provide a variety of single-family dwellings and other residential uses. The district includes existing dense neighborhoods prime for infill and redevelopment as well as land located close to mixed use activity centers. New residential neighborhoods will be walkable and should be accessible via local streets to parks, open space, schools and civic activities. The development standards in the MDR District ensure that new development in this district is appropriately scaled to transition between low-density housing and denser commercial areas. New development should be designed so that its form, height, and proportion are compatible with existing adjacent development.

4.8.2 Development Emphasis

The standards in this district shall ensure that there are attractive development and redevelopment opportunities for new housing near the center of Tupelo. Standards shall be designed to offer more housing types that are designed to keep neighborhoods and property values stable; to improve walkability and connectivity of residential areas; and to provide a transition between low density residential areas and mixed use areas.

4.8.3 Flexibility Options

Compatibility with existing development will be the top priority in MDR. Other standards include setbacks, lot dimensions, and lot coverage. At points of transition between different types of development or land uses, dimensions and density may increase or decrease to allow buildings to buffer between higher and lower intensity uses or structures. Pedestrian and/or bike connectivity may substitute for street connectivity.

4.9 Mixed-Use Residential District (MUR)

4.9.1 Purpose and Intent

The objective of the Mixed-Use Residential District (MUR) is intended to provide opportunities for new development and redevelopment in existing well-connected, centrally located neighborhoods. MUR standards will allow a diverse range of housing that is compatible with existing development patterns. A range of residential housing types may be permitted and will be the majority of new development, including detached single-family houses, duplexes, patio homes, townhomes, live/work units, or apartments. Some small scale commercial uses may be allowed on larger streets if the buildings are scaled to the neighborhood and the uses are those that are compatible with the neighborhood. These could include a church, small boutique clothing store, doctors office, day care center, coffee shop, or dry cleaner. The MUR district is intended to accommodate new growth in areas near activity centers and major streets and to allow for a vertical or horizontal mix of uses on sites. All new development and redevelopment will be pedestrian-oriented and shall be accessible via local streets to parks, schools, and nearby commercial centers. Development will be designed so that its form, height, and proportion are compatible with existing adjacent development.

 

4.9.2 Development Emphasis

The highest priority in the MUR district is to preserve the character of existing residential neighborhoods while accommodating some new and renovated housing units. The standards in this district will encourage the redevelopment of existing neighborhoods. It will allow infill residential development that respects the existing character of the neighborhoods. Many residents in these neighborhoods are already in walking distance of schools, parks, churches, and retail or restaurants. These standards will allow some limited new destinations to be built at a small, neighborhood scale, such as offices, coffee shops, or retail stores. All new development will be compatible with existing development patterns, including height and setbacks, and it will include street and pedestrian connectivity.

4.9.3 Flexibility Options

Compatibility is the most important goal. Therefore, where necessary to achieve compatibility, there may be adjustments to standards such as height or setback. In some cases a landscaped buffer may be replaced by architectural transition and pedestrian connections. Residential density may be increased on a collector or arterial street. In general, non-residential uses are permitted as part of a larger residential project. However, if a collector or arterial street already has some commercial uses, a non-residential project may be allowed if it is compatible with the existing area, conforms to design standards, and will enhance the value of the street. Minimum parking requirements may be reduced in locations that are safely accessible to pedestrians from nearby residential areas.

4.9.4 Development Standards

 

MIXED-USE RESIDENTIAL DISTRICT (MUR)
Minimum/Maximum Lot Size*   3,000 sq. ft. min. for traditional housing; 5,000- 14,520 sq. ft. for other single family housing.

4.10 Mixed-Use Downtown District (MUD)

4.10.1Purpose and Intent

The objective of the Mixed-Use Downtown District (MUD) is to maintain and improve the vibrant downtown area as an environment that has employment and shopping opportunities, a range of housing types and parks, lodging, open space, and civic uses. New development should be compatible with the existing character of the block. In general, it will occur in traditional development patterns with narrower streets, smaller blocks, and smaller lots. Uses may be mixed both vertically and horizontally. Development and redevelopment will be designed in an integrated, pedestrian-friendly manner and should not be dominated by any one land use or housing type. Due to the varying character and land uses that exist in the MUD district, the City of Tupelo has Downtown Overlay Zones that have additional standards. These overlay zones are intended to ensure that new development is compatible with the existing architectural pattern.

4.10.2 Development Emphasis

The standards in the MUD district are intended to encourage adaptive reuse, redevelopment, and new development that preserves the pedestrian-oriented form of the area and allows higher density employment, residential, and office uses. A wide variety of uses are permitted in this district. In general, the pattern of development should consist of retail uses on the ground floor and residential and office space on upper floors. This pattern is most lucrative for the developer and fosters the most vibrant form of street life for residents and visitors.

 

4.10.3 Development Standards

Mixed-Use Downtown District (MUD)
Minimum/Maximum Lot Size*   None

Minimum/Maximum Width*   None

Minimum/Maximum Front Setback**   0 to 20ft.

Minimum/Maximum Side Setback**   No minimum/no maximum

Minimum/Maximum Rear Setback**   10 ft. minimum/no maximum

Maximum Height***   7 stories

Maximum Floor Area Ratio (FAR)   2.5

Open Space Amenity: n/a

*Existing parcels of land are exempt from minimum and maximum lot size and width requirements. A property owner will not be required to subdivide an existing parcel to conform to any minimum requirements.

**Front setback shall be zero feet (0) on Main Street. On other streets, setbacks shall be determined by averaging the setbacks of adjoining or adjacent buildings. Where setback is not determined by context the stated minimum and maximum setback shall apply. Where a design covenant is more restrictive, the more restrictive guidelines shall apply.

*** Height limits do not apply to church spires, belfries, cupolas, or domes not used for human habitation, nor to chimneys, ventilators, skylights, parapet walls, cornices, solar energy systems, or necessary mechanical appurtenances usually located on the roof level, provided that such features are limited to the height necessary for their proper functioning and do not exceed the limitations of the airport hazard zoning regulations.

4.10.4 Uses

Permitted uses are regulated in Chapter 5, Overlay Districts.

 

 

4.11 Mixed-Use Commercial Corridor District (MUCC)

4.11.1 Purpose and Intent

The objective of the Mixed-Use Commercial Corridor District (MUCC) is to promote gradual development and redevelopment of existing commercial corridors as mixed use areas that contain shopping and services, offices, light commercial uses, and some housing. The MUCC district allows both a vertical (multi-story) and horizontal (multiple uses on a site) mix of uses. New development and redevelopment will be designed to accommodate a range of residential, retail, commercial, and office uses in a way that is visually appealing for residents, both motorists and pedestrians. The district is intended to serve both residents of adjacent neighborhoods and people who may drive to one destination but stay to shop, eat, or run other errands in a walkable commercial area. Developers in the MUCC districts may choose between pedestrian-scaled standards (MUCC-1) and conventional standards (MUCC-2), with the exception that properties adjoining pedestrian-oriented development shall use that set of standards.

4.11.2 Development Emphasis

The standards in the MUCC district are intended to encourage redevelopment of aging commercial corridors to a more pedestrian-oriented form and to improve connectivity to nearby residential areas. Some residential units may be mixed into the commercial corridor, either on upper floors of mixed-use buildings or along the edges of the MUCC district to provide a buffer between the commercial district and adjacent single family neighborhoods.

4.11.3 Flexibility Options

A developer who chooses walkable development will be allowed significantly higher density as well as reduced landscaping and reduced open space requirements. Landscaping requirements may be reduced for a development with side and rear parking areas. In general, dimensional standards may be adjusted to allow increases in the intensity of use if such increase is compatible with existing development. Buffer requirements between non-residential and residential areas may be replaced by architectural transition and pedestrian connections. Tree replacement requirements may be reduced for pedestrian-oriented development. Vertically mixed uses are encouraged. Requests for flexibility considerations that reduce the pedestrian accessibility or appeal of a proposed development will not normally be considered. A development that consists of at least fifty percent (50%) residential uses shall be built to the walkable set of standards.

4.11.4 Development Standards

Mixed-Use Commercial Corridor District (MUCC)

4.12 Mixed-Use Employment District (MUE)

4.12.1 Purpose and Intent

The objective of the Mixed-Use Employment District (MUE) is to provide concentrated areas of high-quality employment facilities that may be integrated with or adjacent to complementary retail and commercial uses and medium density residential uses. Mixed-use employment areas should have direct access to arterial or collector streets and shall be compatible with and connected to the surrounding development as well as any nearby parks, open space, and pathways. Mixed use employment areas may include corporate office headquarters, hospitals and medical centers, research and development facilities, business parks, and educational facilities in planned, campus-like settings. Secondary uses such as live-work units, medium-density residential housing, and complementary commercial uses are encouraged. Developers in the MUE districts may choose between pedestrian-scaled standards (MUE-1) and conventional standards (MUE-2), with the exception that properties adjoining pedestrian-oriented development shall use that set of standards.

4.12.2 Development Emphasis

The standards in the MUE district are intended to promote higher-quality design standards at street frontages and gateways and allow a wider range of uses in existing commercial and employment corridors. Some residential units may be mixed into the MUE district, either on upper floors of mixed-use buildings or along the edges of the MUE district to provide a buffer between the commercial district and adjacent residential development.

4.12.3 Flexibility Options

A developer who chooses walkable development will be allowed significantly higher density as well as reduced landscaping and no open space requirements. Landscaping requirements may be reduced for a development with side and rear parking areas. In general, dimensional standards may be adjusted to allow increases in the intensity of use if such increase is compatible with existing development. Buffer requirements between non-residential and residential areas may be replaced by architectural transition and pedestrian connections. Tree replacement requirements may be reduced for pedestrian-oriented development. Vertically mixed uses are encouraged. Standards for building design or materials may be reduced if additional landscaping is provided. Sidewalk requirements may be waived if a system of internal pedestrian circulation or another pedestrian amenity is more appropriate. Requests for flexibility considerations that reduce the pedestrian accessibility or appeal of a proposed development will not normally be considered. A development that consists of at least fifty percent (50%) residential uses shall be built with the walkable set of standards (MUE-1).

4.13 Mixed Use Activity Center District (MUAC)

4.13.1 Purpose and Intent

The objective of the Mixed Use Activity Center District (MUAC) is to create areas that will serve as focal points for commercial development activity and as convenient places for the community to shop, work, live, or gather within a pedestrian-friendly environment. Activity centers have been designated along major corridors where they are accessible to adjacent residential and employment uses. Developers in the MUAC districts may choose between pedestrian-scaled standards (MUAC-1) and conventional standards (MUAC-2), with the exception that properties adjoining pedestrian-oriented development shall use that set of standards.

 

4.13.2 Development Emphasis

Standards in the MUAC district are intended to encourage the concentration of activities at centers near major intersections rather than in strip form along major streets. Standards will allow increased density and diversity of uses. They will be distinguished from the Regional Center district because they may be designed to a pedestrian scale.

 

4.13.3 Flexibility Options

Pedestrian-oriented development will be allowed significantly higher density as well as reduced landscaping and no open space requirement. Landscaping requirements may be reduced for any development with parking on the side and rear rather than the front. In general, dimensional standards may be adjusted to allow increases in the intensity of use. Buffer requirements between non-residential and residential areas may be replaced by architectural transition and pedestrian connections. Tree replacement requirements may be reduced for pedestrian-oriented development. Vertically mixed use is encouraged. Requests for flexibility considerations that reduce the pedestrian accessibility or appeal of a proposed development will not normally be considered. A development that consists of at least fifty percent (50%) residential uses shall be built with the walkable set of standards (MUAC-1).

4.14 Regional Commercial District (RC)

4.14.1 Purpose and Intent

The Regional Commercial (RC) district is intended to provide appropriate locations for large retail centers with stores that provide a regional draw. It allows a variety of community needs to be met in a single area of town and create a synergy that contributes to the success of businesses located there. The RC district is located at the intersection of major highways and arterial streets. New development should designed as concentrated centers that convey a unified design. Retail businesses will be the primary use. Complementary uses such as restaurants, high-density residential development, and employment uses are also encouraged.

4.14.2 Development Emphasis

Standards in the RC district focus on high-quality design. Development sites and businesses are expected to continue to be oriented for vehicles. In the future, there should be improved internal circulation to maintain safety on arterial roads where excessive curb cuts are likely to lead to increased collisions. Signage shall be encouraged that consists of one (1) sign advertising all businesses in a subdivision so that potential customers can more easily locate businesses and good visibility may be maintained on the street.

4.14.3 Flexibility Options

Limited flexibility may be given in regard to building height, lot coverage, floor area ratio or additional parking. Developments that allow cross connection to adjoining properties or include one unified subdivision sign at the street will be attractive candidates for flexibility.

4.14.4 Development Standards

CHAPTER 6. DESIGN AND DEVELOPMENT STANDARDS
6.1 Purpose and Relationship to Comprehensive Plan

The City of Tupelo adopted a comprehensive plan in 2008 that promotes a different development pattern than currently exists in much of the city, one that is more compact and walkable. This Code is written to specifically address design goals of the Comprehensive Plan. Those goals include higher density, mixing of uses, and the encouragement of infill and redevelopment. All of these goals require careful design and a flexible approach. The Code offers a number of flexibility provisions through which defined standards for building size, location on sites, architecture and site improvements can be adjustable according to the context of the development and owner needs. These mechanisms include the adoption of five mixed use zoning districts (Chapters 4 and 5) in which developers will be able to choose between walkable and conventional development standards. The code allows more uses by right in most zoning districts, and more density of development in many districts. A development review checklist (Section 12.4) is used to incentivize good design and to evaluate variance requests in terms of the project context. Providing these flexibility options requires that the code offer guidance on how much flexibility is appropriate in different situations. The descriptive material about each zoning district in Chapters 4 and 5 provides insight as to the Comprehensive Plans intent for each district. This chapter will focus on the relationship of the individual development to its context and its own functional requirements. While a code with an emphasis on flexibility is more complex to administer, attention to detail in the design and review of new development should ensure that new developments can be integrated appropriately into existing neighborhoods or commercial areas.

6.2 General Provisions

6.2.1 Applicability

This chapter applies to any application for development approval, except as otherwise provided. The chapter provides design standards for residential development and for walkable and conventional mixed-use and nonresidential development. These standards include site design, which includes the visual quality of the property in relation to its context, and the design of buildings themselves. The chapter also provides standards for site infrastructure.

6.2.2 Administrative Exceptions

(1) To facilitate flexibility in design while maintaining the safety, health, and welfare of the public, the Director of Development Services may grant administrative exceptions to the following technical design requirements found in the following sections of this chapter:

(a) Open Space Standards, 6.6;
(b) Stormwater management , 6.7;
(c) Street design and transportation, 6.8;
(d) Utilities, 6.9.
(2) No administrative exception shall be granted unless:

(a) The Director of Development Services certifies that the proposed exception does not conflict with the goals and policies of the comprehensive plan; and

(b) The applicant demonstrates, through documentation and/or studies based on generally accepted engineering principles, that the proposed exception would not pose a threat to health and safety.

6.2.3 Variances

Where an administrative exception is not granted, or where an administrative exception is not permitted (as in the case of street connectivity, maximum parking requirements, and other items not enumerated in this section), the applicant may seek a variance pursuant to Section 13.16 of this code.

6.2.4 Construction Standards

All construction shall conform to City of Tupelo Design Standards and Construction Specifications manual to the extent consistent with this chapter.

6.2.5 Sampling and Testing

Sampling and testing of materials, and laboratory inspection of materials and processes, shall be performed at the expense of the developer. Firms providing construction materials testing services must have an established in-house laboratory whose tests meet the standards of the American Society for Testing and Materials requirements.

6.2.6 Americans With Disabilities Act

(1) Infrastructure construction and improvements of facilities shall comply with the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) of 1990. Applicants shall consult both the Title III Technical Assistance Manual and the Title II Technical Assistance Manual.

(2) Multifamily housing and condominium development shall comply with § 804(f)(5)(C) of the Fair Housing Act of 1988 and the implementing regulations codified at 24 C.F.R. 100.205. Applicants shall consult the Fair Housing Accessibility Guidelines.

6.2.7 Operation and Maintenance

All improvements required by this chapter shall be operated and maintained by either dedication to the City of Tupelo, by a Homeowners Association as described in this section, or by the property owner.

6.2.7.1 The instruments creating the dedication, homeowners association (HOA), condominium association, easement, transfer, or improvement district shall be attached to the application for subdivision plat approval.
(1) Dedication of Land

Dedication of the improvement to the City of Tupelo satisfies the requirements of this section as follows:

(a) Dedication shall take the form of a fee simple ownership.

(b) The City of Tupelo may accept the improvement if such land is accessible to the residents of the City of Tupelo;

(c) There is no cost of acquisition other than any costs incidental to the transfer of ownership, such as title insurance.

(d) The improvement conforms to the applicable standards of this chapter.

(2) Homeowners Association

(a) Improvements that are owned in common by all owners of lots or units in a subdivision or condominium are required by this chapter to be operated and maintained by an HOA established in the covenants, conditions, and restrictions (CC&Rs) adopted as a condition of development approval.

(b) The CC&Rs shall provide that, in the event that the association fails to maintain the improvements according to the standards of this chapter, the City of Tupelo may, following reasonable notice and demand that deficiency of operation or maintenance be corrected, enter the land area to repair, operate, or maintain the improvement.

(c) The cost of such maintenance shall be the responsibility of the HOA, which shall be required by the CC&Rs to levy an assessment to be charged to all owners.

6.3 Development Design Standards

6.3.1 Purpose and Relationship to Comprehensive Plan

The City of Tupelo 2025 Comprehensive Plan includes a number of goals for better design, with the intent that future growth of the city be more attractive, more accessible, and more economically productive. This division provides for lots, blocks, buildings, and structures that provide a pedestrian scale, offer alternative paths for vehicular traffic, and accommodate on-street parking. Standards are provided to ensure that lots have adequate access and conform to the zoning provisions of the Development Code. The City of Tupelo finds and determines that long blocks lined with homes and other buildings reduce street connectivity and impair the efficiency of public and safety services while increasing distances between residences and nonresidential destinations or public gathering places. Exceptions to these standards are made for nonurban districts and zoning districts that require greater flexibility in order to encourage environmental protection or economic development.

 

6.3.2 Pedestrian Scale and Conventional Standards Distinguished



 

 

 

For the purposes of implementing the goals and objectives in the land use plan, the City of Tupelo has adopted two types of development standards, one intended to provide for a walkable, pedestrian-friendly environment and one to accommodate conventional development pattern focused on access by automobiles. The basic development standards of the Mixed Use Downtown, Mixed Use Residential, and Medium Density Residential zoning districts are pedestrian scale. The basic development standards of the Industrial, Regional Commercial, Low Density Residential, and Agriculture/Open Space zoning districts are conventional. In the other zoning districts, both sets of standards are provided. Developers may choose to apply either pattern, with a few exceptions as follows:

(1) The traditional housing development option requires the use of pedestrian scale standards.

(2) On sites adjacent to and facing the same street as a property developed to pedestrian scale setback standards, the developing site must also use pedestrian scale standards.

(3) No development shall mix the two (2) sets of standards.

6.3.3 Conservation Subdivisions

6.3.3.1 Purpose
To encourage innovation in residential subdivision design, conservation subdivisions shall be permitted providing for more efficient layout of lots, streets, and utilities, for the preservation of open space and recreation areas, and for the protection of unique site features and scenic vistas. Conservation subdivisions shall permit reductions in lot area in exchange for equal amounts of open space on a one-to-one basis, subject to the following standards:
(a) Minimum Site Area: The minimum acreage required for a Conservation Subdivision shall be four (4) acres.
(b) Lot Size: No minimum or maximum lot size or width standard shall apply within the Conservation Subdivision.
(c) Maximum Density: The maximum density shall not exceed the maximum density permitted in the base district.
(d) Housing Types: A variety of housing types shall be permitted in a Conservation Subdivision as follows: detached dwelling, traditional dwelling, zero (0)lot line/semi-attached dwelling.
(e) Stormwater Management: Street drainage may be provided by swales rather than curb and gutter. Low impact management facilities are encouraged and street geometry may be modified to accommodate such alternative designs.
(f) Open Space: The subdivision shall include minimum designated common open space as follows:
i. Agricultural/Open Space District: 50% of total area
ii. Low Density Residential District: 40% of total area

iii. Medium Density Residential District: 30% of total area

(1) Accessibility: A minimum of fifty percent (50%) of lots shall directly abut a protected open space. Pedestrian access by sidewalk or trail shall be provided from all other lots to open space area. A minimum of ninety-five percent (95%) of the lots shall be within a two thousand-six hundred (2,600) foot walking distance of accessible, usable open space.



 

 

(2) Protection: Open space in a conservation subdivision shall be designated and protected in accordance with Section 6.6, Open Space.
(3) Perimeter Treatment: Property on the edge of conservation subdivisions shall either:
(a) Be set aside in open space that includes a Type C or higher type buffer , as set forth in Chapter 9, Landscaping and Buffering; or
(b) Be platted in lots that conform to the conventional single-family detached house requirements for the district; or
(c) Be platted in lots no less than seventy-five percent (75%) of the average size of the nearest adjacent residential-zoned lots.
6.3.4 Traditional Housing Development
In any zoning district where single family dwellings are allowed by right or compatibility, a subdivision may be developed as a traditional housing development subject to the following standards:

(1) Lots: The minimum lot size allowed in the zoning district may be reduced by up to two thousand (2,000) square feet.

(4) Variation in Front Yard: In any block in which seventy percent (70) percent of the lots have front yards that are less than required by the existing zoning regulations, construction on any remaining vacant lots is permitted to the average yard of the existing improved lots

(5) Rear Yards on Irregular Lots: For lots fronting on cul-de-sacs or other curved sections of roadways, and other irregularly shaped lots, a rear yard of fifteen (15) feet is permitted based on the mean horizontal distance of the principal structure from the rear lot line, provided that no part of the structure is closer than ten (10) feet to the lot line. The mean horizontal distance shall be calculated by adding the distance from the closest point of the structure to the rear property line, to the distance from the rear corner of the structure that is farthest from the rear property line, and dividing by two (2).

(6) Dwelling on Small Lot: A platted lot within a residential district that contains less than the minimum area for the district may be used for a single-family dwelling, provided that the lot is held in separate and different ownership from any immediately abutting lot, has a minimum area of three thousand-five hundred (3,500) square feet, and has a minimum street frontage of twenty (20) feet.

(7) Corner Lots: Corner lots shall have two (2) front setbacks and two (2) side setbacks.

(a) The Director of Development Services may waive this requirement and determine the front yard to be on the street front that is in line with the prevailing pattern of front yards on the street in order to be consistent with the established pattern of the street.

(8) Double Frontage Lots: Double frontage or through lots are prohibited except in commercial or industrial districts.

(9) Flag lots: Flag lots shall not be allowed except through the variance process provided in Section 12.16.

(d) Accessory buildings and structures may encroach into the required yard or building restriction line shown on the subdivision plat for the property, but no closer than five (5) feet to the rear lot line or side lot lines. An accessory building or structure shall be located in the rear yard or side yard only. An accessory building or structure shall be located at least fifteen (15) feet from the principal building; otherwise, it shall conform to the yard setback requirements of the principal building.

(11) Corner Visibility: On a corner lot in any zoning district except MUD, and excepting properties developed to walkable standards in mixed use districts, nothing shall be erected, placed, planted or allowed to grow in such a manner as to materially impede vision between a height of two and one-half (2½) and ten (10) feet above the center line grades of the intersected streets in the area bounded by the street lines of such corner lots and a line adjoining points along said street lines fifty (50) feet from the point of the intersection.



 

 

 

 

 

 

6.3.7 Vehicle and Pedestrian Areas for Single-Family, Duplex, Triplex, and Quadraplex Lots

6.3.7.1 Purpose and Applicability

(1) Restrictions on driveway areas are designed to avoid the domination of front yards by large expanses of impervious surfaces, which deaden the streetscape and discourage pedestrian activity. Reducing the width of driveways can reduce total site imperviousness.

(2) This section applies to any subdivision plat, site plan, or development approval authorizing a single-family, duplex, triplex, or quadraplex structure.

 

6.3.7.2 Standards

(1) If the site is served by an alley, access for motor vehicles must be from the alley and not from a street frontage.

(2) No more than two (2) parking spaces may be located in the front setback.

(3) Parking may be provided in the rear yard, and access may be provided through alleys where the front yard is insufficient to accommodate a driveway.

(4) New vehicle areas may not be located between the buildings porch or porches and an adjacent street.

(5) Driveways and other impervious surfaces shall not comprise more than twenty-five percent (25 %) of the front yard area or the street frontage width.

(a) In order to reduce run-off and increase stormwater travel times, alternative materials for driveway surfaces, such as pervious pavers or gravel, may be approved by the Director of Development Services in any watershed or drainage basin overlay district, or in neighborhood blocks where driveways composed of such materials are found on a majority of developed lots.

(b) On lots of four thousand (4,000) square feet or less, the limitation of driveway area and frontage may be waived by the Director of Development Services.



 

 

 

 

 

 

 

6.3.8 Blocks

(1) Lots to Be Contiguous: Lots shall be arranged in a contiguous pattern within blocks or abutting a cul-de-sac. For minor subdivisions, all lots shall be contiguous, and any new lots subdivided from a tract that has been previously subdivided shall adjoin the existing lots.

(2) Block Width: Blocks to the interior of the subdivision shall have sufficient width to provide for two (2) tiers of lots. One tier of required block width is permitted in blocks adjacent to collector or arterial streets or waterways. Not more than two (2) tiers of lots shall be provided for any block.

(3) Block Length: Maximum block length in the Agriculture/Open Space zoning district shall be one thousand-five hundred (1,500) feet. Maximum block length in the Low Density Residential zoning district shall be one thousand (1,000) feet.

(d) Ensure that the location and amount of the living area of the residence, as seen from the street, is more prominent than the garage;

(e) Prevent garages from obscuring the main entrance from the street and ensure that the main entrance for pedestrians, rather than automobiles, is the prominent entrance;

(f) Provide for a more pleasant pedestrian environment by preventing garages and vehicle areas from dominating the views of the neighborhood from the sidewalk;

(g) Supplement the zoning regulations applied to site-built, modular, and manufactured homes, with additional standards and procedures that will promote a satisfactory living environment for residents of single-family homes and that will permit a mix of homes and other types of housing within the City of Tupelo;

(h) Permit greater diversity in the types of housing communities;

(i) Ensure that new single-family dwellings are compatible with other forms of housing; and;

(j) Ensure the provision of single-family housing opportunities for persons or families of low or moderate income by providing for design standards that ensure compatibility among various types of housing units as an alternative to exclusionary zoning.

(6) Private Lighting Poles: Private lighting poles may be located within landscaped areas or planting islands, but in no instance shall poles be located in a manner that conflicts with required landscape elements such as canopy trees.

(7) Ground-Oriented, Pedestrian-Scaled Lighting shall be considered as an alternative to pole-mounted fixtures along pedestrian walkways.

(8) Exterior Lighting: No exterior lighting shall have any blinking, flashing or fluttering lights or other illuminating device that has a changing light intensity, brightness, or color.

(9) Maximum Lighting Height: In mixed use zoning districts where walkable development standards are applied, and in residential and mixed use developments in all districts, public and private lighting fixtures shall not exceed sixteen (16) feet in height, measured from finished grade to the highest part of the fixture or pole assembly.

(a) The height and style of public lighting fixtures in all other locations shall be exempt from the standards of this subsection.

(b) Private lighting fixtures in all other locations shall not exceed twenty-five (25) feet in height, measured from finished grad to the highest part of the fixture or pole assembly, except that fixtures within fifty (50) feet of residential dwelling units or land with active approval for residential development shall not exceed sixteen (16) feet in height.

(10) Lighting Fixtures: Within residential and mixed use development where walkable development standards are applied, exterior lighting shall be of a pedestrian scale with a historic or ornamental fixture. Shoe box or cobra head style fixtures shall be prohibited.

(11) Shielding: No interior light source shall be positioned, aimed, or configured so as to result in the light source being visible from land occupied by existing residential development.

6.4.8.3 Exemptions for Security Plan

Government facilities, parks, public safety facilities or other uses that may warrant illumination levels higher than the maximum permitted may submit to the Development Services Department a Site Security Plan requesting external lighting that deviates from the standards of this section. The Director of Development Services may approve the Site Security Plan, with or without conditions, on finding that the deviation from the standards are necessary for protection of the public and will not have a significant adverse effect on neighboring lands.

6.4.8.4 Outdoor Sports Fields and Performance Areas: In addition to the above light level standards, fixtures used in lighting outdoor sports or performance areas shall be equipped with a glare control package and aimed so that their beams are directed and fall within the primary playing or performance area.

6.4.8.5 Sign Lighting: Lighting fixtures illuminating signs shall comply with the standards of this subsection, and such fixtures shall be aimed and shielded so that direct illumination is focused exclusively on the sign face.

6.4.9 Manufactured buildings for occupied use.

Manufactured buildings may be occupied for use under the following conditions:

(1) The building meets the standards of the currently adopted building codes for the use class; and
(2) The business engages in the sale of manufactured buildings, including manufactured homes; or
(3) The Director of Development Services may approve temporary occupation of manufactured buildings as replacement for a building destroyed by fire or other event, up to a maximum of two (2) years.

Otherwise manufactured buildings may be used for storage only.

 

6.5 Transitional Features

(1) Transitional features are architectural elements or site aspects used to provide a transition between certain land uses which may conflict with each other. They are an alternative to conventional landscape buffers. The intent of these standards is to limit the excessive consumption of land in vegetated buffers and to provide more connectivity between uses where it is appropriate. The Department of Development Services, the Planning Committee, or the City Council may require the use of a landscaped buffer in lieu of or in addition to a transitional feature where such buffer is necessary to reduce potential adverse impacts between incompatible uses, or where a transitional feature is not feasible.
Table 9.9.1. displays the situations in which transitional features are required or encouraged.

(2) In areas where a transition between different uses or building types is needed, one (1) or more of the following approaches shall be used:

(a) Use setbacks that are within twenty-five percent (25%) of the average setbacks for existing uses on the same block provided that no new use is closer to the right of way than any existing use;

(b) Ensure the façade width and height of structures on opposing sides of a street are consistent with each other such that neither façade exceeds the others dimensions by more than twenty-five (25%) percent;

(c) Graduate building height and mass in the form of building step-backs or other techniques so that structures with a higher intensity have a comparable scale with adjacent structures housing lower intensity uses;

(d) Use similarly sized and patterned architectural features such as windows, doors, awnings, arcades, pilasters, wall offsets, building materials and other building articulations present on the lower intensity or existing use;

(e) Locate off-street parking and service areas to the rear of structures, adjacent to similar site features on adjacent sites;

(f) Avoid abrupt changes in roof form by using similar roof types, slopes, or arrangements on the developing site;

(g) Orient primary building facades directly across from opposing primary facades regardless of use type; and

(h) When dealing with multi-building developments, establish a continuum of use intensity where uses of moderate intensity are sited between high-intensity uses and lower intensity uses.

6.6 Open Space
6.6.1 Purpose
Open space adds to the visual character and uniqueness of each development and allows for recreational and aesthetic enjoyment by the residents. In the Agriculture/Open Space zoning district, open space is provided by land in agricultural use or floodplains. In the residential zoning districts, improved open space provides centrally located community gathering spots, and play spaces that are integral to the livability of the neighborhoods, while the preservation of natural areas ensures habitat. In the Mixed Use districts, a limited quantity of open space is required as relief from the intensity of the built environment. Except for Ownership and Management of Open Space, the requirements of this section do not apply to conservation subdivisions under Sec. 6.3.3, Conservation Subdivision.
6.6.2 Required Open Space

Open space shall be required in all proposed uses of land which require development approval by the Planning Committee and/or City Council, in all districts except Agriculture/Open Space, Mixed Use Downtown, Regional Commercial and Industrial. The amount of open space shall be determined by applying the percentage shown in the development standards in Chapter 4, Zoning Districts, and Table 4.16, General Development Standards, to the total area of the property to be developed.
6.6.3 Use of Required Open Space
Required open space may consist of any of the following, up to the maximum percent credit shown.
(1) Naturally vegetated areas, including wooded areas, riparian buffers, floodways, and steep slopes: one hundred percent (100%)

(2) Areas developed for active or passive recreational uses, including walking tracks, bike paths or trails, greenways, picnic areas, benches, shelters, play areas, common greens, plazas and courtyards: one hundred percent (100%)

(3) Tree replacement areas, required buffer areas, required landscape areas: seventy-five percent (75%)

(4) Stormwater detention or management areas: fifty percent (50%)
6.6.4 Open Space Calculation: Streets, driveways, vehicular use areas and required yard spaces provided for residences may not be counted toward the open space requirement.
6.6.5 Ownership/Dedication: Land set aside as open space in residential developments shall be held in common ownership or dedicated to the public rather than platted as part of individual private lots.

6.6.6 Minimum Dimension: Within the Mixed Use Downtown, Mixed Use Commercial Corridor, Mixed Use Residential, and Mixed Use Activity Center zoning districts, a horizontal dimension of at least ten (10) feet shall be the minimum required to be considered open space.
Within all other zoning districts, a horizontal dimension of at least twenty-five (25) feet shall be the minimum required to be considered open space.
6.6.7 Useable Open Space Design General: Useable open space shall constitute at least one-third (1/3) of the required open space, except in the Agriculture/Open Space district, where no useable open space shall be required. Areas designated as useable open space, other than walking paths and bicycle trails, shall have at least one (1) side with street frontage of at least fifty (50) feet in length, and shall be accessible by sidewalks.
6.6.7.1 For developments proposing residential uses within the Mixed Use Commercial Corridor, Mixed Use Residential, and Mixed Use Activity Center zoning districts, useable open space shall be located so that ninety-five percent (95%) of the residential units in the subdivision or development are within a One thousand-three hundred (1,300) foot walking distance of an accessible, useable open space.
6.6.7.2 For developments proposing residential uses within all other zoning districts, useable open space shall be located so that ninety-five (95%) of the residential units in the subdivision or development are within a two thousand (2,600) foot walking distance of an accessible, usable open space.
6.6.8. Ownership and Management of Open Space: Prior to approval of a final plat, a program for continued maintenance of all open space areas shall be submitted. The submission shall include agreements, contracts, deed restrictions, sureties, or other legal instruments acceptable to the City, as appropriate, to guarantee the provision and continued maintenance of such common areas and facilities.
6.6.8.1 The open space shall be protected in perpetuity by a binding legal instrument that is recorded with the deed. The instrument shall be one of the following:
(1) A permanent conservation easement in favor of either:
(2) A land trust or similar conservation-oriented non-profit organization with legal authority to accept such easements (the organization shall be bona fide and in perpetual existence and the conveyance instruments shall contain an appropriate provision for retransfer in the event the organization becomes unable to carry out its functions). If the entity accepting the easement is not the City, then a third party right of enforcement favoring the City shall be included in the easement; or
(3) A governmental entity with an interest in pursuing goals compatible with the purposes of this section acceptable to the City.
(4) A permanent restrictive covenant for conservation purposes in favor of a governmental entity.
(5) An equivalent legal tool that provides permanent protection, if approved by the City.
(6) Dedication of the land to an established homeowners association (with legal standing in the property) that accepts permanent maintenance responsibility.
6.6.8.2 The instrument for permanent protection shall include clear restrictions on the use of the open space. These restrictions shall include all restrictions contained in this Article, as well as any further restrictions the applicant chooses to place on the use of the open space.
6.6.8.3 Open space that has been dedicated to an established homeowners association may be transferred with a permanent conservation easement to a land trust or similar conservation-oriented non-profit organization with legal authority to accept such easements pursuant to this section, if approved by the appropriate governing body.

 

6.7 Stormwater Management
6.7.1. Purpose and Intent
The purpose of this section is to provide adequate measures for the retention, detention, and distribution of stormwater in a manner that minimizes the possibility of adverse impacts on both water quantity and water quality during development and on adjoining properties during and after development.

6.7.2 Applicability

This section applies to any application for subdivision plat, site plan, or development approval except as otherwise provided in this chapter. A stormwater report shall be provided as set forth in the City of Tupelo Design Standards and Construction Specifications for Streets, Storm Water, Sanitary Sewer and Water Distribution.

6.7.3 System Criteria

6.7.3.1 Design Conditions: Stormwater management facilities shall normally be designed for proposed development. Three (3) development conditions shall be analyzed for each development as follows:

(1) Existing Conditions: Current development conditions in the watershed and on site. Use as the baseline analysis for determining the impact of development.

(2) Proposed Conditions: Existing conditions with the proposed development added. Use to determine if the increased run-off from the proposed development results in an adverse impact to other properties.

(3) Ultimate Conditions: Ultimate development conditions within the watershed used to design the drainage facilities. Ultimate development conditions may be used in lieu of proposed conditions to determine if the increased runoff from the ultimate watershed development results in an adverse impact to other properties, or for projects located within designated watershed protection districts, at the discretion of the City Engineer.

6.7.4.2 Design Storm Event

All drainage facilities shall be designed for a twenty-five (25) year storm. Facilities that are to convey drainage along the flooding source of a designated Special Flood Hazard Areas (SFHA) or one hundred (100) year floodplain as defined on the Flood Insurance Rate Maps (FIRM) must be designed using the one hundred (100) year (one percent (1%) chance) flood event.

6.7.4.3 Responsibility to Accept Stormwater

The owner or developer of property to be developed is responsible for the conveyance of all stormwater flowing through the property. This responsibility includes stormwater flowing onto the property by any other developed property as well as the drainage naturally flowing through the property by reason of topography. Future upstream development shall be accounted for by assuming ultimate development when sizing drainage systems as specified in this section.
6.7.4.4 Level of Service for New Development/Redevelopment

Peak stormwater run-off rates from all new development and redevelopment projects (due to zoning or re-platting) shall be less than or equal to the peak run-off rates from the sites predevelopment or existing conditions for the twenty-five (25) and one hundred (100) year design storm events. Special consideration may be given to developments that discharge runoff directly to major drainage ways such as creeks and streams, provided the increased runoff will not adversely impact the stream in question or adjoining properties.

6.7.4.5 Low Impact Stormwater Management Design

Use of low impact stormwater management, integrated management practices, and design features that are consistent with the practices described in Low-Impact Development Design Strategies: An Integrated Design Approach and Low-Impact Development Hydrologic Analysis, which are incorporated by reference and are referred to as the LID Manuals, are encouraged by reference in the Plan Goals and Design Options Checklist, Section 12.4.6.

6.7.4.6 Where applicable, compliance with the National Pollution Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit process is required.

6.8 Street Design and Transportation

6.8.1 Purpose: These regulations are designed to:

(1) Ensure that the design of streets conforms to the recommendations of the comprehensive plan;

(2) Provide for the safety for both vehicular and pedestrian traffic;

(3) Provide for livable residential and commercial environments;

(4) Provide economy of land use, construction, and maintenance; and

(5) Provide safe and efficient access to property.

6.8.2 Intent

Unlike the situation in traditional subdivision regulations, one intent of this section is to permit narrower street widths while requiring greater connectivity in order to more efficiently disperse traffic, to protect pedestrians from high vehicular speeds, and to enhance the streetscape. The City of Tupelo further finds and determines that street layout and design can have a very significant influence on the total imperviousness and hydrology of a site. Alternative road layout can result in significantly reducing imperviousness, reducing stormwater run-off, protecting water quality, and providing cost savings for developers and home buyers.

6.8.3 Applicability: This section applies to:

(1) Any application for subdivision plat approval; and

(2) Any application for site plan or development plan approval if no subdivision plat is required.

 

6.8.4 Classification

Classification of an existing or proposed street not already identified on the major street plan, for the purpose of determining the appropriate design of a roadway or development, or for the purpose of determining the appropriateness of a location for a proposed use, shall be done by the City Engineer. Pursuant to the major street plan, the following classification system, as described in Table 6.8, is adopted. Additional information on street classification and standards is provided in Appendix A, City of Tupelo Design Standards and Construction Specifications for Streets, Stormwater, Water Distribution, and Sanitary Sewer.



 

 

*See exceptions to sidewalk requirements in section 6.8.7.2.

6.8.4.1 Arterials

Arterials may be classified as either principal or minor, but for purposes of this manual and within the context of the City of Tupelo, no such separate distinction will be made. Arterials are defined as corridors generating the highest traffic volumes with the longest trip desires and are commonly referred to as major thoroughfares. The arterial system generally will consist of multiple lanes of traffic, will serve the major centers of activity and will be the primary routes entering and leaving the urban area as well as providing routes for intra-area travel, such as between business districts and outlying residential areas. Gloster Street, Main Street and McCullough Boulevard are examples of arterials within the City of Tupelo. For design considerations of this manual all arterials within the City of Tupelo will be assumed to carry five percent (5%) heavy truck traffic.

6.8.4.2 Collectors

The collector system provides land service access and traffic circulation within business districts, residential neighborhoods and industrial areas. A collector gathers traffic from within specific land use zones and distributes it to the arterial system. Collectors within the City of Tupelo may be classified as either major or minor. Major collectors function as primary routes between land use zones and tie directly into the arterial system. They will carry high volumes of traffic (ADT > 2,000) both commercial and residential. Green Street, Thomas Street and West Jackson Street are examples of major collectors within the City of Tupelo. For design purposes of this manual all major collectors within the City of Tupelo will be assumed to carry two percent (2%) heavy truck traffic unless the designer is directed to accommodate a higher or lower percentage by the city engineer. Minor collectors generally serve outlying residential and smaller confined business districts. They will distribute traffic between neighborhoods and major collectors carrying less volume (ADT < 2,000) than a major collector. They may or may not tie into the arterial system. Butler Road, Lakeshire Drive and Wilson Street are examples of minor collectors within the City of Tupelo. Heavy truck traffic will be considered negligible on minor collectors unless special consideration is ordered by the city engineer.

6.8.4.3 Local Streets

Local streets comprise all facilities that cannot be categorized into one of the other two classifications. These include mainly residential streets within distinct neighborhoods and subdivisions. They function to distribute traffic to the collector system and beyond and will often carry very low traffic volumes (ADT < 400). Except for industrial districts, local streets will be assumed to carry no truck traffic. In newly developed subdivisions local streets shall be designed so that blocks do not exceed one thousand-five hundred (1,500) feet in the Agriculture/Open Space zoning district, one thousand (1,000) feet in length in the low-density residential zoning district, or seven hundred-fifty (750) feet in other residential zones unless severe topographic constraints or other unusual features make an excessive length necessary. Connections between streets shall be created in such a way that they do not encourage the use of such streets by substantial through traffic. A local street open at only one (1) end should have a cul-de-sac turn around at the closed end. Such dead end streets should be kept to minimum length as possible and in no instance should a dead end street exceed six hundred (600) feet in length.

6.8.4.4 Alleys

Alleys are small, low volume streets that provide access to the side or rear of individual parcels of land in medium to high density residential and commercial areas. They are categorized separately from local streets in that they are intended, in many cases, to serve only a few individual parcels. In commercial districts they may be used primarily for loading and unloading of goods and other materials. In residential districts they may serve as few as two (2) or (3) three separate homes and provide a safer alternative to on street parking on the primary local and collector routes. Alleys are generally intended for one way traffic only. Alleys for rear vehicle access are required in traditional housing developments. Dead end alleys may be permissible in certain situations and where allowed should be equipped with a turn around. Minimum design criteria for turnarounds are shown on Figure 1.D of the Appendix. Because of their intended use the geometric criteria for their design will be somewhat less intrusive than that of a local street and is illustrated in Figure 1.D of the Appendix.

6.8.4.5 Factors to be Considered: In determining the classification of a street, factors to be considered include the following existing or proposed features:

(1) Facility geometrics, including the number and width of traffic lanes, turning lanes, and parking lanes;

(2) Access conditions, including any restrictions on access, the spacing of private accesses, and average lot frontages;

(3) Traffic characteristics, including average daily traffic, percentage of trucks, average operating speed, percentage of turning movements, origin-destination characteristics of the traffic, and peak-hour characteristics of traffic; and
(4) Adjacent land uses.

6.8.4.6 Geometric Design: Interior streets within the subdivision or development parcel shall conform to the standards described in Table 6.8. and the City of Tupelo Design Standards and Construction Specifications Manual.

6.8.5 Street Names and Signage

6.8.5.1 Names of new streets shall not duplicate the names of existing streets unless the new street continues or aligns with an existing street. All new street names shall be submitted to and approved by the U.S. Postal Service and Lee County E911 office.

6.8.5.2 Street Name Signs: Street name signs shall be installed at all intersections within and abutting the subdivision. Such signs shall be manufactured and installed by the subdivider in accordance with specifications of, and subject to plan reviews and inspections by, the Director of Public Works. Street name signs shall not be accepted by the City of Tupelo until the street has been accepted for maintenance by the City of Tupelo, unless approved by the Director of Development Services in order to provide mail service.

6.8.5.3 Warning and Regulatory Traffic Signs: Within the City of Tupelo limits, warning and regulatory traffic signs shall be installed within and abutting the subdivision in accordance with the Manual of Uniform Traffic Control Devices.

6.8.5.4 Street Lights: Street lights shall be provided in all subdivisions within the City of Tupelo. Street lights shall conform to the City of Tupelo Design Standards and Construction Specifications manual.

(1) When the Director of Development Services determines that the sidewalks will interfere with or disrupt drainage;

(3) The Director of Development Services determines that public construction that requires sidewalk replacement will take place on the street within three (3) years; and

(4) In single (1) or two (2) family residential subdivisions with a density less than one (1) dwelling unit per acre.

6.8.7.3 Payment in Lieu of Sidewalk Construction

The requirement of sidewalks on any proposed development where no sidewalks are existing to connect with may be met by a payment in lieu of twenty-five dollars ($25) per linear foot of right of way frontage, at the applicants option. The city of Tupelo shall apply all such payments in lieu to construction of sidewalks in areas of the city where the existing sidewalk system can be extended or completed.

6.8.7.4. Location: The field inspector may approve changes in the sidewalk location for a maximum linear distance of two hundred (200) feet without amending the street plan or utility layout provided if the plans are annotated with a note stating that intent. During the plat review process, reviewing agencies may designate areas where prior approval of the agency is necessary for any alteration to the sidewalk location. No other changes are permitted without the approval of all agencies that approved the original utility layout.

6.8.7.5. Continuity: Sidewalks shall align vertically and horizontally with abutting sidewalks. Sidewalks shall not be installed in such a manner that they conflict with or are obstructed by power lines, telephone poles, fire hydrants, traffic/street signs, mailboxes, trees, buildings, barriers, light poles, or any other structure. The grades of sidewalks shall be such that changes of grades greater than ten (10%) percent are not encountered within blocks. When there is an existing or anticipated obstruction, the sidewalk shall be installed around the object and shall provide the required sidewalk width.

(1) Exceptions: The subsection above does not apply if:

(a) The lot is at least one (1) acre in size; and

(b) The lot includes a permanent vehicular turnaround to prevent backing onto the collector or arterial street. This restriction shall be noted on the plat.

(c) If conditions are such that vehicular access to such lots cannot be provided other than from the collector or arterial street, the Director of Development Services may permit the creation of a marginal access street or easement to serve two (2) or more lots. The marginal access street or easement shall be designed to permit entry to the thoroughfare without requiring a motorist to execute a backing maneuver. Marginal access streets or easements shall be included on the subdivision plat.

6.8.8.3 Nonresidential, Multifamily, or Mixed-Use Developments: Lots that are not used for single-family or duplex dwellings, are permitted vehicular access from a collector or higher-order street subject to this section. The number of access points shall not exceed one (1) for every two hundred (200) feet of frontage. Developments that are intended to be subdivided into multiple parcels, with or without multiple business owners, will be viewed as a single development/business enterprise and will be subject to the requirements of this section as such. Individual parcels within such developments shall not be permitted access unless the access point meets the requirements of this section.

6.8.8.4 Cross Access: All lots in commercial or mixed-use zoning districts that front an arterial or collector street shall provide an access connection to abutting parking areas that is at least twenty-two (22) feet in width. The applicant may grant a common access easement across the lot or recorded deed covenant providing common access across the lot with adjacent lot or lots as a traffic mitigation measure in support of a traffic special use permit as provided in Section 12.6. Where adjacent land is vacant, a stub for future cross access shall be provided.

CHAPTER 7. ACCESSORY AND TEMPORARY STRUCTURES AND USES
7.1 Purpose and Intent

This section authorizes the establishment of accessory structures and uses that are incidental and subordinate to principal structures and uses. Standards for principal structures may be found in Chapters 4 and 6. The intent of this section is to allow a broad range of accessory structures and uses, so long as they are located on the same site as the principal use, they comply with the standards set forth in this section, and they do not create adverse impacts to the surrounding community. Accessory structures include satellite dish antennae; swimming pools; fences and walls; storage buildings; storm shelters; commercial-grade playground equipment; and accessory dwelling units. Accessory uses include home occupations; home businesses; small and large day care homes; dog kennels; outdoor dining; outdoor display of merchandise; and outdoor storage of merchandise. Signs are considered accessory structures and are governed by the standards and sign permit procedures set forth in Chapter 10.

7.2 Standards for Accessory Structures

7.2.1 All accessory structures shall:

(1) Directly serve the principal use or structure;
(2) Be accessory and clearly incidental to the principal structure;
(3) Be clearly subordinate in area, extent, and purpose to the principal structure;
(4) Be owned or operated by the same person as the principal structure;
(5) Be located on the same lot as the principal use or structure;
(6) Be subject to all applicable design and development standards for the zoning district and the principal use;

(7) Be constructed on or after the date when the principal structure is constructed;
(8) Not have any adverse impact on surrounding property;
(9) Be maintained in a safe, sanitary, and secure fashion.

7.2.2 Residential accessory structures shall:

(1) Be no more than thirty-five percent (35%) of the gross floor area (GFA) or two thousand (2,000) square feet, whichever is less, when accessory to a principal residential use (the square footage of all accessory uses and structures shall be combined to determine the total);

(2) Not exceed the height of the principal structure.

(3) Accessory buildings to be located in a side yard shall be constructed with a similar design and construction materials as the principal building or be screened from view from the front and side property lines by a solid board fence or opaque landscaping that shields the structure from view. See Chapter 9 for standards on opaque landscaping.

7.2.3 Structures accessory to non-residential uses shall:

(1) Be no more than forty percent (40%) of the gross floor area (GFA) of the principal building or buildings on a lot;

(2) Not be located in front of the primary structure, except for fences meeting height and location restrictions in Section 7.5;

(3) Not encroach on any required setback;

(4) Not be located within the side and rear yards of lots adjacent to Low Density Residential, Medium Density Residential, and Mixed Use Residential districts.

Where the structure is on a corner lot with two (2) front setbacks, the parking shall be located behind both front lines.

7.4.2 If the ADU is to be new construction rather than redevelopment of an existing structure, it shall have a roof pitch, siding, and window proportions similar to that of the principal dwelling in order to maintain the architectural design, style, appearance, and character of the main building as a single-family residence.

7.4.3 The accessory dwelling shall be connected to the central water and sewer system of the principal dwelling.

7.4.4 The property owner must occupy either the principal dwelling or the accessory dwelling as his/her permanent residence. For purposes of this section, property owner means the title holder and/or contract purchaser of the lot, and owner occupancy means that a property owner, as reflected in the title records, makes his/her legal residence at the site, as evidenced by voter registration, vehicle registration, or similar means.

7.4.5 The property owner shall sign an affidavit before a notary public affirming that the owner occupies either the principal dwelling or the accessory dwelling. The applicant shall provide a covenant suitable for recording with the recorder of deeds providing notice to future owners or long-term lessors of the subject lot that the existence of the accessory dwelling unit is predicated upon the occupancy of either the accessory dwelling or the principal dwelling by the person to whom the certificate of occupancy has been issued.

CHAPTER 8. OFF-STREET PARKING
8.1 General

8.1.1 Purpose

Parking lots, loading areas, and similar features are necessary elements in the built environment. However, these infrastructure improvements can often cause negative impacts. They increase stormwater volume and velocity, surface pollutants, and surface level heat and glare. Poor design can increase the risk of collision for motorists, pedestrians, and cyclists. To mitigate these negative impacts, and to provide adequate service, the City of Tupelo has enacted standards to regulate the construction, expansion, and renovation of such facilities. These standards are intended to relieve traffic congestion in streets, minimize detrimental effects on adjacent properties, and ensure uniform development of parking areas throughout the City. Additionally, good design of parking lots can improve safety and help maintain the aesthetic character Tupelo currently has.

8.1.2 Off Street Parking Required

There shall be provided at the time of the erection of any building, or at the time any principal building is enlarged or increased in capacity by adding dwelling units, guest rooms, seats, or floor area, permanent off-street parking spaces in the amount specified by this Section. A change in use in an existing building may also require different parking standards. In the MUD district, the Director of Development Services or designee will determine whether the proposed development shall be exempt from parking requirements. Such determination shall be based on the buildings size and location and the presence of available on-street or shared off-street parking.

8.2 Basic Standards

8.2.1 Minimum and Maximum Parking Standards

(1) Table 8.2.7, Off Street Parking Standards, lists parking requirements for each use and shall be used to calculate parking spaces needed for a proposed development. All site plans shall include the location and dimensions of all off-street parking in accordance with this Section the Code. Such plans shall include disabled parking spaces according to the requirements of the currently adopted building code. This information shall be in sufficient detail to enable Development Services staff to determine if the minimum standards have been met.

(2) Multi-family and non-residential development shall be permitted to apply for additional parking. A development with a total parking requirement of twenty (20) or fewer spaces may provide up to twenty-five percent (25%) more spaces as a permitted use. Such development may apply for a compatible use permit for twenty-six to fifty percent (26%-50%) more parking spaces and a flexible use permit for fifty-one percent (51%) or more parking spaces. A development of twenty-one (21) or more spaces may provide up to twenty-five percent (25%) more spaces as a permitted use. Such development may apply for a compatible use permit for twenty-six to fifty percent (26%-50%) more parking spaces and a flexible use permit for fifty-one percent (51%) or more additional spaces.

(3) The process of obtaining a compatible or flexible use permit shall allow the developer to show how mitigation strategies or design alternatives shall offset the additional stormwater runoff and other impacts the increased parking will create. These measures could include grass parking, pervious pavement, stormwater islands, bio-retention areas, increased landscaping, or other tools. In determining whether to approve a conditional use permit, the City of Tupelo shall also consider the site design of the development and the visual effect of additional parking. Developers are encouraged to locate parking in an area that is less visible from the street and thus mitigates any adverse visual impact.

8.2.2 Combination of Required Parking Space

A development which incorporates two (2) or more uses may combine required parking space for those uses in one (1) lot. In such cases, some of the required space assigned to one (1) use may be shared by another if the peak use times are likely to be different (for instance, an office and a church). Up to one-half (½) of the required parking space for each use may be shared. The Development Services Director shall determine the uses based on signed contracts from tenants, a site plan which clearly demonstrates the future use of each space, or another means.

8.2.3 Shared Parking

The joint use of shared off-street parking between two (2) uses may be made by contract or written permission between two (2) or more adjacent property owners. Entities that have peak hours at different times may jointly use or share the same parking spaces with a maximum of half (½) of the parking spaces credited to both uses. Where feasible, shared parking shall be adjacent to the principal use or connected by a pedestrian walkway and shall not be separated from the principal use by a major thoroughfare.

8.2.4 Remote Parking Space

If some or all of the off-street parking spaces required by this Code cannot reasonably be located on the same lot as the principal use, then such spaces may be provided on land within four hundred (400) feet on the main entrance to such principal use, provided that:

(1) Such land is owned by the same person or persons as the principal use;

(2) Such land is not separated from the principal use by a major thoroughfare or arterial street.

(3) Such land is located in a zoning district within which the principal use would be allowed as a permitted or special use;

(4) There is a pedestrian walkway or sidewalk connecting the parking area to the use it serves or will be before certificate of occupancy is issued.

(5) In such cases, the applicant for a building permit or certificate of occupancy for the principal use shall submit, along with his or her application for such permit or certificate, a legal instrument, duly executed and acknowledged which subjects and restricts the land to use for parking in connection with the principal use. Upon the issuance of a building permit or certificate of occupancy, the applicant shall register the legal instrument in the Chancery Clerks Office.

(6) The restrictions of this Section shall not apply to those uses which share parking spaces as provided above.

8.2.5 Reduction in Parking Space

(1) As part of the review and approval of a site plan, the Development Services Director may approve a request for the reduction in the number of parking spaces required by this Section upon finding that the reduced number of parking spaces will be sufficient to satisfy the demand for parking expected for the use, considering the nature of the use, the number of trips generated by the use, the times of day when the use generates the most trips, any shared parking agreement in effect, and the extent to which other establishments are located on the same property and may reduce the number of vehicle trips required between different establishments.

(2) In cases where no site plan is required, or where a previously approved site plan remains in effect for the property, the Planning Committee may grant a variance from the parking requirements above only upon finding that the reduced number of parking spaces will be sufficient to satisfy the demand for parking expected for the use, considering the nature of the use, the number of trips generated by the use, the times of day when the use generates the most trips, and the extent to which other establishments are located on the same property and may reduce the number of vehicle trips required between different establishments, in addition to finding that the variance meets the general standards for variances set forth in this Section.

8.2.6 Timing of Construction

All parking areas required under this Section shall be completed prior to the issuance of a certificate of occupancy for the use or uses which they serve. In some cases, provided the owner shall execute an agreement to complete the required parking within six (6) months of the date of occupancy of the building, the Building Official may authorize such an extension.

8.2.7 Off-Street Parking Standards

Click here: The following minimum number of off-street parking space(s) shall be provided for each use:

8.2.8. Computation of Off-Street Parking Requirements

8.2.8.1 Calculations

When measurements of the number of required spaces result in fractions, the space requirements shall be rounded upward to the next highest whole number.

8.2.8.2 Different Use Areas

Except as provided for in this Section, parking shall be calculated separately for the area of each different use in a building or on a site, including all accessory uses. For instance, a building which has a portion open to the public as retail and a portion used by the business as warehouse space shall have parking computed based on the floor area open to customers and the floor area used as a warehouse.

8.2.8.3 On-Street Parking

Except as provided for in this Section, on-street parking within public or private streets, driveways, or drives, shall not be used to satisfy the off-street parking or overflow requirements prescribed by Section 8.2.

8.2.8.4 Unimpeded Parking

No parking spaces shall be located so as to require the moving of any vehicle on the premises in order to enter or leave any other space. Notwithstanding the above, the Development Services Director may, on a case-by-case basis, allow stacking spaces provided for auto-related uses (e.g. fleet vehicles) to count toward the minimum required parking, as long as such spaces are not part of areas required for site ingress or egress, or areas intended for fueling.

8.2.8.5 Parking Space Adjacent to Alleys

Where off-street parking facilities are located adjacent to an alley, the width of such alley may be accounted as a portion of the required maneuvering and access area, but not as part of the parking spaces required.

8.3 Improvement, Design and Location Standards

8.3.1 Residential Parking Standards

(1) Residential uses shall provide paved parking areas according to the standards in table 8.2.7. No more than twenty five percent (25%) of the front yard area of any residential property shall be paved.

(2) Driveways in Agriculture/Open Space and Low Density Residential Districts on residential lots of two (2) or more acres may be surfaced with gravel or crushed stone.

(3) Residential uses shall not have recreational vehicles, commercial vehicles, boats, trailers of fifteen (15) feet or less, or similar vehicles stored in front of the front edge of the house. They may be stored in the side yard, back yard, garage, or in a carport or driveway behind the front edge of the house. Any such vehicle shall be stored within the side setback, at least five (5) feet from the rear setback, and on a concrete pad or driveway.

(4) Commercial vehicles rated greater than three-quarter (¾) ton, buses, trailers exceeding fifteen (15) feet in length, tractors, tractor trailers, heavy equipment such as bulldozers and road graders, and similar vehicles are prohibited in all subdivisions and on lots of forty thousand (40,000) sq. ft. or less, except for unloading, loading, or construction as approved by a City of Tupelo building permit. Under no circumstances shall any of the above mentioned items be stored in front of the front edge of a house or closer than fifty (50) feet to any property line.

(5) A recreational vehicle shall not be used for sleeping quarters while in a residential district for greater than fifteen (15) days per year.

(b) They shall be permanently maintained by the owner(s) in compliance with the approved site plan and/or preliminary subdivision plat.

(c) All parking and loading spaces shall be covered with an all-weather surface designed to support anticipated loads as specified in the City of Tupelo Design Standards and Construction Specifications for Streets, Storm Water, Sanitary Sewer and Water Distribution manual. Unpaved parking may be permitted for up to seventy-five percent (75%) of required parking for places of worship and/or assembly and on a case-by-case basis for similar uses that have very limited hours of peak service. A porous pavement system may be allowed in place of conventional paving materials, subject to the approval of the City Engineer.

(d) All off street parking areas shall be required to have curbing around the entire parking lot unless waived by the Development Services Department because landscape islands, stormwater islands, bio-retention areas, low-impact parking methods, increased landscaping, or other tools will capture stormwater on site.

(e) They shall meet the parking lot landscaping standards of Section 9.7, Vehicular Use Area Landscaping.

(f) They shall be located and designed to avoid undue interference with the use of public streets. Parking areas for nonresidential and apartment development uses shall provide suitable maneuvering room so that all vehicles may enter an abutting street in a forward direction. Backing into public streets is prohibited for all nonresidential uses and for apartment developments.

CHAPTER 9. LANDSCAPING AND BUFFERING
9.1 General

9.1.1 Purpose and Intent

The standards of this section provide for the preservation of existing vegetation and for the installation and maintenance of new vegetation and other landscape architectural features. The purpose of these standards is to:

(1) Improve property and community appearance without compromising community safety, including minimization of the visual impact of extensive land disturbance;

(2) Allow for the ecological benefits provided by plant materials, including protection of land from unnecessary erosion and watercourse sedimentation, reduction of stormwater runoff, improvement of air quality, and provision of wildlife habitat;

(3) Reduce the heat island effect;

(4) Enhance the beauty of the built environment; and

(5) Enhance the attractiveness and value of commercial areas and the privacy and welfare of residential areas by buffering incompatible land uses, where potential impacts cannot be mitigated through design compatibility concepts or transitional features.

9.1.2 Applicability

(1) The landscaping and buffering standards of this section shall apply to all proposed development for which a minor or major site plan, development plan, or preliminary plat is required.

(2) Land used toward achieving the requirements of the section need not hold the same zoning designation as the use to which the landscaping and buffer applies, unless the property is zoned with a development plan showing all requirements met onsite. If the landscaping or buffer is not on site, the landscaping shall either be on the same lot or on contiguous property under the same permanent possession or control as the lot on which the use is located.

9.1.3 Variations: The approving authority may modify the buffer and landscape standards of this chapter where:

(1) There are special considerations of site design and/or topography.

(2) The plantings or planting area would conflict with utilities, easements, or overhead power lines, or encroach upon City trees.

(3) Proposed street widening not provided by the developer will consume the landscaping area.

(4) The approving authority may require alternative buffers or landscaping, including locations other than those typically required, when a modification to the requirements of this section is warranted in order to meet the intent of the specified standards.

9.2 Landscape Design Principles

The following standards are intended to ensure that community appearance, the value of property, environmental quality, or the safety of residents and visitors are not compromised through poor landscape design. These standards shall be balanced against other objectives of landscaping, such as sheltering, buffering and screening purposes in the review of landscape plans.

(1) Landscaping should contribute to the livability of the environment.

(2) A water-wise approach to landscape materials (including mulch), design and installations is encouraged. The amount of irrigation and maintenance required for landscaping should be minimized.

(3) Landscaping in the Agriculture/Open Space and Low Density Residential zoning districts should be clustered to provide a natural impression. Landscaping in the other zoning districts may be arranged more formally.

(4) Landscaping should be selected, installed and maintained so that it allows unobstructed views of vulnerable doors and windows from the street and other properties and avoids blind spots and hiding spaces.

(5) Landscape materials should be selected and arranged to add variety and visual interest.

(6) Site landscaping and streetscapes should be compatible and complement one another.

(7) Site landscaping shall not conflict with utility placement.

(8) Landscaping should be used to define property lines and private areas with planting areas, pavement treatments, or walls and fences.

(9) Landscaping, fences, walls and paving treatments should be designed to guide visitors to desired entrances and away from private areas.

(10) Plant placement in buffers may include clustering; however, such clustering should be reflected in plant placement that provides the maximum protection of neighboring properties.

(11) Landscaping should be used to divide parking areas into smaller lots.
9.3. Basic Plant Types

9.9.2 Walls, Berms and Fences in Buffers: Where walls, berms or fences are built within any required project boundary buffer, they shall meet the following requirements:

(1) All walls, when located within a buffer, shall be planted on the side facing the adjacent property with at least one (1) upright shrub for every six (6) feet of wall length. Where shrubs are planted adjacent to a wall, the minimum distance between the wall and the property line shall be four (4) feet.

(2) The applicant shall be required to demonstrate provision for access and maintenance of landscaping and the wall structure at the time of landscape plan approval.

(3) Berms located within a buffer shall have side slopes of not less than three (3) feet horizontal for each one (1) foot vertical and a minimum crown width of two (2) feet.

(4) Prior to issuance of the first certificate of compliance, berms shall be planted to ensure coverage by live plant material within three (3) to five (5) years.

(5) Fences shall be maintained in a structurally safe and attractive condition and with finished faces and plantings located towards the adjacent property with at least one (1) upright shrub for every six (6) linear feet of fence length.

9.9.3 Separate Parcels for Stormwater Management: Where a separate legal parcel is permitted for stormwater management, buffers consistent with those required for the remainder of the project shall be required.

9.9.4 Permitted Activity Within Project Boundary Buffers:

(1) Driveways or walkways may cross a project boundary buffer, provided they cross at as near a perpendicular angle as practical. Walking paths or trails may be placed within project boundary buffers.

(2) Existing specimen trees, as defined in Section 9.6, Protection of Existing Vegetation, that are located within a required project boundary buffer shall be retained, except where the approving authority determines that the removal of such trees is required to provide safe and reasonable access to the property.

9.9.5 Variations in Buffer Width

Buffer width shall normally be calculated as perpendicular to the property line, however, design variations may be allowed and shall be calculated based on the average width of the buffer per one hundred (100) feet or portion thereof. In no case shall the minimum width of the buffer be less than one-half (½) the required width. The maximum width, for the purposes of installing required landscaping or receiving credit for existing vegetation, shall not be more than one and one-half (1 ½) times the required buffer width.

9.9.6 Off-Site Vegetation

Existing plant material on adjacent property may be credited toward buffer requirements, provided that such material is in a permanently protected area such as a conservation or landscape easement or similarly preserved area. Credit for offsite plant material shall be calculated as provided in Section 9.8.

9.9.7 Standards

(1) Constructed Buffer: The following four (4) basic buffer templates and two (2) alternatives are to be used as specified in table 9.9.

(a) The Type A Opaque Buffer is used between high impact uses and residential or mixed uses. It provides a continuous, solid screen to the height of six (6) feet, serving as a sight and noise barrier. The buffer width is fifty (50) feet. Trees required may not have greater than five (5) foot opening between mature canopies. Fifty percent (50%) of trees and one hundred percent (100%) of shrubs must be evergreen.

(b) The Type B Opaque Buffer is used in cases of lesser degrees of incompatibility, such as between non-residential uses that are not high impact and residential uses. Its planting requirements are the same as the Type A buffer but with a thirty (30) foot width.

(c) The Type C Semi-Opaque Buffer is used in relatively low incompatibility cases; such as between mixed use development and detached dwellings. It provides a semi-solid screen allowing views between properties. The buffer width is twenty (20) feet. Trees required may not have greater than ten (10) foot opening between mature canopies. No understory trees and fewer shrubs are required.

(d) The Type D Open Buffer provides a tree buffer while allowing view between properties. The buffer width is ten (10) feet with three (3) canopy trees and three (3) understory trees per one hundred (100) feet of length. The buffer width is ten (10) feet. Canopy spacing is not to exceed twenty (20) feet.

(e) The Type E Overhead Utility Buffer shall be permitted only where overhead utilities make larger tree planting impractical. It is defined as the applicable Type A, B, C, or D Buffer with canopy trees replaced by understory trees.

(f) The Type F Intense Buffer is an alternative allowing reduction of buffer width by replacing shrubs with a wall, fence or berm. Type A buffers may be reduced to twenty-five (25) feet, type B buffers to twenty (20) feet, Type C buffers to fifteen (15) feet.

i. Use of Type F Buffers may be approved as part of site plan, preliminary plat, development plan, compatible use, or flexible use approval. The approving authority may allow comparable flexibility in buffer plantings or dimensions if the design intent of the applicable buffer type is satisfied.

(g) All shrubs used to meet constructed buffer requirements shall be upright shrubs.

(2) Natural Buffers: Existing healthy, natural forest cover and other vegetation shall be used to meet buffer requirements in the Agriculture/Open Space and Low Density Residential Districts as follows:

(a) Where the existing tree cover exceeds fifteen (15) feet in height; and

(b) Where the existing tree canopy covers seventy-five percent (75%) or more of the required buffer area.

(c) The minimum width of a required natural buffer shall be fifty (50) feet.

(3) Natural Buffer as an Option: In zoning districts that do not require use of a natural buffer, a natural buffer may be employed. A minimum natural buffer width of twenty-five (25) feet or the width required to satisfy the applicable constructed buffer requirement, whichever is greater, shall be provided in these instances.

(a) Tree Protection in Natural Buffers

(b) In addition to the requirements of Section 9.11, Tree Protection and Tree Coverage

(c) Preservation, trees within natural buffers shall be protected as follows:

(d) For the trees with a diameter at breast height of thirty (30) inches or less, seventy-five percent (75%) of the root protection zone shall be undisturbed; and

(e) For trees over thirty (30) inches diameter at breast height, at least ninety percent (90%) of the root protection zone shall be undisturbed.

(4) Additional Planting: The Development Services Director, or designee, may require additional planting in a natural buffer if it does not meet the vegetation standards required for the applicable constructed buffer. Sampling of existing vegetation within a natural buffer shall be required to determine if it meets this standard.

9.9.8. Land Disturbance Buffers

(1) Land disturbing activity of five (5) acres or more where no other site improvements are proposed shall require perimeter buffers at all exterior lot lines pursuant to this section.

(2) Buffers required by this section shall no longer be required if a site plan for other site improvements (other than preliminary plat) has been approved, although buffers may be required by other provisions of this Ordinance.

(3) If such a site plan or a final plat is approved, the required land disturbance buffer shall be retained until a project boundary buffer pursuant to Section 9.9.1., Constructed Buffers, is installed, or a natural buffer pursuant to Section 9.9.2. Natural Buffers, is approved.

(4) No grading shall be allowed within land disturbance buffers except to provide reasonable access and for utility installation. Utilities shall be located to limit disturbance to existing vegetation and shall be approved prior to installation.

(5) Perimeter land disturbance buffers adjoining other properties (along exterior property lines), a minimum of thirty-two (32) feet in width, measured perpendicular to the boundary of the site, shall be in place prior to any land disturbing activity, unless the adjoining property is undeveloped and has had no applications for development filed, in which case no perimeter land disturbance buffers shall be required on those sides of the site proposed for disturbance.

(6) Such buffers, when required, shall consist of existing vegetation with supplemental vegetation added, when necessary, that meets or exceeds the requirements of Table 9.9, Constructed Buffer.

(7) Land disturbance buffers along public right-of-way at least fifty (50) feet in width measured perpendicular to the boundary of the site shall be in place prior to any land disturbing activity.

(8) Such buffers shall consist of preserved vegetation with supplemental vegetation added, when necessary, that meets or exceeds the standards of Table 9.9, Constructed Buffer, exclusive of areas for reasonable access or for utility installation.

(9) Exemptions: Forestry activities conducted in conformance with a Forest Management Plan that uses the current best management practices as adopted by the Mississippi Forestry Commission shall not require a land disturbance buffer.

(10) Revegetation: Revegetation is required where land disturbing activity has taken place, and no site plan for improvements has been approved within two (2) years.

(a) An owner shall have two (2) years from the date that a site plan is approved for land disturbing activity subject to this section where no other tract improvements are proposed either to secure site plan approval for development of the tract or to revegetate the site.

(b) Revegetation required by this section shall not be required upon approval of a site plan for site improvements (other than a preliminary plat) for that portion of the development tract with such improvements proposed. The remainder of the development tract shall continue to require revegetation until a site plan showing other site improvements (other than a preliminary plat) is approved.

(c) Standards: So long as the required land disturbance buffers pursuant to this section have been provided and maintained, revegetation of a tract with a ground cover sufficient to restrain erosion shall satisfy the requirement for revegetation.

i. If the required land disturbance buffers were not provided and maintained, revegetation of a tract shall create a biological community composed of a mixed and variable assemblage of native vegetation which is appropriate for the existing site conditions with at least three (3) different species of trees native to Mississippi and a tree density of at least two hundred (200) living trees per acre, with at least fifty percent (50%) of those trees having the potential of attaining a two and one-half (2 ½) inch or greater diameter at breast height within seven (7) years.
9.10 Riparian Buffers
9.10.1 Purpose
The primary purpose of the riparian buffer protection standards is to maintain land adjacent to streams in a vegetated state in order to enhance and maintain water quality, protect stream channel wetlands, minimize stormwater runoff, reduce sedimentation and erosion, conserve plant and wildlife habitat and protect movement corridors.
9.10.2 Types of Riparian Buffers and Naturally Occurring Ponds and Lakes: Riparian buffers shall be clearly indicated on all development plans, site plans, preliminary plats and final plats.
Where maps show a difference in stream type for a particular reach of stream, the map that shows the greater level of stream protection shall apply.
(1) Riparian Buffer Size: Riparian buffers shall apply on each side of the stream and shall begin at the most landward limit of the top of the bank perpendicular to the direction of stream flow. Riparian buffers shall be a minimum of fifty (50) feet in width for perennial streams and thirty (30) feet in width for intermittent streams.
(2) Riparian Buffer Use Limitations: Land within the riparian buffer shall not serve to meet minimum lot size requirements, except on property zoned A-O, Agriculture/Open Space, or LDR, Low Density Residential, where at least fifty percent (50%) of the required lot area is outside the riparian buffer.
(a) Buildings and other features that require grading and construction shall be set back at least ten (10) feet from the edge of the riparian buffer.
(b) To avoid a loss of effectiveness in protecting streams, the riparian buffer shall remain in natural undisturbed vegetation except as provided by this section or allowed pursuant to a variance approved by the Planning Committee in accordance with Section 12.14, Variances. Riparian buffers within any Mixed Use Zoning District may be landscaped rather than left in an undisturbed state, at the discretion of the property-owner in accordance with an approved revegetation plan.
(c) Any use allowed by this section shall be designed and constructed to minimize the amount of intrusion into the riparian buffer and to minimize clearing, grading, erosion and water quality degradation.
(d) Crossings by streets, driveways, railroads, recreational features, intakes, docks, utilities, bridges or other facilities shall be allowed provided that they are designed to minimize the amount of intrusion into the riparian buffer. Such facilities may run generally within and parallel to the riparian buffer only where no alternative location is practical and when their design minimizes the amount of intrusion of the riparian buffer.
(e) Stormwater control structures and temporary erosion control structures shall be considered utilities for the purposes of this section and may be allowed in riparian buffers provided that:
(i)The property owner or applicant demonstrates to the satisfaction of the City Public Works Director or City Engineer, or their designees, as appropriate, that such facilities cannot be practicably located outside of the riparian buffer, and that any proposed stormwater control structure is sited and designed to minimize disturbance of the stream and riparian buffer. Siting stormwater control structures away from the stream channel shall be considered preferable to siting such structures in the stream channel;
(ii)Alternate methods of stormwater and erosion control shall be considered prior to approval of such structures in the riparian buffers; and
(iii)A vegetated buffer of a width determined by the City Public Works Director or the City Engineer, or their designees, as appropriate, may be required around the stormwater control structures.
(iv)Sanitary sewer lines, on an alignment generally parallel to the stream, may be allowed in riparian buffers, provided that:
(v)The property owner or applicant demonstrates to the satisfaction of the City Public Works Director or the City Engineer, or their designees, as appropriate, that the lines cannot be practicably located outside of the riparian buffer;
(vi)Design and construction specifications minimize damage to the stream and the possibility of line leakage; and,
(vii)The line is generally located at least thirty-five (35) feet from the top of the stream bank and the easement is no closer than twenty (20) feet from the top of the bank.
(viii)Riparian buffers may be used for passive recreational activities, such as trails, provided that service facilities for such activities, including but not limited to parking, picnicking and sanitary facilities, are located outside of the riparian buffer.

9.11 Tree Protection and Tree Coverage Preservation

9.11.1 Purpose and Intent: The purpose and intent of this Section is to:

(1) Assist in providing adequate light and air;

(2) Prevent erosion and siltation and aid in the absorption of air pollutants through conservation of trees and other vegetation;

(3) Provide visual buffering and enhance the beatification of the City of Tupelo;

(4) Safeguard and enhance property values and protect public and private investment;

(5) Provide habitat for living things that might not otherwise be found in the urban environs; and,

(6) Protect the quality of water resources from future degradation by maintaining vegetative cover and controlling disturbance of vegetation.

9.11.2 Applicability: The requirements of this Section shall apply to all uses for which minor or major site plan or major subdivision approval is required pursuant to Chapter 13 of this Ordinance.
9.11.3 Tree Protection: The intent of this section is to minimize the removal of protected trees in commercial and residential developments. It is the further intent of this section to ensure that developers take reasonable measures to design and locate proposed improvements so that the number of protected trees that may be approved for removal is minimized. The design shall especially protect and preserve historic and specimen trees.

(1) Protected Trees: The types of trees listed below are considered protected trees for the Development Code.



 

 

(2) In all zoning districts where commercial or residential uses are allowed as by right, compatible or flexible uses, no person shall remove or otherwise damage any protected tree prior to submittal of development plans, or during the development process, without submittal of a tree survey and the execution of an agreement between the property owner and/or developer and the city, stating any tree replacement requirements that may apply to future development of the property.

(3) Historic and Specimen Trees: An historic tree is one that is designated by the City of Tupelo as being of notable historical interest and value due to its association with the physical and cultural development of the City of Tupelo. Upon identification of an historic tree, the City shall hold a public hearing for designation purposes and due notice provided to the owner of the tree.

(a) A specimen tree is one that is designated by the City of Tupelo as being of high value due to its type, size, age and other relevant criteria. Upon identification of a specimen tree, the City shall hold a public hearing for designation purposes and due notice provided to the owner of the tree.

(b) No historic or specimen tree shall be removed without finding by the City of Tupelo that the tree is a hazard or that it is not economically or practically feasible to develop the parcel without removing the tree.

9.11.4 Tree Removal Procedure: The procedures and standards for review of planned tree removal shall be as follows:

(1) Any person desiring to remove trees in connection with, or for the purpose of, the construction or development of a development requiring minor or major site plan or major subdivision approval, shall first submit a site plan to the Development Services Department. The preliminary plat required by Section 12.10 or the site plan required by Section 12.11 shall be sufficient to satisfy this requirement provided it contains a generalized tree survey based upon the most current available information.

(2) The tree survey shall show the approximate location, extent and type of protected trees upon the site, including common or scientific names of the major groups of trees. The survey shall indicate which protected trees are intended for removal and/or grubbing and which will be left undisturbed. For nonresidential and multifamily development, the survey may be in the form of an aerial or a field survey, and shall be accompanied by photographs illustrating areas of trees.

(3) If site development plans have been prepared, the survey shall be prepared to the same scale or in some other manner which clearly illustrates the relationships between areas of protected trees and proposed site improvements. If site development plans are available, the survey shall be prepared to a convenient scale which clearly reveals the extent of protected trees upon the site.

(4) The site plan and accompanying documents shall be submitted in copies sufficient to administer this Section, and shall include the name, address, and telephone number of the land owner and his agent.

(5) The filing of a site plan shall be deemed to extend permission to the City of Tupelo employees and/or Planning Committee members to inspect the subject site if necessary for purpose of evaluating the application.

9.11.5 Review Criteria: No site plan or preliminary subdivision plat shall be approved authorizing the removal of a protected tree unless the developer/owner demonstrates one (1) or more of the following conditions:

(1) A permissible use of the site cannot reasonably be undertaken unless specific trees are removed or relocated;

(2) The tree is located in such proximity to an existing or proposed structure that the safety, utility, or structural integrity of the structure is materially impaired;

(3) The tree materially interferes with the location, servicing or functioning of existing utility lines or services;

(4) The tree creates a substantial hazard to motor, bicycle, or pedestrian traffic by virtue of physical proximity to traffic or impairment of vision;

(5) The tree is diseased, insect ridden, or weakened by age, abuse, storm or fire and is likely to cause injury or damage to people, buildings or other improvements;

(6) The removal of the tree is necessary to promote the growth of surrounding protected trees. Under this provision, the applicant must demonstrate a preference for protecting historic and specimen trees. Trees removed pursuant to this subsection are exempt from tree replacement requirements; or

(7) Any law or regulation requires the removal.

9.11.6 Review Procedures: The City of Tupelo Development Services Department shall review each completed site plan or preliminary plat according to procedures stated in Sections 12.10 and 12.11.

9.11.7 Replacement of Removed Trees

(1) Protected trees removed shall be replaced at the expense of the developer/owner. Each removed tree shall be replaced with a new tree(s) having a total tree caliper equivalent to that of the removed tree. Replacement trees shall be of species appropriate for mitigation of the specific function (canopy, ornamental, et cetera) of removed trees.

(2) Single-trunk replacement trees shall be a minimum of two (2) inches in diameter at a point six (6) inches above the base and a minimum of six (6) feet in overall height.

(3) A replacement tree may be a tree moved from one (1) location to another on the site.

(4) If the developer/owner demonstrates to the satisfaction of the Development Services Department that the site cannot accommodate the total number of required replacement trees as a result of insufficient planting area, the developer/ owner shall provide the remaining replacement trees, of species approved by the city arborist, at the appropriate planting season to the City of Tupelo Public Works Department for placement on city or other public property in the City of Tupelo.

(5) Cash payment in lieu of replacement trees may be accepted with documentation of current cost of appropriate trees.

(6) Any replacement tree, planted for credit, which dies within one (1) year of planting, shall be replaced by a tree of a minimum of two inches in diameter and a minimum of ten (10) feet in overall height at the time of planting.

9.11.8 Protection of Trees During Development Activities: Generally, to assure the health and survival of protected trees that are not to be removed, the developer shall avoid the following kinds of tree injuries during all development activities:

(1) Mechanical injuries to roots, trunk, and branches;
(2) Injuries by chemical poisoning;
(3) Injuries by grade changes;
(4) Injuries by excavations; and
(5) Injuries by paving.
9.11.9 Tree Protection Zone: A circular tree protection zone shall be established around each protected tree or group of protected trees as follows:

(1) If the drip line is less than six (6) feet from the trunk of the tree, the zone shall be that area within a radius of six (6) feet around the tree.

(2) If the drip line is more than six (6) feet from the trunk of the tree, but less than twenty (20) feet, the zone shall be that area within a radius of the full drip line around the tree.

9.11.10 Development Prohibited Within the Tree Protection Zone: All development activities shall be prohibited within the tree protection zone provided for any protected trees, including any construction of buildings, structures, paving surfaces, and stormwater retention/detention ponds. All temporary construction activities shall also be prohibited within tree protection areas, including all digging, concrete washing, storage of construction material, and parking of construction vehicles.

9.11.11 Fencing of Tree Protection Zone: Prior to the commencement of construction, the developer shall enclose the entire tree protection zone within a fence or similar barriers as follows:

(1) Steel T posts shall be implanted in the ground deep enough to be stable and with at least five (5) feet above ground;

(2) The protective posts shall be placed not more than six (6) feet apart, and shall be linked together by a rope, chain, or highly visible woven fabric;

(3) During construction, each tree protection zone shall be clearly identified with two (2) temporary signs that is at least four (4) feet in height and at least eighteen (18) inches by twenty-four (24) inches in size.

9.11.12 Permitted Activities Within Tree Protection Zone

(1) Utility Excavation: Excavating or trenching by duly constituted utilities shall be permitted within the tree protection zone, except where the trees are historic or specimen, in which case utility lines shall be tunneled beneath tree roots in order to protect feeder roots.

(2) Sodding and Ground Cover: Placement of the sod or other ground covers and the preparation of the ground surface for such covers shall be permitted within the tree protection zone.

9.11.13 Parking Reduction for Preservation of Protected Trees

(1) A reduction of required parking spaces may be allowed or required by the Development Services Department when the reduction would result in the preservation of a significant tree with a trunk of twelve (12) inches in diameter or greater.

(2) The reduction in required parking may be granted or required only if it will prevent removal of a significant tree that is located within the area of the site designated as a parking lot area.

(3) The reduction in required parking spaces shall not exceed the number of parking spaces required to protect and maintain protected trees, or ten percent (10%) of the required number, whichever is less.

9.11.14 Tree Coverage Preservation

Development proposals requiring tree protection according to Section 9.11(1) (b). above and which have twenty-five percent (25%) or more of the property covered by trees shall have the option to preserve or to mitigate the removal of some of the tree coverage area. Tree coverage preservation supersedes the tree protection procedures of Section 9.11 (4) and tree replacement requirements of Section 9.11. (5).

9.11.14.1 Required Preservation Standards: All tree coverage areas located within riparian buffers or project boundary buffers as required according to sections 9.9 and 9.10 shall be preserved.

Projects located in the Agriculture/Open Space or Low Density Residential zoning districts shall preserve or mitigate forty percent (40%) of tree coverage area outside riparian or boundary buffers.

(1) Projects located in the Medium Density Residential or Mixed Use Residential zoning districts shall preserve or mitigate twenty-five percent (25%) of tree coverage area outside riparian or boundary buffers.

(2) Projects located in all other zoning districts shall preserve or mitigate fifteen percent (15%) of tree coverage area outside riparian or boundary buffers.

(3) For the purposes of calculating tree coverage requirements, the water surface area of ponds, streams, and other water bodies shall be excluded from the total land area of the development tract.

(4) Insert drawings of existing tree coverage, tree coverage removal, tree coverage preservation

9.11.14.2 Mitigation Plan Requirement

(1) In lieu of the tree survey required in the tree protection section above, a tree coverage mitigation plan may be submitted. The mitigation plan shall be prepared by a Mississippi registered forester, Mississippi registered arborist, or Mississippi registered landscape architect. The plan shall include:

(a) A report on the estimated number, size, species and location of trees on the site, based on an acceptable method of timber stand evaluation, as well as an estimate of the square footage or acreage of tree coverage;

(b) Identification of any specimen trees or trees which may be candidates for specimen tree designation;

(c) Identification of any tree coverage areas proposed for removal;

(d) An estimate of the total area required for preservation or mitigation based on the requirements above.

9.11.14.3 Mitigation Options

(1) One hundred percent (100%) of the area of tree coverage that is preserved, including areas of mandatory preservation in buffers, shall count toward the total area required for preservation. This may include the canopy area of isolated or specimen trees.

(2) Seventy-five percent (75%) of the area covered by the canopy of trees planted on site for landscaping purposes, estimated at ten (10) years from planting date, shall count toward the total area required for preservation.

(3) Fifty percent (50%) of area reforested with seedlings, of a species mix similar to trees removed from site, shall count toward the total area required for preservation. Such reforestation areas shall be planted on public property as approved by the City Public Works Director, or on other areas within the City of Tupelo which are protected by permanent conservation easements.

(4) Approved tree protection and replacement area shall be shown on all preliminary plats, final plats, site plans and development plans in order to clearly assign tree protection and replacement responsibility to future owners.

(5) Allowable Uses of Preserved Tree Coverage Areas: Preserved tree coverage areas shall not be used for active recreational purposes, except for walking paths and foot trails constructed with minimal disturbance of tree roots and existing vegetation provided a Mississippi registered arborist, Mississippi registered forester, or Mississippi registered landscape architect has certified that the construction of the trail has been designed to minimize impact to the existing trees. No tree over ten (10) inches diameter at breast height shall be removed for the construction of trails.

(6) All buildings shall be set back at least ten (10) feet from the edge of any preserved tree coverage area or shall be constructed in a way to minimize negative impacts to the area.

(7) Utility lines and drainage channels shall be minimized within the root protection zones of trees to be saved. Preferably, such facilities should be located adjacent to driveways and in groupings as allowed by sound engineering practices and approved prior to installation.

(8) Tree protection measures as stated above shall be applied to preserved tree coverage areas where needed.

9.12 Installation and Maintenance

9.12.1 Responsibility

Unless otherwise stated, the owner of any property where landscaping or buffering is required shall be responsible for the maintenance of all required plant material (including street trees located off-site), fences and walls. Maintenance responsibilities shall include the clearing and replacement of required material that is dead and/or dying.

9.12.2 Pruning

(1) Trees and shrubs shall be kept trimmed back from doors, windows, and walkways.

(2) Necessary pruning and trimming shall be in accordance with the American National Tree, Shrub and Other Woody Plant Maintenance Standards Practices (Pruning), and shall not be interpreted to include topping of trees through removal of crown material or the central leader, or any other similarly severe procedures that cause irreparable harm to the natural form of the tree, except where such procedures are necessary to maintain public overhead utilities. Any such activity shall be a violation of this Ordinance and additional plant material may be required by the Development Services Director or designee to replace or supplement the damaged plant material.

9.12.3 Extensions

(1) It is recognized that land development occurs continuously and that vegetation used in landscaping or screening should be planted at certain times to ensure the best chance of survival. In order to ensure compliance and to reduce the potential expense of replacing landscaping or screening materials which were installed at an inappropriate time or under unfavorable conditions, a letter of request for extension of compliance with landscaping requirements may be filed with the Development Services Director, or designee, which states the reasons why the request is being made. This letter shall acknowledge that the applicant is aware of all landscaping and screening requirements, and will comply with those requirements within ninety (90) days, or discontinue use of the property.

(2) The Development Services Director, or designee, shall grant the extension on requests for planting extensions for single-family development submitted between May 15 and September 15 of each year and may grant the extensions for other uses and at other times if there are unfavorable conditions for planting.

(3) If the initial letter of request for extension of compliance with landscaping requirements has expired and conditions are still deemed unsuitable for planting, an applicant may request one additional extension of up to ninety (90) days. During periods of extreme drought, the Development Services Director, or designee, may authorize additional ninety (90) day extensions beyond the one (1) extension typically allowed. These extensions may be continued throughout the period in which the extreme drought conditions remain.

(4) The applicant shall also acknowledge that while a Conditional Certificate of Compliance may be issued, no Final Certificate of Compliance shall be issued while there is an active (pending) letter of request for extension of compliance with landscaping requirements unless a performance guarantee (such as a letter of credit or performance bond) sufficient to cover one hundred-fifty percent (150%) of the installed landscaping costs has been posted with the Development Services Department.

The supporting structure or bracing of a sign shall be omitted in measuring the area of the sign unless such structure or bracing is made part of the message or face of the sign.

(2) Where a sign consists of individual letters, words or symbols attached to a surface, building, canopy, awning, wall or window and all such elements are located in the same plane, the sign area shall be the area of the smallest rectangle which completely encompasses all such letters, words or symbols and any accompanying background of a color different than the natural color of the wall.

(3) On all signs other than wall signs, which shall only be allowed one (1) face, signs with identical sign faces placed in such a manner to ensure that the angle at which the two (2) sign faces are placed does not exceed sixty (60) degrees, shall be considered as a single (1) face.

Because these regulations can only establish the physical characteristics of signage and not enforce a level of visual quality in sign design, anyone planning a sign is strongly encouraged to consider:

(1) The character of the proposed sign, not only in and of itself, but also in terms of the effects a sign will have upon the character of the surrounding area;
(2) The way in which the sign will be read and whether its size, location, configuration, and character are appropriate to its intended audience or whether a more appropriate sign could better serve its intended purpose and, at the same time, be less visually disruptive; and

(3) The character of the sign structure, (the physical means of supporting the sign,) and whether that structure could be made an integral part of the sign rather than a separate and frequently distracting element.

(4) Signs shall be located so as not to block windows, doors or other means of ingress and egress. No sign shall be erected or placed in such a manner as to impair visibility of any motorists.

(5) No person may, for the purpose of increasing or enhancing the visibility of signs, damage, trim, destroy or remove any trees, shrubs, or other vegetation located as follows:

(a) Within public right-of-way, unless the work is done pursuant to the express written authorization of the City of Tupelo or State of Mississippi, whichever is appropriate.

(3) All signs and components thereof shall be maintained in a safe, neat, clean, attractive and structurally sound condition. All signs shall be kept neatly painted, including all metal parts and supports thereof that are not galvanized or of rust-resistant material. The premises surrounding signs shall be maintained in a clean, sanitary, and inoffensive condition, free and clear of obnoxious substances, rubbish, and weeds.

The day of the public hearing shall be considered the day the hearing is originally advertised for, unless a deferral is granted by the governing body upon a request that follows the procedures set forth in this Code regarding timely submission of requests for deferrals.

12.3.6. Protest Petition Sufficiency and Procedures

(1) Protest Petition Defined: A petition in opposition to any application listed in Section 12.2.1, Applicability, shall be considered a valid protest petition if the petition meets the requirements of applicable state and local law.

(2) Standards:

(a) The petition must be signed by the owners of either:

i. Twenty percent (20%) or more of the area included in the proposed change or;

ii. Five percent (5%) of the area of a one hundred foot (100) wide buffer extending along the entire boundary of each discrete or separate area proposed to be rezoned.

(b) In evaluating the sufficiency of a protest under this provision, a street right of way shall not be considered in computing the one hundred (100) foot buffer area as long as the street right of way is one hundred (100) feet wide or less. When less than an entire parcel of land is being rezoned, the one hundred (100) foot buffer shall be measured from the property line of the entire parcel.
(3) Procedure:

(a) A form for a protest petition shall be available in the Department of Development Services.

(b) Completed petitions shall be submitted to the Department of Development Services at least four (4) working days prior to the day of the public hearing.

(c) The Director of Development Services, or designee, in consultation with the Attorney for the jurisdiction shall determine if the petition meets the criteria for classification of valid protest petition. The Clerk shall inform the governing body that a petition has been filed and indicate the determination by the Director of Development Services, or designee, whether the petition is valid or invalid. The Director of Development Services, or designee, shall notify the petitioner as to the validity of the protest petition.

(e) Petitions for zoning map change for which a protest petition has been determined to be valid shall require a three-fourths (¾) vote of the governing body for approval rather than a simple majority. Vacant positions on the Council and members who have been excused from voting because of a conflict of interest shall not be considered in computing Council membership.

(4) Withdrawal: Persons or entities who have signed protest petitions may withdraw their signatures at any time prior to the vote on the proposed map change. Any withdrawal must meet standards established for such withdrawals by the Department of Development Services. Withdrawals submitted less than two (2) working days prior to the public hearing may result in a continuance of the hearing if the effect of the withdrawal on the validity of the protest cannot be determined prior to the public hearing.

(5) Exemption: The foregoing provisions concerning protest petitions shall not be applicable to any zoning map change that establishes the Citys zoning designation on property that has been added to the Citys jurisdiction as a result of annexation, except as provided by general or local law.

12.3.7 Notice of Decision

Within seven days after a decision is made, a copy of the decision shall be provided to the applicant and filed in the appropriate department, where it shall be available for public inspection during regular office hours.

12.4 Development Review Checklist Procedure

12.4.1 Purpose

The Development Review Checklist is intended to provide a basis for evaluation of development projects which integrates the degree to which a project is compatible with its immediate context, the design values created by the project, and the ways in which a development proposal supports goals established by the Comprehensive Plan. It is not intended to represent a complete list of all standards and requirements that may apply to a proposed action.

12.4.2 Applicability

Completion of the Development Review Checklist shall be required for all major subdivisions, major site plans, development plans, flexible use approvals, and requests for variance in excess of thirty percent (30%) from the applicable standard (major reviewable elements). Completion of the compatibility section of the Development Review Checklist shall be required for compatible use approvals, for infill or redevelopment projects over two (2) acres, and for requests for variance between fifteen percent (15%) and thirty (30%) of the applicable standard.

12.4.3 Required Information for Review

The applicant shall include with the application all information necessary for staff to complete the Development Review Checklist. Where additional information is needed to make a complete review, staff will provide the applicant with a specific list of material needed. Staff will provide a determination of any sections of the checklist that are not applicable to the proposed application.

12.4.4 Compatibility

(1) The compatibility section is used to grant zoning approval for activities identified as compatible uses in a given zone. It may also be used to grant staff approval of dimensional requirements of up to thirty percent (30%) of a given standard.

(2) Variances in excess of thirty percent (30%) must obtain Planning Committee approval.

The compatibility section is also required as part of the review of any project or application which is classified as infill or redevelopment and involves a site of two (2) or more acres.

(3) Identify all land uses and/or structures within five hundred (500) feet of subject property. For each compatibility element provide the required information for each property, beginning with the closest. If an element does not apply, indicate with N/A.

(a) Identify lot sizes in context area.

(b) Estimate height of context area structures beginning with closest.

(c) Estimate setbacks of context area structures beginning with closest.

(4) Identify architectural elements:

(a) Width to height proportionality;

(b) Predominant exterior materials;

(c) Roof type and pitch if applicable;

(d) Other significant architectural element represented in project or context area.

(5) Identify other significant non-architectural project or context area elements, such as sign dimensions or site amenities.

(6) Identify average daily traffic generation from Institute of Traffic Engineers (ITE) manual for comparables beginning with closest.

(7) Estimate on site parking provided at properties within five hundred (500) feet, and identify the location on site.

 

12.4.5 Comprehensive Plan Goals and Design Options

(1) Compact, efficient Land Use Pattern:

(a) The project provides a mix of land uses or, for single use projects, adds to the diversity of uses in an area.

 

(b) The project is located in a walkable neighborhood: frequently visited uses are within one-half (½) mile of the proposed project and are easily accessible to pedestrians via a sidewalk or other pedestrian facility.

 

(c) The project will provide elements of a walkable environment.

(d) The project site is an infill location or a location that logically reinforces or extends existing development.

(e) The project will rehabilitate an existing structure and/or redevelop an existing developed site. Such a project shall have a minimum proposed construction cost that is fifty percent (50%) or more of the tax-assessed value.

(f) The project will add to the diversity of housing types or prices. Median housing and rental unit prices shall be those provided by the US Census or another reliable source. Census figures may be adjusted for inflation using the US Department of Labor Consumer Price Index inflation calculator or another reliable method.

(2) High Quality, Environmentally Sustainable Design and Materials:

(a) Projects that develop on vacant land or land used only for agricultural purposes shall avoid disturbance of environmentally sensitive areas such as wetlands, steep slopes, riparian buffers, flood hazard areas, and mature woodlands. The cluster subdivision and the planned unit development processes offer flexibility in lot size and other development standards to enable projects to be designed around environmental features. Projects which provide environmental amenities above the level required are encouraged.

The project shall not have adverse impacts on stormwater management. Development which was built in past decades with inadequate stormwater management has had negative impacts on surrounding property owners and the City of Tupelo. Projects that use good design principles to enhance the aesthetic features of stormwater management infrastructure are encouraged.

(b) The project uses landscaping to enhance or preserve an urban tree canopy.

(c) The project incorporates building design principles and uses materials to enhance the project and the surrounding area.

(3) Transportation and Parking:

(a) The project is located in an area with and/or provides an interconnected street system.

(b) The project provides pedestrian and/or bicycle improvements.

(c) The project will use good design in parking requirements by locating parking in the side or rear or by having shared parking.

12.4.6 Review and Approval of Applications:

(1) Staff will review information and compile a report identifying the features of the proposed project or action which address the comprehensive plan goals.

12.5 Traffic Impact Analysis (TIA)

12.5.1 Applicability

Unless exempted below, a traffic impact analysis (TIA) shall be required for zoning map changes utilizing a development plan, site plans, and preliminary plats that can be anticipated to generate at least one hundred-thirty (130) vehicle trips at the peak hour (as determined by Institute of Transportation Engineers Standards). Trips generated by separate developments meeting the criteria of Sec. 12.5.3, TIA Submission for Projects with Cumulative Impacts, shall be considered cumulatively.

12.5.2 Exemptions

The following projects shall not be required to submit a TIA:

(1) Projects located within the Mixed Use Downtown District.

(2) Developments that submitted a TIA in conjunction with a zoning map change or previously approved site plan, or other plan, where the TIA remains valid, consistent with the provisions of Sec. 12.5.5. (5), Period of Validity.

(3) Redevelopment of any site on which the increase in traffic at peak hour represents an increase of less than one hundred-thirty (130) trips from the previous development, if the redevelopment is initiated within twelve (12) months of the cessation of use of the previous development.

12.5.3 TIA Submission for Projects with Cumulative Impacts

(1) An applicant shall be required to submit a TIA for a development plan, site plan, preliminary plat, or other similar plan that does not otherwise meet the thresholds for submission of a TIA if the development approval is for a project that:

(a) Shares features such as site access or other roadways, design elements, or other infrastructure with nearby unbuilt, but reasonably foreseeable developments; and,

(b) When complete, will function in conjunction with such nearby developments as a single project, the impact on the infrastructure of which would exceed the thresholds for preparation of a TIA.

(2) Determination: The Director of Development Services shall determine whether a development application meets the criteria above and shall determine whether one TIA shall be required for all of the aggregated development, or whether multiple TIAs may be employed for separate phases of the development.

12.5.4 Pre-Application Conference

The applicant shall schedule a pre-application meeting with the Development Services Director or designee to discuss procedures, standards, and regulations required for TIA submittal and approval.

12.5.5 Requirements

(1) Content: The Development Services Director or designee shall set forth specific guidelines for preparation of TIAs. A TIA shall, at a minimum, provide the following information:

(a) An estimate of the traffic generated as a result of the proposed development;

(b) An analysis of the existing street system serving the proposed development; and

(c) An assessment of the improvements needed to the existing street system in order to support the traffic anticipated to be generated by the proposed development.

(3) Preparer: A TIA shall be prepared by a registered professional engineer with experience in traffic engineering.

(4) Sources of Data: Estimates of vehicle trips shall be calculated based on trip generation rates from the most recent edition of the Trip Generation Manual published by the Institute of Transportation Engineers, unless an alternative source of information is approved by the Development Services Director or MDOT.

(5) Period of Validity: A TIA shall be valid for a specific site for no more than eight (8) years, so long as no significant modifications to the development proposed for the site that substantially increase the traffic impact are made. A TIA submitted in connection with a project that is accessed by a road that is operating at a level of service lower than that approved by the City Engineer or MDOT, if applicable, shall be valid for no more than five (5) years, however.

(6) Coordination with Zoning Map Changes, Site Plans, and Preliminary Plats

Transportation mitigation measures may be required to address issues raised by a TIA, or as part of the approval of a Transportation Special Use Permit (TSUP). Such measures may include, but shall not be limited to, onsite and offsite improvements related to reduction of traffic impact on the surrounding road system, bicycle facilities, pedestrian movement, and the environment. These measures shall be conditions of development approval. Deletion or modification of these conditions shall require the same approval process that was required for the original project, unless the approved mitigation measure is deemed to conflict with MDOT or City of Tupelo requirements, in which case they may be deleted or modified by the Planning Committee.

12.6 Transportation Special Use Permit

(1) A Transportation Special Use Permit shall be required for site plans and preliminary plats that are expected to generate:

(a) Six hundred (600) or more vehicle trips at peak hour; or

(1) The traffic generated by the development and associated improvements to the street system will not have a significant adverse impact on the surrounding area. Significant adverse impact shall include:

(2) Substantial increases in traffic on local residential streets such that the majority of the traffic is not associated with the residential properties which front on the street; or

(3) The need to widen local residential streets which would detract significantly from the character or basic function of the nearby streets.

(4) Adequate provisions have been made for safe and efficient vehicular circulation, parking and loading, and pedestrian access.

(5) The traffic generated by the proposed development and any proposed improvements to the street system will not have a significant adverse impact on the environment. Significant adverse impacts shall include but not be limited to undue concentration of air pollutants, or excessive noise or vibrations.

(6) The traffic generated by the development can be accommodated by the existing or funded transportation system, or adequate traffic mitigation measures have been proposed as part of the development application. Proposed mitigation measures shall become conditions of the special use permit. The adopted level of service for the adjacent roadways may be considered in making this determination but shall not be the sole factor considered by the governing body.

12.7 Comprehensive Plan Adoption/Amendment and Development Code Amendment

12.7.1 Applicability

(1) The governing bodies shall consider adoption of or amendments to the Comprehensive Plan, or to the Development Code, as may be required from time to time.

(5) An approval shall be by written resolution. The approval may be contingent upon conditions specified by the governing body. The effective date may be immediate or may be a date otherwise specified in the approval.

12.8 Zoning Map Change

12.8.1 Purpose

The purpose of a zoning map amendment is to amend the zoning district boundaries of the Official Zoning Map.

12.8.2 Initiation

A zoning map change may be initiated by the governing body, the Planning Committee, the Director of Development Services or designee, or the property owner or their agent, except that a petition for a zoning map change with a development plan may only be initiated by the property owner or their agent.

12.8.3 Development Plans

A development plan is required for any rezoning of five (5) or more acres. The development plan provides additional information with a zoning map change petition. The purposes and required elements of the development plan are set forth in Section 12.9, Development Plan. The development plan establishes the level of development that will be allowed on the property. Subsequent site plans or plats shall not deviate from the plan, unless otherwise allowed, or required under this Code. Deviation may require a zoning map change, as established in Section 12.9.12, Deviations from Approved Development Plans. Unless a development plan also functions as a site plan, it is not a site specific development plan. The right to develop pursuant to a development plan, whether approved under this Code or any previous Code, accrues only for any portion of the plan for which a site plan or preliminary plat is approved, and then only for the period of validity specified in this Code.

12.8.4 Mandatory Development Plan

The development plan may be used by the petitioner in any zoning district; however, the development plan shall be required in all Mixed Use districts. Development plans may also be required as otherwise set forth in this Code. The development plan shall become a part of the zoning map change petition and shall be reviewed concurrently with the zoning map change petition. Development plans shall not be required for zoning map changes of less than five acres or for correction of zoning map errors.

12.8.5 Traffic Impact Analysis

(1) A traffic impact analysis may be required if the proposed zoning map change meets the threshold requirements established in Section 12.4, Traffic Impact Analysis.

12.8.6 Pre-Application Conference

(1) All applicants petitioning for a zoning map change shall schedule a pre-application conference with the Director of Development Services or designee in accordance with Sec. 12.2.2.

12.8.7 Neighborhood Meeting

An applicant petitioning for a zoning map change that requires a TIA pursuant to Sec. 12.4, Traffic Impact Analysis, shall hold a neighborhood meeting as set forth in Sec. 12.2.3, Neighborhood Meeting.

12.8.8 Relation to Comprehensive Plan

(1) All petitions for zoning map change shall be consistent with the Comprehensive Plan. A petition for zoning map change shall not be approved by the governing body when there is a conflict with the Comprehensive Plan, as determined by the Director of Development Services or designee (see Section 12.7, Comprehensive Plan Amendment).

(2) When required, an application for a plan amendment shall be submitted and reviewed concurrently with an application for zoning map change. The public hearings on both the plan amendment and zoning map change may be heard at the same meeting. The decisions, however, shall be rendered with separate motions.

12.8.9 Application Requirements

An application for zoning map change shall be submitted in accordance with Sec., Application Requirements.

(1) Zoning map changes should correspond with the boundary lines of existing platted lots or tracts. If the boundaries of a zoning map change request stop short of an exterior property line, that portion of the property outside the proposed zoning map change boundary shall be capable of being subdivided and developed in accordance with the existing zoning and other requirements of this Code.

(2) All zoning requirements shall be met within the boundaries of the area being proposed for change, unless the area being changed is utilizing a development plan and is an addition to an existing area zoned with a development plan. If all of the requirements cannot be met on the site being changed, the zoning map change shall be expanded to include necessary property being used to meet zoning requirements. Projects utilizing a development plan may be expanded without meeting this criteria if, considering the original development plan area, the requirement can be met without violating any committed elements. Projects utilizing this provision shall provide graphics and/or a chart demonstrating how the requirements are met.

(3) If the boundaries of a zoning map change request in process are modified so as to 1) remove property from the request, and 2) have the effect of separating other adjoining properties from the boundaries of the modified request, that change shall be considered a substantial change from the original request and shall result in the modified request being considered a new zoning map change request and requiring resubmittal with a new application and applicable fees.

12.9 Development Plan

12.9.1 Purpose

(1) A development plan is intended to identify commitments that are equal to or greater than Code requirements, including but not limited to:

(a) Intensity/density of the proposed development;

(b) Sensitive areas and related protection;

(c) Any limitations on number, type, or range of uses;

(d) Dedications or reservations;

(e) Design elements if required or otherwise provided; and

(f) Development phasing if required or otherwise provided.

12.9.2 Designation/Effect

When a proposed zoning map change includes a development plan, the letter D shall follow the proposed zoning district designation. If approved, the letter D shall remain as a part of the zoning designation of the property. The elements submitted as part of the development plan, called commitments, are binding and establish the level of development permitted on the property absent further zoning action except as otherwise allowed or required under this Code. Commitments may also be identified as committed elements throughout this Code.

12.9.3 Authority of Director of Development Services: The Director of Development Services is authorized to:

12.9.4 Requirements

(1) A development plan shall comply with all applicable laws and guidelines, except where modification of development or use standards are specifically requested by inclusion in the plan. Requirements under this section shall consist of the following, which may be supplemented by guidelines of the Development Services Department.

(2) A development plan shall be signed and sealed by a Professional Engineer, Registered Architect, or Registered Landscape Architect. All graphic depictions shall be accurately

scaled and separate or additional sheets may be required by the Development Services Department.

12.10.18 Continuing Validity of Preliminary Plat

An approved preliminary plat shall retain its validity for four (4) years, if:

(1) A permit to begin development pursuant to the plat, such as a land disturbance permit, a building permit, or an improvement permit has been issued and has remained continuously valid thereafter; and,

(2) Building or land disturbing activity has begun on the property.

(3) The issuance of a building permit or a certificate of compliance within a phase of a project shall not extend the validity of the preliminary plat for the unbuilt portions of that phase or any future phases of the project for which building permits have not been issued.

12.10.19 Modification of Design Standards and Improvement Requirements

(1) In approving the preliminary plat, the City Council may modify any of the design standards or improvement requirements set forth in Chapters 6, 8, and 9, where necessary to make the approved preliminary plat conform to any master land use plan which the City Council has approved for a planned unit development on the property.

(1) A valid, approved site plan exists for the overall complex;

(2) The complex, in its entirety, satisfies all Code requirements; and

(3) Each final plat created contains a note stating that the owners acknowledge that the individual parcel is a part of the named development complex, and that deeds of easement, restrictive covenants, and/or other legal documents necessary for the perpetual functioning of the development complex shall be executed and recorded with the final plat.

12.11 Site Plan Review

12.11.1 Applicability

The site plan review process assures that future development will occur in a planned and orderly manner. All proposed development that will affect the exterior of a structure shall be subject to the site plan review process. In some cases, proposed interior changes will also be subject to site plan review. For instance, an applicant may propose interior changes as part of a change in use (e.g., from overnight accommodations to retail sales). A change in use may result in different standards for parking, landscaping, or buffers which must then be included in the application.

(2) A variance of fifteen to thirty (15% to 30%) of any regulated dimension may be allowed where special conditions applicable to the property in question would make the strict

enforcement of the regulations impractical or result in a hardship in making reasonable use of the property, or

Where other characteristics of the proposed use of property are found to support and advance the goals of the Comprehensive Plan, as incorporated in the Development Review Checklist, to a degree that exceeds the impact of the requested variance.

(c) Where necessary for reconstruction, rehabilitation, or restoration of structures that are individually listed or are contributing structures within an historic district; or

(2) Where other characteristics of the proposed use of property are found to support and advance the goals of the Comprehensive Plan, as incorporated in the Development Review Checklist, Section 12.3, to a degree that exceeds the impact of the requested variance.

(1) In granting any variance, the Planning Committee shall make the following findings:

(a) That special or unique circumstances or conditions or practical difficulties exist which apply to the land, buildings or uses involved which are not generally applicable to other land, buildings, structures, or uses in the same zoning districts;

(b) That the special conditions or circumstances or practical difficulties do not result from the actions of the property owner or applicant, their agent, employee, or contractor. Errors made by such persons in the development, construction, siting or marketing process shall not be grounds for a variance except in cases where a foundation survey submitted to the City Engineer, or designee, before a contractor proceeds beyond the foundation stage has not revealed an error which is discovered later;

(c) That the strict enforcement of this Code would deprive the owner or applicant of reasonable use of the property that is substantially consistent with the intent of this Code;

(e) That the variance shall not be materially detrimental to the health, safety or welfare of persons residing or working in the neighborhood.

Consideration of the effects of the variance shall include but not be limited to, increases in activity, noise, or traffic resulting from any expansion of uses allowed by the variance;

(f) That the proposed use and the appearance of any proposed addition or alteration will be compatible with, and not negatively impact, nearby properties; and

(g) That the variance will not result in the expansion of a nonconforming use.

(2) In making the findings above, the Planning Committee shall use the Development Review Checklist to ascertain and give specific weight to the number and percentage of nearby properties that share characteristics for which the variance is requested by the applicant.

(3) Appeal from final action by the Planning Committee on a variance may be taken by filing a petition for certiorari with the Court.

CHAPTER 14: NONCONFORMITIES
14.1 Purpose and Scope

(1) The purpose of this Section is to regulate and limit the development and continued existence of uses, structures, and lots established prior to the effective date of this Code. Many nonconformities may continue, but the provisions of this Section are designed to curtail substantial investment in nonconformities and to bring about their eventual improvement or elimination in order to preserve the integrity of this Code and the character of the City. Any nonconforming use, structure, or lot which lawfully existed as of the effective date of this Code and which remains nonconforming, and any use, structure, or lot which has become nonconforming as a result of the adoption of this Code or any subsequent rezoning or amendment to this text of this Code, may be continued or maintained only in accordance with the terms of this Section.

(2) This Section shall not apply, however, to any feature which is the subject of a variance or modification from particular regulations that has been granted by the Planning Committee or City Council, subsequent to the adoption of this Code. Where a variance or modification has been granted for a feature which does not otherwise conform to the requirements of this Code, that feature shall be deemed conforming.

14.2 Nonconforming Uses

(1) Extension of Use: A nonconforming use shall not be enlarged or extended in any way except as provided in Section 14.5 below.

(2) Mobile and Manufactured Home: A nonconforming mobile or manufactured home may be continued, maintained, repaired, or relocated on the same property or conveyed in the same manner as if a mobile or manufactured home were a permitted use. However, if the mobile or manufactured home is moved from the property or if the mobile or manufactured home is moved because of a condemnation or demolition order under the citys substandard building Code, then no mobile or manufactured home may again be placed on said property. If active use or operation of the mobile or manufactured home is discontinued for three (3) consecutive months or more, then the use of the mobile or manufactured home shall be automatically deemed abandoned and shall be removed from the city limits of the City of Tupelo immediately.

(3) Continuation, Maintenance, and Minor Repair: The continuation of a nonconforming use and the maintenance or minor repair of a structure containing a nonconforming use are permitted, provided that the continuation, maintenance, or minor repair does not extend or expand the nonconforming use. For purposes of this Section, maintenance or minor repair shall mean:

(a) Repairs that are necessary to maintain and to correct any damage or deterioration to the structural soundness or interior appearance of a building or structure without expanding or altering the building or structure;

(b) Maintenance of land areas to protect against health hazards and promote the safety of surrounding land uses;

(c) Repairs which are required to remedy unsafe conditions which cause a threat to public safety; and

(d) Maintenance or repair of a sign in a way which does not change the exterior message.

(4) Damage or Destruction: If a nonconforming use or structure that is or contains a nonconforming use is damaged or destroyed by any means to an extent greater than fifty percent (50%) percent of its replacement cost at the time of the damage or destruction, then such use shall not be re-established in any way which does not conform to the requirements of this Code.

(5) Change of Use: Any nonconforming use may be changed to a conforming use by securing all approvals and permits which this Code requires for the intended or resulting use, building, structure, or lot. No nonconforming use may be changed to another nonconforming use, except as provided in Section 14.5 below.

(6) Cessation of Use: If a nonconforming use is discontinued for three (3) consecutive months or more, then the property shall thereafter be occupied and used only for a conforming use, except as provided for re-establishments in Section 14.5 below. If a nonconforming use is continued before three (3) months has passed it may continue, provided that the nature and degree of the nonconformity will not be changed or increased from that which existed before the nonconforming use was discontinued.

(7) Signs for Nonconforming Uses: Nonconforming uses located in residential districts may erect non-illuminated wall signs only. Such signs shall conform in all other ways with the size, placement, and other standards set forth for such signs in Chapter 10 of this Code.
14.3 Nonconforming Structures

(1) Expansion or Enlargement: A nonconforming structure shall not be enlarged or extended in any way, except as provided in Section 14.5 below.

(2) Maintenance or Repair: The maintenance or repair of a nonconforming structure is permitted, provided that it does not extend or expand the nonconforming structure.

(3) Damage or Destruction: If a nonconforming structure is damaged or destroyed by any means to an extent greater than fifty percent (50%) percent of its replacement cost at the time of damage or destruction, then such structure shall not be restored, nor any use of the structure be re-established, in any way which does not conform to the requirements of this Code.

(4) Section Not Applicable to Nonconforming Signs: This Section shall not apply to nonconforming signs, the continuation, replacement, removal, expansion, maintenance and repair of which are governed by Section 10.11.

(5) Illegal Signs: Signs which were in place on December 31, 2012 and which do not conform to the terms of this Code, which signs were also in violation of the previous Sign Code of the City at the time they were erected, shall not be classified as nonconforming signs and shall be removed immediately.

14.4 Nonconforming Lots of Record

(1) Development Allowed. Development shall be allowed on a lot of record which does not conform to the lot area and lot which requirements established in this Code for the zoning district in which it is located, not withstanding limitations imposed by other provisions of this Code. Such lot must be in a separate ownership and not of the continuous frontage with other lots in the same ownership. Yard requirements, lot coverage and all other requirements shall be satisfied.

(2) Adjacent Lots in Single Ownership: If two (2) or more adjacent and vacant nonconforming lots are in single ownership at any time, and such lots individually have less frontage or area than the minimum requirements of the district in which such lots are located, then such lots shall be considered and treated as a single lot or several lots which meet the minimum requirements of this Code for the district in which such lots are located.

14.5 Change, Re-establishment, Expansion, Alteration or Major Repair of Nonconformities

(1) Intent: The intent of this Part is to allow the continuation of any nonconformity and the normal maintenance and repair thereof, but to require any change, re-establishment, expansion, alteration or major repair of a nonconformity to obtain a flexible use permit to determine whether it will substantially injure the value, use, and enjoyment of neighboring properties. Minor repair to nonconforming structures shall, in accordance to Section 14.2.(3), be permitted without the necessity of obtaining such conditional use.

(2) Flexible Use Procedure: Unless this Section expressly provides otherwise, change, re-establishment, expansion, alteration or major repair of any nonconformity shall be deemed a flexible use, and shall occur only as approved by the Planning Committee in accordance with the procedures set forth in Section 12.12 of this Code.

(a) After holding a public hearing on the flexible use, the Planning Committee shall determine whether to approve the proposed change, re-establishment, expansion, alteration, or major repair. The Planning Committee shall not approve the proposed change, re-establishment, expansion, alteration or major repair unless and until it finds, based on the evidence and testimony received at the public hearing or otherwise appearing in the record of the case, that the proposed change, re-establishment, expansion, alteration or major repair meets the standards set forth in Section 12.12 of this Code as well as the following:

(i) That all access roads and entrance or exit drives to the nonconformity will be adequate with respect to automotive and pedestrian safety and convenience, traffic flow, and control and access in the case of fire or other emergency;

(ii) That all off-street parking, loading, refuse collection, and other service areas will be adequate with respect to automotive and pedestrian safety and convenience, traffic flow, economic, noise, glare, odor and other impacts on adjoining properties;

(iii) That all water, wastewater treatment, schools, fire and police protection and other necessary public and private utilities and services will be adequate with respect to their location, availability and compatibility with adjoining properties;

(iv) That all landscaping, screening, and fencing will be adequate, with respect to the effectiveness of their type, dimensions and character; will be adequate with respect to minimizing the economic, noise, glare, odor and other impacts of the nonconformity on adjoining properties and other properties in the neighborhood;

(v) That the type, size and intensity of the proposed use, including such considerations as storage of items and arrangement, the size of the site and the location of the use upon it, and the hours of operation and numbers of people who are likely to utilize or be attached to the use, will be adequate with respect to minimizing the impact of the nonconformity upon adjoining properties, other properties in the neighborhood, and the purposes of the use district in which the property is located;

(vi) Surface drainage will be adequate with respect to on-site erosion, siltation, pollution, flooding or other detrimental effects of the nonconformity.

(b) In determining whether the proposed change, re-establishment, expansion, alteration or major repair will substantially injure the value, use and enjoyment of other properties, the Planning Committee shall also consider and balance:

(i) The possible detriment or benefit to the owner of the nonconformity resulting from denying the approval, from approving the request but requiring that the nonconformity be brought wholly or partially into compliance, or from approving the request;

(ii) The possible detriment or benefit to the general public resulting from denying the approval, from approving the request but requiring that the nonconformity be brought wholly or partially into compliance, or from approving the request.

(c) The Planning Committee may impose any conditions on approval of the request as it deems necessary to mitigate any potential hazards or problems, or to bring the nonconformity into compliance to the extent necessary to protect the rights and interests of nearby property owners and the general public.

(d) In acting upon applications for such flexible uses, the Planning Committee shall not order the discontinuation or termination of a nonconformity. If an applicant is denied, then the continuation, maintenance and repair of the nonconformity shall still be allowed in accordance with the terms of this Section.
