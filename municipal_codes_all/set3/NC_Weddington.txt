PREFACE 
    This Code constitutes a codification of the general and permanent ordinances of the Town of Weddington, North Carolina. 
    Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were ordinances adopted by the town council. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this Code, the reader can locate any ordinance included herein. 
    The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order, and the various sections within each chapter have been provided catchlines to facilitate usage. Notes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state law have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this Code. 
Chapter and Section Numbering System 
    The chapter and section numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and local government codes. Each section number consists of two parts separated by a dash. The figure before the dash refers to the chapter number, and the figure after the dash refers to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the second section of chapter 1 is numbered 1-2, and the first section of chapter 6 is 6-1. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter, and at the same time new sections can be inserted in their proper place by using the decimal system for amendments. For example, if new material consisting of one section that would logically come between sections 6-1 and 6-2 is desired to be added, such new section would be numbered 6-1.5. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject. The next successive number shall be assigned to the new article or division. New chapters may be included by using one of the reserved chapter numbers. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. 
Page Numbering System 
    The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the volume. The number to the right of the colon represents the number of the page in that portion. In the case of a chapter of the Code, the number to the left of the colon indicates the number of the chapter. In the case of an appendix to the Code, the letter immediately to the left of the colon indicates the letter of the appendix. The following are typical parts of codes of ordinances, which may or may not appear in this Code at this time, and their corresponding prefixes: 
CHARTER CHT:1 SESSION LAWS SL:1 CHARTER COMPARATIVE TABLE CHTCT:1 CODE CD1:1 CODE APPENDIX CDA:1 CODE COMPARATIVE TABLES CCT:1 STATE LAW REFERENCE TABLE SLT:1 CHARTER INDEX CHTi:1 CODE INDEX CDi:1  
Indexes 
    The indexes have been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the indexes themselves which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which the user is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
    A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up-to-date. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited, and the affected page or pages will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
    Keeping this publication up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. As revised pages are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
Acknowledgments 
    This publication was under the direct supervision of Daniel Walker, Code Attorney, and Kyle Meyer, Editor, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida. Credit is gratefully given to the other members of the publisher's staff for their sincere interest and able assistance throughout the project. 
    The publisher is most grateful to Amy McCollum, Town Clerk, for her cooperation and assistance during the progress of the work on this publication. It is hoped that her efforts and those of the publisher have resulted in a Code of Ordinances which will make the active law of the town readily accessible to all citizens and which will be a valuable tool in the day-to-day administration of the town's affairs.

Secs. 2-152-2-178. - Reserved. 
ARTICLE VI. - CODE OF ETHICS 

Sec. 2-179. - General principles underlying the code of ethics. 
(a)  The stability and proper operation of democratic representative government depend upon public confidence in the integrity of the government and upon responsible exercise of the trust conferred by the people upon their elected officials. 
(b)  Governmental decisions and policy must be made and implemented through proper channels and processes of the governmental structure. 
(c)  Board members must be able to act in a manner that maintains their integrity and independence, yet is responsive to the interests and needs of those they represent. 
(d)  Board members must always remain aware that at various times they play different roles: 
(1)  As advocates, who strive to advance the legitimate needs of their citizens; 
(2)  As legislators, who balance the public interest and private rights in considering and enacting ordinances, orders, and resolutions; 
(3)  As decision-makers, who arrive at fair and impartial quasi-judicial and administrative determinations. 
(e)  Board members must know how to distinguish among these roles, to determine when each role is appropriate, and to act accordingly. 
(f)  Board members must be aware of their obligation to conform their behavior to standards of ethical conduct that warrant the trust of their constituents. Each official must find within his or her own conscience the touchstone by which to determine what conduct is appropriate. 
(Ord. No. O-2010-17, 11-8-2010) 
Sec. 2-180. - [Purpose.] 
    The purpose of this code of ethics is to establish guidelines for ethical standards of conduct for the town council and to help determine what conduct is appropriate in particular cases. It should not be considered a substitute for the law or for a board member's best judgment. 
(Ord. No. O-2010-17, 11-8-2010) 
Sec. 2-181. - Official actions. 
    Board members should obey all laws applicable to their official actions as members of the board. Board members should be guided by the spirit as well as the letter of the law in whatever they do. At the same time, board members should feel free to assert policy positions and opinions without fear of reprisal from fellow board members or citizens. To declare that a board member is behaving unethically because one disagrees with that board member on a question of policy (and not because of the board member's behavior) is unfair, dishonest, irresponsible, and itself unethical. 
(Ord. No. O-2010-17, 11-8-2010) 
Sec. 2-182. - Integrity and independence. 
    Board members should act with integrity and independence from improper influence as they exercise the duties of their offices. Characteristics and behaviors consistent with this standard include the following: 
(1)  Adhering firmly to a code of sound values. 
(2)  Behaving consistently and with respect toward everyone with whom they interact. 
(3)  Exhibiting trustworthiness. 
(4)  Living as if they are on duty as elected officials regardless of where they are or what they doing. 
(5)  Using their best independent judgment to pursue the common good as they see it, presenting their opinions to all in a reasonable, forthright, consistent manner. 
(6)  Remaining incorruptible, self-governing, and unaffected by improper influence, while at the same time being able to consider the opinions and ideas of others. 
(7)  Disclosing contacts and information about issues that they receive outside of public meetings and refraining from giving, seeking or receiving information about quasi-judicial matters outside of the quasi-judicial proceedings themselves. 
(8)  Treating other board members and the public with respect and honoring the opinions of others even when the board members disagree with those opinions. 
(9)  Not reaching conclusions on issues until all sides have been heard. 
(10)  Showing respect for their offices and not behaving in ways that reflect badly on those offices. 
(11)  Recognizing that they are part of a larger group and acting accordingly. 
(12)  Recognizing that individual board members are not generally allowed to act on behalf of the board but may only do so if the board specifically authorizes it, and that the board must take official action as a body. 
(Ord. No. O-2010-17, 11-8-2010) 
Sec. 2-183. - Avoiding impropriety. 
(a)  Board members should avoid impropriety in the exercise of their official duties. Their official actions should be above reproach. Although opinions may vary about what behavior is inappropriate, this board will consider impropriety in terms of whether a reasonable person who is aware of all of the relevant facts and circumstances surrounding the board member's action would conclude that the action was inappropriate. 
(b)  If a board member believes that his or her actions, while legal and ethical, may be misunderstood, the member should seek the advice of the town attorney and should consider publicly disclosing the facts of the situation and the steps taken to resolve it (such as consulting with the attorney). 
(Ord. No. O-2010-17, 11-8-2010) 
Sec. 2-184. - Performance of duties. 
(a)  Board members should faithfully perform the duties of their offices. They should act as the especially responsible citizens whom others can trust and respect. They should set a good example for others in the community, keeping in mind that trust and respect must continually be earned. Board members should faithfully attend and prepare for meetings. They should carefully analyze all credible information properly submitted to them, mindful of the need not to engage in communications outside the meeting in quasi-judicial matters. They should demand full accountability from those over whom the board has authority. 
(b)  Board members should be willing to bear their fair share of the board's workload. To the extent appropriate, they should be willing to put the board's interests ahead of their own. 
(Ord. No. O-2010-17, 11-8-2010) 
Sec. 2-185. - Openness and transparency. 
(a)  Board members should conduct the affairs of the board in an open and public manner. They should comply with all applicable laws governing open meetings and public records, recognizing that doing so is an important way to be worthy of the public's trust. They should remember when they meet that they are conducting the public's business. They should also remember that local government records belong to the public and not to board members or their employees. 
(b)  In order to ensure strict compliance with the laws concerning openness, board members should make clear that an environment of transparency and candor is to be maintained at all times in the governmental unit. They should prohibit unjustified delay in fulfilling public records requests. They should take deliberate steps to make certain that any closed sessions held by the board are lawfully conducted and that such sessions do not stray from the purposes for which they are called. 
(Ord. No. O-2010-17, 11-8-2010) 
Sec. 2-186. - Guidelines for ethical behavior. 
    The following guidelines are designed to translate current legal requirements into specific behaviors board members should avoid. While statutory provisions should be viewed as a minimum standard, board members should always consider whether there are ethical problems with other behaviors, even if such behavior does not violate criminal or other statutes dealing with conflicts of interest or other subjects: 
(1)  Avoid deriving a direct benefit from contracts in which you are involved in making or administering on behalf of the public agency; G.S. 14-234(a)(1). 
(2)  Avoid attempting to influence others involved in making or administering a contract on behalf of the public agency, even if you aren't involved, if you will derive a direct benefit from the contract; G.S. 14-234 (a)(2). 
(3)  Avoid soliciting or receiving any gift or reward in exchange for recommending, influencing, or attempting to influence the award of a contract by the public agency you serve; G.S. 14-234(a)(3). 
(4)  Consider the ethical and practical consequences of deriving a direct benefit from a contract authorized under any exception to the statute and weigh these considerations against the potential advantage to the public agency and to yourself. Follow reporting requirements to ensure transparency; G.S. 14-234(b); G.S. 14-234(d1). 
(5)  Avoid participating in deliberations about or voting on a contract in which you have a direct benefit, when the contract is undertaken as allowed under any exception to the statute; G.S. 14-234(b1); criminal penalty. 
(6)  Avoid using your knowledge of contemplated action by you or your unit, or information known to you in your official capacity and not made public, to acquire a financial interest in any property, transaction, or enterprise, or to gain a financial benefit that may be affected by the information or contemplated action. Avoid intentionally aiding another to do any of these things; G.S. 14-234.1. 
(7)  Avoid receiving any gift or favor from a current, past, or potential contractor; G.S. 133-32(a). 
(8)  Consider the ethical and practical consequences of accepting a gift or favor under any exception to the statutory prohibition, and follow reporting requirements to ensure transparency; G.S. 133-32(d). 
(9)  Avoid voting on matters involving your own financial interest or official conduct; G.S. 160A-75; G.S. 153A-44. Identify and disclose these matters in advance so your board can determine whether you have a conflict allowing you to be excused by the board from voting. When in doubt, obtain an opinion from the town attorney about whether you must vote or may be excused. 
(10)  Avoid voting on any zoning map or text amendment where the outcome of the vote is reasonably likely to have a direct, substantial, and readily identifiable financial impact on you; G.S. 153A-340(g); G.S. 160A-381(d). 
(11)  Do not participate in or vote on any quasi-judicial matter, including matters that come before the board when the board is acting in a quasi-judicial capacity under G.S. 153A-345 or G.S. 160A-388, if participation would violate affected persons' constitutional right to an impartial decision-maker. Impermissible conflicts under this statutory standard include "having a fixed opinion prior to hearing the matter that is not susceptible to change"; "undisclosed ex parte communications [communications between a board member and someone involved in the matter that occur outside the official quasi-judicial proceeding]"; "a close familial, business, or other associational relationship with an affected person"; or "a financial interest in the outcome of the matter"; G.S. 153A-345(e1); G.S. 160A-388(e1). 
(12)  Fulfill your statutory obligation to vote on all matters that come before you even when there are appearances of conflict, and only refrain from voting when there is a legal basis for being or a requirement to be excused from voting; G.S. 153A-44; G.S. 160A-75.

Chapter 6 - ALARM SYSTEMS 

Sec. 6-1. - Definitions. 
    The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this chapter, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this section, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning: 
    Alarm signal means a detectable signal, either audible or visual, generated by an alarm system to which the sheriff, fire department or other emergency personnel are expected to respond. 
    Alarm system means any single piece of or assembly of equipment designed for the detection of an unauthorized entry into a building, structure, or facility or for the alerting of others of a medical emergency situation, the detection of smoke and/or fire, the commission of robbery within a building or other structure, or other hazardous situations, and which emits a sound or transmits a signal or message when activated which causes automatic signal transmission to be made directly or indirectly to the county sheriff's office, a volunteer fire department or other emergency response. For the purposes of this definition, the term "alarm system" shall not include a device installed on a motor vehicle or devices installed in buildings, structures, or facilities owned or controlled by federal, state or local government agencies. 
    Alarm systems coordinator means a person designated by the town council to administer the provisions of this chapter. 
    Alarm user means any person owning or leasing an alarm system, or on whose premises an alarm system is maintained for the protection of such premises. 
    Alarm user permit means a permit issued by the town to an alarm user allowing the operation of an alarm system within the town. 
    Automatic dial protection device means an automatic dialing device or an automatic telephone dialing alarm system, including any system which upon being activated automatically initiates to the county communications center, county sheriff's office or a local volunteer fire department a recorded message or code signal indicating a need for sheriff's office or fire department response. 
    False alarm. 
(1)  The term "false alarm" means the activation of an alarm system summoning the county sheriff's office, county communications center, or fire department, unless law enforcement or fire or emergency response is cancelled by the alarm user or his agent before the sheriff, fire department, or emergency personnel arrive at the alarm location, due to any of the following: 
a.  Mechanical or electronic failure; 
b.  Malfunction; 
c.  Improper installation; or 
d.  The negligence of the alarm user, his employees or agents, and alarm signals activated. 
(2)  For the purposes of this definition, the term "false alarm" shall not include: 
a.  An alarm which can reasonably be determined to have been caused or activated by unusually violent conditions or nature. 
b.  An alarm activated during circumstances where the alarm user reasonably believed a situation was present for which purpose the alarm system was necessary.

d.  An alarm activated during an alarm system testing procedure, if the alarm user first notifies and receives permission from the user's alarm company, the county sheriff's office and the appropriate fire department, or emergency response department to test the system. 
An alarm is presumed to be false when, upon inspection by a member of the county sheriff's office or a member of the local volunteer fire department responding to the alarm, evidence indicates that no unauthorized entry, robbery or other such crime was committed or attempted in or upon the premises which would have activated a properly functioning alarm system, when no extraordinary circumstances were present, or when, upon inspection of an authorized representative of the volunteer fire department responding to the alarm, evidence indicates that no fire or smoke was present which would have activated a properly functioning alarm system. 
(Ord. No. O-2000-02, § 1, 5-8-2000) 
Sec. 6-2. - Alarm user permits. 
(a)  Permit required.

(c)  Inspection. The county sheriff's office, volunteer fire department or other emergency department personnel authorized by the town shall have the right to inspect any alarm system on the premises to which a response has been made at a reasonable time thereafter to determine whether it is being used in conformity with this chapter.

(1)  Whenever a petition is filed with the inspector by a public authority or by at least five residents of the town charging that any dwelling or dwelling unit is unfit for human habitation, or whenever it appears to the inspector, upon inspection, that any dwelling or dwelling unit is unfit for human habitation, he shall, if his preliminary investigation discloses a basis for such charges, issue and cause to be served upon the owner of and parties in interest in such dwelling or dwelling unit a complaint stating the charges and containing a notice that a hearing will be held before the inspector or his designated agent at a place therein fixed not less than ten or more than 30 days after the serving of the complaint. 
(2)  The owner or any party in interest shall have the right to file an answer to the complaint and to appear in person, or otherwise, and give testimony at the place and time fixed in the complaint. Notice of such hearing shall also be given to at least one of the persons signing a petition relating to such dwelling. Any person desiring to do so may attend such hearing and give evidence relevant to the matter being heard. The rules of evidence prevailing in courts of law or equity shall not be controlling in hearings before the inspector. 
(b)  Procedure after hearing. 
(1)  After such notice and hearing, the inspector shall state in writing his determination whether the dwelling or dwelling unit is unfit for human habitation, and, if so, whether it is deteriorated or dilapidated. 
(2)  If the inspector determines that the dwelling or dwelling unit is deteriorated, he shall state in writing his findings of fact in support of such determination, and shall issue and cause to be served upon the owner thereof an order directing and requiring the owner to repair, alter, or improve such dwelling or dwelling unit to comply with the minimum standards of fitness established by this article within a specified period of time, not to exceed 90 days. Such order may also direct and require the owner to vacate and close such dwelling or dwelling unit until such repairs, alterations, and improvements have been made. 
(3)  If the inspector determines that the dwelling is dilapidated, he shall state in writing his findings of fact to support such determination, and shall issue and cause to be served upon the owner thereof an order directing and requiring the owner either to repair, alter or improve such dwelling or dwelling unit to comply with the minimum standards of fitness established by this article, or else to vacate and remove or demolish the same within a specified period of time, not to exceed 90 days. 
(c)  Failure to comply with order . 
(1)  In personam remedy. If the owner of any deteriorated dwelling or dwelling unit shall fail to comply with an order of the inspector to repair, alter, or improve or to vacate and close the same within the time specified therein, or if the owner of a dilapidated dwelling or dwelling unit shall fail to comply with an order of the inspector to repair, alter or improve or to vacate and close and remove or demolish the same within the time specified therein, the inspector shall submit to the town council, at its next regular meeting, a resolution directing the town attorney to petition the superior court for an order directing such owner to comply with the order of the inspector, as authorized by G.S. 160A-446(g). 
(2)  In rem remedy. After failure of an owner of a deteriorated or dilapidated dwelling or dwelling unit to comply with an order of the inspector within the time specified therein, if injunctive relief has not been sought or has not been granted as provided in subsection (c)(1) of this section, the inspector shall submit to the town council an ordinance ordering the inspector to cause such dwelling or dwelling unit to be repaired, altered, improved, vacated, closed, removed or demolished, as provided in the original order of the inspector, and pending removal or demolition, to place a placard on such dwelling as provided by section 14-57 and G.S. 160A-443. 
(d)  Appeals from orders of inspector . An appeal of any decision or order of the inspector may be taken by any person aggrieved thereby. Any appeal of the decision or order of the inspector shall be taken within ten days from the rendering of the decision or service of the order, and shall be taken by filing with the inspector and with the town board of adjustment a notice of appeal, which shall specify the grounds upon which the appeal is based. Upon the filing of any notice of appeal, the inspector shall forthwith transmit to the board of adjustment all the papers constituting the record upon which the decision appealed from was made. When an appeal is of a decision of the inspector refusing to allow the person aggrieved thereby to do any act, his decision shall remain in force until modified or reversed. When an appeal is of a decision of the inspector requiring the person aggrieved to do any act, the appeal shall have the effect of suspending the requirement until the hearing by the board of adjustment, unless the inspector certifies to the board of adjustment, after the notice of appeal is filed with him, that, by reason of the facts stated in the certificate, a copy of which shall be furnished the appellant, a suspension of this requirement would cause imminent peril to life or property, in which case the requirement shall not be suspended, except by a restraining order. Such a restraining order may be granted for due cause shown upon not less than one day's written notice to the inspector, by the board of adjustment, or by a court of record upon petition made pursuant to G.S. 160A-446(f) and subsection (e) of this section. 
(1)  The board of adjustment shall fix a reasonable time for the hearing of all appeals, shall give due notice to all the parties, and shall render its decision within a reasonable time.

Any party may appear in person or by agent or attorney. 
(2)  The board of adjustment may reverse or affirm, wholly or in part, or may modify the decision or order appealed, and may make such decision and order as in its opinion ought to be made in the matter, and to that end it shall have all the powers of the inspector, but the concurring vote of four members of the board of adjustment shall be necessary to reverse or modify any decision or order of the inspector. 
(3)  The board of adjustment shall have power also in passing upon appeals, in any case where there are practical difficulties or unnecessary hardships in the way of carrying out the strict letter of this article, to adapt the application of this article to the necessities of the case to the end that the spirit of this article shall be observed, public safety and welfare secured, and substantial justice done. 
(4)  Every decision of the board of adjustment shall be subject to review by proceedings in the nature of certiorari instituted within 15 days of the decision of the board of adjustment, but not otherwise. 
(e)  Petition to superior court by owner . Any person aggrieved by an order issued by the inspector or a decision rendered by the board of adjustment shall have the right, within 30 days after issuance of the order or rendering of the decision, to petition the superior court for a temporary injunction restraining the inspector, pending a final disposition of the cause, as provided by G.S. 160A-446(f).

ARTICLE IV. - LIGHTING 

Sec. 14-81. - Purpose. 
    The purpose of this article is to improve nighttime public safety, utility, and security by restricting the nighttime emission of light rays. New lighting technologies have produced lights that are extremely powerful, and these lights may be improperly installed so that they create problems of excessive glare, light trespass, and higher energy use. Excessive glare can be annoying and may cause safety problems. Light trespass reduces everyone's privacy, may be detrimental to the aesthetic values of the town, and can restrict persons from the peaceful enjoyment of their property. Higher energy use results in increased costs for everyone. This article is intended to reduce the problems caused by excessive lighting, or by improperly designed and installed outdoor lighting. 
(Ord. No. O-2000-01, 8-14-2000) 
Sec. 14-82. - Definitions. 
    The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this article, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this section, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning: 
    Average to minimum means the ratio of average footcandles to the minimum footcandle point calculation or reading for a given area. This ratio is generally maintained footcandles but could be initial. This ratio is an indicator of lighting uniformity. The lower the ratio, the better the uniformity. 
    Candlepower means luminous intensity. The term "candlepower" is normally associated with a directional type fixture such as a floodlight. 
    Direct light means light emitted directly from the lamp, off of the reflector or reflector diffuser, or through the refractor or diffuser lens, of a luminaire. 
    Fixture means the assembly that houses the lamp or lamps and can include all or some of the following parts: a housing, a mounting bracket or pole socket, a lamp holder, a ballast, a reflector or mirror, and/or a refractor or lens. 
    Floodlight or spotlight means any light fixture or lamp that incorporates a reflector or a refractor to concentrate the light output into a directed beam in a particular direction with a wide or narrow beam. 
    Footcandle means the amount of light falling on a surface, measured or calculated. It can be quantified as one lumen per square foot. 
    Footcandles, average, means the average of a number of points of footcandle calculations or footcandle readings in a given area. They could be initial or maintained. 
    Footcandles, average maintained, means the average of a number of points of footcandle calculations or footcandle readings in a given area which have been adjusted to account for maintenance factor, which includes luminaire dirt depreciation (LDD) and lamp lumen depreciation (LLD). 
    Footcandles, initial, means footcandles that are calculated with no adjustment for dirt build-up in the fixture or lamp lumen depreciation. Initial footcandles should be measured when a lighting system is new and after 100 hours of lamp burn-in time. Car dealerships are often designed using initial footcandles. 
    Footcandles, maintained, means footcandles that are calculated with an adjustment for a maintenance factor to include dirt buildup in the luminaire (fixture) and lamp lumen depreciation. The system is, in effect, overdesigned initially and then, over time, allowed to reach a maintained footcandle level. 
    Full cutoff (fully shielded lights) means outdoor light fixtures shielded or constructed so that no light rays are emitted by the installed fixture at angles above the 90-degree horizontal plane, as certified by a photometric test report. 
    Glare means light emitting from a luminaire with an intensity great enough to reduce a viewer's ability to see or, in extreme cases, causing momentary blindness. 
    Indirect light means direct light that has been reflected or that has scattered off of other surfaces. 
    Lamp means the component of a luminaire that produces the actual light. 
    Light trespass means the shining of light produced by a luminaire beyond the boundaries of the property on which it is located. 
    Lumen output, initial, means ratings of a lamp as listed in a lamp catalog. 
    Lumens means the total quantity of light emitted from a light source, or a unit of luminous flux. One footcandle is one lumen per square foot. For the purpose of this article, the lumen output values shall be the initial lumen output ratings of a lamp. 
    Luminaire means a complete lighting system and includes a lamp or lamps and a fixture, housing, reflector, refractor, etc. 
    Maximum to minimum means the ratio of the maximum footcandle point calculation or reading to the minimum footcandle point calculation or reading for a given area. This ratio is generally maintained footcandles but could be initial. This ratio is an indicator of lighting uniformity. The lower the ratio, the better the uniformity. 
    Maximum means the maximum footcandle point calculation or reading in a given area. The maximum is generally maintained footcandles but could be initial. 
    Minimum means the minimum footcandle point calculation or reading in a given area. The minimum is generally maintained footcandles but could be initial. 
    Mounting height of luminaire means the vertical distance from the ground directly below the centerline of the luminaire to the center of the light source (lamp) in the luminaire. 
    Outdoor lighting means the nighttime illumination of an outside area or object by any manmade device located outdoors that produces light by any means. 
    Preexisting luminaires means luminaires not conforming to this article that were in place at the time the ordinance from which this article is derived was adopted. 
    Temporary outdoor lighting means the nighttime illumination of an outside area or object by any manmade device located outdoors that produces light by any means for a period of less than seven days, with at least 180 days passing before being used again. 
(Ord. No. O-2000-01, art. 1, 8-14-2000) 
Sec. 14-83. - Regulations. 
    All public and private outdoor lighting installed in the town shall be in conformance with the requirements established by this article. The provisions of this article are intended to supplement other applicable codes and requirements. Compliance with all applicable provisions of building, electrical and other codes must be observed. In the event of a conflict between the requirements of this article and other requirements, the more stringent requirement shall apply. 
(Ord. No. O-2000-01, § 2-1, 8-14-2000) 
Sec. 14-84. - Control of glare, light trespass and light levels. 
(a)  Glare control. All fixtures other than floods shall be fully shielded and shall be classified as full cutoff, as classified by the IESNA. This shall mean that no light is to be emitted out of the fixture above the 90 degree-horizontal plane. Floodlights are to be equipped with shields and aimed so as to direct the light onto the area to be lighted. 
(b)  Light trespass. The horizontal illuminance on the ground shall not exceed 0.4 maintained footcandles five feet beyond any adjacent property line. 
(c)  Light levels. The following table summarizes the recommended light levels for general parking and pedestrian areas.

(e)  Gas station/convenience store lighting. Lighting levels for convenience stores, gas station and other similar locations shall be adequate to facilitate the activities taking place in such locations. Lighting of such areas shall not be used to attract attention to such businesses. Signs allowed under article V of chapter 58 shall be used for that purpose. Facilities having canopies shall be restricted to no more than 320 watt recessed fixtures, including lenses, mounted flush with the bottom of the canopy. The light level shall not exceed 20 footcandles average maintained, measured at ground level at the gas pump island area. Lights shall not be mounted on the top or sides (fascias) of the canopy, and the sides (fascias) of the canopy shall not be illuminated. 
(f)  Sportsfield lighting. Lighting for sportsfields is generally in excess of general outdoor lighting levels. Recreation lighting levels established by the IESNA are to be used as the standard. Higher lighting levels for tournament or high league play are sometimes required and must be approved by the town prior to construction. All sportsfields must meet the following minimum standards: 
(1)  Fixtures must not exceed 80 feet in mounting height, including bases and/or other mounting structures. 
(2)  Fixtures must be fitted with the manufacturer's glare control package. If the manufacturer does not have a glare control package, the fixture specification must be changed to a manufacturer that offers a glare control package. 
(3)  Fixtures must be designed with a sharp cutoff and aimed so that their light beams fall within the primary playing area and the immediate surroundings, so that off-site direct illumination is significantly restricted. 
(4)  Lighting shall be extinguished no later than one hour after the event ends. 
(g)  Signs. 
(1)  Lighting fixtures illuminating signs shall be carefully located, aimed and shielded so that light is directed only onto the sign facade and glare is significantly reduced. Lighting fixtures shall not be aimed toward adjacent streets, roads or properties. 
(2)  Lighting fixtures illuminating signs shall be of a type such that the light source (bulb) is not directly visible from adjacent streets, roads or properties. 
(3)  Internally illuminated signs are prohibited. 
(4)  To the extent practicable, lighting fixtures shall be directed downward rather than upward. 
(5)  This article does not regulate outdoor signs. Such regulations have been adopted and can be found in article V of chapter 58. 
(h)  Building facades. 
(1)  Minimum illumination on any vertical surface or angular roof shall not exceed 5.0 footcandles average maintained. 
(2)  Lighting fixtures shall be carefully located, aimed and shielded so that light is directed only onto the building facade. Lighting fixtures shall not be directed toward adjacent streets or roads. 
(3)  To the extent practicable, lighting fixtures shall be directed downward rather than upward. 
(i)  Softscape/holiday/festive lighting . All softscape (landscape) lighting shall be aimed and shielded, if necessary, so as not to cause a hazard to a motorist or pedestrian. All fixtures shall be less than 50 watts. All holiday lighting shall be temporary in nature and shall be used only during the holiday or festive celebration period.

Sec. 14-85. - Exceptions and exemptions to general design standards. 
(a)  The design for an area may suggest the use of parking lot lighting, area lighting and roadway fixtures of a particular period or upscale architectural style such as the nostalgic lantern as either alternatives or supplements to the lighting described above. These decorative post-mounted fixtures are generally classified as noncutoff by the IESNA and are acceptable. The maximum lumens generated from each fixture shall not exceed 9,500 initial lamp lumens per fixture, and each fixture must be equipped with a solid top to reduce the amount of light going into the sky. 
(b)  All temporary emergency lighting needed by the sheriff or fire departments or other emergency services, as well as all vehicular luminaries, shall be exempt from the requirements of this article. 
(c)  All hazard warning luminaries required by federal regulatory agencies are exempt from the requirements of this article, except that all luminaries must be shown to be as close as possible to the federally required minimum lumen output requirement for the specific task. 
(d)  Motion detector security lights which are normally "off" and which are activated for less than five minutes occasionally when motion is detected are exempt from this article. 
(e)  In the case of flags, statues or other top-of-pole mounted objects, including neighborhood entrances, which cannot be illuminated with down-lighting, upward lighting may be used only in the form of two narrow-beam spotlights which confines the illumination to the object of interest.

ARTICLE V. - ARCHITECTURAL DESIGN STANDARDS 

Sec. 14-101. - Purpose and intent. 
    The purpose of establishing supplementary requirements for development is to ensure that the physical characteristics of proposed development are compatible when considered within the context of the surrounding areas and to preserve the unique visual character of the Town of Weddington. These requirements strike a balance between creativity and innovation on one hand while avoiding obtrusive, incongruous structures on the other. The Town of Weddington strongly encourages architectural styles that build upon and promote the existing historic character of the town and supports the view that inspiring, well-maintained, and harmonious development is in the best economic development interests of all residents and businesses. 
(Ord. No. O-2009-10, 7-13-2009) 
Sec. 14-102. - Applicability. 
    The standards described or referenced in this section shall apply to all nonresidential development, including renovations, remodelings, face lifts, repainting and additions to existing structures within the zoning jurisdiction of the Town of Weddington. All such projects that require a conditional use permit, a modification to a CUP, or conditional zoning shall be required to meet these standards. 
(Ord. No. O-2009-10, 7-13-2009) 
Sec. 14-103. - General compatibility requirement. 
    All development subject to this section shall be compatible with the character of the town by using a design that is complementary to existing town architectural styles, designs and forms. Compatibility shall be achieved through techniques such as the repetition of roof lines, the use of similar proportions in building mass and outdoor spaces, similar relationships to the street, similar window and door patterns, and the use of building materials that have color, shades and textures similar to those existing in the immediate area of the proposed development. 
(Ord. No. O-2009-10, 7-13-2009) 
Sec. 14-104. - Modification of standards. 
    The zoning administrator, his designee, or the design review board may make modifications to the following standards upon the written request of the applicant if the standard(s) in question conflicts with other requirements by law, as long as the proposal is in compliance with the purpose and intent of these standards and general compatibility requirements given above. If the applicant and zoning administrator, his designee, or the design review board cannot come to an agreement the proposal shall be submitted to the planning board for recommendation at their next meeting and to the town council for final decision. 
(Ord. No. O-2009-10, 7-13-2009) 
Sec. 14-105. - Conflicting requirements. 
    Where these requirements conflict with each other or with any requirement of the zoning ordinance or subdivision regulations, the stricter, more visually compatible or more appropriate standards shall apply as determined by the zoning administrator. Any modifications necessary shall be made with the approval of the zoning administrator, his designee, or the design review board. 
(Ord. No. O-2009-10, 7-13-2009) 
Sec. 14-106. - Overall design and appearance standards. 
(a)  Applicability. All nonresidential development within the zoning jurisdiction of the Town of Weddington shall meet these overall design and appearance standards. 
(b)  Basic building design. 
(1)  Scale: Building design shall emphasize a human scale at ground level, at entryways and along street frontages through the creative use of such features as windows, doors, columns, canopies, arcades, awnings, decks and porches. 
(2)  Avoiding monotony: Monotony of design in single or multiple building projects shall be avoided by varying detail, form and siting to the maximum extent practicable, within the standards set forth in these requirements. 
(3)  Unify individual storefronts: If several storefronts are located in one building, the individual storefronts shall be unified in all exterior design elements, such as mass, window and door placement, color, materials and signage while, at the same time, varying the look and providing distinctiveness from storefront to storefront. 
(c)  Architectural features. 
(1)  Roofs: Roof lines shall be varied to reduce the scale of structures and add visual interest including gables, windows, dormers where possible. 
(2)  Facades: All facades, including front and side facades and all rear facades that are visible from any public roadway or sidewalk or from private property, that are greater than 100 feet in length, measured horizontally, shall be interrupted by recesses, projections, windows, awnings and/or arcades and shall utilize a repeating pattern of change in color, texture and material modules. 
(3)  All facades clearly visible from public streets or adjoining properties shall contribute to the scale of features of the building and feature characteristics similar to the front facade. 
(4)  Entryways: Each principal building on a site shall have one or more clearly defined, highly visible customer entrances featuring one or more of the following: Canopies or porticos, arcades, arches, wing walls and/or planters. 
(5)  Materials: Predominant exterior building materials shall be high quality materials, including brick, stucco, wood, stone and tinted/textured decorative concrete masonry units or other materials similar in appearance and durability. Under no circumstances shall unfinished concrete block be permitted. 
(6)  Colors: Colors used for exterior surfaces shall be harmonious with surrounding development and shall visually reflect the traditional concept of the town. Color shades shall be used to facilitate blending into the neighborhood. Facade colors shall be of low reflectance earth tone, muted, subtle or neutral colors. Building trim may feature brighter colors as an accent material. The use of high-intensity or metallic colors is not allowed except for accent purposes. The use of fluorescent, day glow or neon colors shall be prohibited as a predominate wall color. Variations in color schemes are encouraged in order to articulate entryways and public amenities so as to give greater recognition to these features. Color samples shall be provided to the staff at the time of site plan review and prior to any renovations, remodelings, facelifts and repainting, along with a description of how and where each color will be used. Colored renderings are encouraged, but shall not be a substitute for this requirement. 
(d)  Parking lots. To prevent huge expanses of asphalt separating nonresidential buildings from streets, parking will be separated into sections separated by landscaping and other features. Larger parking areas shall be split into sections on different sides of the building or enclosed in an interior space between buildings so as not to be easily visible from the street in order to emphasize the building and de-emphasize the parking lot. 
(e)  Trash containment areas. All trash containment devices, including compactors and dumpsters, shall be located and designed so as not to be visible from the view of nearby streets and properties. If the device is not visible from off the site, then it need not be screened. The type of screening used shall be determined based on the proposed location of the trash containment area, existing site conditions and the type and amount of existing and proposed vegetation on the site. Trash containment areas must be constructed of materials in similar color and nature to the primary structure. 
(f)  Mechanical and utility equipment. Mechanical and utility equipment shall be screened from view from nearby streets and properties in the same manner as trash containment areas. Ground mounted equipment shall be located in the rear or side yard and screened. Such equipment located on the roof of the building shall also be made invisible from nearby streets and properties, through the use of setbacks from the edge of the roof or through the use of a screen exceeding the height of the equipment and using building materials and design which are compatible with those used for the exterior of the building. If the equipment is not visible from off the site, then it need not be screened. The type of screening used shall be determined based on the proposed location of the equipment, existing site conditions, and the type and amount of existing and proposed vegetation on the site. 
(g)  Landscape protection. Any damage to the existing landscaping, including street trees, by development, use or condition of private property shall be corrected by the property owner at the owner's expense to the satisfaction of the Town of Weddington prior to the issuance of a certificate of occupancy. Any damage not corrected by the owner shall be corrected by the town, the cost of which is to be billed to the owner, including town administrative costs. 
(h)  Cultural resources. Site development shall be considered in light of impacts on the cultural resources of the Town of Weddington. Cultural resources include historic properties, points of high elevation, significant sites and mature exceptional trees. Impacts on cultural resources shall be minimized by use of design, height, massing, scale, building orientation, site layout, visual and other development techniques to harmoniously integrate new development into the town while preserving and using cultural resources. 
(i)  Lighting. Lighting shall conform to the Town of Weddington's Lighting Ordinance. 
(Ord. No. O-2009-10, 7-13-2009) 
Sec. 14-107. - Additional standards. 
(a)  Applicability. All nonresidential development shall meet these standards, in addition to those described in overall design and appearance standards. 
(b)  Basic building design. 
(1)  Massing: A single, large, dominant building mass shall be avoided. Where large structures are required, mass shall be broken up through the use of setbacks, projecting and recessed elements and similar design techniques. 
(2)  Varying architectural styles: In developments with multiple structures of varying architectural styles, buildings shall be compatible by such means as a pattern of architectural features, similar scale and proportions and consistent location of signage. 
(3)  Additions and renovations: Building additions and facade renovations shall be designed to reflect existing buildings in scale, materials, window treatment and color. A change in scale may require a transitional design element between the new development and existing buildings. 
(4)  Infill development: New infill development shall either be similar in size and height or, if larger, be articulated and subdivided into massing that is proportional to the mass and scale of other structures in the area. 
(c)  Architectural features. 
(1)  Roofs: Roof lines, type (such as flat, hip, mansard or gable), and materials shall be architecturally compatible with facade elements and the rest of the building and with other buildings on the same and adjoining area. 
(2)  Fenestration: Windows, entryways, awnings and arcades shall total at least 60 percent of the facade length abutting a public street. Windows and glass doors shall be clear, transparent glass. No window or door shall be horizontally separated by more than 15 feet from the nearest other window or door in the same facade visible from any public street. 
(3)  Materials: Building materials shall either be similar to the materials already being used in the neighborhood or, if dissimilar materials are being proposed, other characteristics such as scale and proportions, form, architectural detailing, color and texture, shall be utilized to ensure that enough similarity exists for the building to be compatible, despite the differences in materials. 
(4)  Exterior wall cladding: During renovations in existing buildings brick, stone or wood facades shall not be covered or replaced with artificial siding or panels, including decorative concrete masonry units. Fiber cement siding, such as the brand name "Hardiplank", may be used to replace wood clapboard siding. 
(5)  Awnings and canopies: When used, awnings and canopies shall be placed at the top of window or doorway openings and shall relate to the shape of the top of the window. Awnings shall be made of canvas, treated canvas or similar material. Metal or vinyl (or plastic) awnings are prohibited. No awning shall extend more than the width of the sidewalk or nine feet, whichever is less. Awnings must be self-supporting from the wall. No supports shall rest on or interfere with the use of pedestrian walkways or streets. In no case shall any awning extend beyond the street curb or interfere with street trees or public utilities. 
(6)  Canopies shall be of solid materials and complement the color of the building to which they are affixed or associated. In some cases canopies may have supports separate from the building, such as at gas stations, but such canopies must be setback from the property and right-of-way lines a minimum of the required setback of accessory buildings, as required in the zoning district where located, and must not interfere with street trees or public utilities.

The defendant may secure cancellation of an order of abatement by paying all costs of the proceedings and posting a bond for compliance with the order. The bond shall be given with sureties approved by the appropriate clerk of superior court in an amount approved by the judge before whom the matter is heard, and it shall be conditioned on the defendant's full compliance with terms of the order of abatement within a time fixed by the judge. Cancellation of an order of abatement shall not suspend or cancel an injunction issued in conjunction therewith. 
(e)  The provisions of this chapter may be enforced by any one, all or a combination of the remedies authorized and prescribed by this section.

(b)  Procedure. A petition for any such modification shall be submitted in writing by the subdivider to the subdivision administrator. The petition shall include: 
(1)  The precise nature of the proposed modification of this chapter. 
(2)  The reasons that the need for the modification has occurred.

The modification request and any recommendation from the planning board may be handled simultaneously by the planning board with the sketch plan for a conservation subdivision; however, a modification shall be granted prior to the zoning administrator's approval of a sketch plan for a conventional subdivision. 
(d)  Consideration by town council. The town council shall consider the modification request once a recommendation has been received from the planning board, or the time for planning board review has elapsed with no recommendation having been forwarded, whichever comes first. In granting any modification, the town council shall make the findings required in this subsection, taking into account the nature of the proposed subdivision, the existing use of land in the vicinity, the number of persons to reside or work in the proposed subdivision and the probable effect of the proposed subdivision upon traffic conditions in the vicinity. No modification shall be granted unless the town council finds that: 
(1)  There are special circumstances or conditions affecting said property such that the strict application of the provisions of this chapter would deprive the applicant of the reasonable use of his land. 
(2)  The modification is necessary for the preservation and enjoyment of a substantial property right of the petitioner. 
(3)  The circumstances giving rise to the need for the modification are peculiar to the parcel and are not generally characteristic of other parcels in the jurisdiction of this chapter. 
(4)  The granting of the modification will not be detrimental to the public health, safety and welfare or be injurious to other property in the territory in which said property is situated. 
(5)  The modification will not vary the provisions of chapter 58 applicable to the property. 
(6)  The need for modification is not a direct result of actions taken by the applicant or property owner. 
In approving modifications, the town council may require such conditions as will, in its judgment, secure substantially the objectives and standards or requirements of this chapter.

Sec. 46-16. - Amendments. 
(a)  For the purpose of providing for the public health, safety, and general welfare, the town council may from time to time amend the terms of this chapter, but no amendment shall become effective unless it shall have been proposed by or shall have been submitted to the planning board for review. The proposed amendment must be submitted to the planning board at least 15 days in advance of the meeting at which the planning board considers said amendment, unless this requirement is waived by majority vote of the planning board members at the meeting the amendment is considered. The planning board shall have 30 days from the meeting at which the proposed amendment is considered to submit its report. If the planning board fails to submit a report within the time specified above, the proposed amendment will be forwarded to the town council without the recommendation of the planning board. 
(b)  No amendment shall be adopted by the town council until it has held a public hearing on the amendment. Notice of the hearing shall be published in a newspaper of general circulation in the town at least once a week for two successive calendar weeks prior to the hearing. The initial notice shall appear not more than 25 nor not less than ten days prior to the hearing date.

Sec. 46-41. - Major subdivision plat approval. 
    Prior to construction or installation of any subdivision improvements, all major subdivisions shall be submitted and approved in accordance with sections 46-42 through 46-46. All applications for major subdivisions, both conventional and conservation, must meet the requirements and submittal schedule described in both the Traffic Impact Analysis Process and Procedures Manual, and Appendix C: Traffic Impact Analysis. 
(Ord. No. 04-09-13, § 306, 9-13-2004; Ord. No. O-2015-10, 6-8-2015) 
Sec. 46-42. - Sketch plan for major subdivisions. 
(a)  Meeting. A preapplication meeting shall be required between the applicant and the subdivision administrator for all subdivisions located in the R-CD district to introduce the applicant to the town's zoning and subdivision regulations and procedures, to discuss the applicant's objectives, and to schedule site inspections, and plan submissions as herein required. 
(b)  Sketch plan-Required. A sketch plan as provided in subsection (a) of this section shall be prepared by a registered land surveyor currently licensed and registered in the state by the state board of registration for professional engineers and land surveyors. 
(c)  Same-Approval. Under this chapter, an administrative approval by the zoning or subdivision administrator shall not constitute approval by the town for common law vested rights. Sketch plan approval is merely a precursor to the submission of a preliminary plat requiring town council approval. Hence, sketch plan approval under chapter 58 is subject to be changed or modified and is not intended to provide a basis for common law vested rights claims. 
(d)  Number of copies and contents. 
(1)  Conventional and conservation subdivisions. 
a.  Prior to the application for approval of a preliminary plat, the subdivider shall submit to the subdivision administrator nine copies of a sketch plan of the proposed subdivision along with a fee, in accordance with a fee schedule adopted by the town council. No application shall be considered complete or processed by the subdivision administrator unless it is accompanied by said fee. In addition, the town shall be reimbursed by the subdivider for all costs associated with the town's engineering and/or consulting services with respect to review of the sketch plan prior to sketch plan approval. All conservation subdivision sketch plans shall be reviewed by the planning board. The sketch plans shall contain the following information: 
1.  A sketch vicinity map including a north arrow showing the location of the subdivision in relation to the neighboring tracts, subdivisions, roads, and waterways. For conservation subdivisions, a "site context map" per section 46-44(b)(1) shall substitute for a sketch vicinity map. 
2.  The boundaries of the tract and the portion of the tract to be subdivided. 
3.  The total acreage to be subdivided. 
4.  The existing and proposed uses of land within the subdivision and the existing uses of land adjoining it.

The report shall be based of the physical characteristics of the site. The applicant shall conduct at least two soil core borings for every one acre of land in the tract to be subdivided and the borings shall be an average of at least four feet in depth. Each boring shall be assigned a separate number and the report shall present the findings of each boring, The subdivider shall show the location of each boring (by number assigned) on the sketch plan. The report shall include the description of soils in accordance with N.C. Admin. Code, title 10, chapter 10, subchapter 10A, and the U. S.

b.  The report shall include a description of soil color, using the Munsell Soil Color Charts, Published by Munsell Color, Macbeth Division of Kollmorgen Corporation. 
c.  The report shall draw conclusions as to the suitability of septic systems as derived from the testing, color and type of soil for each sample of soil taken. 
d.  Approval of the proposed lots for septic tanks by the county health department shall be acceptable in lieu of the soils test requirement. 
(2)  Conservation subdivisions only. In addition to the information cited in subsection (d)(1) of this section, the following information shall also be submitted for all proposed conservation subdivisions: 
a.  Existing resources and site analysis plan, which shall be prepared to provide the developer and the town with a comprehensive analysis of existing conditions, both on the proposed development site and within 500 feet of the site (for tracts of 100 acres or less) or 1,000 feet of the site (for tracts over 100 acres.) Conditions beyond the tract boundaries may be described on a more general basis from existing published data available from governmental agencies, and from aerial photographs and need not be as specific as those that are required for the development site. Unless otherwise requested by the subdivision administrator to facilitate readability, such plans shall be prepared at a scale of one inch equals 100 feet or one inch equals 200 feet, whichever would fit best on a single standard size sheet (24 inches by 36 inches). The following information shall be included in this plan: 
1.  An aerial photograph enlarged to a scale not less detailed than one inch equals 400 feet, with the site boundaries clearly marked. 
2.  Topography, the contour lines of which shall generally be at five-foot intervals, determined by photogrammetry. Slopes shall be clearly indicated when they are between ten and 15 percent, between 15 and 25 percent, or when exceeding 25 percent. Topography shall be prepared by a professional land surveyor or professional engineer from an actual field survey of the site or from stereoscopic aerial photography and shall be coordinated with official USGS benchmarks. 
3.  The location and delineation of ponds, lakes, streams, ditches, natural drainage swales, wetlands, and floodplains. Additional areas of wetlands on the proposed development tract shall also be indicated, as evident from testing, visual inspection, or from the presence of wetland vegetation.

6.  Ridge lines. 
7.  A viewshed analysis showing the location and extent of views into the property from public roads and from public parks, and from the boundaries of lakes, ponds, and streams on the site. 
8.  Geologic formations on the proposed development parcel, such as rock formations and outcroppings, and fault lines, based on available published information or more detailed data obtained by the applicant. 
9.  All existing manmade features including, but not limited to, streets, driveways, farm roads, forest roads, buildings, foundations, walls, wells, drainage fields, dumps, utilities, fire hydrants, and sanitary sewers. 
10.  Locations of all historic sites on the tract. 
11.  Locations of trails that have been in public use (pedestrian, equestrian, bicycle, etc.). 
12.  All easements and other encumbrances of property which are or have been filed of record with the county register of deeds. 
13.  Total acreage of the tract, and the location and acreage of primary conservation lands. 
b.  The general concept for land conservation on the subdivision (i.e., a summary description of the types of primary and secondary lands contained on the tract and an overview of the subdivider's plans for retaining each, where applicable.). 
c.  A yield plan showing the number of lots that could occur on the tract if it were developed in accordance with all applicable subdivision requirements as a conventional subdivision using lots of a minimum size of 40,000 square feet. Conservation subdivisions in the R-CD district are designed to be density neutral (i.e., allow for the same number of lots as that which could be platted under applicable subdivision requirements with a minimum lot size of 40,000 square feet). A yield plan shall incorporate the following: 
1.  Yield plans must be prepared with the sketch plan in accordance with the standards of this chapter, and must show all proposed lots, streets, rights-of-way, and other pertinent features that would be required for a sketch plan for major conventional subdivisions as identified in subsection (d)(1) of this section. Although the yield plan must be drawn to scale, it need not be based on a field survey. However, the yield plan must be a realistic layout reflecting a development pattern that could reasonably be expected to be implemented, taking into account the presence of wetlands, floodplains, steep slopes, existing easements or encumbrances and, if unsewered, the suitability of soils for subsurface sewage disposal. When calculating required buffering along thoroughfares, the minimum buffer width shall be as shown in table 46-76 and shall not be further reduced in any way. 
2.  Yield plans shall also reflect that each lot in the subdivision contains a minimum area of 40,000 square feet. The yield plan must identify the site's primary and secondary conservation lands, as identified in the existing resources/site analysis Plan, and demonstrate that the primary conservation lands could be successfully absorbed in the development process without disturbance, by allocating this area to proposed single-family dwelling lots. Irrespective of this provision, all lots that are partially located within a designated floodplain area shall contain a minimum buildable area (i.e., area outside of the floodplain) of at least 5,000 square feet of land. 
3.  On sites not served by a central sewage disposal, lot yield shall be further determined by evaluating septic tank drainfield suitability reports as identified in subsection (d)(1)a.10 of this section. 
(e)  Submission and review procedure for major subdivisions. The subdivision administrator shall, within 30 days of receipt of the sketch plan, review the sketch plan for: 
(1)  General compliance with the requirements of this chapter and chapter 58. 
(2)  The subdivision administrator shall advise the subdivider or his authorized agent of the regulations pertaining to the proposed subdivision and the procedures to be followed in the preparation and submission of the preliminary and final plats. One copy of the sketch plan shall be retained as a part of the record of the subdivision administrator, with another copy being returned to the subdivider or his authorized agent along with any comments made by the subdivision administrator. 
(3)  In the case of conservation subdivisions, an existing resources and site analysis plan, as called for in subsection (d)(1) of this section, the general concept plan for land conservation, and a submittal of a yield plan. 
(f)  Public involvement meeting (PIM). Proposed developments ten acres or greater shall require a public involvement meeting (PIM) prior to any recommendation by the planning staff and approval by the appropriate town council. The PIM is designed to provide a framework for creating a shared vision with community involvement directed by the applicant in accordance with the following requirements: 
(1)  Schedule of public involvement meeting. 
a.  The subdivision applicant shall provide an agenda, schedule, location, and list of participants such as landscape architects, engineers, etc. to answer questions from citizens and service providers for the PIM in cooperation with the planning staff. 
b.  The PIM shall be a minimum of four hours. Two hours shall be scheduled during normal business hours to allow service providers (such as the state department of transportation, utilities, and state department of environment and natural resources) to participate as needed and to allow for citizens to appear at a convenient time throughout the period. It is strongly recommended that this portion of the PIM take place at the proposed development site. In addition, a two-hour evening period shall be scheduled at the town hall or other public place agreed upon by the applicant and planning staff. 
(2)  Notice of public involvement meetings. Such notice shall, at a minimum, be given as follows: 
a.  A public notice shall be sent to a newspaper having general circulation in the town not less than ten days nor more than 25 days prior to the date of the PIM. 
b.  A notice shall be sent by first class mail by the town to the affected property owners and to all property within 1,300 linear feet, as measured from the exterior boundaries of the proposed development up to the town limits, not less than ten days prior to the date of the PIM. The notification shall contain information regarding the PIM time and locations as well as a general description of the proposal. The applicant shall reimburse the town for all expenses incurred for such notifications. 
c.  A PIM notification sign shall be posted in a conspicuous place at the property not less than ten days prior to the PIM. The sign shall indicate the date, time, and locations of the PIM. 
(3)  Public involvement meeting report. Town staff will keep notes of citizens' comments received during the PIM. In addition, all service provider comments shall be recorded by the developer, including, but not limited to, all correspondence, reports and oral comments by service providers, and shall be made a part of the report. After town review, the report will be available at town hall and at subsequent meetings concerning the project. When practical, comments, ideas, and suggestions should be incorporated by the developer into the proposed development.

Sec. 46-44. - Major subdivision preliminary plat submission and review for conservation subdivisions. 
(a)  Site inspection meeting. Prior to submission of a preliminary plat, the applicant shall schedule a site inspection meeting with the subdivision administrator, as well as such others as may be called for by the subdivision administrator, to familiarize the town with the property's existing conditions, special features, to identify potential site design issues, and to provide an informal opportunity to discuss site design concepts, including the general layout of designated conservation lands, and lot line and street alignment layouts. 
(b)  Documents required for the preliminary plat. In addition to all other information required for preliminary plats outlined in section 46-46, a preliminary plat application shall be accompanied by the following materials. Where the requirements of section 46-46 and this section conflict, the requirements of this section shall control for conservation subdivisions: 
(1)  Site context map. A map showing the location of the proposed subdivision within its neighborhood context shall be submitted. Unless otherwise requested by the subdivision administrator to facilitate readability, for sites under 100 acres, such maps shall be at a scale of not less than one inch equals 200 feet, and shall show the relationship of the subject property to natural and manmade features existing within 500 feet of the site. For sites of 100 acres or more, the scale shall be one inch equals 400 feet, and shall show the above relationships within 1,000 feet of the site. The features that shall be shown on the site context map include topography (from USGS maps), stream valleys, wetland complexes (from maps published by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service or the USDA Natural Resources Conservation Service), forestlands over 10,000 square feet in area (from aerial photographs), ridge lines, public roads, trails, utility easements and rights-of-way, public land, and land protected under conservation easements. 
(2)  Delineation of conservation lands. The delineation of conservation lands shall be as provided for in subsection 58-58(4). 
a.  The minimum percentage and acreage of required conservation lands shall be calculated by the applicant and submitted as part of the preliminary plat. 
b.  Proposed conservation lands shall be designated using the existing resources and site analysis plan (submitted with the sketch plan) as a base map. 
c.  In delineating secondary conservation areas, the applicant shall use the following tier system as a guide, with those lands included in tier A having the highest priority for preservation; provided, however, that in certain portions of the town, the priorities defined may be altered by the town in order to maximize achievement of the goals and objectives of maintaining open space through conservation subdivisions: 
1.  Tier A, highest priority. 
(i)  Forestlands. 
2.  Tier B, medium priority. 
(i)  Farmlands. 
(ii)  Historic sites. 
3.  Tier C, lowest priority. 
(i)  Steep slopes. 
(ii)  Rock formations. 
(iii)  Lands adjacent to parks. 
(3)  Conservation maintenance plan and maintenance agreement. A conservation maintenance plan and maintenance agreement, in accordance with subsection 58-58(4)i, shall be submitted with the preliminary plat. 
(c)  Approval procedure for preliminary plat. Preliminary plats for conservation subdivisions shall be approved in the same manner as conventional subdivisions as provided in subsections 46-43(c) and (d). 
(d)  Conservation subdivision design standards delineation standards. The locations and boundaries of primary conservation lands shall follow their natural delineated boundaries. The locations and boundaries of secondary conservation lands shall be based upon the applicant's analysis of the tract's resource features. The priorities set forth in this subsection shall be used, to the greatest degree feasible, in delineating the location of secondary conservation lands. The applicant shall also be guided by any written recommendations provided by the town regarding the delineation of secondary conservation area lands, following site inspection. 
(1)  Design standards. Standards to be followed regarding the design of the conservation subdivision are as follows: 
a.  Except as otherwise permitted, conservation lands shall be free of all structures except historic buildings, stone walls, and structures related to conservation land uses. The town council may approve structures and improvements required for storm drainage, sewage treatment and water supply within such conservation land on finding that such facilities would not be detrimental to the conservation land, and that the acreage of lands required for such uses is not credited towards minimum conservation acreage requirements for the tract, unless the land they occupy is appropriate for passive recreational use. 
b.  Conservation lands shall not include parcels smaller than three acres, have a length-to-width ratio of less than 4:1, or be less than 75 feet in width, except for such lands specifically designed as neighborhood greens, playing fields or trail links. Exceptions to this requirement may be granted, on a case-by-case basis, where, due to topography, shape, size, or location of the tract, such requirements are determined by the town council when reviewing the preliminary plat to be infeasible, impractical, or serve no meaningful purpose. 
c.  Conservation lands shall be directly accessible to the largest practicable number of lots within the subdivision. Nonadjoining lots shall be provided with safe and convenient pedestrian access to conservation land. 
d.  Conservation lands shall be interconnected wherever possible to provide a continuous network of conservation lands within and adjoining the subdivision. 
e.  Conservation lands shall provide buffers to adjoining parks, preserves or other protected lands. 
f.  Except as provided herein, conservation lands shall be provided with pedestrian pathways for use by the residents of the subdivision. Public access shall be provided on such trails if they are linked to other publicly accessible pathway systems within the town. Provisions shall be made for access to the conservation lands, as required for land management and emergency purposes. Access to conservation lands for agricultural or horticultural purposes may be appropriately restricted for public safety purposes and to prevent interference with agricultural or horticultural operations. 
g.  Conservation lands shall be undivided by streets, except where necessary for proper traffic circulation. 
h.  Conservation lands shall be made subject to such agreement with the town and such conservation easements shall be duly recorded in the office of the county register of deeds for the purpose of preserving the common open space for such uses. 
i.  Conservation lands shall be located in a manner that is consistent with the town's land use plan and the town's conservation land audit, which identifies an interconnected network of conservation lands. 
(2)  Specific conservation standards. The following specific conservation standards shall also apply within the conservation subdivision: 
a.  Stream valleys, swales, springs, and other lowland areas. Stream valleys, swales, springs and other lowland areas are resources that warrant restrictive land use controls because of flooding hazards to human life and property, their groundwater recharge functions, their importance to water quality and the health of aquatic communities, and their wildlife habitats. They are generally poorly suited for on-site subsurface sewage disposal systems. Accordingly, the following activities shall be minimized in such areas: 
1.  Disturbance to streams and drainage swales. 
2.  Disturbance to yearround wetlands, areas with seasonally high water tables and areas of surface water concentration. 
3.  Because of their extreme limitations, stream valleys, swales and other lowland areas may warrant designation as conservation lands. They may also require adjoining buffer lands to be included as conservation lands, to be determined by an analysis of the protection requirements of such areas as determined by the town council on a case-by-case basis upon finding that designation of such areas as conservation land would have significant and positive longterm environmental impact on the conservation lands. 
b.  Forestlands. 
1.  Forestlands often occur in association with stream valleys and wet areas, poor and erodible agricultural soils, and moderate to steep slopes. Forestlands serve many functions, including soil stabilizers, particularly on moderate to steep slopes, a means of ameliorating harsh microclimatic conditions in both summer and winter, a source of wood products, natural wildlife habitats, and visual buffers. 
2.  Because of their resource values, all forestlands on any tract proposed for a conservation subdivision shall be evaluated to determine the extent to which they should be designated partly or entirely as conservation lands. Evaluation criteria include: configuration and size, present conditions, site potential (i.e., the site's capabilities to support forestlands, based upon its topographic, soil and hydrologic characteristics), ecological functions (i.e., in protecting steep slopes, erodible soils, maintaining stream quality and providing for wildlife habitats), relationship to forestlands on adjoining properties and the potential for maintaining continuous forestland areas. 
3.  The evaluation of the tract's forestlands shall be undertaken consistent with the town's land audit. This evaluation shall be submitted as a report and made a part of the application for a preliminary plat. At a minimum, that report shall include one or more maps indicating boundaries and conditions of forestland areas. 
4.  In designing a conservation subdivision, the applicant shall be guided by the following standards: 
(i)  Proposed site improvements shall be located, designed and constructed to minimize the loss or degradation of forestland areas. 
(ii)  Disturbance or removal of forestlands occupying environmentally sensitive areas shall be undertaken on a limited, selective, as needed basis. 
(iii)  No clearing or earth disturbance, except for soil analysis for proposed sewage disposal systems, shall be permitted on a site before preliminary plat approval. 
c.  Slopes. Moderately sloping lands (ten to 15 percent) and steeply sloping lands (over 15 percent) are prone to severe erosion if disturbed. Erosion and the resulting overland flow of soil sediments into streams, ponds and public roads, are detrimental to water quality and aquatic life, and a potential hazard to public safety. 
1.  Areas of steep slope (15 percent or greater) shall be considered as secondary conservation lands. 
2.  Development in areas containing slopes of 15 to 25 percent shall be minimized. The only permitted grading beyond the terms described above, shall be in conjunction with the siting of a dwelling, its access driveway and the septic system. 
3.  No site disturbance shall be allowed on slopes exceeding 25 percent except grading for a portion of a driveway accessing a dwelling when it can be demonstrated that no other routing which avoids slopes exceeding 25 percent is feasible. 
4.  Grading or earthmoving on all sloping lands of 15 percent or greater shall not result in earth cuts or fills whose highest vertical dimension exceeds six feet, except where in the judgment of the town's consulting engineer, no other available alternatives exist for construction of roads, drainage structures and other public improvements, in which case such vertical dimensions shall not exceed 12 feet. Roads and driveways shall follow the line of existing topography to minimize the required cut and fill. Finished slopes of all cuts and fills shall be as required to minimize disturbance of natural grades. 
d.  Significant natural areas and features. Natural areas containing rare or endangered plants and animals, as well as other features of natural significance may exist in the town. Subdivision applicants shall take all reasonable measures to protect significant natural areas and features identified by the applicant's existing resources and site analysis plan, as required in subsection 46-42(d)(1), by incorporating them into proposed conservation lands. 
e.  Rural road corridors and scenic viewsheds. All applications for conservation subdivisions shall preserve the viewsheds along rural roads by incorporating them into conservation lands or otherwise providing for building setbacks and architectural designs to minimize their intrusion. Views of developable lots from exterior roads and abutting properties shall be minimized by the use of changes in topography, existing vegetation, or additional landscaping to the greatest degree possible. 
(3)  Location of house sites. Applicants shall identify house site locations in the tract's designated development areas designed to fit the tract's natural topography, be served by adequate water and sewerage facilities, and provide views of and/or access to adjoining conservation lands in a manner consistent with the preservation of the conservation lands. 
(4)  Alignment of streets; street access. 
a.  With house site locations identified, applicants shall delineate a street system to provide vehicular access to each house in a manner conforming to the tract's natural topography and providing for a safe pattern of circulation and ingress and egress to and from the tract. 
b.  Streets shall be designed and laid out in a manner that minimizes adverse impacts on the conservation lands. To the greatest extent practicable, wetland crossings and new streets or driveways traversing steep slopes shall be avoided. 
c.  Street connections shall be designed so as to minimize the number of new culs-de-sac and to facilitate easy access to and from homes in different parts of the tract (and on adjoining parcels). Where practical, at least two means of ingress and egress from the conservation subdivision onto adjoining public roads shall be provided for all conservation subdivisions containing more than 15 lots. 
d.  Developable lots shall be accessed from interior streets, rather than from roads bordering the tract. Single loaded streets are encouraged to the greatest degree feasible. 
e.  Two points of ingress and egress onto an adjoining public road from a conservation subdivision containing more than 15 lots is encouraged. Proposals for more than two points of ingress and egress onto any adjoining public road shall be allowed on a case-by-case basis only when determined by the town council that it would not have a negative impact on traffic levels and patterns and the viability of the conservation subdivision. 
(e)  Resource conservation standards for site preparation and cleanup. 
(1)  Protection of vegetation from mechanical injury. Where earthwork, grading, or construction activities will take place in or adjacent to forestlands, or other significant vegetation or site features, the town shall require that the limit of disturbance be delineated and vegetation protected through installation of temporary fencing or other approved measures. Such fencing shall be installed prior to the commencing of, and shall be maintained throughout, the period of construction activity. 
(2)  Protection of vegetation from excavations. 
a.  When digging trenches for utility lines or similar uses, disturbances to the root zones of all woody vegetation shall be avoided. 
b.  If trenches must be excavated in the root zone, all disturbed roots shall be cut as cleanly as possible. The trench shall be backfilled as quickly as possible.

Sec. 46-45. - Final major subdivision plat submission and review. 
(a)  Preparation of final plat and installation of improvements. Upon approval of the preliminary plat by the town council, the subdivider may proceed with the preparation of the final plat and the installation of or arrangement for required improvements in accordance with the approved preliminary plat and the requirements of this chapter. Prior to initiation of the construction of utility and street improvements, plans shall have all necessary approvals from state agencies and appropriate county. Prior to approval of a final plat, the subdivider shall have installed the improvements specified in this chapter or guaranteed their installation as provided herein. No final plat will be accepted for review by the town council unless accompanied by written notice by the subdivision administrator acknowledging compliance with the improvement and guarantee standards of this chapter. If the street improvements are completed prior to preparation of the final plat, subsection 46-49(b) shall be complied with before submission of the final plat to the town council for approval. The final plat shall constitute only that portion of the preliminary plat which the subdivider proposes to record and develop at that time; such portion shall conform to all requirements of this chapter. 
(b)  Improvement and guarantee standards. 
(1)  Optional agreement. In lieu of requiring the completion, installation and, if applicable, dedication of all improvements prior to final plat approval, the town may enter into an agreement with the subdivider whereby the subdivider shall guarantee completion of all required improvements as specified on the approved preliminary plat for that portion of the subdivision to be shown on the final plat within two years from the date of final plat approval, unless otherwise specified in the written agreement. Once said agreement is signed by both parties and the security required herein is provided, the final plat may be approved by the town council; provided, however, that all other requirements of this article are met. To secure this agreement, the subdivider shall provide either one or a combination of the following guarantees in an amount equal to 1.25 times the costs, as estimated by the subdivider and approved by the town planner or engineer, of installing all required improvements on the approved preliminary plat for that portion of the subdivision to be shown on the final plat. The amount shall be subject to the approval of the town council or the planning board; provided, however, that the planning board shall have no authority to approve bonds in excess of $1,000,000,00. 
a.  Surety performance bond. The subdivider shall obtain a performance bond from a surety bonding company satisfactory to the town council or planning board, as applicable. A surety bonding company must at minimum be: (1) registered to do business with the North Carolina Secretary of State; (2) licensed to issue surety bonds in the State of North Carolina by the North Carolina Department of Insurance; (3) rated at least "B+" by a reputable bond rating agency; and (4) possess a minimum of $50,000,000.00 in assets. The town council or planning board may, within its sole discretion, insist upon alternative standards based upon the particular project, the estimated cost of completion of the improvements, and/or other factors indicating higher standards are warranted. The bond(s) must contain the following provisions: (1) the bond(s) shall remain in effect until such time as all improvements are installed and approved by the town council or planning board; (2) the surety bonding company, within 15 days of the town providing notice of default, shall take over and complete all improvements or pay the town in cash the estimated costs of installing the improvements as determined by the town's planner or engineer; and (3) the town shall be able to draw upon the bond(s) in the event that the subdivider defaults upon its agreement with the town in accordance with subsection (2) of this section. Any charges associated with cost calculation or verification shall be borne entirely by the subdivider. 
b.  Letter(s) of credit. The subdivider shall obtain an irrevocable letter(s) of credit issued by a commercial bank satisfactory to the town council or planning board. The commercial bank issuing the letter of credit must be: (1) organized under the laws of the United States of America or any state of the United States, or the District of Columbia; (2) authorized to do business in the State of North Carolina; (3) subject to regulation by the State of North Carolina or federal banking regulatory authorities; and (4) possess combined capital stock, surplus and undivided profits aggregating at least $100,000,000.00. The town council or planning board may, within its sole discretion, insist upon alternative standards based upon the particular project, the estimated cost of completion of the improvements, and/or other factors indicating higher standards are warranted. The letter(s) of credit must contain the following provisions: (1) the letter(s) of credit shall be evergreen and shall not be subject to expiration until such time as all improvements are installed and approved by the town council or planning board, and shall require the issuing commercial bank to give at least 60 days' notice of its intent to terminate the letter(s) of credit, upon which the town can draw upon the letter(s) of credit; (2) the town shall be able to draw upon the letter(s) of credit at any time on or before its expiration; (3) the commercial bank shall, upon written notification by the town council or planning board stating that the subdivider is in default, immediately pay to the town the full amount, or any lesser amount if requested by the town council or planning board, of the letter(s) of credit; (4) the town shall be able to draw upon the letter(s) of credit in the event that the subdivider defaults upon its agreement with the town in accordance with subsection (2) of this section; and (5) the letter(s) of credit shall allow for presentment and collection at a location within a 30-mile radius of the town. 
c.  Cash or equivalent surety. The subdivider shall deposit cash, or other instrument readily convertible into cash at face value, such as a certificate of deposit or treasury-issued security, either with the town or in escrow with a financial institution designated as an official depository of the town. The use of any instrument other than cash shall be subject to the approval of the town council or planning board. 
If cash or other instrument is deposited in escrow with a financial institution as provided above, then the subdivider shall file with the town council or planning board an agreement between the financial institution and the subdivider guaranteeing the following: 
1.  That said escrow account shall be held in trust for the town until released by the town council or planning board and may not be used or pledged by the subdivider in any other matter during the term of the escrow; 
2.  That the financial institution shall, upon written notification by the town council or planning board stating that the subdivider is in default, immediately pay to the town all funds in said account, excluding any interest earned; and 
3.  That the duration of said escrow account(s) shall be until such time as all improvements are installed and approved by the town council or planning board, or until the subdivider provides the town with an acceptable, alternative guarantee for the completion of installing all remaining required improvements on the approved preliminary plat for that portion of the subdivision to be shown on the final plat. Any charges associated with cost calculation or verification shall be borne entirely by the subdivider. 
(2)  Duration of financial guarantees. The duration of a financial guarantee shall be of a reasonable period to allow for completion and acceptance of improvements. In no case shall the duration of the financial guarantee for improvements exceed 24 months, unless otherwise specified in the written agreement as described in subsection 46-45(b)(1). All subdivisions whose public improvements are not completed and accepted at least 30 days prior to the expiration of the financial guarantee shall be considered to be in default, unless said guarantee is extended with the consent of the town council to a future date not to exceed six months, or to a date determined by council. 
(3)  Default. Upon default by the subdivider, the town council or planning board, as applicable, may require the surety, the letter of credit issuer or the financial institution holding the escrow account to pay all or a portion of the bond, letter of credit or escrow account to the town. Upon payment, the town shall expend said funds to complete all or any portion of the required improvements as it deems necessary. For purposes of this section, default shall constitute any of the following: (1) failure on the part of the subdivider to complete, within the time period specified in the agreement in subsection (b)(1)c.1. of this section, the required improvements as specified on the approved preliminary plat for that portion of the subdivision to be shown on the final plat; (2) failure on the part of the subdivider to install any improvement in accordance with the specifications or the regulations in the town's ordinances; or (3) transfer of ownership of any portion of the property or lots located within the subdivision to another person or entity under no legal obligation to install the required improvements (e.g., foreclosure). If one of the above events occurs, nothing herein shall prevent the town from declaring default prior to the expiration of the time period specified in subsection (b)(1)c.1. of this section. 
(4)  Release of guarantee surety. In its sole discretion, the town council or planning board may release a portion of any security posted as the improvements are completed and recommended for approval by the town planner, so long as the town maintains the posted security in an amount equal to at least 1.25 times the estimated costs of installation of the remaining improvements. However, notwithstanding the above, nothing shall require the town council or planning board to release any portion of security posted until such time as all improvements are installed and approved by the town council or planning board. Within 30 days after receiving the town planner's recommendation, the town council or planning board shall approve or not approve said improvements. Once all required improvements on the preliminary plat for that portion of the subdivision to be shown on the final plat have been installed and approved, then all security posted for said improvements shall be released by the town council or planning board. 
(c)  Final plat submission procedure. 
(1)  Within two years following the approval of the preliminary plat, the subdivider shall submit a final plat as set forth in this subsection. 
(2)  At least ten copies of the final plat (additional copies may be required by the subdivision administrator to send to various agencies) shall be submitted to the subdivision administrator at least 15 days prior to the meeting at which the planning board reviews the final plat. A fee, in accordance with a fee schedule adopted by the town council, shall accompany such submission. No application shall be complete or processed by the subdivision administrator unless accompanied by said fee. In addition, the town shall be reimbursed by the subdivider for all costs associated with the town's engineering and/or consulting services with respect to review of the final plat prior to final plat approval. One copy of the final plat shall be on reproducible material. Materials and drawing medium for the original shall be in accordance with the standards of practice for land surveying in the state, where applicable, and the requirements of the appropriate county register of deeds. 
(3)  The final plat shall be prepared by a registered land surveyor currently licensed in the state by the state board of registration for professional engineers and land surveyors, and shall be at a scale of not less than one inch equals 200 feet. Maps may be placed on more than one sheet with appropriate match lines. 
(4)  The final plat may be submitted in sections. In this case, at least one final plat section shall be submitted per year, on or before the anniversary date of preliminary plat approval. In no case shall preliminary plat approval for any section extend beyond five years from the date of approval. 
(5)  Each phase's final plat must contain a comment stating common open space/conservation land requirements set forward by this chapter and chapter 58 have been met. 
(6)  The final plat shall conform substantially to the preliminary plat as approved, and if desired by the owner or subdivider, it may refer to that portion of the approved preliminary plat which he proposes to record as a final plat and begin selling within the following year. 
(7)  Failure to submit a final plat within two years after preliminary plat approval shall render the preliminary plat null and void. 
(8)  The final plat shall meet all applicable specifications in section 46-46 and the following signed certificates shall appear on each copy of the plat: 
a.  Certificate of ownership and dedication. 
I hereby certify that I am the owner of the property shown and described hereon, which is located in the subdivision jurisdiction of the Town of Weddington and that I hereby adopt this plan of subdivision with my free consent, establish minimum building setback lines, and dedicate all streets, alleys, walks, parks, and other sites and easements to public or private use as noted.

If this cannot be supplied, expenses will be charged to the developer for the service to be completed by the town plus 15 percent. During his review of the final plat, the subdivision administrator may appoint a registered land surveyor to confirm the accuracy of the final plat. If any error is found which exceeds five percent of the figures shown on the proposed final plat, the costs of the review shall be charged to the subdivider. The subdivision administrator shall note his comments regarding the proposed final plat and the costs of the review, which shall be paid by the subdivider before the final plat approval of the town council. 
(2)  The planning board shall recommend approval, conditional approval with modifications to bring the plat into compliance, or disapproval of the final plat with reasons within 31 days of its first consideration of the proposed final plat. 
(3)  If the planning board recommends approval of the final plat, it shall transmit all copies of the plat and its written recommendations to the town council, through the subdivision administrator. 
(4)  If the planning board recommends conditional approval of the proposed final plat with modifications to bring the plat into compliance, it shall retain one print of the plat for its minutes, and return its recommendations and one copy of the plat to the subdivider, and transmit one copy of the plat and its written recommendations to the town council through the subdivision administrator. The town council may consider the proposed final plat on its own motion or at the request of the subdivider, at which time the council may consider the proposed final plat, and the modifications recommended by the planning board. 
(5)  If the planning board recommends disapproval of the final plat, it shall instruct the subdivider concerning the resubmission of a revised plat and the subdivider may make such changes as will bring the plat into compliance with the provisions of this chapter, and resubmit same for reconsideration by the planning board, or may appeal the decision to the town council. 
(6)  In the event the planning board fails to make a written recommendation to the town council within the time specified in this section, the subdivider may apply to the town council for approval of the proposed final plat. 
(7)  If the planning board recommends approval or conditional approval with modifications to bring the proposed final plat into compliance, or the subdivider appeals to the town council, the town council shall review and approve or disapprove the proposed final plat within 31 days after the proposed final plat is considered by the town council at a town council meeting. 
(8)  If the town council approves the final plat, such approval shall be shown on each copy of the plat by the signed certificate specified in subsection (d)(13) of this section. 
(9)  The developer/owner shall submit to the subdivision administrator mylars of the final plat approved by the town council within five days of council approval. The subdivision administrator will have 14 days thereafter to review the mylars to be signed by the mayor and recorded at the county register of deeds. 
(10)  The mayor shall not execute any mylars without first obtaining written certification from the subdivision administrator that the mylars are identical to those approved by the town council. 
(11)  In the event the mylars submitted are not identical to the final plat approved by the town council, the subdivision administrator shall report same to the mayor, who shall place the matter on the agenda for the next town council meeting for town council review. 
(12)  Upon receipt of the report of the subdivision administrator, the town council may, in its absolute discretion: 
a.  Request review of the mylars by the town planning board and resubmittal to the council for review and approval; or 
b.  Review the mylars and determine they are in substantial conformity with the final plat previously approved by the council and that the lots depicted on the mylars are in full compliance with chapter 58.

(16)  The subdivider shall file the approved final plat within 90 days of approval; otherwise such approval shall be null and void, and the subdivider must begin the procedure for approval from the sketch plan stage, with payment of the required fee. 
(e)  Final plat for conservation subdivisions. Final plats shall conform to the approved preliminary plat, including any conditions placed on the preliminary plat by the town council. In addition to all other information required for final plats outlined in subsections (a)-(f) of this section and section 46-46, the final plat for a conservation subdivision shall be accompanied by the following information, and where the requirements of subsections (a)-(f) of this section and section 46-46 and this chapter conflict, the requirements of this section shall control for conservation subdivisions: 
(1)  An existing resources and site analysis plan shall be submitted if it differs with that which was submitted for sketch plan approval. 
(2)  The maintenance plan and maintenance agreement that shows how all conservation lands will be owned and managed in accordance with subsection 58-58(4)i. 
(3)  All conservation lands developed per section 46-44 shall be recorded at the county register of deeds in their entirety concurrent with the initial recordation of the final plat. 
(4)  Prior to the issuance of any zoning permits for lots located within the subdivision, the conservation easement shall be recorded and deeded to either the homeowners' association, conservation organization, and/or other easement holders as specified in the maintenance plans and maintenance agreement, as described in subsection 58-58(4)i. Proof of such recording shall be required prior to the issuance of any zoning permits. 
(f)  Addresses and cluster mailboxes. 
(1)  Final plats must include the location of cluster mailbox units (CBU) to serve all the lots included on the plat. The plat must also include a note stating that all CBU locations will be approved by the USPS. If the roadways on the plat are labeled as public rights-of-way, then the plat must also include a note stating that all CBU locations must be approved by NCDOT. 
(2)  The applicant may request an address for the property following final plat approval. All addresses will be assigned by the Union County Tax Administrator's office. 
(3)  Every lot shall display the distinctive house number assigned to that lot by Union County and recognized by Union County Emergency Services. The individual house number shall be no less than four inches in height and shall be in a contrasting color to the background. The house number shall be displayed in one of the following fashions: 
a.  If the number is displayed on a house, the number shall be placed upon the front of the house in such a position as to remain plainly visible to all traffic coming to the premises from either direction, or 
b.  If a house is more than 100 feet from the roadway or is not clearly visible from the roadway, the number shall be displayed within 50 feet of the roadway, and on a surface that is plainly visible to all traffic coming to the premises from either direction.

(Ord. No. 04-09-13, 401, 9-13-2004) 
Sec. 46-73. - Suitability of land. 
(a)  Land which has been determined by the town council on the basis of engineering or other expert surveys to pose an ascertainable danger to life or property by reason of its unsuitability for the use proposed shall not be platted for that purpose, unless and until the subdivider has taken the necessary measures to correct said conditions and to eliminate said dangers. 
(b)  Areas that have been used for disposal of solid waste shall not be subdivided unless tests by a structural engineer and a soils expert determine that the land is suitable for the proposed development. 
(c)  All subdivision proposals shall be consistent with the need to minimize flood damage. 
(d)  All subdivision proposals shall have public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical and water systems, if available, located and constructed to minimize flood damage. 
(Ord. No. 04-09-13, § 402, 9-13-2004) 
Sec. 46-74. - Subdivision and street naming. 
    The name of the subdivision and the names of the streets within the subdivision shall not duplicate or closely approximate the name of an existing subdivision or any existing streets within the county. 
(Ord. No. 04-09-13, § 403, 9-13-2004) 
Sec. 46-75. - Subdivision design. 
(a)  Blocks. 
(1)  The lengths, widths, and shapes of blocks shall be determined with due regard to provision of adequate building sites suitable to the special needs of the type of use contemplated, zoning requirements, needs for vehicular and pedestrian circulation, control and safety of street traffic, limitations and opportunities of topography, and convenient access to water areas. 
(2)  Blocks shall not be less than 400 feet or more than 1,500 feet in length. Where a longer block will reduce the number of railroad grade crossings, major stream crossings, or where blocks will result in less traffic through residential subdivisions from adjoining business areas, the town council may authorize block lengths in excess of 1,500 feet. 
(3)  Blocks shall have sufficient width to allow two rows of lots of minimum depth except where single row lots are required to separate residential development from through vehicular traffic or another type of use, in nonresidential subdivisions, or where abutting a water area. 
(b)  Lot dimensions. 
(1)  All lots in new subdivisions shall conform to the zoning requirements of the district in which the subdivision is located. Conformance to zoning requirements means, among other things, that the smallest lot in the subdivision must meet all area and dimensional requirements of chapter 58. 
(2)  Orientation of residential lot lines. 
a.  Side lot lines shall be substantially at right angles or radial to street lines. 
b.  Double frontage lots shall be avoided wherever possible. 
(3)  Panhandle lots and other irregular shaped lots may be approved in cases where such lots would not be contrary to the purpose of this chapter, heighten the desirability of the subdivision, and, where necessary, enable a lot to be served by water and/or a waste disposal system. All panhandle lots shall have a minimum road frontage width of 35 feet thereby providing an access strip to the lot. The length of said strip shall not exceed 200 feet. Said strip shall not be used to determine lot area or width or setback lines. 
(4)  All minimum lot dimensions may be increased in order to meet any applicable requirements of the appropriate county health department. 
(5)  Lots within floodplains shall not be approved for recordation unless the following provisions are met: 
a.  Lots wholly subject to flooding. No proposed residential building lot that is wholly subject to flooding, as defined herein, shall be approved. 
b.  Lots partially subject to flooding. 
1.  No proposed residential building lot that is partially subject to flooding as defined herein shall be approved unless there is established on the lot plan a contour line representing an elevation no lower than two feet above the base flood line as defined in section 58-229. All buildings or structures designed or intended for residential purposes shall be located on such a lot such that the lowest useable and functional part of the structure shall not be below the elevation of the base flood line, plus two feet. 
2.  For the purpose of this subsection, the term "useable and functional part of structure" shall be defined as being inclusive of living areas, basements, sunken dens, basement, utility rooms, crawl spaces, attached carports, garages and mechanical appurtenances such as furnaces, air conditioners, water pumps, electrical conduits, and wiring, but shall not include water lines or sanitary sewer traps, piping and cleanouts; provided that openings for same serving the structure are above the base flood line. 
3.  Where only a portion of the proposed lot is subject to flooding as defined herein, such lot may be approved only if there will be available for building a usable lot area of not less than 5,000 square feet. The useable lot area shall be determined by deducting from the total lot area, the area of all yard setbacks required by the applicable zoning regulations and any remaining area of the lot lying within the area of the base flood (100-year flood) as shown on the Flood Boundary and Floodway Map described in section 58-229. 
(c)  Easements. Easements shall be provided as follows: 
(1)  Utility easements. A utility easement of not less than five feet in width shall be provided to the side and rear of each lot and in other locations where deemed necessary. This requirement may be waived by the subdivision administrator if the subdivider can certify on the final record plat where accommodations for such utilities are to be located. Lots in minor subdivisions are exempt from this requirement upon certification that they may be serviced by existing utilities along the public rights-of-way. Wider easement widths may be required if determined necessary by the utility company involved. 
(2)  Drainage easements. Where a subdivision is traversed by a stream or drainageway, an easement shall be provided conforming with the lines of such a stream and shall be of sufficient width as will be adequate for the purpose and in accordance with section 58-520. Other drainage easements may be required for the proper drainage of all lots. 
(3)  Access easements. Private and recorded easements created according to subsection 46-76(a) that provide access from an easement lot to a public road. 
(Ord. No. 04-09-13, § 404, 9-13-2004; Ord. No. O-2004-21, 9-13-2004; Ord. No. O-2014-17, 12-8-2014) 
Sec. 46-76. - Road standards and buffering along thoroughfares. 
(a)  Public roads. 
(1)  All subdivision lots, except as provided herein and in section 58-10, shall abut public roads. All public roads shall be built to the design criteria and construction standards of the state department of transportation and the town for subdivision roads. Streets which are not eligible to be put on the state department of transportation system because there are too few lots or residences shall, nevertheless, be offered for dedication to the public and shall be designed and constructed in accordance with the above-referenced standards. A written maintenance agreement with provision for maintenance of the street until it is accepted as part of the state system shall be included in the final plat. 
(2)  Exceptions to the public road frontage requirements shall be as follows: Any lot or tract shall be allowed to have easement lots created for construction of single-family dwellings as the principal use. Creation of such lots is made necessary by virtue of the fact that development of said property by conventional means (i.e., extension of public street) is impractical due to the disproportionate costs of required improvements as compared to the relative value of lots created and is within the spirit and intent of this chapter. These lots shall be created as follows: 
a.  The applicant shall submit an application to the planning board with a sketch plat showing the proposed easement lots for approval to proceed further as specified in this section. 
b.  All access easements shall be at least 45 feet in width and shall meet or exceed the state department of transportation minimum standards for subdivision road width where possible. The travel surface of said easement shall be at least 16 feet in width. The travel surface need not be paved. The easement shall be maintained at all times in a condition that is passable for service and emergency vehicles. 
c.  The creation of easement lots shall follow the procedures of a minor subdivision as outlined in section 46-40. In addition, a statement shall be placed on the subdivision plat acknowledging that said lots were being created upon a privately maintained and recorded easement, and a statement indicating the parties responsible for maintaining the easement. 
d.  Creation of such easement lots and access easements shall not impair future extension of an adequate system of public streets to serve such lots. 
e.  Easement lots shall not be further subdivided unless the newly created lots abut a public road. Any additional subdivision of easement lots shall be a major subdivision and shall be reviewed using the major subdivision plat approval process. 
f.  If public road access becomes available to easement lots, all affected lot owners shall have the easement terminated of record. 
(b)  Subdivision street disclosure statement. All streets shown on the final plat shall be designated in accordance with G.S. 136-102.6 and designated as a public street and shall be conclusively presumed an offer of dedication to the public. Where streets are dedicated to the public but not accepted into a municipal or the state system before lots are sold, a statement explaining the status of the street shall be included with the final plat. 
(c)  Marginal access street. Where a tract of land to be subdivided adjoins a major or minor thoroughfare as designated on the town zoning map, the subdivider shall be required by the town council to provide a marginal access street parallel to the major thoroughfare or reverse frontage on a minor street for the lots to be developed adjacent to the major thoroughfare. Where reverse frontage is established, private driveways shall be prevented from having direct access to the thoroughfare. In cases where it is not feasible or practical for the subdivider to provide a marginal access street, or when the town council determines that the installation of a marginal access would result in a less desirable subdivision design, the town council may grant an exception to the requirement for a marginal access street. In granting said exception the town council shall find that the spirit and intent of this chapter are preserved and that circumstances particular to the subject property, such as topography or shape of the tract, exist to warrant the exception. 
(d)  Buffering along thoroughfares. 
(1)  Where side and rear lot lines abut along a thoroughfare as defined in the Weddington Roadway Standards, the subdivider shall provide a natural buffer between the lot lines paralleling the thoroughfare and the thoroughfare road right-of-way. The natural buffer shall materially screen all principal and accessory uses from public view from the thoroughfare. The buffer shall consist of a natural planting or a berm with natural planting. Any walls, fences or other constructed devices shall be allowed within the buffer area, and shall be approved by the zoning administrator. 
(2)  The subdivider is encouraged to propose the use of existing natural vegetation and/or topography or a combination of existing features as prescribed in this section when the purpose and intent of this section can be met with such methods. 
(3)  Such screening shall be located on the property with the use with which it is associated or required, and shall materially screen the subject use from the view of the adjoining properties. Screening shall be in the form of all natural material, including brick with no exposed cement block. When screening is in the form of natural vegetation, a buffer strip at least ten feet wide shall be planted. This strip shall be free of all encroachments by building, parking areas or impervious coverage. 
(4)  The buffer requirement is 100 feet for subdivisions, which is the minimum distance separation from the edge of the road right-of-way. Table 46-76 lists the required planting of trees and shrubs within this buffer. If the required buffer exceeds 15 percent of the total acreage of the parcel, the zoning administrator may reduce the required buffer to an amount equal to 15 percent.

(5)  Any fence or wall shall be permitted with the following standards: 
a.  Constructed in a durable fashion of brick, stone, other masonry materials or wood posts and planks or metal or other materials specifically designed as fencing materials, or any combination thereof as may be approved by the zoning administrator. No more than 25 percent of the fence surface shall be left open, and the finished side of the fence shall face the abutting property. A chainlink fence with plastic, metal or wooden slats may not be used when abutting residential uses and districts; 
b.  Walls and fences shall be a minimum height of six feet. 
(6)  Required trees and shrubs within the buffer shall meet the following standards: 
a.  Forty percent of the required trees within the buffer shall be large mature trees; 
b.  All trees shall have a minimum caliper of two inches measured six inches above ground at the time of planting; 
c.  Shrubs shall be evergreen and at least three feet tall when planted with the average height of six feet in three to four years. However, 25 percent of the shrubs may vary from the above standard. The allowed variations are as follows: 
1.  Shrubs may be deciduous; 
2.  Shrubs may be two feet tall when planted, provided an average height of three to four feet is expected as normal growth within four years; 
3.  Shrubs planted on a berm may be of lesser height, provided the combined height of the berm and plantings is at least eight feet after four years; 
d.  Shrubs and trees shall be on the approved plant list in appendix 1 to chapter 58; 
e.  All specifications for the measurement, quality, and installation of trees and shrubs shall be in accordance with the American Standards for Nursery Stock, published by the American Association of Nurserymen, and free of disease; and 
f.  Twenty-five percent of all trees will be evergreen. 
(7)  Landscaping buffers will have an arrangement of trees and shrubs in the buffer area, which shall be done in a manner that provides a visual separation between abutting land uses. Shrubs shall be massed in rows or groups to achieve the maximum screening effect. Guidelines for the arrangement of plant material are illustrated in table 46-76. 
(8)  In the event that it can be demonstrated that existing vegetation meets the intent of this section, but the plant materials are not on the approved list, the zoning administrator may waive the requirements for plant materials. If a plant material is not on the approved list, the zoning administrator may determine whether it is acceptable. 
(9)  Berms may be used as screening provided such berms are at least six feet in height with a maximum slope of 4:1 as measured from the exterior property line. 
a.  Berms shall be stabilized to prevent erosion and landscaped; and 
b.  If a berm is constructed, shrubs are required but the number may be reduced by 25 percent. However, constructing a berm does not modify the number of trees required. 
(10)  Required buffers shall not be disturbed for any reason except for required driveways, sidewalks, or other pedestrian or bicycle paths, walls, fences, or required landscaping, landscaping maintenance or replacement, or maintenance and construction of berms, or utility lines. However, utility line construction must meet the following requirements: 
a.  The removal of any tree larger than six inches caliper or any dogwood or redbud larger than two inches in caliper shall require the approval of the zoning administrator; 
b.  No utility easements shall run longitudinally within a buffer yard. 
(11)  To the extent possible, the path cleared for the utility lines shall be replaced with plant materials which are consistent with those that existed prior in the buffer yard. 
(12)  In no case shall the plant species of Pueraria lobata (Kudzu) be used for planting with the buffer. 
(13)  The developer shall be required to replace any plant material which has not remained viable or has failed to stabilize the soil through two consecutive growing seasons. 
(14)  All buffers shall be constructed in a manner that shall allow for adequate sight distance where subdivision streets intersect with the thoroughfare. 
(15)  If utilities are located within the buffer yard, then the right-of-way width must be added to the total buffer width, in addition to the required width in table 46-76. This additional buffer width can be added into the calculated lot area. 
(16)  If above ground utilities are to remain in the buffer yard, then all landscaping, including the location of a berm, must be located as follows: 
a.  Overhead . Trees next to power lines shall be planted using the table below. The measurement shall be made from the nearest edge of the tree trunk. 
Distance from power line Tree specification 40 feet or greater Any tree listed in appendix I 18 feet or greater Small maturing trees listed in appendix I. However, trees marked with an asterisk (*) shall not be located within the utility right-of-way. 0-18 feet Shrubs with a mature height of less than 20 feet.  
b.  Underground. Roots planted near underground utility or power lines may be damaged in the event that repairs are required. Utmost care shall be taken when planting new trees and when carrying out any excavation work near trees. 
(17)  The area of the buffer shall be in addition to the lot area as required by chapter 58, and all setbacks as prescribed in chapter 58 shall be measured from the nearest edge of the buffer to any structure of the lot. The buffer area shall become part of the lot on which it is located, or, in the case of commonly-owned property, shall be deeded to the homeowner's association. 
(18)  The preliminary plat shall be accompanied by a statement providing for buffer area permanent maintenance by a method acceptable to the town. Maintenance of the buffer by the town shall not be an acceptable method. 
(e)  Access to adjacent properties. Where it is deemed desirable by the town council, proposed streets shall be extended by dedication to the boundary of such property and a temporary turnaround provided. 
(f)  Street design and standards. Minimum street right-of-way and pavement widths, as well as other engineering design standards shall be in accordance with the minimum design criteria for subdivision roads as established from time to time, by the division of highways, state department of transportation publication entitled "Subdivision Roads: Minimum Construction Standards", except where modified by the Town of Weddington Roadway Standards. 
(g)  Culs-de-sac. 
(1)  Permanent dead-end streets shall not exceed 600 feet in length in conventional subdivisions unless necessitated by topography or property accessibility and if the town council grants a modification per section 46-15. In conservation subdivisions, culs-de-sac may be greater than 600 feet in length in order to prevent the degradation and development of primary and secondary lands within the subdivision, thereby conserving the integrity of the conservation subdivision by preserving open space in an unaltered state. Culs-de-sac in conservation subdivisions shall not inhibit emergency vehicular access. The planning board shall review the sketch plan and existing resource and site analysis plan for a conservation subdivision that proposes culs-de-sac greater than 600 feet in length. Measurement shall be from the point where the centerline of the dead-end street intersects with the center of a through street to the center of the turnaround of the cul-de-sac.

Sec. 58-5. - Zoning districts established. 
    In order to achieve the purpose of this chapter, the following districts, based on the concepts and proposals of the land development plan of the town, are hereby established. In addition to the primary uses which are permitted by right or through the issuance of a conditional zoning permit, other uses, including accessory uses, off-street parking and signs, are permitted as listed in this chapter: 
(1)  R residential districts. These districts are established to encourage the retention of existing farms and low density residential areas, which are compatible with the land development plan concept of retaining the suburban, rural character of the community. Residential development must be restricted to a sufficiently low density since there is no public water supply and development is dependent upon septic tanks on individual lots for sewage disposal. In order to provide for a healthful, rural environment, residential development must continue in a large lot, low density fashion. 
a.  R-80 single-family and agricultural. This district allows for agricultural uses and single-family residential development. The minimum lot size is 80,000 square feet. 
b.  R-60 single-family and agricultural. This district allows for agricultural uses and single-family development. The minimum lot size is 60,000 square feet. 
c.  R-40 single-family and agricultural. This district allows for agricultural uses and single-family residential development. The minimum lot size is 40,000 square feet. 
d.  R-40(D) two-family development. This district allows duplexes on lots with a minimum size of 40,000 square feet. This district was established to regulate one specific geographical area in the town. Since the area has been developed recently and contains a number of duplexes, the town does not want to label the area with a nonconforming status. However, in adhering to the policies and goals contained in the land development plan, the town has no intention of creating any other duplex districts elsewhere in the town. The concern with this type of residential development is that the higher density is in conflict with the low density and single-family character of the town. 
e.  R-CD residential conservation district. The purpose of this district is to promote conservation subdivisions and encourage the preservation of open space and unique environmental features in the town, including, but not limited to, viewsheds, forestland, farmland, historic sites, steep slopes, rock formations and land adjacent to parks. Incentives are included in the R-CD district to encourage conservation subdivisions in the future by allowing residential lot sizes smaller than those found in other zoning districts in the town. 
f.  R-E residential district. This district allows single-family residential development with a minimum lot size of 20,000 square feet. This district is established to regulate subdivisions that are annexed by the town and do not meet any existing zoning district. Since these lots are existing, the town does not want to label the area as nonconforming. However, in adhering to the policies and goals contained in the land development plan, the town has no intention of creating any other of these districts elsewhere in the town. The concern with this type of residential development is that the higher density is in conflict with the low density character of the town. 
(2)  B business districts. These districts were established before conditional zoning was available for use by municipalities. The town has no intention of creating any other of these districts elsewhere in the town. Conditional zoning districts are available for future retail, commercial and business. 
a.  B-1 general business district. 
1.  This district is established to provide an area for neighborhood business without undue conflict with, detriment to, or disruption from nearby land uses or zoning districts. 
2.  This district is designed primarily for retailing of merchandise such as groceries, drugs and household items for furnishing certain personal, business, and professional services for the convenience of residents of the town area. This district is located at an accessible location with respect to traffic circulation in order to conveniently serve the resident population. All permitted uses locating in the B-1 district shall have a maximum gross floor area of 3,000 square feet. Uses otherwise permitted within this zone which exceed a gross floor area of 3,000 square feet may be permitted on a conditional zoning basis only. 
b.  B-2 local shopping center district. This district is established to provide for the controlled development of more intense retail and service uses designed to serve the immediate town area. Certain uses will be permitted on an individual use basis only. The purposes of a planned local shopping center district is to provide for an orderly arrangement of convenience and comparison shopping outlets and adequate off-street parking and other amenities. However, local shopping centers are allowed in this district only on a conditional use basis. This zone is not shown on the zoning map of the town at the time of the adoption of the ordinance from which this chapter is derived. 
(3)  Conditional zoning district. 
a.  The conditional zoning district process allows for the establishment of certain uses that, because of their nature or scale, have particular impacts on both the immediate area and the community as a whole. The development of these uses cannot be predetermined or controlled by general district standards. In order to accommodate these uses, this section establishes specific development standards for these uses that allows for flexibility in development while protecting existing nearby areas. The process for approval of a conditional zoning district is explained in section 58-271. The rezoning of any parcel of land to a conditional district should be a voluntary process initiated by the property owner. Any application to rezone an area to a conditional zoning district shall be reviewed in light of the goals, objectives and implementation strategies of the town land use plan and all other plans and regulations officially adopted by the town council. The review process established in this part provides for the accommodation of such uses by a reclassification of property into a conditional zoning district, subject to specific conditions which ensure compatibility of the use with the use and enjoyment of neighboring properties and in accordance with the general plans of development of the town. 
b.  B-1(CD) general business district. The B-1(CD) general business district is hereby established as a conditional zoning district. The B-1(CD) district is intended to provide an area for a neighborhood business without undue conflict with, detriment to, or destruction from nearby land uses or zoning districts. These districts were established before conditional zoning was available for use by municipalities. The town has no intention of creating any other of these districts elsewhere in the town. Conditional zoning districts are available for future retail, commercial and business. Any development or redevelopment occurring after August 1, 2010, shall comply with MX development standards. 
This district is designed primarily for retailing of merchandise such as groceries, drugs and household items for furnishing certain personal, business, and professional services for the convenience of residents of the town area. This district is located at an accessible location with respect to traffic circulation in order to conveniently serve the resident population. 
c.  B-2(CD) local shopping center district. The B-2(CD) local shopping center district is hereby established to provide for the controlled development of more intense retail and service uses designed to serve the immediate town area. Certain uses will be permitted on an individual use basis. The purpose of a planned local shopping center district is to provide for an orderly arrangement of convenience and comparison shopping outlets and adequate off-street parking and other amenities. These districts were established before conditional zoning was available for use by municipalities. The town has no intention of creating any other of these districts elsewhere in the town. Conditional zoning districts are available for future retail, commercial and business. Any development or redevelopment occurring after August 1, 2010, shall comply with MX development standards. 
d.  MX mixed-use district. The MX mixed-use district is hereby established as a conditional zoning district. The MX mixed-use district is intended as a limited use district with a very high level of design control including both site and building features. It is designed to allow a variety of office, commercial and limited residential uses only in carefully considered locations requiring a high level of design control by the town. Each site proposed for MX mixed-use district zoning must be evaluated by the town council as to its appropriateness for such designated use. Factors to be taken into consideration include, but are not limited to, accessibility, surrounding uses, site design including building arrangement, aesthetics, signage, height, size and elevation design, traffic impact within the proposed development and the surrounding service area including vehicular and pedestrian circulation and parking area design and location, setbacks, buffer effectiveness and stormwater management. It is the intent of the district to encourage high quality design and innovative arrangement of buildings, parking and open space. Because of the nature of all the factors listed, the approval of a location for the MX mixed-use district is at the sole discretion of the town council and in no way implies that any other site will be found acceptable for similar designation. 
(4)  E-D educational district. This district is established to provide for the specific circumstances and needs of the educational institutions, (limited to elementary, middle and high school) within the town's jurisdiction. The uses permitted within this district shall be limited to those of an educational nature for the necessary operation of the educational institutions. Requirements specific to this district are listed in article II, section 58-61 of this Code. Discontinuation of any school shall result in the loss of the educational district zoning and will initiate a rezoning back to the original zoning district. Additionally, discontinuation of any school after five years will require the property owner to remove the buildings.

(Ord. No. 87-04-08, § 4.1, 4-8-1987) 
Sec. 58-8. - Screening and landscaping. 
(a)  Screening required by any of the following or by any other section of this chapter shall be provided in accordance with the following standards: 
(1)  Such screening shall be located on the property with the use with which it is associated or required, and shall materially screen the subject use from the view of the adjoining properties. Screening shall be in the form of all natural material, including brick with no exposed cement block. When screening is in the form of natural vegetation, a buffer strip at least ten feet wide shall be planted. This strip shall be free of all encroachments by building, parking areas or impervious coverage. 
(2)  Buffer requirements include a given minimum distance separation from the property line and required planting trees and shrubs within the buffer. The minimum buffer requirements, which are based on the size of the lot, shall be as listed in the following table:

*The minimum width of a buffer may be reduced by an additional 20 percent if a fence or wall is constructed in accordance with these regulations. 
ft = feet 
(3)  The width of the buffer may be reduced by 20 percent if a wall or fence is provided that meets the following standards: 
a.  Any fence or wall shall be constructed in a durable fashion of brick, stone, other masonry materials, or wood posts and planks, or metal or other materials specifically designed as fencing materials, or any combination thereof as may be approved by the zoning administrator. No more than 25 percent of the fence surface shall be left open, and the finished side of the fence shall face the abutting property. A chainlink fence with plastic, metal or wooden slats may not be used to satisfy the requirements of this section when abutting residential uses and districts; 
b.  Walls and fences shall be a minimum height of six feet; 
(4)  Required trees and shrubs within the buffer shall meet the following standards: 
a.  Forty percent of the required trees within the buffer shall be large mature trees; 
b.  All trees shall have a minimum caliper of two inches measured six inches above ground at the time of planting; 
c.  Shrubs shall be evergreen and at least three feet tall when planted with the average height of six feet in three to four years. However, 25 percent of the shrubs may vary from this standard. The allowed variations are as follows: 
1.  Shrubs may be deciduous; 
2.  Shrubs may be two feet tall when planted, provided an average height of three to four feet is expected as normal growth within four years; or 
3.  Shrubs planted on a berm may be of lesser height, provided the combined height of the berm and plantings is at least eight feet after four years. 
d.  Shrubs and trees shall be on the approved plant list in appendix I to chapter 58; 
e.  All specifications for the measurement, quality, and installation of trees and shrubs shall be in accordance with the American Standards for Nursery Stock published by the American Association of Nurserymen, and shall be free of disease; and 
f.  Twenty-five percent of all trees will be evergreen. 
(5)  Landscaping buffers will have an arrangement of trees and shrubs in the buffer area, which shall be done in a manner that provides a visual separation between abutting land uses. Shrubs shall be massed in rows or groups to achieve the maximum screening effect. Guidelines for the arrangement of plant material are illustrated in table 58-8. 
(6)  In the event that it can be demonstrated that existing vegetation meets the intent of this section, but the plant materials are not on the approved list, the zoning administrator may waive the requirements for plant materials. If a plant material is not on the approved list, the zoning administrator may determine whether it is acceptable. 
(7)  Berms may be used as screening, provided such berms are at least six feet in height with a maximum slope of 4:1, as measured from the exterior property line. 
a.  Berms shall be stabilized to prevent erosion and landscaped; and 
b.  If a berm is constructed, shrubs are required but the number may be reduced by 25 percent. However, constructing a berm does not modify the number of trees required. 
(8)  Required buffers shall not be disturbed for any reason except for required driveways, sidewalks, or other pedestrian or bicycle paths, walls, fences, or required landscaping, landscaping maintenance or replacement, or maintenance and construction of berms, or utility lines. However, utility line construction must meet the following requirements: 
a.  The removal of any tree larger than six inches in caliper or any dogwood or redbud larger than two inches in caliper shall require the approval of the zoning administrator; 
b.  No utility easements shall run longitudinally within a buffer yard. 
(9)  To the extent possible, the path cleared for the utility lines shall be replaced with plant materials which are consistent with those that existed prior in the buffer yard. 
(10)  In no case shall the plant species of Pueraria lobata (Kudzu) be used for planting with the buffer. 
(11)  The developer shall be required to replace any plant material which has not remained viable or has failed to stabilize the soil through two consecutive growing seasons. 
(12)  All buffers shall be constructed in a manner that shall allow for adequate sight distance where subdivision streets intersect with the thoroughfare. 
(13)  If utilities are located within the buffer yard, then the right-of-way width must be added to the total buffer width, in addition to the required width in table 58-8. This additional buffer width can be added into the calculated lot area. 
(14)  If aboveground utilities are to remain in the buffer yard, then all landscaping, including the location of a berm, must be located as follows: 
a.  Overhead. Trees next to power lines shall be planted using the table below. The measurement shall be made from the nearest edge of the tree trunk. 
Distance from power line Tree specification 40 feet or greater Any tree listed in appendix I 18 feet or greater Small maturing trees listed in appendix I. However, except trees as marked with an asterisk (*) shall not be located within the utility right-of-way. 0-18 feet Shrubs with a mature height of less than 20 feet.  
b.  Underground. Roots planted near underground utility or power lines may be damaged in the event that repairs are required. Utmost care shall be taken when planting new trees and when carrying out any excavation work near trees. 
(b)  Business and commercial uses adjacent to residential zoning shall provide screening to materially screen the subject use from the view of the adjoining residential zoning district. 
(c)  Off-street parking and loading facilities and dumpsters adjacent to residential zoning or located in a residential district shall provide screening. 
(d)  For open-air storage, or an unenclosed structure within 100 feet of a road, consisting of a roof, but no walls, used for storage of materials, products, wastes or equipment associated with business or certain conditional uses, screening shall be provided. Such screening may be located anywhere on the subject property, provided the storage is effectively screened. 
(e)  The screening provisions of this section shall be minimum screening standards required for the issuance of a conditional use permit as provided in article III of this chapter; provided, however, that the town council may impose additional reasonable screening requirements as a condition for awarding a conditional use permit as the town council considers necessary to protect the public health, safety and welfare in accordance with the purpose and intent of this chapter. 
(f)  In cases where screening is required by this chapter and devices such as existing vegetation or topographical features or extreme size of the tract involved would render the installation of screening unnecessary, the zoning administrator is hereby empowered to accept the existing features as meeting the general requirements. Such decision shall be based on the spirit and intent of this section. If, at any time after existing topographical features or size of the lot are thereafter altered so as to render them inadequate as screening, the owner of the land shall be required to provide screening as described in this section to achieve the required screen. The vacancy or nonuse of adjacent property shall not negate the necessity for installation of screening. 
(g)  Subsections (a)-(f) of this section shall be construed to require screening alongside property lines and/or rear property lines adjacent to residential zoning, but in no case shall screening be required along a public street, except as provided in subsections (c) and (d) of this section. 
(h)  Uses permitted within the business districts shall provide street trees as landscaping along the front property line, along the side street property line on a corner lot, and at the rear property line when the rear property line lies directly across the street from a residential district. Such trees shall be installed in accordance with the following standards: 
(1)  Such trees may be evergreen or deciduous. 
(2)  Such trees shall be a minimum of four feet high at planting. 
(3)  The maximum spacing between trees shall be 30 feet. 
(i)  Such trees shall when possible be located behind the right-of-way of the street. When it is necessary to locate landscaping required by this section on the right-of-way of a state-maintained road, an encroachment agreement shall be obtained from the state department of transportation. Consideration should be given to the alignment of trees or shrubs installed on an adjoining lot and when possible the alignment should be continued along the street. Encroachment into the sight distance area as defined in section 58-12 shall be allowed subject to the requirement that landscaping installed within a sight distance shall be set back as far as is practicable from the intersection of the two streets forming the intersection and shall not be of a height to interfere with sight distance. 
(j)  In cases where existing trees on a lot or lots are located within the required setback, and where existing trees would inhibit or restrict the growth of street trees required by this section, the zoning administrator may authorize that low growing shrubbery be installed in lieu of trees. Such shrubs shall adhere to the locational requirements stated in subsections (g) and (h) of this section. 
(k)  Essential services, classes I, II, III, IV, shall be naturally screened on all sides in compliance with the screening and landscaping provisions of this section.

The permit shall be issued for a one-year period and may be renewed by the zoning administrator on an annual basis, provided the construction has proceeded in a diligent manner. Renewal shall take place during the renewal window prescribed in the Town of Weddington Annual Enforcement Manual. Failure to renew the permit may result in enforcement and penalties described in section 58-3. 
(3)  Any use of a temporary nature (i.e., less than 45 days in duration and held no more than four times per year at any particular location) which would not otherwise be permitted in a particular zoning district and which will materially affect normal activities (i.e., increased traffic, noise, etc.) may be issued a temporary use permit as herein provided. The applicant shall complete and submit an application and a fee, in accordance with a fee schedule adopted by the town council. 
a.  The zoning administrator may grant a temporary use permit for the following temporary uses: Sales for civic, charitable and nonprofit organizations, i.e., Christmas tree sales. The permit shall be valid for a specified period only, not to exceed 45 days in duration. 
b.  The planning board may issue a temporary use permit for all other temporary uses including public events such as festivals, concerts, carnivals, circuses, etc., only after a public hearing has been conducted as follows: 
1.  Notices shall be sent by the town by first class mail to the applicant and to owners of all contiguous pieces of property and to all other property owners whose properties lie within 200 feet of any portion of the property in question at least ten days prior to the public hearing.

3.  A sign shall also be placed by the town in a conspicuous location on the subject properties indicating the nature of the public hearing and date, time and place at which it is to occur. Said sign shall be placed on the properties in question at least ten days prior to the public hearing. 
4.  Before issuing any temporary use permit, the zoning administrator and/or planning board shall make the following determinations: 
(i)  That the proposed temporary use will not materially endanger the public health, welfare and safety; 
(ii)  That the proposed temporary use will not have a substantial negative effect on adjoining properties; 
(iii)  That the proposed temporary use is in harmony with the general purpose and intent of this chapter and preserves its spirit; and 
(iv)  The proposed temporary use is held no more than four times per year at any particular location. 
In addition, the planning board may authorize conditions regarding duration of the use, hours of operation, signage, lighting, temporary structures, etc., and such conditions shall be made part of the temporary use permit issued. Violations of such conditions shall be considered a violation of this chapter. 
c.  The decision of the planning board may be appealed by the applicant to the town council. The decision of the zoning administrator may be appealed by the applicant to the board of adjustment pursuant to article VIII of this chapter. A written application for town council review shall be submitted to the zoning administrator within seven days of the planning board decision. 
(4)  Structures, whether temporary or permanent, located in a subdivision, and used as sales offices for the subdivision development are permitted only with a permit granted pursuant to this section. The zoning administrator shall issue such permit for a period of one year. An extension of up to one additional year may be granted by the zoning administrator, provided that the development is being actively marketed and three or more residential lots within the subdivision remain to be sold by the developer. Following this initial extension period, the permit may be extended only within the discretion of the town council and only for a period of time the town council deems appropriate, provided the subdivision is being actively marketed and three or more residential lots within the subdivision remain to be sold by the developer. Renewal shall take place during the renewal window prescribed in the Town of Weddington Annual Enforcement Manual. Failure to renew the permit may result in enforcement and penalties described in section 58-3. After the developer sells all lots within the subdivision, or after any permit granted under this section expires, whichever occurs first, the temporary structures shall be removed, and any permanent structures temporarily used as a sales office shall be used only for a purpose otherwise permitted in that district. After a permit issued under this section expires, no other permits under this section may be issued for that same subdivision unless approved by the town council. For purposes of this section, having a sales office within a subdivision, by itself, shall not constitute "actively marketing" the subdivision.

(1)  That the mobile home is an accessory use to the principal residential use; 
(2)  That the mobile home will be placed on the lot on a temporary basis;

(9)  That the granting of the CUP will not materially endanger the public health, safety and welfare. 
(b)  In addition to the requirements of subsection (a) of this section, the following shall apply:

(2)  The CUP may be renewed prior to the expiration date with proper application to and approval by the town council when the hardship warranting the original permit remains and is verified. 
(3)  Such permit is granted to a particular owner on the basis of circumstances peculiar to that owner and it shall not remain in effect in the event of a change of ownership of any land, structure, use, or other item covered by the CUP. 
(4)  When granting the CUP, the town council may impose reasonable conditions, restrictions, and safeguards as considered necessary to protect the public health, safety and general welfare in accordance with the purpose or intent of this chapter. Violation of these conditions, restrictions and safeguards shall be considered a violation of this chapter. 
(c)  In the event of overcrowded permanent facilities, a temporary CUP may be issued by the town council to any school or church using, at the time of the application, permanent buildings for one or more mobile classrooms, pending construction of additional permanent facilities.

(Ord. No. 87-04-08, § 4.15, 4-8-1987) 
Sec. 58-23. - Planned residential developments. 
(a)  Planned residential developments (PRDs) are allowed as conditional zoning districts in the R-CD, R-80, R-60 and R-40 zoning districts. PRDs are established in order to provide a residential development at low densities consistent with suitability of the land and the rural character of the town. In order to encourage high quality design and innovative arrangement of buildings, these districts provide flexibility from the conventional use and dimensional requirements of the general districts. Unlike other developments in the town, a PRD may be allowed to have private streets that are not owned and maintained by the state department of transportation (DOT). In addition, a PRD may be a gated community where a gate is placed at the outer periphery of the development in order to restrict access. All PRDs must be developed in accordance with the regulations of this section, other applicable regulations of this chapter, and chapter 46. 
(b)  The town council may approve a PRD for any new development proposed in the town. Existing developments in the town shall not be considered as PRDs and are not subject to any PRD regulation. 
(1)  Uses permitted in a PRD and minimum lot and setback requirements for such uses in a PRD shall be as allowed in the underlying zoning district. 
(2)  As PRDs are conditional zoning districts, a conditional zoning application must first be approved by the town council in accordance with section 58-271. Once conditional zoning is approved, the developer shall comply with all applicable procedures of chapter 46. 
(3)  The design and layout of any gatehouse, external fence, walls and berms that serve the entire PRD and other amenities to the PRD that are visible from any public street shall be included with the conditional use permit application. All such facilities shall be located outside any public street right-of-way and shall be designed to blend in, to the greatest degree feasible, with the proposed development and shall be attractive to motorists and pedestrians from adjoining public streets. 
(4)  With the exception of the placement of the gate and/or guardhouse in a private street, any road built within a PRD shall be built to state standards and shall meet all applicable minimum right-of-way, pavement, and construction standards for public roads as established by the state department of transportation. A certified engineer shall verify that all roads within the PRD conform to all required state department of transportation standards for roadway and storm drainage design. The NCDOT Built-To Standards Checklist (available at town hall upon request) will be required to be submitted to the town zoning staff for review and approval. The town reserves the right to have streets inspected during the construction phase to insure that they are being built in accordance with all applicable state DOT standards. The PRD developer of the subdivision shall bear all costs borne by the town in association with such inspections. 
(5)  Before the approval of a final plat for a PRD, the developer shall submit to the town evidence that the developer has created a homeowners' association whose responsibility it will be to maintain common areas and private streets within the PRD. Such evidence shall include filed copies of the articles of incorporation, declarations and homeowners' association bylaws. 
(6)  The maintenance and upkeep of any guardhouses or entry structures, and subdivision walls, fences or berms located at the external periphery of the PRD, as well as the maintenance and upkeep of any private streets in the PRD, shall be the sole responsibility of the developer and/or any duly incorporated and active homeowners' association. Accordingly, any bond accepted by the town per subsection 46-49(b) for a PRD subdivision shall be calculated using the construction costs of all such facilities (in addition to the cost of streets as provided in subsection 46-49(b)) and shall remain in place until the town council is satisfied (in its own exclusive discretion) that the homeowners' association is controlled by individual lot owners other than the developer (which generally the town council shall not deem to have occurred until one year, at a minimum, after a homeowners' association is incorporated and active) and has made necessary assessments for, and has otherwise taken over the full responsibility of, maintaining and repairing such streets and facilities. The decision to release such bonds shall rest entirely within the town council's discretion and shall be made based upon the homeowners' association's financial ability to properly maintain and repair these streets and facilities. After the bond is released by the town council, the homeowners' association shall be required to submit to the town, by January 15 of each calendar year, the names, addresses and telephone numbers of all duly elected members of its board of directors as well as a copy of its annual financial statements showing, at a minimum, the amount of funds budgeted to maintain such streets and facilities. In the event the town council, in its discretion, believes the homeowners' association is not adequately maintaining or repairing the streets or facilities or is not making assessments necessary to cover the cost of said maintenance or repairs, it may, after holding a hearing, require the homeowners' association to provide a bond as required in subsection 46-49(b). The hearing described above, shall be duly noticed by publication as provided in this chapter and by mailing notice of the hearing to at least one officer (according to the most recent list of officers the town has received) of the homeowners' association or to the homeowners' association's registered agent at least ten days before the hearing. The homeowners' association's bond may be eliminated, modified, or reinstated at the discretion of the town council after a hearing notice as described above. 
(7)  Subdivisions which have an entrance gate are subject to the following regulations: The homeowner's association will provide the access code to the gate and an emergency contact number to the fire department, the Union County Sheriff and other emergency services and will be responsible for maintenance, testing and repairs of all functions of the gate. An annual inspection and test of the gate system shall be performed and the results submitted to town hall during the renewal window prescribed in the Town of Weddington Annual Enforcement Manual. Should there be a problem with the operation of the entrance gate, the gate shall remain open and accessible until the gate is repaired and tested. Any homeowner's association that is found to be in violation shall be required to maintain a service agreement with a qualified contractor to ensure year-round maintenance and to submit a copy of the service agreement to town hall.

    Adult establishments are permitted only in the B-2 district and only if they satisfy the following requirements: 
(1)  Any structure containing an adult establishment must be at least 1,000 feet from any residentially zoned property, school, church or house of worship, child care center, park or playground (each of which constitutes a protected use). An adult establishment lawfully operating as a conforming use is not rendered a nonconforming use by the subsequent location of a protected use within 1,000 feet of it. 
(2)  Any structure containing an adult establishment must be at least 1,000 feet from any other adult establishment. 
(3)  For purposes of this section, the distance between a structure containing an adult establishment and a protected use shall be measured by a straight line from the closest edge of the structure containing the adult establishment to the closest portion of the property line of the property on which the protected use is located. For purposes of this section, the distance between two structures containing adult establishments shall be measured by a straight line connecting the closest edges of those structures. 
(4)  No more than one adult establishment may be located within a single structure. 
(5)  The ordinance from which this section is derived becomes effective on October 9, 2006. All existing adult establishments that are nonconforming with respect to subsections (1) or (2) of this section, must comply with the provisions of this section within eight years of the effective date.

5.  The homeowners' association shall annually provide to the town a listing of the names, addresses and telephone numbers of all their officers and board members. 
6.  Any proposed changes to the conservation easement that substantively affect the usage, location or maintenance of conservation land within the conservation subdivision must first be consented to and approved by 100 percent of the town council and 100 percent of all homeowners. 
i.  Maintenance plans and maintenance agreement: 
1.  The cost and responsibility of maintaining required open space shall be borne by the fee simple owner of the required conservation lands, or by another party as specified in an executed, binding and enforceable maintenance agreement, who is a holder of the conservation easement. 
2.  The applicant must submit, with an application for preliminary plat approval, a maintenance agreement that obligates either the property owner of the open space, or other specified party as provided above, to implement the maintenance plan. 
3.  The maintenance plan shall be submitted with an application for preliminary plat approval of the subdivision, and shall be in accordance with the following requirements: 
i.  The maintenance plan shall specify ownership of required open space; 
ii.  The maintenance plan shall establish a regular operation and maintenance program appropriate to the uses to be undertaken on the subject open space, pursuant to subsection (4)g.2. of this section;

(4)  Standards for developments located in conservation subdivisions. 
a.  Ownership. When land of a conservation subdivision is held in multiple ownerships, it shall be planned and developed as a single entity for purposes of this chapter. 
b.  Conservation lands disturbance. The proposed design of the conservation subdivision shall minimize disturbance of primary conservation and required secondary conservation lands. 
c.  Density standards. The actual number of lots suitable for the placement of a principal residential structure may be limited by on-site features as determined by submission and analysis of a yield plan as contained in subsection 46-42(d)(2). 
d.  Minimum required conservation land. No lot suitable for the placement of a principal residential structure shall be platted to include within its dimensions any conservation lands as herein required. Conservation land on the tract containing the conservation subdivision shall be calculated as follows: 
1.  Tracts containing primary conservation lands. All primary conservation lands within the tract shall be retained as conservation land. Half of all remaining secondary conservation lands, where they exist, shall be retained as conservation land in the order of priority as described below: 
i.  Tier A (high priority). 
A.  Viewshed from the road. 
B.  Forestlands. 
ii.  Tier B (medium priority). 
A.  Farmlands. 
B.  Historic site. 
iii.  Tier C (lowest priority). 
A.  Steep slopes. 
B.  Rock formations. 
C.  Lands adjacent to parks. 
iv.  At a minimum, 50 percent of the gross acreage of the tract will be required to be retained as conservation land. When a subdivision lies on both sides of a major or minor thoroughfare, all attempts should be made to have 50 percent of each side's gross acreage designated as conservation land. The town may allow flexibility on the distribution of conservation land in unique cases where an alternative purpose is served. Conservation land in excess of the 50 percent minimum, while not required by this chapter, may be set aside at the property owner's discretion. 
2.  Tracts not containing primary conservation lands. At a minimum, 50 percent of the gross area of the tract shall be retained as secondary conservation land if there are no primary conservation lands on the tract. The priority order for retaining secondary conservation lands shall be as described in subsection (4)d.1. of this section. 
e.  Dimensional standards. 
1.  Minimum lot sizes: One of the primary differences between conventional subdivisions and conservation subdivisions is that although the overall allowable density levels between the two are the same, conservation subdivisions allow much smaller lot sizes. Accordingly, lots containing single-family dwellings may have a minimum area of 12,000 square feet. Easement lots are not permitted in a conservation subdivision. 
2.  Minimum lot width at building line: 80 feet. 
3.  Minimum street frontage: 30 feet. 
4.  Yard regulations: Variations in the principal building position and orientation on the lot are encouraged, but shall observe the following minimum standards: 
i.  Front yard: 20 feet. 
ii.  Rear yard: 30 feet. 
iii.  Side yard: 30 feet separation for principal buildings on adjacent lots, with no side yard less than five feet. The streetside side yard on a corner lot (i.e., the lot fronting a street that is not the "front yard") shall be at least 15 feet. 
Notwithstanding the provisions of this subsection, all principal dwelling units within a conservation subdivision shall be set back at least 100 feet from all external road rights-of-way (i.e., rights-of-way of roads that are external to the proposed subdivision), as depicted on the most current version of the local thoroughfare plan. In addition, all principal dwelling units shall otherwise be set back a minimum of 50 feet from the external boundaries of the conservation subdivision. 
5.  Maximum building height: 35 feet. 
6.  Garages with front loading bays shall be recessed a minimum of two feet from the front facade of the house and visually designed to form a secondary building volume. 
f.  Design standards. Lot lines shall not encroach upon the designated conservation lands. A minimum of 95 percent of building lots within the subdivision must share at least one lot line with another lot in the subdivision. 
g.  Conservation land uses. Except as provided herein, most types of structural development are not allowed on primary conservation lands and required secondary conservation lands. 
1.  Principal uses permitted outside of primary and required secondary conservation lands. Single-family dwellings. 
2.  Principal uses permitted on primary and required secondary conservation lands. No use or development shall be allowed on primary and required secondary conservation lands except as follows: 
i.  Conservation of open land in its natural state (e.g., forestlands, fields or meadows). 
ii.  Agricultural uses, including raising crops or livestock, nurseries and associated buildings, excluding residences, provided that such buildings are specifically needed to support an active, viable agricultural or horticultural operation, and are architecturally compatible with the neighborhood setting. Specifically excluded, but not limited to, are commercial livestock operations involving swine, poultry and mink. 
iii.  Pastureland. 
iv.  Horse farms or academies. 
v.  Forestry, in keeping with established best management practices for selective harvesting and sustained yield forestry. 
vi.  Neighborhood uses such as village greens, commons, picnic areas, community gardens, trails and similar low-impact, passive recreational uses. 
vii.  Noncommercial recreational areas, such as playing fields, playgrounds, courts and bikeways, provided such areas do not consume more than half of the minimum required conservation land or five acres, whichever is less. Parking facilities for the same shall also be permitted, and they shall generally be gravel-surfaced, unlighted, properly drained, provide safe ingress and egress, and contain no more than ten parking spaces. Notwithstanding the above, golf courses, their parking areas, and associated structures, shall not be allowed on any required conservation lands. 
viii.  Water supply and sewage disposal systems and stormwater detention areas designed, landscaped and available for use as an integral part of the conservation area. 
ix.  Easements for drainage, access, sewer or water lines or other public purposes. 
x.  Underground utility rights-of-way. Above ground utility and street rights-of-way may traverse conservation lands but street rights-of-way shall not count toward the minimum required conservation land. Fifty percent of the utility rights-of-way may be counted toward the minimum required conservation land. 
h.  Permanent conservation land protection through conservation easements. 
1.  Subject to the provisions of subsections (4)h.2. and (4)h.3. of this section, conservation lands required pursuant to subsection (4)d. of this section may be retained by the applicant or may be conveyed to another party, but must be and remain subject to a conservation easement. Nothing herein shall restrict the legislative zoning authority of the town council. 
2.  Required conservation land shall be subject to a conservation easement that specifies the range of uses allowable pursuant to subsection (4)g.2. of this section, and which are enforceable in accordance with all applicable laws of the state. There shall be at least two holders of every easement, except as provided in subsection (4)h.3. of this section. The holders of the conservation easement shall be the state or appropriate department or agency thereof, or one or more conservation organizations, in any combination of two or more, except as provided in subsection (4)h.3. of this section. Enforcement of the terms of the conservation easement shall be in accordance with applicable state law. The proposed preliminary plat shall indicate that required conservation lands are subject to a conservation easement being conveyed to specific entities pursuant to this section. 
3.  Upon demonstration by the applicant that efforts to comply with subsection (4)h.2. of this section have been exhausted and pursued in good faith, but have failed to result in the execution of a valid conservation easement by two qualified holders, the applicant shall enter into either: 
i.  A conservation easement to be held by the state or appropriate department or agency thereof; 
ii.  Held by a conservation organization approved by the town council, if the state will not agree to be the conservation easement holder; 
iii.  Held by a homeowners' association, subject to subsection (4)h.4. of this section; or 
iv.  Other appropriate easement holder approved within the discretion of the town council. 
To the extent possible, any combination of two or more of the above listed easement holder, is preferable. 
4.  Any homeowners' association that is a holder of a conservation easement as provided in subsection (4)h.3. of this section, shall be subject to and comply with all applicable requirements for homeowners' associations as set forth in state statutes. In addition, the following criteria shall be met: 
i.  The applicant for conservation subdivision approval shall provide the town a description of the organization of the proposed association, including its bylaws, and all documents governing ownership, maintenance and use restrictions for common facilities; 
ii.  The proposed homeowners' association shall be established by the conservation subdivision applicant and shall be operating (with financial underwriting by the applicant, if necessary) before the sale of any dwelling units in the development; 
iii.  Membership in the homeowners' association shall be mandatory for all purchasers of lots within the conservation subdivision and their successors in title; 
iv.  The homeowners' association bylaws shall confer legal authority on the association to place a lien on the real property of any member who falls delinquent in his dues. Such dues shall be paid with the accrued interest before the lien may be lifted; 
v.  The homeowners' association shall annually provide to the town a listing of the names, addresses and telephone numbers of all their officers and board members; 
vi.  Any proposed changes to the conservation easement that substantively affect the usage, location or maintenance of conservation land within the conservation subdivision must first be consented to and approved by the town council. 
i.  Maintenance plans and maintenance agreement. 
1.  The cost and responsibility of maintaining the required conservation lands and associated common facilities shall be borne by the fee simple owner of the required conservation lands, or by another party as specified in an executed, binding and enforceable maintenance agreement, who is a holder of the conservation easement. 
2.  The applicant must submit, with an application for preliminary plat approval, a maintenance agreement that obligates either the property owner of the conservation lands, or other specified party as provided above, to implement the maintenance plan. 
3.  The maintenance plan shall be submitted with an application for preliminary plat approval of a conservation subdivision, and shall be in accordance with the following requirements: 
i.  The maintenance plan shall specify ownership of required conservation lands. 
ii.  The maintenance plan shall establish a regular operation and maintenance program appropriate to the uses to be undertaken on the subject conservation lands, pursuant to subsection (4)g.2. of this section. 
iii.  The maintenance plan shall specify required insurance and all maintenance and operating costs, and shall define the means for funding the maintenance plan on an on-going basis. Such funding plan shall include the means for funding long-term capital improvements as well as regular yearly operating and maintenance costs. 
iv.  The property owner or other specified party as provided above, shall be required to escrow or bond sufficient funds for the maintenance and operation costs of the conservation lands for two years. The amount of such escrow or bond shall be equal to 1.25 times the biannual estimated maintenance and operational costs, and shall be in a form as provided in subsection 46-45(b). 
v.  Any changes to the maintenance plan shall be approved by the town council. 
vi.  In the event that conservation lands and associated common facilities are not maintained in accordance with the approved maintenance plan, the town may recover the escrow or bond funds to be used for such maintenance and any development permits and approvals may be revoked or suspended. 
vii.  The property owner of the conservation lands and, if utilized, any other maintaining party by agreement, shall execute a release and indemnity of the town, in a form satisfactory to the town, for any claims or damages arising from the maintenance agreement and maintenance plan or performance thereof.

Sec. 58-60. - MX mixed-use conditional district. 
    The MX mixed-use conditional district is hereby established in order to accommodate a highly limited type of mixed-use development in accordance with the intent described in subsection 58-5(3)b. Development in a MX mixed-use district may only occur in accordance with the requirements for conditional zoning as outlined in section 58-271. Development occurring within the downtown overlay district must also meet the requirements outlined in section 58-272. MX district rezonings shall only occur in areas designated for future business in the land use plan. 
    After the public hearing, but prior to consideration of the rezoning request, the town council will either verify that the rezoning request is reasonable and consistent with the future land use map or will consider a change to the future land use map so that the rezoning would conform with the future land use map. 
(1)  Permitted uses. 
a.  Offices and office buildings. Following is a list of examples of the types of offices permitted in an MX district. Although this list is not intended to exhaust the types of office uses permitted, other types of office uses are permissible only if they will not produce levels of noise, traffic, pedestrian activity or disturbances that exceed the levels of noise, traffic, pedestrian activity or disturbances commonly associated with the types of office uses listed below:

n.  Day care centers provided the lot is at least three acres. 
o.  Conference centers. 
p.  Wedding, banquet and reception centers provided the lot is at least five acres. However, nothing shall prohibit one or more of these uses from being combined on a single five-acre lot. These uses shall not produce levels of noise or electronically amplified sound that is audible at levels greater than 60 db beyond the boundary of the property on which the facility is located. Further, no electronically amplified sound shall be audible beyond the property boundary between the hours of 10:00 p.m. and 9:00 a.m. 
q.  Small cell telecommunication facility. 
(2)  Development standards. 
a.  Except as provided herein, all uses and structures in the MX district shall meet all applicable development standards established in article I, article V, article VI and article VII of this chapter, as well as the following standards. Some of the standards established in this zoning district may differ than those that would otherwise apply in the town. Whenever a conflict arises between an otherwise applicable standard imposed by another provision of this chapter and this section for the MX district, the stricter standard, as determined solely by the town council, shall apply. 
b.  Except as provided herein, all principal buildings and structures located within the project area shall meet a minimum setback of 25 feet from any public road right-of-way and from any surrounding property not being rezoned as part of the MX district. Where a public road right-of-way along a major or minor thoroughfare has not been established by the Mecklenburg Union Metropolitan Planning Organization's Thoroughfare Plan, the right-of-way shall be determined by a measurement of 50 feet from the centerline of the pavement to the measured line and area of that right-of-way must be dedicated to state department of transportation to provide for future widening. In addition, after considering the criteria for the MX district design as set forth in subsection 58-5(3)b, the town council, at its sole discretion, may reduce one or more of the setbacks to less than 25 feet, but only after the applicant has demonstrated one or more of the following: 
1.  The proposed setback reduction is consistent with and preserves the spirit of the land use plan; 
2.  Where a proposed use abuts permanent open space on an adjacent tract and, when combined with such open space, provides sufficient buffering; 
3.  Screening and buffering can be attained through appropriately planted and existing natural vegetation and/or topography; 
4.  The reduction can be achieved in a manner that is in harmony with the development of the surrounding area; 
5.  The nature of the open space within the proposed setback of the site is sufficient to protect adjacent property owners, i.e., topography, existing vegetation, creeks or other natural features; or 
6.  Overall features of the site plan provide adequate protection to contiguous properties. 
c.  No off-street parking shall be permitted in any required setbacks. 
d.  Landscaping, screening and buffers shall meet or exceed the minimum standards as provided per section 58-8. A buffer shall be built and maintained the entire width of the property fronting major or minor thoroughfares and major or minor roads. The buffers shall be built the width of the setback. All such buffers and/or screens shall be built in such a manner as to effectively screen the development from any major or minor thoroughfare and major or minor road, and/or residential or commercial property existing at the time the MX district is approved. All such landscaping, screening and buffers shall include, protect and maintain existing and planted trees. 
e.  In no event shall the amount of development within the project area exceed a floor area ratio of 0.20. Notwithstanding this provision, if one or more parking decks are to be built in accordance with the guidelines herein and contain 33 percent or greater of the required off-street parking for the development, the maximum allowable floor area ratio may be increased by the town council up to a ratio of 0.25. 
f.  The maximum building height, as measured from the ground level to the peak of the roof, shall be 40 feet. The majority of buildings in the development shall be two stories high. However, one-story and/or three-story buildings will also be used to provide a varied skyline for the development. A majority of the gross floor area within the development shall be contained in buildings that are two stories or shorter. All buildings or structures within 50 feet of residentially zoned property shall be limited to two stories and shall have a maximum building height of 35 feet, as measured from ground level to the peak of the roof. 
g.  No individual use within a MX district development shall have a gross floor area greater than 8,000 square feet, except for supermarkets, libraries, town and government facilities, which may be as large as 25,000 square feet. Furthermore, individual retail uses having a gross floor area of greater than 20,000 square feet shall not comprise greater than 25 percent of the total gross floor area in the development devoted to retail use. 
h.  The first floors of all nonresidential buildings must be designed to encourage pedestrian activity and use by arranging windows and doors so that individual uses within a building are visible and accessible from the street on at least 50 percent of the length of the first floor frontage that faces roads, sidewalks, or other areas of significant pedestrian activity. In its discretion, the town council may modify the requirement contained in the immediately preceding sentence so long as the town council imposes alternative requirements that will encourage at least as much pedestrian activity and use in the development. Where the first floor of a nonresidential building has expanses of blank wall, each such expanse of blank wall may not exceed 20 feet in length. The term "blank wall", for the purposes of this section, means a wall that does not contain transparent windows or doors or significant ornamentation, decoration or articulation. 
i.  Nonresidential portions of a development (including, but not limited to, the landscaping, parking and lighting of those portions) shall be designed so that they encourage and facilitate pedestrian use of those portions. In addition to other design elements that encourage and facilitate pedestrian use, in nonresidential portions of a development, sidewalks shall be placed in front of all principal buildings, and small pocket parks shall be created whenever feasible. 
j.  Large expansive off-street parking lots are not allowed. Accordingly, each off-street parking area shall contain no more than 150 off-street parking spaces and shall meet or exceed the standards in section 58-175. 
k.  Streets within the development may be privately owned and maintained. On-street parking is allowed and may be counted towards meeting the off-street parking requirements. For both on-street and off-street parking, a parking space shall be not less than nine feet in width or less than 20 feet in length, and all parking spaces shall be clearly marked and maintained so that the boundaries of each space may be easily seen. In off-street parking lots with more than 20 standard spaces, one compact parking space may be permitted for every five standard spaces. Each compact space shall be at least seven feet wide and at least 17 feet long, and shall be clearly marked, "small cars only". 
l.  Parking decks not to exceed three above grade levels of parking may be allowed provided they do not exceed the maximum height provided in section 58-58. To the maximum extent possible, such decks shall be built of materials and designed in a manner to blend in with the associated development. Cars on all levels of a structural parking facility must be screened from view from outside the structure. Retail or office uses may be allowed on the periphery of all levels of the parking deck. 
m.  Any outdoor storage of retail goods is prohibited. Notwithstanding this provision, garden materials such as flowers, plants, shrubs, fertilizer and pine needles, etc., may be stored outdoors, but only if appropriately located, screened and secured. Such outside storage shall be allowed only at the sole discretion of the town council and shall be included in calculating the floor area ratio for the site. 
n.  At a minimum, ten percent of the gross acreage of the project (minus any required setbacks and buffers, utility easements, stormwater detention areas, and marginal lands including, but not limited to, wetlands, floodplains, steep slopes and bodies of water) shall consist of prominently located and pedestrian-accessible village green open spaces so as to encourage walking and pedestrian activity within the development. No development may occur within any such open space except for the creation of sidewalks, other walking paths, and any type of development commonly found in small public parks, such as statues or other art. 
(3)  Stormwater management. The postdevelopment rate of stormwater runoff from any lot shall not exceed the predevelopment rate of runoff for a 10-year storm. The applicant shall provide, at a minimum, the following information to the zoning administrator as part of his application to obtain a zoning permit: 
a.  An engineering report made and certified as true and correct by a registered engineer licensed to do business in the state. Such report shall include the following: 
1.  The routing of stormwater for the predevelopment and postdevelopment conditions of the proposed building lot. 
2.  Calculations showing the peak estimated rates of runoff using a ten-year return period for predevelopment and postdevelopment conditions, for the lot, including each stream leaving the proposed building lot. 
3.  Calculations, plans and specifications for stormwater retention/detention facilities or other means to effect peak rate attenuation. 
4.  A statement indicating the rate of postdevelopment stormwater runoff for the proposed building lot will not be greater than the predevelopment rate for a 10-year storm. 
b.  A statement from the owner acknowledging responsibility for the operation and maintenance of required retention/detention facilities, and to disclose such obligation to future owners.

Sec. 58-61. - E-D educational district. 
    Joint proposal from staffs of Union County Public Schools, Union County and all Union County Municipalities regarding standardized zoning regulations. 
    Union County Public Schools (UCPS) is currently subject to 13 different sets of local land use regulations (12 different municipalities and Union County). Regulations vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, making it difficult to build new schools, renovate existing schools or locate mobile units in a consistent, timely and cost effective manner. 
    As a part of the Union County Board of Education's adopted "Building Program Cost Saving Principles", UCPS is endeavoring to establish a standard zoning classification and standardized requirements for school construction regardless of the schools locale in Union County. Such standardization will result in: (i) equitable school facilities throughout the county; (ii) more efficient permitting of school facilities; and (iii) cost savings for the benefit of the taxpayers of Union County. Staffs from UCPS, Union County and local municipalities have met and have agreed to make recommendations to their elected boards as follows: 
(1)  UCPS staff will involve local municipal staff early in the site selection process. The local municipal staff will make recommendations regarding target sites or areas within their respective jurisdictions that are suitable for school uses. Pursuant to state statute, final decisions regarding the selection of school sites are made by the Union County Board of Education. 
(2)  Allow all new schools, additions or renovation uses by right with supplemental standards. This will eliminate the costly and time-consuming discretionary (CUP/SUP) zoning process and site-by-site negotiations. All local government entities benefit by having expectations regarding school design and construction identified in advance. 
(3)  Jurisdictions may consider an optional CUP/SUP review process if unique conditions exist as determined by the zoning/planning administrator. The administrator shall consider if the proposed project poses a negative impact on the public health and safety. 
(4)  Supplemental standards shall include: 
a.  Exterior of buildings: 
1.  Exterior building materials shall be limited to masonry brick (brick or prefinished block), natural or synthetic stucco, prefinished insulated or noninsulated metal panel system, prefinished metal fascia and wall coping, standing seam metal roof (for sloped roof only), painted hollow metal and/or prefinished aluminum door and window frames, glass, painted or prefinished steel. 
2.  UCPS staff will work with municipality staff to follow any requirements of municipality "special overlay districts" as it relates to the exterior design of the facility. 
3.  Exterior of buildings will be articulated to enhance the area of the site. 
b.  Mobile classrooms (MCR): 
1.  MCR's shall be located in rear yard if possible. If rear yard cannot accommodate the MCR's then they can be placed in the side yard. MCR's can be placed in the front yard only if the MCR's cannot be accommodated in the rear or side yards. 
2.  MCR underpinning and crawl spaces shall be screened. 
3.  Landscaping/planting shall be provided between the MCR and any adjacent roads from which the MCR's are visible. 
c.  Sidewalks: 
1.  Sidewalks will not be required if they present a public health and safety hazard; sidewalks on the school property that connect to an existing sidewalk infrastructure will be provided by UCPS. Except as provided above, the municipalities shall be responsible for paying for and constructing sidewalks. 
2.  UCPS will dedicate appropriate easement or road right-of-way needed for sidewalks if requested by municipality. 
3.  UCPS will grade areas for sidewalks if requested by municipality. 
4.  UCPS will cooperate with municipality to apply for grants for sidewalks. 
d.  Exterior illumination: 
1.  Driveway and parking area lighting shall be no more than ten footcandles. Spill over to adjacent properties shall not exceed one footcandle for nonresidential use/and or zoning and 0.50 footcandle for residential use and/or zoning. Lighting fixtures shall be shielding type. 
2.  Lighting fixtures located on the building exterior shall not emit more than five footcandles and shall be shielding type. 
3.  Lighting for athletic fields shall follow the current standards as set forth by the North Carolina High School Athletic Association Lighting Standard. A lighting control package shall be included and lights shall be shut off no later than one hour after the end of the event. 
e.  Signs: 
1.  Materials for sign base and structure shall match the primary building materials. 
2.  Sign face shall not exceed 40 square feet and does not include the sign support structure. The bottom of the sign face shall be no less than 24 inches above, nor more than 72 inches above the ground surface. The sign support structure can include columns and walls on either side of and below the sign face and shall not be more than 16 inches taller than the sign face. 
3.  One sign shall be permitted per school. Alternatively, if multiple schools use the same driveway access, then the allowable square footage may be increased by ten square feet for each additional school. 
4.  One wall sign per school shall be permitted and only for the name of the school and shall be reviewed by the administrator. 
5.  External illumination is allowed. 
f.  Parking: 
1.  At elementary and middle schools provide one space per staff member plus 1.6 spaces per classroom or one space for each three seats used for assembly purposes whichever is greater. 
2.  At high schools provide five spaces per instructional classroom or one space for each three seats used for assembly purposes whichever is greater. 
3.  No more than 20 percent of the required spaces can be compact spaces. 
4.  Minimum size of spaces shall be nine feet wide by 19 feet long for regular, 71/2 feet wide by 15 feet long for compact, and accessible spaces shall meet current accessibility codes. 
g.  Student drop-off stacking: On-site vehicle stacking for student drop-off shall be based on NCDOT requirements using the NCDOT required calculator. 
h.  Landscaping and screening/buffering: 
1.  Trees and shrubs shall be as indicated within the municipality species list. 
2.  Parking area: One large or two small trees shall be provided for each 12 parking spaces. Each parking space shall be located within 65 feet of a tree. Rows of parking spaces shall be terminated with a landscaped island and shall be the same size as a parking space. 
3.  Parking areas shall be screened from adjacent public roads with shrubs based on the municipality's species list. 
4.  Storm detention basins shall be screened with fencing and/or shrubs as determined by the administrator and shall be dependant upon the size, location and use of the basin. 
5.  Land berms will not be permitted between school facilities and roads. 
6.  Land berms can be used in conjunction with required screening/buffering to adjacent uses as determined by the local regulations. 
7.  Screening/buffering from adjacent uses will be opaque and shall consist of: 
i.  Small trees planted at a rate of three per 100 feet and six feet high evergreen shrubs planted at a rate of 25 per 100 feet; or 
ii.  Large trees planted at a rate of 2.5 per 100 feet and a six-foot high solid wood fence; or 
iii.  Tall evergreen trees with branches touching the ground planted in a stagger. 
8.  If the adjoining property is of similar or compatible use the administrator may reduce or eliminate the screening/buffer. 
9.  Screening/buffering requirements may be waived when screening/buffering is already provided. There may be cases where the unusual topography or elevation of a site, or the size of the parcel involved, or the presence of screening on adjacent property would make the strict adherence to the regulation serve no useful purpose. In those cases, the administrator is empowered to waive the requirements for screening so long as the spirit and intent of this section and the general provisions of this section pertaining to screening are adhered to. This section does not negate the necessity for establishing screening for uses adjacent to vacant property. 
10.  UCPS will endeavor to adhere to all tree preservation ordinances of the municipalities and shall preserve natural buffers between the school facility and adjacent properties as much as practical. 
11.  UCPS will endeavor to retain as much existing trees and vegetation on school sites as practical and will re-introduce common local species into the project as possible. 
(5)  Stormwater management. The postdevelopment rate of stormwater runoff from any lot shall not exceed the predevelopment rate of runoff for a 10-year storm. The applicant shall provide, at a minimum, the following information to the zoning administrator as part of his application to obtain a zoning permit: 
a.  An engineering report made and certified as true and correct by a registered engineer licensed to do business in the state. Such report shall include the following: 
1.  The routing of stormwater for the predevelopment and postdevelopment conditions of the proposed building lot. 
2.  Calculations showing the peak estimated rates of runoff using a ten-year return period for predevelopment and postdevelopment conditions, for the lot, including each stream leaving the proposed building lot. 
3.  Calculations, plans and specifications for stormwater retention/detention facilities or other means to effect peak rate attenuation. 
4.  A statement indicating the rate of postdevelopment stormwater runoff for the proposed building lot will not be greater than the predevelopment rate for a 10-year storm. 
b.  A statement from the owner acknowledging responsibility for the operation and maintenance of required retention/detention facilities, and to disclose such obligation to future owners. 
(6)  Small cell telecommunication facilities are a permitted use within this district in accordance with article XI. 
    In the event any provisions of the supplemental regulations conflict with any other provisions of this section, then the provisions of these supplemental regulations shall control. Other ordinance provisions not in conflict with these supplemental regulations remain in effect.

Secs. 58-62-58-78. - Reserved. 
ARTICLE III. - CONDITIONAL USES 

Sec. 58-79. - Intent. 
    This article provides for certain uses to be located by right in certain districts where the uses are compatible with the purpose of the district and with other uses to be located in certain districts only by complying with additional development standards to insure that same compatibility. However, certain uses which are basically in keeping with the intent and purpose of the district may have substantial impact on the surrounding area and should only be allowed after a review of the specific proposal. In order to ensure that these uses would be compatible with surrounding development and be in keeping with the purpose of the district in which they are proposed to be placed, they are not allowed to be established as a matter of right. They may be established only after review and approval of a conditional use permit as required by this chapter. 
(Ord. No. 87-04-08, § 6.1, 4-8-1987) 
Sec. 58-80. - Permit required. 
    Certain uses listed in this article require the issuance of a conditional use permit by the town council prior to the issuance of a zoning permit by the zoning administrator. In certain cases, a change in the zoning district of the property in question will also be necessary. The information in this article details the procedures which shall be followed under these circumstances. 
(Ord. No. 87-04-08, § 6.2, 4-8-1987) 
Sec. 58-81. - Procedures. 
    Conditional use permits shall be considered by the town council by either of the following methods: 
(1)  Submittal information and procedures for all uses except conservation subdivisions (and no zoning change required). 
a.  A completed written application for a conditional use permit shall be filed with the zoning administrator at least 25 days prior to the next regularly scheduled planning board meeting. The application, at a minimum, shall include the following items, for all uses except conservation subdivisions.

iii.  Existing and proposed topography at five-foot contour intervals. 
iv.  Plans for providing potable water and for the treatment of wastewater. 
10.  Proposed phasing, if any, and approximate completion time of the project. 
11.  A stormwater management plan. Stormwater runoff and rate should not exceed the predevelopment rate for a ten-year storm. 
12.  For nonresidential uses: Plans and schematic designs for all buildings and signs on the site. 
b.  All applications shall be completed and signed by the applicant and shall be submitted with the application fee required by the town in accordance with the fee schedule adopted by the town council. No application shall be considered complete or processed by the zoning administrator unless accompanied by said fee. In addition, the town shall be reimbursed by the applicant for all costs associated with the town's engineering and/or consulting services with respect to review of the conditional use permit prior to the conditional use permit approval. All expenses incurred by the town for the processing of a conditional use permit application shall be paid prior to the issuance of a final notification of action taken. 
c.  The zoning administrator shall review the application and notify the applicant if the application is incomplete in any respect. If the zoning administrator notifies the applicant that the application is incomplete, the applicant must complete the application before it will be forwarded to the planning board and the design review board (DRB), if applicable. After reviewing the application, the zoning administrator also may provide the applicant with comments on the application. If the applicant intends to amend the application as a result of any comments provided by the zoning administrator, the applicant shall notify the zoning administrator of the applicant's intent to amend the application within 15 calendar days after receiving such comments. After the applicant submits any amended application, the zoning administrator will review the amended application to ensure that it is complete, and the zoning administrator may provide the applicant with comments on the amended application. 
d.  If the most recent version of the application is complete and either the zoning administrator completes his review of that version and does not provide the applicant with comments, or the zoning administrator provides the applicant with comments on that version but the applicant does not notify the zoning administrator within 15 calendar days as proscribed in subsection c. above that he intends to amend the application, then the application shall be deemed ready for submission to the planning board and the DRB, if applicable, as established below: 
1.  Submissions requiring planning board approval: The zoning administrator shall submit the application to the planning board at their next regularly scheduled meeting that occurs at least 15 days after the application is deemed ready for submission in accordance with this section. The planning board by majority vote may shorten or waive the time provided in this article for receipt of a completed conditional use application. 
2.  Submissions requiring planning board and DRB approval: The zoning administrator shall submit the application to the DRB within five business days of the determination that the application is complete as set forth in this subsection d. The DRB shall have a maximum of 30 days from the date on which the application is submitted to the DRB to review the application and submit its recommendation to the planning board. The DRB shall determine whether plans and schematic designs satisfy the standards set out in this section and meet the requirements of the town's architectural design standards (see chapter 14, article V). If a recommendation is not made within the 30-day time period, the application shall be forwarded to the planning board without a recommendation. The planning board shall have a maximum of 30 days from the date on which an application is submitted to it, or until its next regularly scheduled meeting, if such meeting is not less than 15 days after the application is submitted to it, whichever is later, to review the application and to submit its recommendation to the town council. If a recommendation is not made during said time period, the application shall be forwarded to the town council without a recommendation from the planning board. 
e.  During the review of a conditional use permit application, it may be desirable to request additional information in order to evaluate a proposed use and its relationship to the surrounding area. Therefore, the DRB, planning board and/or the town council may request needed additional information from the applicant as they deem necessary. 
f.  Once the application is forwarded to the town council from the planning board, the town council shall consider conducting a public hearing as described in subsection 58-270(g) (a public hearing is required if a CUP is to be approved). In the event the town council deems a public hearing appropriate, due notice of such hearing shall be as prescribed in subsections 58-270(g)(1)-(g)(4). The town council shall render a decision on the conditional use permit in accordance with subsection 58-82(3). 
(2)  Submittal information and procedures for conservation subdivisions (no zoning change required). 
a.  An applicant for a conditional use permit for a conservation subdivision shall be required to submit a site plan that contains or is accompanied by the following: 
1.  Name, address and telephone number of the applicant and property owner, if different from the applicant, deed book and page number of the property description. 
2.

16.  A yield plan showing the number of lots that could occur on the tract if it were developed in accordance with all applicable subdivision requirements as a conventional subdivision using lots of a minimum size of 40,000 square feet, as called for in subsection 46-42(d)(2). 
17.  A general concept of what the conservation subdivision will look like, including proposed roads and lot layout. 
b.  All applications shall be completed and signed by the applicant and shall be submitted with the application fee required by the town in accordance with the fee schedule adopted by the town council. No application shall be considered complete or processed by the zoning administrator unless accompanied by said fee. In addition, the town shall be reimbursed by the applicant for all costs associated with the town's engineering and/or consulting services with respect to review of the conditional use permit prior to conditional use permit approval. All expenses incurred by the town for the processing of a conditional use permit application shall be paid prior to the issuance of a final notification of action taken. 
c.  The zoning administrator shall review the application and notify the applicant if the application is incomplete in any respect. If the zoning administrator notifies the applicant that the application is incomplete, the applicant must complete the application before it will be forwarded to the planning board. After reviewing the application, the zoning administrator also may provide the applicant with comments on the application. If the applicant intends to amend the application as a result of any comments provided by the zoning administrator, the applicant shall notify the zoning administrator of the applicant's intent to amend the application within 15 calendar days after receiving those comments. After the applicant submits any amended application, the zoning administrator will review the amended application to ensure that it is complete, and the zoning administrator may provide the applicant with comments on the amended application. 
d.  If the most recent version of the application is complete and either the zoning administrator completes his review of that version and does not provide the applicant with comments, or the zoning administrator provides the applicant with comments on that version but the applicant does not notify the zoning administrator within the 15-calendar-day time period, provided that he intends to amend the application, then the application shall be deemed ready for submission to the planning board. The zoning administrator shall submit the application to the planning board at their next regularly scheduled meeting that occurs at least 15 days after the application is deemed ready for submission in accordance with this section. The planning board, by majority vote, may shorten or waive the time provided in this article for receipt of a completed conditional use application. 
e.  The planning board shall have a maximum of 30 days from the date on which an application is submitted to it, or until its next regularly scheduled meeting after an application is submitted to it, whichever is later, to review the application and to submit its recommendation to the town council. If a recommendation is not made during said time period, the application shall be forwarded to the town council without a recommendation from the planning board. 
f.  When reviewing an application for a conditional use permit, it may be desirable to request additional information in order to evaluate a proposed use and its relationship to the surrounding area. Therefore, the town may request needed additional information as they deem necessary. 
g.  After the planning board has made a recommendation to the town council, the zoning administrator is authorized to call and advertise a public hearing to be held at the next regularly scheduled town council meeting provided notification requirements, pursuant to subsections 58-270(g)(1)-(g)(6), are met. The town council shall render a decision on the conditional use permit in accordance with subsection 58-82(3). 
(3)  Zoning change required. 
a.  When a conditional use permit is being requested for a use in a zoning district for which a rezoning is required, the following procedures shall be followed: 
1.  The requirements listed in subsection (1) of this section shall be met. 
2.  The applicant shall also complete a rezoning application which, together with the conditional use permit application, shall be submitted at the same time to the zoning administrator as set forth in subsection 58-270(b). 
b.  Once the conditional use permit application and zoning change application have been properly completed, they shall both be reviewed by the planning board and the town council in compliance with subsection (1) of this section for conditional uses and subsections 58-270(d) and 58-270(j) for zoning changes. 
c.  The withdrawal of the conditional use permit application by the applicant after it has been accepted by the zoning administrator shall immediately terminate review of the zoning change application by either the planning board or town council. Any fee paid by an applicant shall be forfeited to the town unless the application for a conditional use permit is withdrawn prior to submission of the application to the planning board. All recommendations made by the planning board concerning the zoning changes shall be in accordance with article IX of this chapter. 
(Ord. No. 87-04-08, § 6.3, 4-8-1987; Amd. of 5-9-1994; Ord. No. O-2004-22, 8-9-2004; Ord. No. O-2004-24, 10-11-2004; Ord. No. O-2006-15, 8-14-2006; Ord. No. O-2009-08, 7-13-2009) 
Sec. 58-82. - Town council decision. 
    If the town council should find, after conducting a public hearing, that the proposed conditional use permit and, where requested, zoning change should be granted, the town council may impose such additional reasonable and appropriate special conditions upon such conditional use permit, as it may deem necessary. In no instance shall any of these conditions be less restrictive than any requirements which would pertain to that particular development found in the same zoning district. Any conditions should relate to the relationship of the proposed use to surrounding property, proposed support facilities such as parking areas and driveways, pedestrian and vehicular circulation systems, screening and buffer areas, preservation of open space, the timing of development and other matters that the town council may find appropriate or the petitioner may propose. The conditions may include architectural review or control and sign controls. The screening provisions of this article shall be minimum screening requirements as a condition for awarding a conditional use permit; however, the town council may impose additional reasonable screening requirements as a condition for awarding a conditional use permit as the council considers necessary to protect the health, safety and welfare in accordance with the purpose and intent of this article. The petitioner will have a reasonable opportunity to consider and respond to any additional requirements prior to approval or denial by the town council. The town council shall give due regard to the intent and purpose of this section and ensure that the public safety and welfare will be secured and substantial justice done. 
(1)  Burden of proof. The applicant has the burden of producing competent material and substantial evidence, tending to establish the existence of the facts and conditions which the appropriate section of this article requires for the issuance of the conditional use permit. 
(2)  Voting. When deciding conditional use permits, the town council shall follow quasi-judicial procedures. No vote greater than a majority vote shall be required for the council to issue such permits. For the purposes of this section, vacant positions on the council and members who are disqualified from voting on a quasi-judicial matter shall not be considered members of the council for calculation of the requisite majority. 
(3)  Findings to be made by town council for all conditional uses other than conservation subdivisions. The town council shall issue a conditional use permit only after having made each of the following findings: 
a.  The use will not materially endanger the public health or safety if located where proposed and developed according to plan. 
b.  The use meets all required conditions and specifications. 
c.  The use will not substantially injure the value of adjoining or abutting property, or the use is a public necessity. 
d.  The location and character of the use, if developed according to the plan as submitted and approved, will be in harmony with the area in which it is to be located and will be in general conformity with this chapter and the town's land development plan. 
e.  Additional review criteria, as stated in this chapter, shall also be considered and addressed where required. 
(4)  Findings to be made by town council for all conservation subdivisions. The town council shall issue a conditional use permit only after having made each of the following findings: 
a.  The proposed conservation subdivision is density neutral (i.e., allows for the same number of lots as that which could be platted under applicable subdivision requirements with a minimum lot size of 40,000 square feet). 
b.  If applicable, the proposed conservation subdivision provides conservation lands along public roadways to minimize visual impacts of the scenic view from the road. 
c.  The proposed conservation subdivision minimizes the impact on the most sensitive forestland, floodplain, and wetland resources and wildlife habitat. 
d.  The proposed conservation subdivision minimizes the impact on the most productive farmland soils. 
e.  The proposed conservation subdivision is in harmony with the area in which it is to be located and will be in general conformity with this chapter, chapter 46, and the town land use plan. 
f.  The use will not materially endanger the public health or safety if located where proposed. 
g.  The use will not substantially injure the value of adjoining or abutting property. 
(5)  Appeal of town council decision on conditional use permit. Every conditional use permit decision of the town council shall be subject to review by the superior court by proceedings in the nature of certiorari. Any petition for review by the superior court shall be filed with the appropriate clerk of superior court within 30 days after the decision of the town council is filed in the office of the town clerk, or after a written copy thereof is delivered to every aggrieved party who has filed a written request for such copy with the clerk at the time of the hearing of the case, whichever is later. The decision of the town council may be delivered to the aggrieved party either by personal service or by registered mail or certified mail return receipt requested. 
(Ord. No. 87-04-08, § 6.4, 4-8-1987; Ord. No. O-2004-22, 8-9-2004; Ord. No. O-2006-01, 2-13-2006) 
Sec. 58-83. - Binding effect. 
(a)  Any conditional use permit so authorized shall be likewise binding to the property included in such permit unless subsequently changed or amended by the town council. A copy of the letter notifying the applicant of the council approval of a conditional use permit shall be forwarded to the county register of deeds for recordation. Notwithstanding, a conditional use permit for a conservation subdivision shall become null and void unless a complete application for a sketch plan, in accordance with section 46-42 has been submitted within two years following the date of the conditional use permit approval. The conditional use permit allows the subdivider to proceed with a conservation subdivision, but in no way replaces or lessens the requirements for sketch, preliminary and final plat submissions as specified in chapter 46.

ARTICLE VI. - OFF-STREET PARKING AND LOADING 

Sec. 58-175. - Off-street parking. 
    Every new use, or an enlargement, expansion or alteration of an existing use, shall require off-street parking in compliance with this article, unless specifically exempt from such provisions or portions thereof. 
(1)  Off-street parking spaces shall be increased when a change of use of either a structure or of land requires additional parking spaces in compliance with this article. Parking spaces may be decreased when a change of use in either a structure or of land requires less spaces than provided for the replaced use. 
(2)  A one-time only enlargement of a structure or increase in the amount of land used may be made for existing uses deficient in off-street parking, provided that the enlargement or increase does not represent a requirement in excess of five off-street parking spaces. In the event that such increase represents a requirement in excess of five off-street parking spaces, such increase shall require complete compliance of the provisions of this article for the entire use. 
(3)  Off-street parking shall be located as follows: 
a.  Parking as required herein shall be located on the same lot as the principal use except when specifically permitted to be located elsewhere. Driveways shall be considered as providing off-street parking spaces for all single-family and two-family dwellings. 
b.  Cooperative provisions for off-street parking may be made by contract between owners of adjacent property, and such contract filed with the zoning administrator. The parking area provided on any one lot may be reduced to not less than half the parking spaces required for the use occupying such lot. The total number of spaces provided under such a cooperative parking scheme shall not be less than the total number of spaces required for each use. 
c.  No parking area shall be located over an active septic tank field. 
d.  In residential areas, the temporary parking or storage of mobile homes shall be prohibited. Boats, motor homes and camping trailers may, however, be stored or temporarily parked in a residential district. All inoperative motor vehicles stored outdoors shall be parked behind the residence and screened from the public right-of-way. 
e.  Parking areas may not be extended into the required rear yard and side yard setbacks. 
f.  A city or town hall, post office, library or other governmental facility may count shared parking spaces toward up to 50 percent of its total off-street parking requirement. Such a use may share parking spaces only with one or more other uses that also may share parking spaces under subsection (4)c of this section. The following formula shall be used to determine how many shared parking spaces a particular use may apply toward its off-street parking requirement: 
1.  For off-street private parking, a use may treat as shared parking, any parking spaces that are within 800 feet of that use. A document must be filed with the town's zoning administrator that confirms that the parking lot's owner or operator consents to parking spaces in that lot being shared. If fewer than all the spaces within the lot are being shared, this document must clearly identify which spaces are being shared. If the shared parking arrangement described in the document is later modified, a document describing the modified arrangement must be filed with the town's zoning administrator. If the shared parking arrangement described in any document filed with the town's zoning administrator is later rescinded, the zoning administrator must be notified immediately. If the rescission or modification of a shared parking arrangement leaves a use with inadequate parking to satisfy the requirements of this article, said use will not be considered nonconforming, and it will not be permitted to continue without satisfying this article's parking requirements. 
(4)  Design standards for parking areas are as follows: 
a.  A parking space shall be not less than nine feet in width nor less than 20 feet in length. In lots of more than 20 spaces, compact stalls may be permitted on the basis of one compact stall to each additional five standard stalls. Each compact stall shall be seven feet wide and 17 feet long, and shall be clearly marked, "small cars only." All parking stalls shall be clearly marked and such markings shall be maintained so as to be easily seen. 
b.  Parking bays shall be designed in accordance with accepted standard practice for parking at various angles, with aisles being of such widths as to permit the entering and leaving of a parking space with ease and safety. 
c.  Access to all required parking areas shall be by roads adequate in width to accommodate two-way traffic, except for parking areas designed and clearly marked for one-way traffic. Except by way of approved driveways, access from or egress to a public road from a parking area shall be expressly prohibited. Adequate provisions shall be made to insure compliance by the use of fences, walls, wheel stops or landscaping, or a combination of those devices. 
d.  Wheel stops, curbs, or other devices shall be provided in such locations as to prevent any vehicle from encroaching either on a public right-of-way or an adjacent property. 
e.  Parking areas shall be so designed as to retain existing trees and other plant life. Where no trees or other plant life exists, adequate landscaping shall be provided, both within the parking area and on the external boundaries of such area. 
f.  Screening shall be provided as required in section 58-8. 
g.  Signs shall be permitted in compliance with section 58-153. 
(5)  Permits for driveway locations on state-maintained roads shall be obtained from the state department of transportation. 
(6)  Storm drainage facilities shall be required, and shall be so designed as to protect any public right-of-way or adjacent property from the damage. 
(7)  The requirements for off-street parking spaces shall be computed as follows: 
a.  When units of measurement determining the number of required parking spaces result in a fractional space, any fraction of one-half or more shall require one parking space. 
b.  Where seats consist of pews or benches, each 20 inches in length of pew or a bench shall be considered as one seat. 
c.  For the purpose of computing parking requirements based on the number of employees, the owners or managers shall also be considered employees. 
d.  Lots containing more than one principal use shall provide parking in the amount equal to the total of the requirements for each use. 
(8)  The following chart indicates the minimum off-street parking requirements:

    It shall be unlawful to commence the excavation or filling of any lot for the construction of a building or structure, or to begin the construction of any building or structure or part thereof, or to erect or replace a sign (except as permitted in section 58-145) or to move, alter or add to any structure, or to begin the development of land, until the zoning administrator has issued a zoning permit for such work. No zoning permit shall be issued except in conformity with the provisions of this chapter unless after written order from the board of adjustment. 
(1)  Application for zoning permit. A zoning permit is required for residential, institutional, and commercial uses. A zoning permit application form can be obtained at town hall, and shall contain the following information: 
a.  Nonresidential uses . Two copies of a scaled dimensional plan drawn by and certified as true and correct by a surveyor or engineer registered with the state which shows the following: 
1.  The exact shape, dimensions and location of the lot to be built upon; 
2.  The exact shape, dimensions, use and location of existing structures on the land; 
3.  The exact shape, dimensions and location of the structures to be developed upon the lot; 
4.  All setback lines on the lot once the proposed construction is completed; 
5.  Proposed parking facilities (if required); 
6.  Landscaping and buffering plans (if required); and 
7.  Any other information that may be needed to insure that the proposed construction is in compliance with all applicable provisions of this chapter. In the event the subject property is a corner lot, the owner shall designate which intersecting street shall be the front of the lot. 
b.  Single-family and two-family residences . Two copies of a scaled dimensional survey drawn by and certified as true and correct by a surveyor or engineer registered with the state which shows the following:

The fee shall be as established from time to time by resolution of the town council, and must be paid by certified check or cash at the time an application for a zoning permit is received by the town. 
e.  Issuance of permit. If the proposed excavation, filling, or construction, as set forth in the application, are in conformity with the provisions of the chapter and the processing fee has been paid, the zoning administrator shall issue a zoning permit and return one copy of the approved plan with his signature to the applicant.

Once a zoning permit has expired, construction work on the lots in question cannot proceed until a new zoning permit is issued. 
(6)  Right of appeal. Appeal of denial of a zoning permit must be made in writing and must specify the grounds thereof and the appeal must be received by the zoning administrator within ten days of receipt by the applicant of the written notice of denial of a zoning permit application. 
(7)  Records. The zoning administrator shall maintain a record of all zoning permits on file at his office, and copies shall be made available to interested parties upon request. 
(8)  Foundation survey. 
a.  Upon construction of a building foundation (subsequent to the issuance of a zoning permit for that building or structure) the applicant shall be required to submit a copy of the foundation survey of that building or structure to the zoning administrator in order to ensure that the foundation is in accordance with all applicable setback and bulk requirements. The foundation survey, in scaled form and which has been certified as being accurate by a surveyor or engineer registered with the state, shall show the location of the foundation on the lot and all applicable front, side, and rear yard setbacks. Failure to submit this foundation survey may result in the denial of a certificate of compliance. 
b.  The requirements for the foundation survey submittal shall be waived if the structure is a single-family dwelling or mobile home located on a tract of at least ten acres in area and the proposed dwelling is also at least 200 feet from the boundaries of the tract.

The certificate of compliance shall state that the building or portion of a building is in compliance with the provisions of this chapter, and with the information stated on the zoning permit. 
(1)  Application for a certificate of compliance. A certificate of compliance may only be issued after the written application for same has been made in which the applicant must state that the building or structure erected or altered or changed complies in all respects with this chapter and the zoning permit previously issued. If the application for certificate of compliance is for any building, the application shall include a scaled, dimensional plat drawn by and certified as accurate by a surveyor or engineer registered with the state which affirmatively shows that the building or structure was erected in compliance with this chapter and the zoning permit previously issued; provided, however, for residential properties only, that if the tract that the residence is constructed on contains ten acres or more, then the person applying for the certificate of compliance shall be allowed to present a noncertified sketch in lieu thereof, provided that the residence is not to be located closer than 200 feet from any of the boundaries of the tract. In the event that the proposed residence is to be located closer than 200 feet from any of the boundaries of the tract, then the applicant shall submit a certified survey of the improvements with respect to those boundaries only. The sketch submitted shall in all other respects comply to the requirements set forth above. 
(2)  Review of certificate of compliance. The zoning administrator shall take necessary action to assure the applicant's compliance with this chapter and the zoning permit prior to issuing a certificate of compliance and shall make written findings that the applicant has complied with the zoning permit. After making such findings, the zoning administrator may issue a certificate of compliance. 
(3)  Denial of certificate of compliance. In the event the zoning administrator finds that the applicant has not complied with this chapter and the zoning permit previously issued, he shall notify the applicant of same stating the reasons therefor by certified mail or hand delivery. 
(4)  Appeal. The applicant may appeal the zoning administrator's denial of the certificate of compliance to the board of adjustment. Appeal of denial of the certificate of compliance must be made in writing and state the grounds thereof, and be received by the zoning administrator within ten days of the applicant's receipt of written notice of denial of the certificate of compliance.

Footnotes: 
--- (2) --- 
Editor's note- Ord. No. O-2010-08, adopted June 14 2010, amended art. VIII in its entirety to read as herein set out. Former art. VIII, §§ 58-231-58-238, pertained to similar subject matter and derived from Ord. No. 87-04-08, §§ 11.1-11.8, adopted Apr. 8, 1987; Ord. No. O-2003-17, adopted Sept. 08, 2003; and Ord. No. O-2006-01, adopted Feb. 13, 2006. 

Sec. 58-231. - Board of adjustment powers, duties and procedure. 
(a)  Establishment and duties. A board of adjustment is hereby established which shall have all the powers and duties as authorized by G.S. 160A-388, and as otherwise provided for in this chapter. Generally, such powers and duties shall include, but not be restricted to the following: 
(1)  Hearing and deciding all appeals from decisions, citations (with and without civil penalties), orders, requirements or other determinations made by the zoning administrator. 
(2)  Hearing and deciding appeals that require interpretation of this chapter. 
(3)  Hearing and granting variances from the provisions of this chapter. 
(b)  Composition. The board of adjustment shall consist of five regular members who are residents of the town and shall be appointed by the town council. In addition, two alternate members shall serve on the board of adjustment, both residents of the town, and shall be appointed by the town council. Alternate members shall serve in the absence for any cause of any regular member. Initial appointment of the regular members shall be as follows: Three regular members and one alternate member appointed by the town council for terms to expire on December 31, 1987, and two regular members and one alternate member appointed by the town council for terms to expire on December 31, 1989. Thereafter, all members and alternate members shall be appointed by the town council for terms to correspond with planning board terms set out in article II of chapter 38. Any vacancy in the membership shall be filled for the unexpired term in the same manner as the initial appointment. Members shall serve without pay but may be reimbursed for any expenses incurred while representing the board. Such alternate member while attending any regular or special meeting of the board of adjustment and serving in the absence of any regular member shall have and may exercise all the powers and duties of such regular members. 
(c)  Jurisdiction. Each member of the board of adjustment shall have equal rights, privileges and duties in all matters coming under the board's purview. 
(Ord. No. O-2010-08, 6-14-2010) 
Sec. 58-232. - Administrative appeal. 
    The board of adjustment shall hear and decide appeals decisions from and review any order, requirement, decision, citations (with or without civil penalties), or determination made by an administrative official charged with the enforcement of this chapter and may hear appeals arising out of any other ordinance that regulates land use or development, and apply such interpretation to the particular fact situations. The board of adjustment shall follow quasi-judicial procedures when deciding administrative appeals. 
(1)  Any person who has standing under G.S. 160A-393(d) or the town may appeal a decision to the board of adjustment. An appeal is taken by filing a notice of appeal with the town clerk. The notice of appeal shall state the grounds for the appeal. 
(2)  The official who made the decision shall give written notice to the owner of the property that is the subject of the decision and to the party who sought the decision, if different from the owner. The written notice shall be delivered by personal delivery, electronic mail, or by first class mail. 
(3)  The owner or other party shall have 30 days from the receipt of the written notice within which to file an appeal. Any other person with standing to appeal shall have 30 days from receipt from any source of actual or constructive notice of the decision within which to file an appeal. 
(4)  It shall be conclusively presumed that all persons with standing to appeal have constructive notice of the decision from the date a sign containing the words "Zoning Decision" or "Subdivision Decision" in letters at least six inches high and identifying the means to contact an official for information about the decision is prominently posted on the property that is the subject of the decision, provided the sign remains on the property for at least ten days. Posting of signs is not the only form of constructive notice. Any such posting shall be the responsibility of the landowner or applicant. Verification of the posting shall be provided to the official who made the decision. Absent an ordinance provision to the contrary, posting of signs shall not be required. 
(5)  The official who made the decision shall transmit to the board all documents and exhibits constituting the record upon which the action appealed from is taken. The official shall also provide a copy of the record to the appellant and to the owner of the property that is the subject of the appeal if the applicant is not the owner. An appeal of a notice of violation or other enforcement order stays enforcement of the action appealed from unless the official who made the decision certifies to the board of adjustment after notice of appeal has been filed that because of the facts stated in an affidavit, a stay would cause imminent peril to life or property or because the violation is transitory in nature, a stay would seriously interfere with enforcement of the ordinance. In that case, enforcement proceedings shall not be stayed except by a restraining order, which may be granted by a court. If enforcement proceedings are not stayed, the appellant may file with the official a request for an expedited hearing of the appeal, and the board of adjustment shall meet to hear the appeal within 15 days after such a request is filed. Notwithstanding the foregoing, appeals of decisions granting a permit or otherwise affirming that a proposed use of property is consistent with the ordinance shall not stay the further review of an application for permits or permissions to use such property; in these situations the appellant may request and the board may grant a stay of a final decision of permit applications or building permits affected by the issue being appealed. 
(6)  Notice of the proposed hearing of the appeal shall be mailed to the person or entity whose appeal is the subject of the hearing; to the owner of the property that is the subject of the hearing if the owner did not initiate the hearing; to the owners of all parcels of land abutting the parcel of land that is the subject of the hearing; and to any other persons entitled to receive notice as provided by the zoning ordinance. In the absence of evidence to the contrary, the town may rely on the county tax listing to determine owners of property entitled to mailed notice. The notice must be deposited in the mail at least ten days, but not more than 25 days, prior to the date of the hearing. Within that same time period, the town shall also prominently post a notice of the hearing on the site that is the subject of the hearing or on an adjacent street or highway right-of way. 
(7)  Subject to the provisions of subsection (5), the board of adjustment shall hear and decide the appeal within 30 days of the hearing, except with consent by the appellant for additional time. The official who made the decision shall be present at the hearing as a witness. The appellant shall not be limited at the hearing to matters stated in the notice of appeal. If any party or the town would be unduly prejudiced by the presentation of matters not presented in the notice of appeal the board shall continue the hearing. The board of adjustment may reverse or affirm, wholly or partly, or may modify the decision, or determination that ought to be made. The board shall have all the powers of the official who made the decision. 
(8)  When hearing an appeal pursuant to G.S. 160A-400.9(e) or any other appeal in the nature of certiorari, the hearing shall be based on the record below and the scope of review shall be as provided in G.S. 160A-393(k). 
(9)  The parties to an appeal that has been made under this section may agree to mediation or other forms of alternative dispute resolution. 
(10)  The decision of the board of adjustment shall be in writing and shall be mailed by certified mail or hand delivered to the appellant, with a copy delivered to the zoning administrator or secretary of the board to be placed in the zoning files. 
(Ord. No. O-2010-08, 6-14-2010; Ord. No. O-2014-10, 10-13-2014) 
Sec. 58-233. - Variances. 
(a)  Under no circumstances shall the board of adjustment grant a variance to allow a use of land or structures not permitted under the terms of this chapter in the district involved or for a use expressly, or by inference, prohibited in said district. No variances shall be granted by the board of adjustment for the following: 
(1)  Setbacks for signs and areas and/or height of signs. 
(2)  Setbacks for essential services, class III. 
(3)  To change the uses that are permitted on the property in question. 
No variance for setbacks shall be granted which allows the applicant to reduce the applicable setback by more than 50 percent. 
(b)  The board of adjustment shall follow quasi-judicial procedures when deciding requests for variances. The board of adjustment, before granting a variance, shall make the following findings based on substantial, competent and material evidence in the record before them: 
(1)  Unnecessary hardship would result from the strict application of the ordinance. It is not necessary to demonstrate that, in the absence of the variance, no reasonable use can be made of the property. This shall be construed to mean: 
a.  The hardship results from the application of this chapter; 
b.  The hardship results from the conditions that are peculiar to the property, such as location, size, or topography. (Hardships resulting from personal circumstances, as well as hardships resulting from conditions that are common to the neighborhood or the general public, may not be the basis for granting a variance.); and 
c.  The hardship is not the result of actions taken by the applicant or the property owner. (The act of purchasing property with knowledge that circumstances exist that may justify the granting of a variance shall not be regarded as a self-created hardship.) 
(2)  That the variance is in harmony with the general purpose and intent of this chapter and preserves its spirit. 
(3)  That in the granting of the variance, the public safety and welfare have been assured and substantial justice has been done. 
(4)  That the reasons set forth in the application and the hearing justify the granting of a variance, and that the variance is a minimum one that will make possible the reasonable use of land or structures. 
(c)  Appropriate conditions may be imposed on any variance, provided that the conditions are reasonably related to the variance. 
(d)  Any order of the board of adjustment in granting a variance shall expire if a zoning permit, or certificate of occupancy for such use if a zoning permit is not required, has not been obtained within one year from the date of the decision. 
(Ord. No. O-2010-08, 6-14-2010; Ord. No. O-2012-10, 6-11-2012; Ord. No. O-2014-10, 10-13-2014) 
Sec. 58-234. - Variance application procedure. 
    The following regulations apply to all applications submitted to the board of adjustment: 
(1)  Before a petition for an interpretation, appeal, or variance shall be considered, a completed application of a form provided by the town, accompanied by a fee (as established by the town council), shall be submitted to the zoning administrator. No application shall be considered complete or processed by the zoning administrator unless accompanied by said fee; provided, however, that the fee shall be waived for any petition initiated by the zoning administrator. The application shall contain the name, address and telephone number of the applicant, and property owner (if different from applicant), and a description of the subject property with reference to the deed book and page. The application shall also contain a list of names and addresses of adjoining and contiguous property owners on all sides and across any street and public right-of-way from the subject property. This information shall be based upon the current year Union County and Mecklenburg County tax records. The application shall be accompanied by a map clearly showing the subject property and all contiguous property on either side and all property across any street or public right-of-way from the subject property. 
(2)  The filing of any application stays all proceedings unless the zoning administrator certifies to the board of adjustment that a stay in his opinion will cause imminent peril to life or property, or that because the violation charged is transitory in nature a stay would seriously interfere with enforcement of this chapter. In that event, proceedings shall not be stayed, except by a restraining order, which may be granted by the board of adjustment, or by a court of record, on application, on notice to the zoning administrator, and on due cause shown. 
(3)  The board of adjustment shall hold a hearing on all complete applications no later than 40 days after the application has been filed with the zoning administrator unless consented to by the applicant. 
(4)  Before the board of adjustment holds a public hearing with regards to a variance, the board of adjustment shall give notice of the public hearing by sending notices by first class mail to the person or entity whose appeal is the subject of the hearing; to the owner of the property that is the subject of the hearing if the owner did not initiate the hearing; to the owners of all parcels of land abutting the parcel of land that is the subject of the hearing; and to any other persons entitled to receive notice as provided by the zoning ordinance. In the absence of evidence to the contrary, the town may rely on the county tax listing to determine owners of property entitled to mailed notice. The notice must be deposited in the mail at least ten days, but not more than 25 days, prior to the date of the hearing. Within that same time period, the town shall also prominently post a notice of the hearing on the site that is the subject of the hearing or on an adjacent street or highway right-of way. 
(5)  A written application for a variance must also demonstrate in detail, the following: 
a.  That special conditions and circumstances exist which are peculiar to the land, structure or building involved and which are not applicable to other lands, structures or buildings in the same district. 
b.  That a literal interpretation of the provisions of this chapter would deprive the applicant of rights commonly enjoyed by other properties in the same district under the terms of this chapter. 
c.  That said circumstances do not result from the actions of the applicant. 
d.  That granting the variance requested will not confer on the applicant any special privilege that is denied by this chapter to other lands, structures or buildings in the same district. 
e.  That no nonconforming use of neighboring land, structures or buildings in the same district and no permitted use of land, structures or buildings in other districts will be considered grounds for the issuance of a variance. 
(6)  In all matters before the board of adjustment, the applicant shall have the burden of providing substantial, competent and material evidence in support of the application. 
(7)  Subsequent to the issuance of a zoning permit and construction of a building or structure, the board of adjustment shall have no authority to issue a variance for a waiver of a setback or bulk requirement for a building or structure if the applicant had not first submitted a foundation survey, in accordance with subsection 58-208(8), subsequent to the construction of the foundation and prior to the application for a certificate of compliance. Applicants may still apply for such variance prior to commencement of any construction without meeting the foundation survey requirement. 
(Ord. No. O-2010-08, 6-14-2010; Ord. No. O-2014-10, 10-13-2014; O-2016-09, 7-18-2016) 
Sec. 58-235. - Board of adjustment action. 
(a)  The concurrent vote of four-fifths of the members of the board of adjustment, not otherwise vacant or excused, shall be necessary to grant any variance from the provisions of this chapter. A majority of the members shall be required to decide any other quasi-judicial matter or to determine an appeal made in the nature of certiorari. At least one of the sitting members shall be the chairman or the vice chairman. For the purposes of this subsection, vacant positions on the board and members who are disqualified from voting on a quasi-judicial matter shall not be considered members of the board for calculation of the requisite majority if there are no qualified alternates available to take the place of such members. 
(b)  Any member of the board who declares that a potential conflict of interest may exist with respect to any petition or application before the board may be excused and replaced by an alternate. Impermissible conflicts include, but are not limited to, a member having a fixed opinion prior to hearing the matter that is not susceptible to change, undisclosed ex parte communications, a close familial, business, or other associational relationship with an affected person, or a financial interest in the outcome of the matter. If an objection is raised to a member's participation and that member does not recuse himself or herself, the remaining members shall by majority vote rule on the objection. In the event fewer than three members remain, no reversal of any prior decision may be made. 
(c)  The board shall determine contested facts and make its decision within 30 days of the hearing, unless consented to by the applicant. Every quasi-judicial decision shall be based upon competent, material and substantial evidence in the record. Each quasi-judicial decision shall be reduced to writing and reflect the board's determination of contested facts and their application to the applicable standards. The written decision shall be signed by the chair or other duly authorized member of the board. A quasi-judicial decision is effective upon filing the written decision with the clerk to the board or such other office or official as the ordinance specifies. 
(d)  All decisions of the board of adjustment shall be filed with the zoning administrator and a written copy thereof shall be delivered by personal delivery, electronic mail, or by first class mail to the applicant, property owner, and to any person who has submitted a written request for a copy, prior to the date the decision becomes effective. The person required to provide notice shall certify that proper notice has been made.

Sec. 58-236. - Appealing of decision by board of adjustment. 
(a)  A written application for a rehearing shall be made in the same manner as provided for an original hearing within a period of 15 days after the date of the written decision of denial of the original application. In addition, specific information to enable the board of adjustment to determine whether or not there has been a substantial change in fact, evidence, or conditions in the case, shall be presented in writing, or graphically. A rehearing shall be denied by the board, if, in its judgment, such change in facts, evidence, or conditions has not been proven. In the event that the board finds that a rehearing is warranted, it shall thereupon proceed in the same manner as prescribed for in the original hearing. 
(b)  Upon the denial of the original application, or upon the denial of an application for which a rehearing has been conducted, a similar application may not be filed for a period of one year after the date of denial of the final application. 
(c)  Every quasi-judicial decision shall be subject to review by the superior court division of the general courts of justice of the state by proceedings in the nature of certiorari. Any petition for review by the superior court shall be duly verified and filed with the clerk of superior court within 30 days after the decision of the board is filed with the secretary of the board, or after a written copy thereof is delivered to every aggrieved party who has filed a written request for such copy with the secretary or chairman of the board of adjustment at the time of its hearing of the case, whichever is later. The decision of the board of adjustment shall be delivered to the aggrieved party either by personal service or by certified mail, return receipt requested. 
(Ord. No. O-2010-08, 6-14-2010; Ord. No. O-2014-10, 10-13-2014) 
Sec. 58-237. - Administration of oaths to witnesses and subpoenas. 
    The chairman of the board of adjustment, the town clerk or any member temporarily acting as chairman is authorized in his official capacity to administer oaths to witnesses in any matter coming before the board. Any person who, while under oath during a proceeding before the board of adjustment, willfully swears falsely is guilty of a class 1 misdemeanor. 
    The board of adjustment through the chair, or in the chair's absence anyone acting as chair, may subpoena witnesses and compel the production of evidence. To request issuance of a subpoena, persons with standing under G.S. 160A-393(d) may make a written request to the chair explaining why it is necessary for certain witnesses or evidence to be compelled. The chair shall issue requested subpoenas he or she determines to be relevant, reasonable in nature and scope, and not oppressive. The chair shall rule on any motion to quash or modify a subpoena. Decisions regarding subpoenas made by the chair may be appealed to the full board of adjustment. If a person fails or refuses to obey a subpoena issued pursuant to this subsection, the board of adjustment or the party seeking the subpoena may apply to the general court of justice for an order requiring that its subpoena be obeyed, and the court shall have jurisdiction to issue these orders after notice to all proper parties.

ARTICLE IX. - AMENDMENTS 

Sec. 58-270. - Amendments to text and map. 
(a)  Zoning regulations and restrictions and district boundaries may from time to time be amended, supplemented, changed, modified or repealed in the following manner: 
(1)  The planning board or the town council or any person may institute an application for a change in the text or a change in the zoning map. However, only the owner of the property to be rezoned or his authorized agent may request that property be rezoned to a conditional zoning district. 
(2)  A property owner (or his authorized agent) may request that his property be rezoned to a conditional zoning district established in subsection 58-5(3). Procedures for having property zoned to a conditional zoning district are found in section 58-271. 
(b)  The application for a rezoning of a particular piece of property and change in the zoning map, other than for conditional zoning districts, shall be made in duplicate on a form provided by the zoning administrator. No application shall be considered complete or processed by the zoning administrator unless accompanied by a fee, in accordance with a fee schedule adopted by the town council. In addition, the town shall be reimbursed by the applicant for all costs associated with the town's engineering and/or consulting services with respect to review of amendments to text and map prior to amendments to text and map approval. All expenses incurred by the town for the processing of a rezoning application shall be paid prior to the issuance of a final notification of action taken. 
(1)  Each noncontiguous parcel of land for which a rezoning is requested shall be considered as a separate application, and a fee as established by the town council shall accompany each application. There shall be no fee for applications initiated by any town governmental agency. 
(2)  For the purpose of this subsection, land traversed and adjoining property shall be construed to mean and include property on the opposite side of any street, stream, railroad, road or highway from the property sought to be rezoned and in the event the owner of the property sought to be rezoned owns other property adjoining the property sought to be rezoned, the adjoining property shall also be construed to mean and include property adjoining the other property of the owner which adjoins the property sought to be rezoned. 
(c)  The application for a change in the text shall be made in duplicate, on a form provided by the zoning administrator and the filing fee and the disposition of such fee in accordance with a fee schedule adopted by the town council. No application shall be considered complete or processed by the zoning administrator until such fee is paid. The application shall contain a reference to the specific section subsection, paragraph or item proposed to be changed, as well as the wording of the proposed change and the reasons therefor. In addition, the town shall be reimbursed by the applicant for all costs associated with the town's engineering and/or consulting services with respect to review of the amendments to text and map prior to amendments to text and map approval. 
(d)  Once a completed application has been received by the zoning administrator, he shall present the application to the planning board at its next regularly scheduled meeting occurring at least 15 days after the application has been filed. The planning board shall have 30 days from the date of referral to review the application and to submit its recommendation to the town council. If a recommendation is not made during said time period, the application shall be forwarded to the town council without a recommendation. A planning board member shall not vote on any zoning map or text amendment where the outcome of the matter being considered is reasonably likely to have a direct, substantial, and readily identifiable financial impact on the member. 
(e)  The planning board may make one of the following recommendations to the town council. If the application is for rezoning and change in the zoning map, the planning board may make one of the following recommendations: 
(1)  Grant the rezoning as requested; 
(2)  Grant the rezoning with a reduction of the area requested; 
(3)  Grant the rezoning to a more restricted district or districts (for the purposes of this article, the zoning districts of this chapter are listed in the following order from most restrictive to least restrictive: R-CD, R-80, R-60, R-40, R-40(D), B-1, B-2); or 
(4)  Recommend that the application be denied. 
Upon making a recommendation, the planning board shall advise and comment on whether the proposed amendment is consistent with any comprehensive plan that has been adopted and any other officially adopted plan that is applicable. The planning board shall provide a written recommendation to the town council that addresses plan consistency and other matters as deemed appropriate by the planning board, but a comment by the planning board that a proposed amendment is inconsistent with the comprehensive plan shall not preclude consideration or approval of the proposed amendment by the governing board. 
(f)  If the application is to amend the text of this chapter, the planning board may make one of the following recommendations to the town council: 
(1)  Adoption of the amendment as written; 
(2)  Adoption of the amendment as revised by the planning board; or 
(3)  Rejection of the amendment. 
(g)  The zoning administrator shall transmit any decision of the planning board to the town council. Once action has been taken by the planning board or the time for action by the planning board has expired, the town council shall, no later than their next regularly scheduled meeting, consider calling for a public hearing or a requested conditional use permit, conditional zoning permit, zoning change, or other matter providing for public hearing under this chapter. Notification of the public hearing shall be made in the following manner: 
(1)  A notice shall be published in the newspaper having general circulation in the area once a week for two successive weeks, the first notice to be published not less than ten days, nor more than 25 days prior to the date established for the hearing. In computing such time the date of publication is not to be included but the date of the hearing shall be included. 
(2)  A notice shall be conspicuously placed in the town hall not less than ten days, nor more than 25 days before the date established for the public hearing. However, failure to post a notice as provided by this section shall not invalidate any action taken with regard to the application. 
(3)  A notice shall be prominently posted on the subject property or on an adjacent public street or highway right-of-way. When an application concerns multiple parcels, a posting on each individual parcel is not required, but sufficient notices shall be posted to provide reasonable notice to interested persons. 
(4)  A notice shall be sent by first class mail to all owners of parcels of land abutting the subject property. The owners shall be identified by county tax listings and the notice shall be sent to the last address listed for each owner on the county tax abstracts. The notice shall be deposited in the mail at least ten, but not more than 25, days before the date of the public hearing. In computing notice periods under this section, the date of mailing is not to be included, but the date of the hearing shall be included. 
(5)  A notice shall be sent by first class mail to the owner of the subject property. The owner shall be identified by county tax listings and the notice shall be sent to the last address listed for the owner on the county tax abstracts. This notice shall be deposited in the mail at least ten, but not more than 25, days before the date of the public hearing. In computing notice periods under this section, the date of mailing is not to be included, but the date of the hearing shall be included. 
(6)  The zoning administrator shall certify that the requirements of subsections (g)(1)-(g)(4) of this section have been met. The town shall charge the applicant a separate fee to cover costs incurred. 
(h)  If any resident or property owner in the town submits a written statement regarding a proposed amendment, modification, or repeal to a zoning ordinance to the clerk to the board at least two business days prior to the proposed vote on such change, the clerk to the board shall deliver such written statement to the town council. If the proposed change is the subject of a quasi-judicial proceeding under G.S. § 160A-388, the clerk shall provide only the names and addresses of the individuals providing written comment, and the provision of such names and addresses to all members of the board shall not disqualify any member of the board from voting. 
(i)  After the public hearing has been conducted and officially closed, the town council shall render a decision concerning the proposal not later than the next regularly scheduled town council meeting. The decision shall be made in any one of the methods provided in subsections (e) or (f) of this section. A town council member shall not vote on any zoning map or text amendment where the outcome of the matter being considered is reasonably likely to have a direct, substantial, and readily identifiable financial impact on the member. 
(j)  Prior to adopting or rejecting any zoning amendment, the town council shall adopt a statement describing whether its action is consistent with an adopted comprehensive plan and explaining why the town council considers the action taken to be reasonable and in the public interest. 
(k)  If the town council has denied an application for the change of any zoning district or change in zoning text, it shall not thereafter accept any application for the same property or any portion thereof or similar change in the zoning text until the expiration of one year from the date of such previous denial, except as permitted in section 58-85.

Sec. 58-271. - Conditional zoning district amendment procedure. 
(a)  Traffic impact analysis. The applicant shall be required to meet the requirements described in both the Traffic Impact Analysis Process and Procedures Manual, and Appendix C: Traffic Impact Analysis. 
(b)  Application. 
(1)  Petitioning for a conditional zoning district and can be initiated only by the owner of the property or by his authorized agent or the Town of Weddington. All applications must include a site plan, drawn to scale, and supporting text, all of which will, if approved, become a part of the amendment. The site plan, drawn by an architect, landscape architect, or engineer licensed to practice in the state, shall include any supporting information and text that specifies the actual use or uses intended for the property and any rules, regulations and conditions that, in addition to all predetermined requirements of this chapter, will govern the development and use of the property. The applicant shall, at a minimum, include as part of the application each of the items listed below: 
a.  A boundary survey showing the total acreage, present zoning classifications, date and north arrow.

o.  Lighting plan and proof of conformity to the article IV of chapter 14. 
(2)  Said site plan, including all additional information shown on it, shall constitute part of the application for rezoning to a conditional zoning district. The zoning administrator, on a case-by-case basis and at his sole discretion, may specify how many copies of the application the applicant must submit in order to have enough copies for review. No application shall be deemed complete unless accompanied by a fee in accordance with the most recently adopted fee schedule adopted by the town council. Furthermore, the applicant acknowledges that he/she will reimburse the town for all engineering and consulting services associated with the review of the conditional zoning request prior to any zoning permits being issued by the town for such project. 
(3)  It is further acknowledged that the town reserves the right to approve a rezoning to a B-1(CD), B-2(CD) or MX conditional district simultaneously with the approval of a sketch plan for a major subdivision, providing that all applicable provisions of this section and article II, chapter 46 are followed. Furthermore, an application to rezone property to a conditional zoning district will also require the applicant to submit all construction plans for infrastructure improvements, individual buildings, and signs as provided in subsection (h)(8) of this section. 
(c)  Additional requirements. When reviewing an application to rezone property to a conditional zoning district, the planning board and/or town council may request additional information in addition to that required in subsection (a) of this section, as they deem necessary. 
(d)  Public involvement meeting. Once the requisite copies of the application have been submitted to the town and the requisite fees have been paid, a public involvement meeting (PIM) shall be scheduled and held. Such meetings shall occur prior to any recommendation by the planning staff and approval by the town council. The PIM is designed to provide an opportunity for community involvement in accordance with the following requirements: 
(1)  The applicant shall provide an agenda, schedule, location and list of participants such as landscape architects, engineers, etc., to answer questions from citizens and service providers for the project in cooperation with the planning staff. 
(2)  The PIM shall be a minimum of four hours. Two hours shall be scheduled during normal business hours to allow service providers (such as the state department of transportation, utilities, or the state department of environment and natural resources) to participate as needed and to allow citizens to appear at a convenient time throughout the period. It is strongly recommended that this portion of the PIM take place at the proposed development site. In addition, a two-hour evening period shall be scheduled at the Town Hall or other nearby location agreed upon by the applicant and planning staff. 
(3)  Notice of public involvement meetings shall, at a minimum, be given as follows: 
a.  A public notice shall be sent by the town to a newspaper having general circulation in the town not less than ten days or more than 25 days prior to the date of the PIM. 
b.  A notice shall be sent by first class mail by the town to the owners of all properties that lie within 1,300 feet of the exterior boundaries of the proposed development. The applicant shall furnish the town with mailing labels that depict the names and addresses of all such owners. Such notice shall be mailed to said property owners not less than ten days prior to the date of the PIM. The notification shall contain information regarding the PIM time and location, as well as a general description of the proposal. 
c.  A PIM notification sign shall be posted by the town in a conspicuous place at the property not less than ten days prior to the PIM. The sign shall indicate the date, time and location of the PIM. 
d.  The applicant shall reimburse the town for all expenses incurred to provide the notifications required by this subsection. 
(4)  Town staff will keep notes of citizen comments received during the PIM. In addition, all service provider comments shall be recorded by the town, including, but not limited to, all correspondence, reports and oral comments by service providers. After town review, this information will be available at the Town Hall and at subsequent meetings concerning the project. When practical, comments, ideas and suggestions presented during the PIM should be incorporated by the developer into the proposed development. 
(5)  Following the PIM, the applicant shall have the opportunity to make changes to the application to take into account information and comments received. One or more revised copies of the application shall be submitted to the zoning administrator for review. No additional fee shall be required to be paid for making such changes provided the zoning administrator receives the revised application within 30 days following the PIM. If a revised application is not received during said 30-day period, or if the applicant otherwise notifies the zoning administrator in writing that no revised application will be submitted, the zoning administrator shall review the original application. 
(e)  Zoning administrator approval. The zoning administrator shall have up to 30 days following any revision of the application (or up to 60 days following the PIM, if no revision is submitted) to make comments. If the administrator forwards no comments to the applicant by the end of said period, the application shall be submitted to the planning board for their review without any further comment. If the zoning administrator provides the applicant with comments on the application, the applicant shall have ten days after receiving the comments to inform the zoning administrator whether the application will be further revised. If the applicant informs the zoning administrator that the application will not be further revised, the zoning administrator shall submit the application to the planning board for their review at the next regularly scheduled meeting. If the applicant informs the zoning administrator that the application will be further revised, the zoning administrator shall not submit the current application to the planning board. Once the applicant submits a revised application, it shall be subject to review in accordance with this section. 
(f)  Planning board review. The applicant shall submit at least ten copies of the application to the zoning administrator for transmittal to the planning board and other appropriate agencies. The zoning administrator shall present any properly completed application to the planning board at its next regularly scheduled meeting occurring at least 15 days after the application has been deemed complete and ready for submission to the planning board in accordance with subsection 58-271(d)(4) of this section. The planning board may, by majority vote, shorten or waive the 15-day time period provided in this section for receipt of a completed application. The planning board shall have 30 days from the date that the application is presented to it to review the application and to take action. If such period expires without action taken by the planning board, the application shall then be transferred to the town council without a planning board recommendation. 
(1)  A planning board member shall not vote on any conditional zoning amendment where the outcome of the matter being considered is reasonably likely to have a direct, substantial, and readily identifiable financial impact on the member. 
(2)  Upon making a recommendation, the planning board shall advise and comment on whether the proposed amendment is consistent with any comprehensive plan that has been adopted and with any other officially adopted plan that is applicable. The planning board shall provide a written recommendation to the town council that addresses plan consistency and other matters as deemed appropriate by the planning board, but a comment by the planning board that a proposed amendment is inconsistent with the comprehensive plan shall not preclude consideration or approval of the proposed amendment by the town council. 
(g)  Action by town council. Conditional zoning district decisions are a legislative process subject to judicial review using the same procedures and standards of review as apply to general use district zoning decisions. Conditional zoning district decisions shall take into account applicable adopted land use plans for the area and other adopted land use policy documents and/or ordinances. Prior to making a decision on rezoning a piece of property to a conditional zoning district, the town council shall hold a public hearing. Notice of such public hearing shall be given as prescribed in subsection 58-270(g). 
(1)  A statement analyzing the reasonableness of the proposed rezoning shall be prepared for each application for a rezoning to a conditional district. 
(2)  Once the public hearing has been held, the town council shall take action on the application. The town council shall have the authority to: 
a.  Approve the application as submitted; 
b.  Deny approval of the application; 
c.  Approve the application with modifications that are agreed to by the applicant; or 
d.  Submit the application to the planning board for further study. The application may be resubmitted to the planning board with any modifications that are agreed to by the applicant. The planning board shall have up to 30 days from the date of such submission to make a report to the town council. Once the planning board issues its report, or if no report is issued within that time period, the town council can take action on the application in accordance with this subsection. 
(3)  In the town council's sole discretion, it may hold additional public hearings on an application at any time before it takes a final vote to approve or deny that application. 
(4)  A town council member shall not vote on any conditional zoning amendment where the outcome of the matter being considered is reasonably likely to have a direct, substantial and readily identifiable financial impact on the member. 
(h)  Conditions to approval of application. In approving an application for the reclassification of a piece of property to a conditional zoning district, the planning board may recommend, and the town council may request that reasonable and appropriate conditions be attached to approval of the application. Any such conditions may relate to the relationship of the proposed use to the surrounding property, to proposed support facilities (e.g., parking areas, pedestrian circulation systems), to screening and landscaping, to the timing of development, to street and right-of-way improvements, to water and sewer improvements, to provision of open space, or to any other matters that the planning board or town council may find appropriate or the applicant may propose. Such conditions to approval may include dedication of right-of-way or easements for streets and/or utilities to serve the development. The applicant shall have a reasonable opportunity to consider and respond to any such proposed conditions prior to final action by the town council. 
(i)  Review of plans and construction documents. 
(1)  If the town council approves the application, the applicant's plans and construction documents will be subject to review in accordance with this section. 
(2)  Where the DRB exists when the applicant submits any plans for review under this section, the DRB will review the plans in accordance with the following procedures. If no DRB exists when the applicant submits a set of plans for review, the functions of the DRB will be performed by the town planning board. 
a.  Review of building schematics, landscape plans and signs. 
1.  The applicant shall submit to the planning staff for review and comment detailed plans and schematic designs for all buildings on the site, landscaping on the site and signs on the site. The planning staff may provide such submitted plans to town consultants or to other third parties to assist the town's review. The applicant shall reimburse the town for all costs and expenses that the town incurs in reviewing plans under this section. 
2.  The applicant need not submit plans for all buildings, landscaping and signs simultaneously, and may instead submit multiple sets of plans, each of which shall be separately and independently reviewed. Notwithstanding this provision, the DRB or the town council need not review plans submitted to it if, in its sole discretion, it determines that it cannot effectively review those plans without simultaneously reviewing plans for other buildings, landscaping and/or signs. 
3.  If the zoning administrator determines that a set of plans submitted by the applicant is complete and contains all information necessary to determine if those plans satisfy the standards specified in this subsection, the zoning administrator shall forward those plans to the DRB. 
4.  The DRB shall have 60 days from the date a set of plans is submitted to it to recommend to the town council whether it should approve those plans. The DRB's recommendation will be based solely upon its determination of whether the plans and schematic designs satisfy the standards specified in this section and meet the requirements of the town's architectural design standards (see chapter 14, article V). If the DRB recommends that any plans not be approved, it shall state the reasons for that recommendation in writing and shall inform the applicant that it may withdraw those plans. 
5.  A set of plans shall be submitted to the town council at its next regularly scheduled meeting that occurs at least 15 days after the DRB issues its recommendation on those plans. The applicant may withdraw any plans before they are submitted to the council, and the council will not review any plans that are withdrawn. If the DRB makes no recommendation to the council within 60 days after a set of plans are submitted to it, the plans shall be submitted to the town council for review without a DRB recommendation. 
6.  The town will approve any plans submitted to it unless those plans either violate any requirements of this chapter, including any requirements applicable to the particular conditional zoning district at issue, violate any requirements, standards or conditions contained in the applicant's rezoning application, violate any requirements, standards, or conditions that are imposed under subsection (g) of this section, or will cause the development not to be in harmony with its surrounding area (collectively, the provisions of this subsection constitute the standards referenced in this section). 
7.  After reviewing plans submitted to it, the town council shall have the authority to: 
i.  Approve the plans; 
ii.  Deny approval of the plans; 
iii.  Approve the plans with any modifications that are agreed to by the applicant; or 
iv.  Submit the plans to the DRB for further study. The plans may be resubmitted to the DRB with any modifications that are agreed to by the town council and the applicant. The DRB shall have 30 days from the date plans are resubmitted to it to make another recommendation to the town council on whether those plans should be approved. If the DRB makes no recommendation to the council within that time frame, the plans shall be resubmitted to the town council for its review. 
8.  No building may be constructed unless plans for that building have been approved by the town council in accordance with the process described in this subsection. No landscaping may begin unless plans for that landscaping have been approved by the town council in accordance with the above process. No signs may be erected unless the plans for those signs have been approved by the town council in accordance with the process described in this subsection. 
b.  Review of other construction documents. 
1.  Other than schematic designs and plans for buildings, landscaping and signs, all other plans, designs and other documents concerning any other construction or development activities will be reviewed in accordance with this subsection. Documents subject to review under this subsection will be referred to generically as construction documents. Construction documents include, by example only and without limitation, plans for all road improvements, stormwater detention, preconstruction and postconstruction best management practices and grading, soil and erosion control. 
2.  The applicant shall submit all construction documents to the town's zoning administrator for review. The applicant shall reimburse the town for all costs and expenses the town incurs in reviewing construction documents. The zoning administrator will approve all construction documents unless they violate the standards of this section. No construction or development contemplated by any construction document may be begun unless and until the zoning administrator has approved that construction document in accordance with this subsection. 
c.  Post approval review. After any and all plans and construction documents for an improvement have been approved, the town staff or other town representatives will periodically inspect that improvement during the construction process and may halt any construction or development that violates the standards. Following completion of the project, the applicant shall request a final inspection. If all improvements and all other development satisfies the standards, the town will issue a certificate of zoning compliance. 
(j)  Changes to an approved conditional zoning district. 
(1)  Except as provided in this section, a request to change the site plan or the conditions governing an approved conditional zoning district shall be processed in accordance with this section as a new application to rezone property to a conditional zoning district. 
(2)  The zoning administrator shall have the delegated authority to approve an administrative amendment to an approved conditional zoning district site plan or to the governing conditions without the requested change having to be approved as a new application in accordance with this section. Such administrative amendments shall include only those changes that do not significantly alter the site plan or its conditions and do not significantly impact abutting properties. 
(3)  No administrative amendment may increase the amount of allowed nonresidential development by more than ten percent of the approved square footage or 1,000 square feet, whichever is less. No administrative amendment may increase the amount of residential development by more than ten percent of the approved square footage, if a maximum square footage for residential development was imposed, or may increase the maximum number of allowed dwelling units by more than five. 
(4)  Any request for an administrative amendment shall be in writing, signed by the property owner, and it shall detail the requested change. The applicant must provide any additional information requested by the zoning administrator. Accompanying the written request must be the applicable fee for administrative review, if any, that is required by the current town fee schedule. Any decision by the zoning administrator to approve or deny a request for an administrative amendment must be in writing and must state the grounds for approval or denial. The zoning administrator shall always have the discretion to decline to exercise the authority delegated by this section because the zoning administrator is uncertain if the requested change would qualify as an administrative amendment or because the zoning administrator determines that a public hearing and town council consideration is appropriate under the circumstances. If the zoning administrator declines to exercise the authority delegated by this section, the applicant can only apply for a rezoning in accordance with this section. 
(k)  Statement of readiness. The petitioner shall submit a statement indicating readiness to proceed with the proposed development by filing with the town council no later than ten days of the approval of the conditional zoning district, a statement signed by the owner or owners of the proposed development that the actual construction shall begin within one year from the date the conditional zoning district was approved, and that the construction shall be completed within 18 months from the approval of the conditional zoning district. In the event the planning board and the town council find that the intent of this section has not been met or that construction has not begun and has not been completed within 18 months, the town may initiate the rezoning of the property in accordance with article IX of this chapter. Notwithstanding the above, nothing shall prohibit a reasonable extension of the 18-month limit by the town council. 
(Ord. No. O-2006-20, § 12.2, 11-13-2006; Ord. No. O-2009-08, 7-13-2009; Ord. No. O-2010-09, 6-14-2010; Ord. No. O-2014-21, 12-8-2014; Ord. No. O-2015-09, 6-8-2015) 
Sec. 58-272. - Downtown overlay district. 
(a)  Downtown overlay boundary. The downtown overlay shall apply to those parcels designated as future business in the Town of Weddington 2013 Land Use Plan. The downtown overlay shall include the northern edge of parcels 06150059A and 06150059, the northern boundary; Weddington-Matthews Road, the eastern boundary; Weddington Road (Highway 84), the southern boundary; and Providence Road, the western boundary. All commercial development proposed within any parcels included within this downtown overlay shall also be subject to the requirements of with the MX zoning district (section 58-60), and the conditional zoning application process described in section 58-271. The downtown overlay district will supersede any requirements defined in section 58-60 (MX zoning district) when there is a conflict in the requirements between the two sections. 
(b)  Maintenance of shared facilities within the downtown overlay. The council may require that the owners, or applicants, create, participate in, or be a signatory to a maintenance agreement with any or all other property owners located within the downtown overlay's jurisdiction. The maintenance agreement shall provide for the maintenance of any shared facilities or spaces within the downtown overlay, potentially including but not limited to, shared open space, pathways, roadways, shared entrances, entryway monuments, decorative street lighting, stormwater facilities, and sewer/septic facilities. Existing property owners shall be allowed to join in any maintenance agreements. 
(c)  Access from thoroughfares. 
(1)  Access to parcels within the overlay district from Providence Road shall be limited to the existing number of access points. Any existing access point may be shifted or modified to accommodate new development and/or parking, subject to council approval and provided the total number of access points is not increased. 
(2)  Access to parcels within the overlay district from Weddington-Matthews Road shall be limited to one shared access point. 
(3)  The town council may require all applicants proposing new commercial development within the downtown overlay to coordinate with NCDOT and contribute to the cost of construction for the east-west collector road as shown in the local area regional transportation plan. The cost of the contribution will be approved by both the town council and NCDOT and may be placed into an escrow account, or a similar account, until sufficient funds are in place for construction of the road. 
a.  The town council may require that maintenance of the collector road to be the responsibility of any or all of the owners within the downtown overlay, until the point that NCDOT takes over maintenance of the road. 
b.  If and when the collector road is constructed, it shall be limited to one shared access point to parcels within the downtown overlay. 
(d)  Connectivity within the Town Center. 
(1)  Any proposed development site plan must create roadway stubs to connect with any or all adjacent parcels also located within the downtown overlay district. 
(2)  Any proposed development site plan must create pedestrian pathway stubs to connect with any or all adjacent parcels also located within the downtown overlay district. 
(3)  Any proposed development site plan must include clearly identifiable crosswalks to allow pedestrians to safely cross parking lots and interior streets. 
(4)  Any proposed development site plan must coordinate with NCDOT and include sidewalks along the thoroughfare or the collector road. Maintenance of the sidewalks must be the responsibility of the property owner, or included within a maintenance agreement including several property owners. 
(5)  Any proposed development must include street trees and decorative street lighting to encourage pedestrian activity. All street trees must be included in the Town of Weddington's List of Acceptable Plant Species. 
(e)  Open space and natural features. 
(1)  Any proposed development within the Town Center shall be required to provide ten percent open space. The development shall also be required to dedicate an additional ten percent of open space to create shared open spaces. The council will approve the location of any shared open space, and may require that the shared open space be located on the boundary of the parcel so that it can be combined with the shared open space of an adjoining parcel. 
(2)  Any application for a conditional rezoning for property within the downtown overlay district shall include an environmental survey locating and detailing all natural features on the property, including but not limited to trees. The town council may require that any or all existing natural features on the property be preserved and/or maintained by the property owner as a condition of a conditional zoning approval. 
(f)  Design and parking. 
(1)  New construction should align facades with those of any adjacent structures. Exceptions may be granted if the setback is pedestrian-oriented and contributes to the quality and character of the streetscape. An example would be for outdoor dining. 
(2)  All roof equipment must be screened from public view and shall not be visible from the street. 
(3)  All exterior trash and storage areas, service yards, loading areas, transformers and air conditioning units must be screened from view. Camouflaging air conditioning units is an acceptable screening method. The screening must use the same materials, color and/or style as the primary building in order to be architecturally compatible with the adjacent building. 
(4)  Shared entry monuments located at shared access points shall be predominantly brick and compatible with existing entryway monuments within the downtown overlay district. Maintenance of the entry monument structures and any landscaping associated with the monuments shall be the responsibility of property owners within the downtown overlay district and/or signatories to the maintenance agreement. 
(5)  Decorative street lighting shall be approved by the Town of Weddington, and must be installed within any new development proposed within the downtown overlay at the sole cost of the developer. The decorative street lighting should be placed at an appropriate and uniform distance along the roadways or pathways, and shall be coordinated with the spacing and locations of the lighting on adjoining parcels within the downtown overlay district. 
(6)  Proposed structures within the downtown overlay district must be designed in a manner that promotes adaptive reuse, as defined in section 58-4. 
(7)  Proposed structures within the downtown overlay should be located towards the exterior of the parcels (along the thoroughfares), and contain interior parking. The town council may approve structures located towards the interior of the parcels if more than one structure is proposed on the same parcel. 
(8)  The town council may reduce parking requirements by up to 50 percent if proposed development provides shared parking between more than one use or property owner. 
(g)  Infrastructure. Any new development within the downtown overlay must connect to a sewer system, whether private or public, unless it is shown to be unreasonable to make the connection, or unless the applicant provides a suitable alternative. 
(h)  Planned unit development. The overlay district is designed to create a unified Town Center out of separate development projects. However, a large area could be developed simultaneously by one developer. One major project could allow for development to meet the intent of the overlay district, while not meeting every specific requirement as stated this section. Therefore, the town council may provide exceptions to any requirements within this ordinance if the overall intent of the ordinance is being met by a proposed development of nine acres or more.

Secs. 58-273-58-290. - Reserved. 
ARTICLE X. - TELECOMMUNICATION TOWERS 

Sec. 58-291. - Intention. 
    In recognition of the Telecommunications Act of 1996, it is the intent of the town to allow communication providers the opportunity to locate towers and related facilities within its jurisdiction in order to provide an adequate level of service to its customers while protecting the health, safety and welfare of the citizens of the town and its extraterritorial jurisdiction. Wireless towers may be considered undesirable with other types of uses, most notably residential; therefore special regulations are necessary to ensure that any adverse affects to existing and future development are mitigated. 
(Ord. No. 87-04-08, § 13.1, 4-8-1987) 
Sec. 58-292. - Maximum height. 
    The maximum allowable height of a tower is 185 feet. No tower shall have a height greater than 185 feet unless the applicant can prove the maximum height will not allow for the provision of adequate service levels (i.e., cannot provide a reasonable level of service in the area). 
(Ord. No. 87-04-08, § 13.2, 4-8-1987) 
Sec. 58-293. - Co-location. 
    It is the intent of the town to encourage providers to co-locate facilities in an effort to reduce the number of telecommunication towers in the town's jurisdiction. All such towers over 150 feet in height must be designed and equipped with the technological and structural capability to accommodate at least three wireless communication carriers. The town requires providers to negotiate in good faith with other wireless communication carriers to lease space at a reasonable cost, and to publicize, either in the newspaper and/or online, the fact that space is available on a leased basis. Co-location of antennas on existing electrical transmission towers may be approved administratively by the zoning officer. For electrical transmission towers, any required accessory structures on the ground must comply with a 15-foot setback from the utility easement line. 
(Ord. No. 87-04-08, § 13.3, 4-8-1987; Ord. No. O-2009-06, 7-13-2009) 
Sec. 58-294. - Requirements for lots with existing use. 
    Where a telecommunication tower is located on a lot with an existing principal use, the tower shall be located in the rear yard only. An access road at least 12 feet wide shall be maintained by the property owner and/or the applicant from a public street to the tower for use by service and emergency vehicles. A minimum separation of 20 feet is required between structures. 
(Ord. No. 87-04-08, § 13.4, 4-8-1987) 
Sec. 58-295. - Compliance with federal standards. 
    The town recognizes that a tower cannot be prohibited, nor can a conditional zoning permit be denied on the basis of environmental or health concerns relating to radio emissions if the tower complies with the Federal Radio Frequency Emission Standards. The town requires that the applicant must provide documentation proving that the proposed tower complies with the Federal Radio Frequency Emission Standards. 
(Ord. No. 87-04-08, § 13.5, 4-8-1987; Ord. No. O-2011-13, 9-12-2011) 
Sec. 58-296. - Accessory structures. 
    Wherever feasible, all accessory structures on the ground which contain switching equipment or other related equipment must be designed to closely resemble the neighborhood's basic architecture or the architecture and style of the principal use on the property. 
(Ord. No. 87-04-08, § 13.6, 4-8-1987) 
Sec. 58-297. - Screening. 
    Screening is required in the form of shrubs and/or trees along all sides of the perimeter of the telecommunication tower site as per section 58-8. In addition, a minimum eight-foot-high fence is required immediately around the tower and any equipment buildings, with the screening to be located on the outside of the fenced area. It will be the responsibility of the provider to keep all landscaping material free from disease and properly maintained in order to fulfill the purpose for which it was established. The owners of the property and any tenant on the property where screening is required shall be jointly and severally responsible for the maintenance of all screen materials. Such maintenance shall include all actions necessary to keep the screened area free of litter and debris, to keep plantings healthy, and to keep planting areas neat in appearance. Any vegetation that constitutes part of the screening shall be replaced in the event it dies. Applicants that are building new towers with co-location opportunities shall plan the fence and screening to accommodate future providers on the site such that the fence and screening surrounds all future structures and the tower. 
(Ord. No. 87-04-08, § 13.7, 4-8-1987)

Sec. 58-412. - Findings of fact. 
(a)  The flood-prone areas within the jurisdiction of the Town of Weddington are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life, property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures of flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare. 
(b)  These flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains causing increases in flood heights and velocities and by the occupancy in flood-prone areas of uses vulnerable to floods or other hazards. 
(Ord. No. O-2008-10, 10-13-2008) 
Sec. 58-413. - Statement of purpose. 
    It is the purpose of this article to promote public health, safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions within flood-prone areas by provisions designed to: 
(1)  Restrict or prohibit uses that are dangerous to health, safety and property due to water or erosion hazards or that result in damaging increases in erosion, flood heights or velocities; 
(2)  Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities that serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction; 
(3)  Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels and natural protective barriers, which are involved in the accommodation of floodwaters; 
(4)  Control filling, grading, dredging, and all other development that may increase erosion or flood damage; and 
(5)  Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers that will unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands. 
(Ord. No. O-2008-10, 10-13-2008) 
Sec. 58-414. - Objectives. 
    The objectives of this article are to: 
(1)  Protect human life, safety and health; 
(2)  Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects; 
(3)  Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public; 
(4)  Minimize prolonged business losses and interruptions; 
(5)  Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities (i.e. water and gas mains, electric, telephone, cable and sewer lines, streets, and bridges) that are located in flood-prone areas; 
(6)  Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of flood-prone areas; and 
(7)  Ensure that potential buyers are aware that property is in a special flood hazard area.

DIVISION 2. - DEFINITIONS 

Sec. 58-431. - [Defined terms.] 
    Unless specifically defined below, words or phrases used in this article shall be interpreted so as to give them the meaning they have in common usage and to give this article its most reasonable application: 
    Accessory structure (appurtenant structure) means a structure located on the same parcel of property as the principal structure and the use of which is incidental to the use of the principal structure. Garages, carports and storage sheds are common urban accessory structures. Pole barns, hay sheds and the like qualify as accessory structures on farms, and may or may not be located on the same parcel as the farm dwelling or shop building. 
    Addition (to an existing building) means an extension or increase in the floor area or height of a building or structure. 
    Appeal means a request for a review of the floodplain administrator's interpretation of any provision of this article. 
    Area of shallow flooding means a designated zone AO, on a community's flood insurance rate map (FIRM), with base flood depths determined to be from one to three feet. These areas are located where a clearly defined channel does not exist, where the path of flooding is unpredictable and indeterminate, and where velocity flow may be evident. 
    Area of special flood hazard see "Special flood hazard area (SFHA)". 
    Base flood means the flood having a one percent chance of being equaled or exceeded in any given year (also know as the 100-year flood). 
    Base flood elevation (BFE) means a determination of the water surface elevations of the base flood as published in the flood insurance study. When the BFE has not been provided in a "special flood hazard area", it may be obtained from engineering studies available from a federal, state, or other source using FEMA approved engineering methodologies. This elevation, when combined with the "freeboard", establishes the "regulatory flood protection elevation". 
    Basement means any area of the building having its floor subgrade (below ground level) on all sides. 
    Building see "Structure". 
    Chemical storage facility means a building, portion of a building, or exterior area adjacent to a building used for the storage of any chemical or chemically reactive products. 
    Development means any manmade change to improved or unimproved real estate, including, but not limited to, buildings or other structures, mining, dredging, filling, grading, paving, excavation or drilling operations, or storage of equipment or materials. 
    Disposal means, as defined in G.S. 130A-290(a)(6), the discharge, deposit, injection, dumping, spilling, leaking, or placing of any solid waste into or on any land or water so that the solid waste or any constituent part of the solid waste may enter the environment or be emitted into the air or discharged into any waters, including groundwaters. 
    Drainage easement means an area of land dedicated for the purpose of conveying stormwater runoff by means of an open channel or drainage pipe. 
    Elevated building means a nonbasement building which has its lowest elevated floor raised aboveground level by foundation walls, shear walls, posts, piers, pilings, or columns. 
    Encroachment means the advance or infringement of uses, fill, excavation, buildings, structures or development into a floodplain, which may impede or alter the flow capacity of a floodplain. 
    Existing manufactured home park or manufactured home subdivision means a manufactured home park or subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including, at a minimum, the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads) was completed before the initial effective date of the floodplain management regulations adopted by the community. 
    FEMA means Federal Emergency Management Agency, or its designated authority. 
    Flood or flooding means a general and temporary condition of partial or complete inundation of normally dry land areas from: 
(1)  The overflow of inland or tidal waters; and/or 
(2)  The unusual and rapid accumulation or runoff of surface waters from any source. 
    Flood insurance means the insurance coverage provided under the national flood insurance program. 
    Flood insurance rate map (FIRM) means an official map of a community, issued by the Federal Emergency Management Agency, on which both the special flood hazard areas and the risk premium zones applicable to the community are delineated. 
    Flood insurance study (FIS) means an examination, evaluation, and determination of flood hazards, corresponding water surface elevations (if appropriate), flood hazard risk zones, and other flood data in a community issued by the Federal Emergency Management Agency. The flood insurance study report includes flood insurance rate maps (FIRMs) and flood boundary and floodway maps (FBFMs), if published. 
    Flood-prone area see "Floodplain". 
    Flood zone means a geographical area shown on a flood hazard boundary map or flood insurance rate map that reflects the severity or type of flooding in the area. 
    Floodplain means any land area susceptible to being inundated by water from any source. 
    Floodplain administrator is the individual appointed to administer and enforce the floodplain management regulations. 
    Floodplain development permit means any type of permit that is required in conformance with the provisions of this article, prior to the commencement of any development activity. 
    Floodplain management means the operation of an overall program of corrective and preventive measures for reducing flood damage and preserving and enhancing, where possible, natural resources in the floodplain, including, but not limited to, emergency preparedness plans, flood control works, floodplain management regulations, and open space plans. 
    Floodplain management regulations means this article and other zoning ordinances, subdivision regulations, building codes, health regulations, special purpose ordinances, and other applications of police power. This term describes federal, state or local regulations, in any combination thereof, which provide standards for preventing and reducing flood loss and damage. 
    Floodproofing means any combination of structural and nonstructural additions, changes, or adjustments to structures which reduce or eliminate flood damage to real estate or improved real property, water and sanitation facilities, structures, and their contents. 
    Floodway means the channel of a river or other watercourse and the adjacent land areas that must be reserved in order to discharge the base flood without cumulatively increasing the water surface elevation more than one foot. 
    Freeboard means the height added to the base flood elevation (BFE) to account for the many unknown factors that could contribute to flood heights greater that the height calculated for a selected size flood and floodway conditions, such as wave action, blockage of bridge openings, and the hydrological effect of urbanization of the watershed. The base flood elevation (BFE) plus the freeboard establishes the "regulatory flood protection elevation". Freeboard also means the vertical distance between the water level and the top of a structure, such as a dam, that impounds or restrains water. 
    Functionally dependent facility means a facility which cannot be used for its intended purpose unless it is located in close proximity to water, limited to a docking or port facility necessary for the loading and unloading of cargo or passengers, shipbuilding, or ship repair. The term does not include long-term storage, manufacture, sales, or service facilities. 
    Hazardous waste management facility means, as defined in G.S. 130A, Article 9, a facility for the collection, storage, processing, treatment, recycling, recovery, or disposal of hazardous waste. 
    Highest adjacent grade (HAG) means the highest natural elevation of the ground surface, prior to construction, immediately next to the proposed walls of the structure. 
    Historic structure means any structure that is: 
(1)  Listed individually in the National Register of Historic Places (a listing maintained by the US Department of Interior) or preliminarily determined by the Secretary of Interior as meeting the requirements for individual listing on the National Register; 
(2)  Certified or preliminarily determined by the Secretary of Interior as contributing to the historical significance of a registered historic district or a district preliminarily determined by the Secretary to qualify as a registered historic district; 
(3)  Individually listed on a local inventory of historic landmarks in communities with a "certified local government (CLG) program"; or 
(4)  Certified as contributing to the historical significance of a historic district designated by a community with a "certified local government (CLG) program". 
    Certified local government (CLG) programs are approved by the U.S. Department of the Interior in cooperation with the North Carolina Department of Cultural Resources through the state historic preservation officer as having met the requirements of the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966, as amended in 1980.

(g)  Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice specifying the difference between the base flood elevation (BFE) and the elevation to which the structure is to be built and that such construction below the BFE increases risks to life and property, and that the issuance of a variance to construct a structure below the BFE will result in increased premium rates for flood insurance up to $25.00 per $100.00 of insurance coverage. Such notification shall be maintained with a record of all variance actions, including justification for their issuance. 
(h)  The floodplain administrator shall maintain the records of all appeal actions and report any variances to the Federal Emergency Management Agency and the State of North Carolina upon request. 
(i)  Conditions for variances: 
(1)  Variances shall not be issued when the variance will make the structure in violation of other federal, state, or local laws, regulations, or ordinances. 
(2)  Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway or nonencroachment area if the variance would result in any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge. 
(3)  Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief. 
(4)  Variances shall only be issued prior to development permit approval. 
(5)  Variances shall only be issued upon: 
a.  A showing of good and sufficient cause; 
b.  A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship; and

5.  Flood openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, or other coverings or devices, provided they permit the automatic flow of floodwaters in both directions; and 
6.  Enclosures made of flexible skirting are not considered enclosures for regulatory purposes, and, therefore, do not require flood openings. Masonry or wood underpinning, regardless of structural status, is considered an enclosure and requires flood openings as outlined above. 
(5)  Additions/improvements. 
a.  Additions and/or improvements to pre-FIRM structures when the addition and/or improvements in combination with any interior modifications to the existing structure are: 
1.  Not a substantial improvement, the addition and/or improvements must be designed to minimize flood damages and must not be any more nonconforming than the existing structure. 
2.  A substantial improvement, both the existing structure and the addition and/or improvements must comply with the standards for new construction. 
b.  Additions to post-FIRM structures with no modifications to the existing structure other than a standard door in the common wall shall require only the addition to comply with the standards for new construction. 
c.  Additions and/or improvements to post-FIRM structures when the addition and/or improvements in combination with any interior modifications to the existing structure are: 
1.  Not a substantial improvement, the addition and/or improvements only must comply with the standards for new construction. 
2.  A substantial improvement, both the existing structure and the addition and/or improvements must comply with the standards for new construction. 
(6)  Recreational vehicles. Recreational vehicles shall either: 
a.  Be on-site for fewer than 180 consecutive days and be fully licensed and ready for highway use (a recreational vehicle is ready for highway use if it is on its wheels or jacking system, is attached to the site only by quick disconnect type utilities, and has no permanently attached additions); or 
b.  Meet all the requirements for new construction. 
(7)  Temporary nonresidential structures. Prior to the issuance of a floodplain development permit for a temporary structure, the applicant must submit to the floodplain administrator a plan for the removal of such structure(s) in the event of a hurricane, flash flood or other type of flood warning notification.

(Ord. No. O-2008-10, 10-13-2008) 
Sec. 58-514. - Standards for floodplains without established base flood elevations. 
    Within the special flood hazard areas designated as approximate zone A and established in section 58-452, where no base flood elevation (BFE) data has been provided by FEMA, the following provisions, in addition to the provisions of section 58-511, shall apply: 
(1)  No encroachments, including fill, new construction, substantial improvements or new development shall be permitted within a distance of 20 feet each side from top of bank or five times the width of the stream, whichever is greater, unless certification with supporting technical data by a registered professional engineer is provided demonstrating that such encroachments shall not result in any increase in flood levels during the occurrence of the base flood discharge. 
(2)  The BFE used in determining the regulatory flood protection elevation shall be determined based on the following criteria: 
a.  When base flood elevation (BFE) data is available from other sources, all new construction and substantial improvements within such areas shall also comply with all applicable provisions of this article and shall be elevated or floodproofed in accordance with standards in division 5, sections 58-511 and 58-512. 
b.  When floodway or nonencroachment data is available from a federal, state, or other source, all new construction and substantial improvements within floodway and nonencroachment areas shall also comply with the requirements of division 5, sections 58-512 and 58-516. 
c.  All subdivision, manufactured home park and other development proposals shall provide base flood elevation (BFE) data if development is greater than five acres or has more than 50 lots/manufactured home sites. Such base flood elevation (BFE) data shall be adopted by reference in accordance with section 58-452 and utilized in implementing this article. 
d.  When base flood elevation (BFE) data is not available from a federal, state, or other source as outlined above, the reference level shall be elevated or floodproofed (nonresidential) to or above the regulatory flood protection elevation, as defined in section 58-431. All other applicable provisions of section 58-512 shall also apply. 
(Ord. No. O-2008-10, 10-13-2008) 
Sec. 58-515. - Standards for riverine floodplains with base flood elevations but without established floodways or nonencroachment areas. 
    Along rivers and streams where base flood elevation (BFE) data is provided by FEMA or is available from another source, but neither floodway, nor nonencroachment areas are identified for a special flood hazard area on the FIRM or in the FIS report, the following requirements shall apply to all development within such areas: 
(1)  Standards of division 5, sections 58-511 and 58-512; and 
(2)  Until a regulatory floodway or nonencroachment area is designated, no encroachments, including fill, new construction, substantial improvements, or other development, shall be permitted unless certification with supporting technical data by a registered professional engineer is provided demonstrating that the cumulative effect of the proposed development, when combined with all other existing and anticipated development, will not increase the water surface elevation of the base flood more than one foot at any point within the community. 
(Ord. No. O-2008-10, 10-13-2008) 
Sec. 58-516. - Floodways and nonencroachment areas. 
    Areas designated as floodways or nonencroachment areas are located within the special flood hazard areas established in section 58-452. The floodways and nonencroachment areas are extremely hazardous areas due to the velocity of floodwaters that have erosion potential and carry debris and potential projectiles. The following provisions, in addition to standards outlined in division 5, sections 58-511 and 58-512, shall apply to all development within such areas: 
(1)  No encroachments, including fill, new construction, substantial improvements and other developments shall be permitted unless: 
a.  It is demonstrated that the proposed encroachment would not result in any increase in the flood levels during the occurrence of the base flood, based on hydrologic and hydraulic analyses performed in accordance with standard engineering practice and presented to the floodplain administrator prior to issuance of floodplain development permit; or 
b.  A conditional letter of map revision (CLOMR) has been approved by the Town of Weddington and FEMA. A letter of map revision (LOMR) must also be obtained upon completion of the proposed encroachment. 
(2)  If subsection (1) above, is satisfied, all development shall comply with all applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of this article. 
(3)  No manufactured homes shall be permitted, except replacement manufactured homes in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision, provided the following provisions are met: 
a.  The anchoring and the elevation standards of subsection 58-512(3); and 
b.  The no encroachment standard of subsection (1), above. 
(4)  Development which causes a rise of greater than 0.00' in the FEMA base flood elevation and impacts an existing habitable building will not be allowed. 
(Ord. No. O-2008-10, 10-13-2008) 
Sec. 58-517. - Standards for areas of shallow flooding (zone AO). 
    Located within the special flood hazard areas established in section 58-452, are areas designated as shallow flooding areas. These areas have special flood hazards associated with base flood depths of one to three feet where a clearly defined channel does not exist and where the path of flooding is unpredictable and indeterminate. In addition to division 5, sections 58-511 and 58-512, all new construction and substantial improvements shall meet the following requirements: 
(1)  The reference level shall be elevated at least as high as the depth number specified on the flood insurance rate map (FIRM), in feet, plus a freeboard of two feet, above the highest adjacent grade; or at least four feet above the highest adjacent grade if no depth number is specified. 
(2)  Nonresidential structures may, in lieu of elevation, be floodproofed to the same level as required in subsection 58-517(1) so that the structure, together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities, below that level shall be watertight with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water and with structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and effects of buoyancy. Certification is required in accordance with subsection 58-482(c) and subsection 58-512(2). 
(3)  Adequate drainage paths shall be provided around structures on slopes, to guide floodwaters around and away from proposed structures. 
(Ord. No. O-2008-10, 10-13-2008) 
Sec. 58-518. - Special provisions for subdivisions. 
(a)  An applicant for a major development permit authorizing a major subdivision, and an applicant for minor subdivision final plat approval, shall be responsible for compliance with the use and construction restrictions contained in division 5 sections 58-511 through 58-517 if any portion of the land to be subdivided lies within a floodway or SFHA, as defined in section 58-431 of this article. 
(b)  Final plat approval for any subdivision containing land that lies within a floodway or SFHA may not be given unless the plat shows the boundary of the floodway and SFHA and contains in clearly discernible print the following statement: "Use of land within a floodway or special flood hazard area (SFHA) is substantially restricted by the Town of Weddington Zoning Ordinance". 
(c)  A major development permit for a major subdivision and final plat approval for any subdivision may not be given if: 
(1)  The land to be subdivided lies within a zone where residential uses are permissible and it reasonably appears that the subdivision is designed to create residential building lots; 
(2)  Any portion of one or more of the proposed lots lies within a floodway or SFHA; and 
(3)  It reasonably appears that one or more lots described in subsections (c)(1) and (c)(2) of this section could not practicably be used as a residential building site because of the restrictions set forth in this article. 
(Ord. No. O-2008-10, 10-13-2008) 
Sec. 58-519. - Location of boundaries of special flood hazard areas (sfha) and floodway districts. 
    As used in this article, the terms SFHA and floodway refer in the first instance to certain areas whose boundaries are determined and can be located on the ground by reference to the specific fluvial characteristics set forth in the definitions of these terms. These terms also refer to overlay zoning districts SFHAs shown on the maps referenced in this article, which boundaries are intended to correspond to the actual, physical location of floodways and SFHAs. These overlay districts thus differ from other zoning districts, whose boundaries are established solely according to planning or policy, rather than physical, criteria. Therefore, the administrator is authorized to make necessary interpretations as to the exact location of the boundaries of floodways or SFHAs if there appears to be a conflict between a mapped boundary and actual field conditions. 
(Ord. No. O-2008-10, 10-13-2008) 
Sec. 58-520. - Setbacks from streams outside designated special flood hazard areas (SFHA). 
(a)  Flood limits of any stream shown on the national flood insurance program flood insurance rate map (FIRM) designated as a zone A or zone AE flood hazard area shall have those limits drawn on the plat to proper scale and certified by a duly licensed professional engineer or registered land surveyor. If the stream is shown on the FIRM with flood elevations, the flooding limits are to be drawn based on the ground survey. If detailed flood elevations do not exist, the applicant may obtain a letter of map amendment (LOMA) or letter of map revision (LOMR) from the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) for use as a basis of the regulatory flood protection elevation. For lots outside of a detailed study area (zone A) as shown on the FIRM for which no LOMA or LOMR exists, and where the proposed subdivision, manufactured home park or other development is greater than five acres or has more than 50 lots/manufactured home sites, the base flood elevation data shall be calculated. In all cases, the regulatory flood protection elevation shall be set as described in this article. 
    For all other lots located outside of a detailed study area (zone A) as shown on the FIRM for which no LOMA or LOMR exists, a regulatory flood protection elevation shall be established as two feet above the highest adjacent drainage easement grade. 
    In all cases where lots are upstream from street crossings, the regulatory flood protection elevation shall be established as described in this subsection or set two feet above the low elevation of the street, whichever is greater, and shown on the plat. 
(b)  Drainage easements shall be established and recorded for all lots containing storm drainage pipes or channels. No structure, with the exception of a fence, shall be erected across or within a drainage easement. Fences are allowed within drainage easements provided the fence does not restrict or obstruct the natural flow of water in an open channel. The following table shall be used as a minimum for drainage easements for all open channels and streams: 
(1)  Less than 25 acres: 20 feet. 
(2)  Less than 50 acres: 30 feet. 
(3)  Less than 75 acres: 40 feet. 
(4)  Greater than 75 acres: 50 feet. 
In addition, all drainage pipes shall have a minimum drainage easement width of 20 feet. The strip of land in the drainage easement to a stream or river shall be retained in its natural vegetative state unless prior approval from the zoning administrator is obtained. The values provided in subsections (b)(1) through (b)(4) of this section are intended for a guide and as a minimum and is not intended to be used in place of accepted engineering practices. 
(c)  Each plat containing drainage easements for watershed areas exceeding 50 acres will require the following engineering certification: 
I ________________, a duly registered Professional Engineer, licensed in the State of North Carolina, do hereby certify that the drainage easements shown on this plat are sufficient to carry the 100-year storm runoff within the easement limits as shown.

C.  Dangerous Dogs. 
1.  The term "dangerous dog" shall include a potentially dangerous dog as determined by the Chief Animal Control Officer as per definition. Upon a preliminary determination that a dog is a potentially dangerous dog, the Chief Animal Control Officer shall notify the owner in writing, if known, giving the reasons for the determination, before the dog may be considered potentially dangerous under this ordinance. The owner shall be provided a copy of Section V(C) of this ordinance and shall be required to sign a statement confirming receipt. The owner may appeal the determination by filing written objections with the Union County Board of Health within three business days. The Board of Health shall schedule a hearing on this matter within 10 days of the filing of objections. 
If a dog has been determined potentially dangerous and the dog's owner has appealed this determination to the Board of Health, or to superior court following a decision by the Board of Health, then the owner shall keep the dog in a secure enclosure pending resolution of any final appeal. If a second complaint is filed against the dog while under a confinement order pursuant to this subsection, Animal Control Officers shall impound the dog pending resolution of any final appeal. The dog's owner shall be responsible for any boarding or other fees resulting from such impoundment. 
2.  It shall be unlawful to own or keep a dangerous dog unless the following requirements have been met: 
a.  The owner or keeper shall have a secure enclosure on the owner's or keeper's property where the animal is maintained. 
b.  The owner or keeper shall display a sign on the owner's or keeper's property warning that there is a dangerous dog on the premises, and said sign must be plainly visible from the public highway, street or other access. The sign shall have dimensions not less than 8 1/2 by 11 and may be obtained from the Animal Shelter at cost. 
c.  The owner or keeper shall notify an Animal Control Officer within twenty-four (24) hours if the dangerous dog becomes unconfined, or has attacked a human being or another animal. In the event the dangerous dog becomes unconfined or attacks a human being or another animal during hours when the Animal Shelter is closed, the owner or keeper shall call 911. 
3.  It shall be unlawful for any person owning, harboring, or having care, custody or control of a dangerous dog to permit it outside of a secure enclosure unless necessary to obtain veterinary care for the dog, or to sell or give away the dog, or to comply with commands or direction of an Animal Control Officer, or to comply with the provisions of this subsection. In such event, the dangerous dog shall be securely muzzled and restrained with a chain having a minimum tensile strength of three hundred (300) pounds and not exceeding more than three (3) feet in length, and shall be under the direct control and supervision of the owner or keeper of the dangerous dog who must be physically able to restrain said animal. 
4.  It shall be unlawful for the owner of a dangerous dog to transfer ownership or possession of the dog to another person without providing written notice to the Chief Animal Control Officer stating the name and address of the new owner or possessor, and written notice to the person taking ownership or possession of the dog indicating the dog's dangerous behavior, which notice shall be acknowledged in writing by the new owner and said acknowledgment delivered to the Chief Animal Control Officer. 
5.  This subsection shall not apply to: a dog being used by a law enforcement officer to carry out the law enforcement officer's duties; or a dog being used in a lawful hunt; or a dog where the injury or damage inflicted by the dog was sustained by a domestic animal while the dog was working as a hunting dog, herding dog, or predator control dog on the property of, or under the control of, its owner or keeper and the damage or injury was to a species or type of domestic animal appropriate to the work of the dog; or a dog where the injury inflicted was sustained by a person who, at the time of the injury, was committing a willful trespass or other tort, was tormenting, abusing, or assaulting the dog, had tormented, abused, or assaulted the dog, or was committing or attempting to commit a crime. 
6.  In the event that the owner or keeper of the dangerous dog is a minor, the parent or guardian of such minor shall be held liable for noncompliance with the provisions of this subsection. 
D.  Public Nuisance Animals. 
1.  The actions of an animal constitute a public nuisance when that animal disturbs the rights of, threatens the safety of, or damages a member of the general public or interferes with the ordinary use and enjoyment of their property. 
2.  It shall be unlawful for any person to own, keep, possess or maintain an animal in such a manner so as to constitute a public nuisance. By way of example and not of limitation the following acts or actions by an owner or keeper are hereby declared to be a public nuisance and are therefore unlawful: 
a.  Allowing or permitting the animal to damage the property of anyone other than its owner, including but not limited to turning over garbage containers or damaging gardens, flowers or vegetables. 
b.  Maintaining a vicious animal as described by the laws of the State of North Carolina. 
c.  Maintaining animals in an environment of unsanitary conditions which results in offensive odors or is dangerous to the animals or to the public health, welfare or safety. 
d.  Maintaining his or her property in a manner that is offensive, annoying or dangerous to the public health, safety or welfare of the community because of the number, type, variety, density or location of the animals on the property. 
e.  Allowing or permitting the animal to bark, whine, or howl, in an excessive or continuous fashion or make noise in such a manner or at such times so as to result in a serious annoyance or interference with the reasonable use and enjoyment of neighboring premises. 
f.  Maintaining an animal that is diseased and dangerous to the public health. 
g.  Maintaining an animal that habitually or repeatedly chases, snaps at, attacks or otherwise molests pedestrians, bicycles or vehicles. 
3.  Compliance with this subsection shall be required as follows: 
a.  When an Animal Control Officer, law enforcement officer, or person duly authorized by the Health Director observes (or determines through investigative means) that a violation has occurred, the owner or keeper will be provided written notification of such violation and will be given twenty-four (24) hours from time of notification to abate the nuisance. The owner or keeper shall be required to provide a written statement to an Animal Control Officer confirming that the nuisance has been abated. 
b.  Upon receipt of a written, detailed and signed complaint made to the Health Director by any person stating that any other person is maintaining a nuisance as defined in this ordinance, the Health Director shall cause the owner or keeper of the animal or animals in question to be notified that a complaint has been received and shall cause the situation complained of to be investigated and a report and findings thereon to be reduced to writing. 
If the written findings indicate that the complaint is justified, then the Health Director or person duly authorized by the Health Director, shall cause the owner or keeper of the animal or animals in question to be so notified in writing, and ordered to abate such nuisance within twenty-four (24) hours by whatever means necessary. The owner or keeper shall be required to provide a written statement to an Animal Control Officer confirming that the nuisance has been abated. 
c.  In the event the owner or keeper of the animal or animals is unknown and cannot be ascertained, the animal shall be impounded. A notice and order, along with a general description of the animal or animals, shall be posted for seventy two (72) hours at the animal shelter. If the owner or keeper of the animal or animals remains unknown, the animal may be adopted according to the provisions of this ordinance or humanely destroyed. 
E.  Cruelty to Animals. 
1.  It shall be unlawful for any person to molest, torture, torment, deprive of necessary sustenance, cruelly beat, needlessly mutilate or kill, wound, injure, poison, abandon, or subject to conditions detrimental to its health or general welfare any animal, or to cause or procure such action. The words "torture" and "torment" shall be held to include every act, omission or neglect whereby unjustifiably physical pain, suffering or death is caused or permitted; but such terms shall not be construed to prohibit lawful taking of animals under the jurisdiction and regulation of the Wildlife Resources Commission; nor to prohibit the Animal Control Officers or persons duly authorized by the Health Director or veterinarians from destroying dangerous, unwanted or injured animals in a humane manner; nor to prohibit the lawful use of animals in scientific research. 
2.  It shall be unlawful for any owner or keeper to fail to provide his animal or animals with proper shelter and protection from the weather, sufficient and wholesome food and water to keep his animal or animals in good health and comfort, the opportunity for vigorous daily exercise, veterinary care when needed to prevent suffering, and humane care and treatment. 
3.  It shall be unlawful for any owner or keeper to harbor any animal for the purpose of fighting or to train, badger, bait or use any animal for the purpose of causing or encouraging said animal to unprovoked attacks upon human beings or domestic animals. By way of example and not limitation, it shall be unlawful for any person to cause, instigate or permit any dog fight, cock fight, bull fight or other combat between animals or between animals and humans. 
4.  It shall be the duty of the owner or keeper of any animals that die, from any cause, and the owner, lessee or person in charge of any land upon which any animals die, to bury the dead animals to a depth of at least three feet beneath the surface of the ground, or to completely burn said animals, within 24 hours after the death of said animals, or to otherwise dispose of the same in a manner approved by the state veterinarian. It shall be unlawful for any person to remove the carcasses of dead animals from his premises to the premises of any other person without the written permission of the person having charge of such premises and without burying said carcasses as provided above. 
F.  Wild Animals. 
1.  This section shall apply to wild animals and exotic pets and owners of wild animals and exotic pets. Neither this section nor any other section of this ordinance shall have the effect of permitting any activity or condition with respect to a wild animal or exotic pet which is prohibited or more severely restricted by State and Federal statute or regulation. 
2.  Wild animals and exotic pets and the owners of wild animals and exotic pets shall be subject to all of the same rules and regulations contained in this ordinance except those which are applicable solely to dogs and cats and the owners of dogs and cats. 
3.  Because of the inherent danger in maintaining a secure enclosure for large wild animals and in order to protect the health, safety and welfare of the citizens of Union County, it shall be unlawful to own, keep or possess a wild animal which exceeds fifty pounds (50 lbs.) in weight. Wild animals and exotic pets which do not exceed 50 pounds shall be maintained at all times in a secure enclosure on the owner's or keeper's property or, with consent, on the property of another. 
4.  All owners of wild animals and exotic pets shall be required to register their animals with an Animal Control Officer within 10 working days of acquisition. Such registration shall be for informational and enforcement purposes and there shall be no fee for such registration. 
If a wild animal bites or attacks another animal or a human being it shall be humanely destroyed. 
Sec. VI. - Rabies control. 
A.  Immunization. 
1.  It shall be unlawful for any animal owner or other person to fail to comply with the state laws relating to the control of rabies. It is the purpose of this ordinance to supplement the state laws by providing a procedure for the enforcement of state laws relating to rabies control, in addition to the criminal penalties provided by state law. Should North Carolina state law applicable to rabies control be amended to include other types of animals in the class of those required to have rabies vaccinations, or should any other change inconsistent with this section be made, the amended law of the State of North Carolina shall apply. 
2.  It shall be required that any dog or cat four months of age or younger be kept in a secure enclosure or be at all times under restraint of the owner or his agent. 
3.  It shall be unlawful for any dog or cat owner to keep any dog or cat four months of age or older unless such dog or cat has been immunized against rabies in accordance with North Carolina law and with an approved antirabic vaccine administered by a licensed veterinarian, and said dog is wearing a collar with a valid rabies vaccination tag at all times. Said tag shall have a number corresponding to the number of a rabies vaccination certificate in possession of the owner. Cats are hereby exempted from any requirement that they wear rabies vaccination tags; provided, however, that cat owners must demonstrate proof of vaccination upon request by an Animal Control Officer. An owner complying with all of the requirements of this section need not display said rabies vaccination tag on a dog during the actual duration of organized hunting activities if: 
a.  The dog is on private property with the consent of the owner of that property; and 
b.  The owner or keeper is in actual physical possession of said rabies vaccination tag during the organized hunting activities. 
4.  Animal Control Officers may impound any dog found off the owner's or keeper's real property while not wearing the required vaccination tag. During the impoundment period, the Animal Control Officer shall make a reasonable effort to locate the owner of the animal. If the animal is wearing an owner identification tag or if the Animal Control Officer is otherwise able to determine ownership of the animal, the Animal Control Officer shall notify the owner in writing, and by more immediate means where reasonably possible. An animal impounded pursuant to this section shall be released to its owner upon payment of all applicable fees and upon agreement by the owner as follows: (1) to have the animal vaccinated against rabies, if not already vaccinated; and (2) to provide the required rabies vaccination certificate to the Animal Control Officer within three days of the animal's release. If an animal is released and the owner fails to provide the required rabies vaccination certificate within three days of release, the Animal Control Officer may again impound the animal whether located on or off the owner's or keeper's real property. 
If an animal impounded pursuant to this section is not reclaimed by its owner during the impoundment period, the animal shall be disposed of in one of the following manners: adopted as a pet by a new owner; or put to death by a procedure approved by the American Veterinary Medical Association, the Humane Society of the United States or of the American Humane Association. Animals shall be impounded for a period of not less than 72 hours prior to disposal. 
B.  Bites. 
1.  When a person has been bitten by an animal, that person or the parent, guardian or person standing in loco parentis of that person, and the person owning the animal or in control or possession of the animal shall notify the Health Director immediately and give the name and address of the person bitten and the owner of the animal. Every physician treating an animal bite would shall also report the incident to the Health Director immediately. The person who has been bitten (or if a minor, such person's guardian) and the person owning the animal or in control or possession of the animal may contact 911 if emergency attention is necessary. 
2.  Every dog or cat that bites a human being and does not have a valid rabies vaccination tag shall be delivered within eight hours of the bite incident by the owner or keeper to the County Animal Shelter or to a licensed veterinary hospital, at the choice of the owner, where the animal shall be confined for observation for not less than 10 days. The owner shall be responsible for the cost of such confinement. An Animal Control Officer may, in his sole discretion, permit the animal to be confined on the premises of the owner only when, after personal inspection by the officer, he determines that there is a suitable secure enclosure on the premises and that other circumstances warrant such action. If the owner or the person who controls or possesses a dog or cat that has bitten a person refuses to confine the animal as required by this section, the Health Director may order seizure of the animal and its confinement for 10 days at the expense of the owner. 
3.  A dog or cat bitten by a proven rabid animal, or animal suspected of having rabies that is not available for laboratory diagnosis, shall be destroyed immediately by its owner or an Animal Control Officer, except that any dog or cat which is immunized under the laws of the State of North Carolina at the time of the bite shall be inoculated with a booster vaccine within three days of the bite. If such a dog or cat develops rabies as determined by a licensed veterinarian, it shall be the duty of the owner to have such animal destroyed and properly disposed of according to the provisions of G.S. § 130A-199, which requires that rabid animals be destroyed and their heads sent to the State Laboratory of Public Health for rabies diagnosis. 
C.  Transferred Animals. All dogs and cats shipped or otherwise brought into Union County, except for exhibition purposes where the dogs or cats are confined and not permitted to run at large, shall be securely confined and vaccinated within one week after entry, and shall remain confined for two additional weeks after vaccination. This section shall not apply to those dogs and cats accompanied by a valid rabies certificate issued by a licensed veterinarian showing that said dog or cat has a current rabies vaccination as determined by the rabies expiration date on the certificate.

B.  Notification to Owners. Impoundment shall be according to the following procedure unless otherwise required by this ordinance: 
Upon impoundment the Animal Control Officer shall make a reasonably diligent attempt to determine the ownership of the impounded animal, if not already known, and to notify the owners of the impoundment and the procedure for redemption. Notification shall be by personal contact or telephone where possible, otherwise by U. S. mail. 
C.  Impoundment Time Periods/Redemption. 
1.  The owner or keeper of an animal impounded pursuant to this ordinance may redeem the animal and regain possession thereof within seventy-two (72) hours after impoundment, or longer where deemed appropriate by the Chief Animal Control officer, provided that there is reasonable assurance that all applicable provisions of this ordinance will be complied with and provided that all applicable fees have been paid. Redemption service fees shall be charged each time an animal is redeemed, in addition to a daily boarding fee. The redemption and boarding fee schedule is:

APPENDIX C - TRAFFIC IMPACT ANALYSIS ORDINANCE 

Sec. I. - Overview. 
    The adequacy of service levels for local, private, and state road intersections that serve or are affected by a proposed project shall be determined in accordance with the provisions of this Appendix. A Traffic Impact Analysis (TIA) required by this Appendix will be prepared by a qualified traffic engineering consultant retained by the Applicant and reviewed and approved by the Town of Weddington. All requirements and recommendations resulting from the TIA must be coordinated with and approved by NCDOT. 
(Ord. No. O-2015-05, 5-11-2015) 
Sec. II. - Applicability. 
A.  Generally. 
1)  Except as provided in subsections 3) through 7) below, a TIA is required for any major subdivision, or conditional rezoning, or portion thereof, which is expected to create fifty (50) or more peak hour vehicle trips or 500 or more daily vehicle trips. Peak hour and daily vehicle trips are those occurring on peak days on the roadway adjacent to the proposed development, based on the current edition of the Institute of Transportation Engineers (ITE) Trip Generation Manual, with the exception of public and private schools which will be based on the NCDOT's most current Municipal School Transportation Assistance (MSTA) School Traffic Calculator. For the purposes of determining the requirement to submit a TIA, no adjustments such as modal split, pass-by trips, and/or internal capture rates will be allowed to the site traffic calculation. 
NCDOT Congestion Management's "Rate versus Equation" spreadsheet shall be used to guide site trip calculations and determine allowable pass-by percentages. Alternative trip generation rates/equations for non-standard uses may be utilized subject to Town approval. A "Determination of Need" for a TIA shall be made by the Town in accordance with the trip generation standards set forth in subsection II.A.1). (See the Town of Weddington TIA Process and Procedures Manual for additional information.) 
2)  The determination of the number of trips generated also shall take into account pass-by trips, internal trip capture for MX projects (e.g., roadway and/or pedestrian connectivity) and any proposed transportation demand management system where adequate guarantees are provided by the applicant to the Town, which ensure the proposed demand management system will function as proposed for the life of the project. 
3)  For redevelopment projects, including changes of use, trip generation thresholds shall be defined as the number of net new trips anticipated to be generated by the proposed development over and above the number of trips generated by the current use of the site. 
4)  No TIA shall be required for special events, which either are temporary in nature, consistent with the Town Zoning Ordinance, or which generate trips that meet or exceed the thresholds set forth in subsection 1), but which do not occur during the peak hours of the roadways adjacent to the proposed development. 
5)  Nothing herein shall prohibit the Town from requiring on-site or off-site improvements necessary to address traffic safety concerns created by a proposed development, regardless of whether the thresholds set forth above have been met. 
6)  This Appendix shall not apply to any rights that have vested prior to the effective date of this Appendix, nor shall this Appendix be applied in a manner that would result in a taking of property. 
7)  This Appendix shall not apply to any development proposal that is part of a conditional zoning plan or subdivision plan submitted prior to the effective date of this Appendix. 
B.  Consecutive or Sequential Applications. 
Proposed developments may not be phased or subdivided in piecemeal fashion to avoid application of this Appendix. Two or more developments represented as separate developments shall be aggregated and treated as a single development where the Administrator determines the developments to be part of a unified plan of development and physically proximate to one another, based on the following factors: 
1)  There is common ownership, indicated by the fact that: 
a)  The same person, company, partnership or legal entity controls the developments; 
b)  The same person, company, partnership or legal entity has ownership or a significant legal or equitable interest in the developments; 
c)  There is common management of the developments which controls the form of physical development or disposition of parcels of the development; 
d)  There is proximity in time between the completion of 80 percent or less of one development and the submission of a development proposal for a subsequent development indicating a common development effort; 
e)  The sharing of infrastructure or improvements between multiple developments; 
f)  There is a common advertising scheme or promotional effort or plan for the developments; or 
g)  Any other credible information gained by the Town suggesting that the project is being phased or subdivided to avoid the requirements of this Appendix. 
C.  TIA Submission and Completion Requirement. 
Once the Town has made a Determination of Need for a TIA, the applicant may proceed with the TIA study, in accordance with the terms of the most recent version of the Town of Weddington TIA Process and Procedures Manual, as approved by Zoning Administrator and all applicable Zoning Ordinance and Subdivision Ordinance requirements. 
(Ord. No. O-2015-05, 5-11-2015) 
Sec. III. - Level of Service Standards; Compliance; Mitigation; Excess Capacity. 
A.  Level of Service Standards and Compliance. 
1.  The applicant must determine the existing (base) Level of Service (LOS) for all intersections within the Impact Area, as described in Section IV. The applicant shall be required to identify mitigation improvements to the roadway network if at least one of the following conditions exists when comparing base Level of Services to project conditions: (1) the total average delay at an intersection or individual approach delay increases by 25% or greater, while maintaining the same LOS; (2) the LOS degrades by at least one level; (3) or LOS is an "F". This determination shall be based on the most currently accepted Highway Capacity Manual (HCM) methodology. For turning lanes, mitigation improvements shall be identified when the SimTraffic analysis indicates that the Max Queue exceeds the storage capacity of the existing lane. 
The proposed mitigation measures required to meet the LOS standards may be modified, subject to final approval of the Town Council to substantially achieve the standards, purpose and intent of this ordinance. The determination of "substantial achievement" based upon an expert opinion provided by the Town's Designated Transportation Engineer. 
2.  As an alternative to mitigation, the developer may elect to phase the project, reduce its intensity, or delay the project until the LOS standards have been met as a result of a transportation improvement planned by the Town, the North Carolina Department of Transportation (NCDOT) or another party. 
B.  Mitigation. 
Mitigation measures shall be consistent with the Design Standards found within the Town of Weddington Roadway Standards. 
Mitigation may include participation by the Town or other governmental agencies or private parties, and also may include the funding of road improvements planned by other governmental agencies. Such improvements can be advanced to mitigate the impacts of the proposed development. The nature and type of mitigation should reflect the timing and the availability of necessary right-of-way or other improvements, the existence and timing of other developments within the area, and the particular characteristics of the particular site and the needed transportation improvements. Monetary mitigation, if proposed by the applicant, may be accepted by the Town Council provided it is shown that such mitigation is a reasonable substitute for actual construction, based on the LOS standards and construction time frames set forth herein. 
Proposed mitigation shall be included as a condition of approval or a binding agreement between the applicant and the Town, with the consent, as appropriate, of the NCDOT or other governmental regulatory agencies with jurisdiction. 
C.  Transportation improvements. 
Transportation improvements provided through mitigation, pursuant to this Appendix, shall be completed and available within three (3) years of the Town Council's final approval of the development proposal, unless expressly provided otherwise by the Town Council. Any improvements not completed prior to the issuance of a Certificate of Occupancy, shall be bonded at 115% of the cost of the remaining required improvement(s), as reviewed and approved by the Zoning Administrator following review by the Town Designated Transportation Engineer. All necessary right-of-way for identified transportation improvements shall be acquired prior to the issuance of a Certificate of Occupancy. 
D.  Excess Capacity. 
If a private party or developer chooses to build a transportation facility that provides capacity in excess of that needed to serve the proposed development, the Town and other responsible parties may enter into an agreement to facilitate the participation of subsequent developers, the Town, NCDOT, or other parties in the provision or funding of the transportation improvement. 
(Ord. No. O-2015-05, 5-11-2015) 
Sec. IV. - Impact Area. 
    The impact area designates the distance from a proposed development within which the TIA is conducted to determine compliance with the LOS standards set forth above. The following impact areas apply to any development subject to this Appendix: 
1)  Public street intersections within a half-mile radius from the proposed development property line. 
2)  Intersections where proposed development contributes seven (7) percent or more of the traffic on any intersection approach during any peak hour. 
(Ord. No. O-2015-05, 5-11-2015) 
Sec. V. - Contents of TIA. 
A.  Generally. 
The TIA shall generally follow the guidelines set forth by the ITE Transportation Impact Analysis for Site Development consistent with the Town of Weddington Roadway Standards, or as required by the Zoning Administrator, and may include, but is not limited to, the following: 
1)  Traffic analysis information related to trip generation, peak hour impacts, and other factors evaluated to determine compliance with applicable LOS standards for intersections within the impact area; 
2)  Site location map and site layout; 
3)  Existing and proposed land uses; 
4)  Timing and phasing of the proposed development, by month and year; 
5)  A narrative describing the project, including any special transportation related impacts or considerations; and 
6)  Other information determined by the Town Designated Transportation Engineer to be necessary in order to determine whether the proposed project complies with the requirements of this Appendix and the requirements of the ITE guidelines for the preparation of TIAs for site development. 
B.  Demand Measures. 
TIAs shall take into account the following demand factors: 
1)  Existing traffic volumes; 
2)  Background traffic, including historical growth traffic and projected trips associated with approved, but un-built development(s); and 
3)  The trips to be generated by the proposed development. 
C.  Capacity Measures. 
TIAs shall take into account the following existing or anticipated capacity measures: 
1)  Existing road segments, intersections, and proposed development access points; 
2)  Roadway and intersection improvements planned by the Town, NCDOT, or other party, scheduled to be completed and available within three (3) years of the approval of the development proposal and which either have or are reasonably certain to have all necessary governmental approvals. 
D.  Mitigation Measures Needed. 
The TIA shall describe what, if any, transportation facility improvements within the impact area are needed for the proposed development to comply with the intersection level of service standards set forth in section III of this Appendix. 
(Ord. No. O-2015-05, 5-11-2015) 
Sec. VI. - Intergovernmental Coordination.
