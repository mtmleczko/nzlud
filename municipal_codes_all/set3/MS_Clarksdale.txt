PREFACE 
    Part I of this volume contains the Charter of the City of Clarksdale, as amended, the enacting act and 
comparative table giving the derivation of each section; and Part II contains a revision and codification of 
all ordinances of a general and permanent nature of the City of Clarksdale which were deemed advisable 
to be included. 
    Part II is an entire new codification, and, as expressed in the Adopting Ordinance, supersedes all 
ordinances not included herein or expressly saved from repeal by the Adopting Ordinance. Special 
ordinances or ordinances dealing with only a portion of the inhabitants of the city, rather than all of them, 
or relating to special purposes, such as the ordinances levying special assessments, providing for bond 
issues, paving, vacating and opening specified streets, changing street names, granting franchises, etc., 
are not included herein. For more specific enumeration of the type of ordinances which are not included 
herein, see Section 3 of the Adopting Ordinance. 
    All the ordinances in Part II, Code, have been classified as to subject matter, edited, revised and in 
many instances rewritten. As will be noted, the chapters have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical 
order and the various sections within each chapter have been appropriately catchlined to facilitate usage. 
Attention is also invited to the appropriate footnotes which tie related sections of the Code together and 
which also refer to relevant state laws. 
    The numbering system used in Part II of this Code is the same system used in many state and 
municipal codes. Each section number consists of two component parts separated by a dash, the figure 
before the dash referring to the chapter number and figure after the dash referring to the position of the 
section within the chapter. Thus, the first section of Chapter 1 is numbered 1-1 and the seventh section 
Chapter 8 is 8-7. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter and at the same time new 
sections can be inserted in their proper places, simply by using the decimal system for amendments. By 
way of illustration: If new material consisting of three sections that would logically come between Sections 
4-3 and 4-4 is desired to be added, such new section would be numbered 4-3.1, 4-3.2, 4-3.3, 
respectively. Section numbers have been reserved at the end of articles to provide for future expansion. 
    New chapters may be included by the addition of a capital letter after the chapter number, i.e., if the 
new material is to be included between Chapters 12 and 13, it will be designated as Chapter 12A. Care 
should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters be maintained when included new 
chapters. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may 
be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and in the case of divisions, may be placed at 
the end of the article embracing the subject, the next successive number being assigned to the new 
article or division. 
    A special feature of this volume to which the attention of the user is particularly invited is the 
innovation of the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing for the Code. With this new 
looseleaf system, this volume will be kept up to date periodically. Acts of the State Legislature amending 
the Charter or pertaining to the City can be inserted after reprinting the pages affected, adding new pages 
or deleting pages in case of repeal. Likewise, upon the final passage of amendatory ordinances, they will 
be properly edited and the appropriate page or pages affected will be reprinted for insertion in the Code. 
The new or reprinted pages will be distributed to the holders of the Codes with instructions for the manner 
of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. The indices will be treated in the same 
manner. To each such amendment will be attached an amendment or editorial note explaining briefly the 
effect of the amendment on the section or sections amended and the derivation of such amendment. 
Each such subsequent amendment, when incorporated into this Code, may be cited as a part hereof as 
provided in Section 5 of the Adopting Ordinance. 
    The successful maintenance of this Code up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder 
of the volume. As revised sheets are received it will then become the responsibility of the holder to insert 
the amendments according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publishers that 
all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them, and that all deleted 
pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
    The indices have been prepared with the greatest care. Each item has been placed under several 
headings, some of the headings being couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology and still 
others in language generally used by city officials and employees. There are numerous cross references 
within the indices themselves which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which 
he is interested. 
    The source of the section is included in the history note in parentheses at the end thereof. The 
absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the 
adoption of this Code. 
    Time and effort have not been spared in the preparation of this Code and the publishers are most 
grateful to Messrs. Vincent J. Brocato and Charles L. Brocato, attorneys, to Honorable W. S. Kincade, 
Mayor, Honorable Hudson Bell and J. W. McKellar, Commissioners, and to T. C. Fox, City Clerk. 
    The publication of this Code was under the direct supervision of George R. Langford, President and 
David N. Hirsch and C. Julian Manson, Editors of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida. 
Credit is gratefully acknowledged also to the other members of the publisher's staff for their sincere 
interest and able assistance throughout the project. 
    This Code is presented for the use and benefit of the citizens of the City of Clarksdale, Mississippi.

PART I - CHARTER AND ENABLING ACT OF THE CITY OF CLARKSDALE[1] 
BE IT REMEMBERED: 
    That whereas, a proper petition of the qualified electors of the City of Clarksdale, County of 
Coahoma, State of Mississippi, was duly and properly filed with the mayor and board of aldermen of the 
said city, praying that an election be ordered by said mayor and board of aldermen to determine whether 
or not the City of Clarksdale aforesaid should adopt a commission form of government as provided in 
Chapter 101 of the Laws of Mississippi of 1908, which petition was as follows, to wit. 
    "To the Mayor and Board of Aldermen of the City of Clarksdale: 
    "The undersigned qualified voters of the City of Clarksdale hereby petition your Honorable body 
to order an election to be held in the City of Clarksdale as required by law, to determine whether or 
not the qualified voters of the City of Clarksdale will elect and determine to adopt a commission form 
of government as is provided by law, with the following named elective officers to wit: Three 
commissioners, one of whom shall be voted for and elected as mayor. 
    "That each of said commissioners shall be required during each day to devote not less than two 
hours in the service of the City of Clarksdale, and that the salary of each of the said commissioners 
shall be not exceeding fifty dollars per month, and that each of the said commissioners shall be 
required to give bond as required by law. Your petitioners pray that said election be ordered and held 
at as early a date as may be done in compliance with law." 
    And whereas, the mayor and board of aldermen of the City of Clarksdale did order an election 
to determine whether said commission form of government should be adopted, which said election 
was duly and legally held on the 30th day of August, 1910, and resulted in the adoption by the 
qualified electors of said City of Clarksdale of the commission form of government for said city, and 
the said mayor and board of aldermen by resolution did declare the result of said election and 
declared the adoption of the said commission form of government; 
    And whereas, the Clerk of the said City of Clarksdale has duly and properly certified to me the 
result of said election as set forth and declared by resolution of the said mayor and board of 
aldermen as the law directs, 
    Now therefore, I, Joseph W. Power, Secretary of State, by virtue of the authority and 
requirements of the said Chapter 108 of the Laws of 1908, do hereby issue this Charter of the City of

designate. The Mayor shall be entitled to all such employment benefits as are lawfully available 
to City employees, including, without limitation, health and hospitalization insurance and 
participation in the Mississippi Public Employees Retirement System. Beginning effective on 
January 1, 2000, the salary of the Mayor shall be adjusted to Sixty-Six Thousand Dollars

Dollars ($15,000.00) per annum, payable monthly, or at such other frequency as the Board of

adopted, designate. At the option of an individual Commissioner, he or she may elect to receive 
from the City an expense reimbursement, including expenses for maintaining an office or home 
office as part of his or her annual compensation, upon the express conditions (a) that the annual 
salary payable to such Commissioner shall be reduced by the amount of such office expense 
reimbursement from the City; (b) the Commissioner so electing must, in all respects, comply 
with the regulations and requirements set forth in the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as 
amended, and as set forth in the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997 for home office deductions, and 
as the same may, from time to time, be amended; and (c) each Commissioner so electing shall 
file annually with the City Clerk notice of such election and sufficient supporting documentation 
so as to comply with Internal Revenue regulations relative to such expense reimbursement. In 
no event shall a Commissioner be entitled to receive a combination of office expense 
reimbursement and salary in excess of the maximum salary amount set forth herein. Each 
Commissioner shall also be entitled to all such employment benefits as are lawfully available to 
City employees, including, without limitation, health and hospitalization insurance and 
participation in the Mississippi Public Employees Retirement System. 
(iii)	Cost of Living Adjustments. In the event that all City of Clarksdale employees receive a cost of 
living adjustment to their annual salaries, the Mayor and the Commissioners shall be entitled to 
receive the same percentage adjustments as do all other City employees in order to reflect 
changes in the cost of living. 
(iv)	Modification of Amount or Frequency. The amount of the annual compensation of the Mayor 
and the Commissioners and/or the frequency of payment may be modified from time by 
ordinance duly adopted in accordance with the provisions of MISS. CODE ANN. § 21-13-1 et 
seq. (Rev. 1990), as amended. 
[(D)]	Bonds. The Mayor and each Commissioner shall be required to enter into bond as required by law 
before beginning the discharge of their duties, and throughout the term of office of each. Said bonds

(a)	Findings. 
(1)	Clarksdale has experienced a series of incidents in which citizens and animals have been 
threatened or attacked and injured by pit bull dogs. 
(2)	The pit bull breed was developed for the purpose of producing fighting dogs. 
(3)	To increase its effectiveness as a fighter, certain pit bull traits have been selected and 
maximized by controlled breeding, including: 
a.	A set of powerful jaws with an exceptional ability to grip, lock and tear when dog bites; 
b.	A unique insensitivity to pain that causes pit bulls to be exceedingly tenacious in attack; 
c.	An unusually aggressive temperament toward human beings and animals; and 
d.	An extraordinary directness in the method of attack that does not include the common 
warning signs such as barking or growling as displayed by other breeds. 
(4)	For the reasons provided in this Section, unregulated and inadequately controlled pit bull dogs 
present a present danger to the health and welfare of the citizens and animals in the City 
different in degree and kind from the dangers presented by other breeds of dogs. 
(b)	Regulations. 
(1)	Generally. This ordinance is intended to utilize the authority and powers of the City in order to 
secure for the citizens of Clarksdale the protection of their health, safety and welfare. This 
ordinance is intended to be applicable to dogs which are commonly referred to as "pit bulls" and 
which are defined herein. This ordinance is designed to regulate these pit bull dogs and to 
ensure responsible handling by their owners through confinement and registration. The unique 
history, nature and characteristics of pit bull dogs have been determined to require the special 
regulations and provisions contained within this ordinance which the Board hereby finds 
reasonable and necessary. 
(2)	Definition; identification of a pit bull dog. The term "pit bull" dog as used within this ordinance 
shall refer to any dog which exhibits those distinguishing characteristics which substantially 
conform to the standards established by the American Kennel Club for American Staffordshire 
Terriers of Staffordshire Bull Terriers, or which substantially conform to the standards 
established by the United Kennel Club for American Pit Bull Terriers. Technical deficiencies in a 
dog's conformance to the standards described herein shall not be considered to indicate that 
the subject dog is not a pit bull dog pursuant to this ordinance. Testimony by a veterinarian or 
an individual with training, experience, education and qualifications duly recognized by the 
Municipal Court, that a particular dog exhibits distinguishing physical characteristics of a pit bull 
shall establish a rebuttable presumption that the dog is a pit bull. 
(3)	Confinement of pit bull dogs. 
a.	Because of the pit bull dog's inbred propensity to attack other animals, and because of the 
danger posed to humans and animals alike by a pit bull dog when running loose or while 
running together in a pack, pit bull dogs must at all times be securely confined indoors, or 
confined in a securely and totally enclosed and locked pen, constructed with cyclone type 
fencing material of at least 9 gauge wire in thickness; with all four (4) sides to be at least 
six (6) feet in height; with concrete slab foundation at least 4 inches in thickness; and a 
secured cyclone fence top; such enclosure shall likewise have a conspicuous sign affixed 
thereto displaying the words "Dangerous Dog." 
b.	At any time that a pit bull dog is not confined as required in paragraph (1) above, the dog 
shall be muzzled in such a manner as to prevent it from biting or injuring any person or 
animal, and kept on a leash with the owner or custodian in attendance; provided, however, 
that no pit bull dog may be walked within fifty (50) feet of any school, nursery or daycare 
ground, nor enter onto such school, nursery or daycare ground. 
c.	An exception to these confinement requirements is hereby provided for any pit bull dog in 
attendance at, and participating in, any lawful dog show, contest or exhibition sponsored by 
a dog club, association, society or similar organization. 
(4)	Registration of pit bull dogs. Every owner of a pit bull dog within the City shall annually register 
said dog with the Clarksdale Animal Shelter and pay a fee of $10 per pit bull. The registration 
shall include the following: Name, address and telephone number of the dog's owner; the 
address where the dog is harbored, if different from that of the owner; a complete identification 
of the dog, including the dog's sex, color and other distinguishing physical characteristics; a 
color photograph of the dog, and a description of the method of compliance with the 
confinement requirements. Certification of rabies vaccination and proof of liability insurance 
shall be presented upon registration. The rabies vaccination tag shall be worn on the dog's 
collar at all times. Owners of pit bulls shall annually re-register their dog(s) on or by the 
anniversary date of the initial registration. 
(5)	Owner age requirement. Owners, keepers or harborers of pit bull dogs or the like must be 
twenty-one (21) years of age. A person must be twenty-one (21) years of age to walk a pit bull 
dog or the like on a leash. 
(6)	Limits of confinement. No more than three (3) pit bull dogs or the like shall be confined at any 
single dwelling in Clarksdale. 
(7)	Altering of pit bull dogs. All pit dogs shall be neutered or spayed, and the appropriate 
certification shall be provided to the Clarksdale Animal Shelter upon registration. 
(8)	Liability insurance. Owners of pit bull dogs or the like shall maintain a liability insurance policy in 
an amount not less than $100,000.00, for bodily injury or property damages arising from the 
events or occurrences associated with owning, keeping or harboring pit bull dogs or the like. 
(9)	Enforcement. It shall be the duty and responsibility of the City's animal control officer and/or 
police department to enforce the provisions of this ordinance. Owners, keepers or harborers of 
pit bull dogs or the like, may be subjected to spot checks by local law enforcement and must be 
able to produce registration, proof of liability insurance, and show confinement to the 
satisfaction of this ordinance. 
(10)	Schedule of penalties. 
a.	Violations of this ordinance shall be punished as follows: 
1.	First offense. A fine of not less than $100.00 nor more than $300.00 nor more than 10 
days in jail, or both. 
2.	Second offense. A fine of not less than $300.00 nor more than $500.00 nor more than 
20 days in jail or both. 
3.	A fine of not less than $500.00 nor more than $1000.00 nor more than 30 days in jail 
or both, and permanent relinquishment of all pit bull dogs or the like by the owner, 
keeper or harborer. 
b.	A separate offense shall be held to have been committed each day that such violation shall 
occur or continue. 
c.	The Municipal Court may order violators to pay all costs incurred by the City to include, but 
not limited to, veterinarian and boarding costs. Additionally, the Municipal Court may order 
the removal of a dog from the City limits of Clarksdale. This Ordinance does not preclude 
the concurrent prosecution of other animal control ordinances relating to the owner or dog. 
d.	Enforcement of penalties for violations of this ordinance shall be within the jurisdiction of 
the City of Clarksdale Municipal Court.

article. 
(4)	Multifamily residential (R-3) and/or (R-4) and agricultural (A-1) districts as a conditional use; 
provided, however, that such towers also satisfy all of the requirements in Section 6-55 of this 
article. 
(5)	Guy towers shall not be permitted within the central commercial (C-1) zoning district. 
(b)	Rooftop mounted communications towers and antennas may be located on any nonresidential 
buildings and alternative tower structures in the city so long as: 
(1)	Such tower or antenna is set back from any existing or planned off-site residence and separated 
from any residentially zoned property at least a distance equal to two (2) times the full height of 
the tower and antennas, but in no event less than one hundred (100) feet; 
(2)	The existing free-standing nonresidential structure other than a tower on which such tower or 
antenna will be placed is fifty (50) feet in height or greater and the tower and antenna will add 
no more than twenty (20) feet total to the height of said existing structure; 
(3)	No advertising is permitted on an antenna or tower; 
(4)	No signs or illuminations are permitted on an antenna or tower unless required by the FCC,

search area is defined as the grid for the placement of the antenna. 
(Ord. No. 937, § IV, 2-3-1997) 


Sec. 6-55. - General requirements. 
    The requirements set forth in this Section shall govern the location and construction of all towers and 
the installation of all antennas governed by this Ordinance. 
(1)	Building codes; safety standards. To ensure the structural integrity of communication towers, 
the owner of a tower shall ensure that it is maintained in compliance with standards contained in 
applicable local building codes and the applicable standards for towers that are published by the 
Electronic Industries Association, as amended from time to time. Tower owners shall conduct 
periodic inspections of communication towers at least once every three (3) years to ensure 
structural integrity, unless required to do so more often under the regulations promulgated by 
the Southern Standard Building Code Congress and/or the Electronics Industries Association. 
Inspections shall be conducted by a structural engineer licensed to practice in Mississippi. The 
results of each inspection shall be provided to the Director. 
(2)	Regulatory Compliance 
a.	All towers and antennas must meet or exceed current standards and regulations of the 
FAA, the FCC and any other agency of the state or federal government with the authority 
to regulate communications towers and antennas. If such standards and regulations are 
changed, then the owners of the communications towers and antennas governed by this 
article shall bring such communications towers and antennas into compliance with such 
revised standards and regulations within six (6) months of the effective date of such 
standards and regulations, unless a more stringent compliance schedule is mandated by 
the controlling federal or state agency. 
b.	Tower owners shall provide documentation showing that each communication tower is in 
compliance with all federal and state requirements. Evidence of compliance must be 
submitted to the city clerk no less often than every twelve (12) months. 
(3)	Security. Communication towers shall be enclosed by decay-resistant security fencing not less 
than six (6) feet in height and shall be equipped with an appropriate anti-climbing device; 
provided, however, the director or the governing body may, upon written request, and in his or 
its sole discretion, waive such requirements for alternative tower structures. 
(4)	Lighting. No illumination is permitted on an antenna or tower unless required by the FCC, FAA 
or other state or federal agency of competent jurisdiction, in which case the Director may review 
the available lighting alternatives and approve the design that would cause the least disturbance 
to the surrounding uses and views. 
(5)	Advertising. No advertising is permitted on an antenna or tower. 
(6)	Visual Impact. 
a.	Towers shall either maintain a galvanized steel finish or, subject to any applicable 
standards of the FAA or other applicable federal or state agency, be painted a neutral 
color, so as to reduce visual obtrusiveness. 
b.	At a tower site the design of the buildings and related structures shall, to the extent 
possible, use materials, colors, textures, screening, and landscaping that will blend the 
tower facilities to the neutral setting and built environment. 
c.	If an antenna is installed on a structure other than a tower, the antenna and supporting 
electrical and mechanical equipment must be of a neutral color that is identical to, or 
closely compatible with, the color of the supporting structure so as to make the antenna 
and related equipment as visually unobtrusive as possible. 
d.	Towers clustered at the same site shall be of similar height and design. 
e.	Towers shall be the minimum height necessary to provide parity with existing similar tower 
supported antenna, and shall be freestanding where the negative visual effect is less than 
would be created by use of a guyed tower. 
(7)	Landscaping. Landscaping shall be used to effectively screen the view of the tower compound 
from adjacent public ways, public property and residential property and shall be as follows: 
a.	For towers one hundred fifty (150) feet tall, a buffer area no less than six (6) feet wide shall 
commence at the property line. 
b.	For towers more than one hundred fifty (150) feet tall, a buffer area not less than ten (10) 
feet wide shall be provided at the property line. 
c.	The buffer zone is to consist of materials of a variety which can be expected to grow to 
form a continuous hedge at lease five (5) feet in height within two (2) years of planting. 
d.	Trees and shrubs in the vicinity of guy wires shall be of a kind that would not exceed 
twenty (20) feet in height or would not affect the stability of the guys, should they be 
uprooted, and shall not obscure visibility of the anchor from the transmission building or 
security facilities and staff/maintenance. 
e.	Native vegetation on the site shall be preserved to the greatest practical extent. The 
applicant shall provide a site plan showing existing significant vegetation to be removed, 
and vegetation to be replanted to replace that lost. 
f.	In lieu of these standards, the director may allow use of an alternate detailed plan and 
specifications for landscape and screening, including plantings, fences, walls and other 
features designed to screen and buffer towers and accessory uses. The plan shall 
accomplish the same degree of screening achieved by the provisions above, except as 
lesser requirements are desirable for adequate visibility for security purposes and/or for 
continued operation of existing bona fide agricultural or forest uses such as farms, 
nurseries and tree farms. In certain locations where the visual impact of the tower would be 
minimal, such as remote agricultural or rural locations or developed heavy industrial areas, 
the landscaping requirement may be reduced or waived by the director. 
(8)	Maintenance Impacts. Equipment at a transmission facility shall be automated to the greatest 
extent possible to reduce traffic and congestion. Where the site abuts or has access to a 
collector and local street, access for maintenance vehicles shall be exclusively by means of the 
collector street. 
(9)	Principal, accessory and joint uses. 
a.	Accessory structures used in direct support of a tower shall be allowed, but shall not be 
used for offices, vehicle storage or other outdoor storage. Mobile or immobile equipment 
not used in direct support of a tower facility shall not be stored or parked on the site of the 
tower, unless repairs to the tower are being made. 
b.	Towers may be located on sites containing another principal use in the same buildable 
area. As long as all of the other siting, setback, separation and general requirements of this 
article are met, owners may occupy a parcel meeting the minimum lot size requirements 
for the zoning district in which it is located. The minimum distance between a tower and 
other principal use located on the same lot shall be for a monopole or lattice tower the 
greater of twenty (20) percent of the tower height or twenty-five (25) feet, and for a guy 
tower the greater of one hundred (100) percent breakpoint or twenty-five (25) feet. This 
separation is required to assure compatibility of land uses and to provide for the health, 
safety and welfare of individuals and structures occupying the same site. 
(10)	Tower lot size, setbacks and separations. 
a.	The site shall be of a size and shape sufficient to provide an adequate setback from the 
base of the tower to any property line abutting a residential district, public property, or 
public street. Such setback shall be sufficient to: 
1.	Provide for an adequate vegetative, topographic or other buffer as required in 
subsections (6) and (7) above; 
2.	Preserve the privacy of surrounding residential property; and 
3.	Protect adjoining property from the potential impact of tower failure by being large 
enough to accommodate such failure on the site, based on the engineers analysis 
required in section 6-57. 
b.	A site is presumed to be of sufficient size when it: 
1.	Meets the requirements of the above subsection (10)a.; 
2.	Provides a setback equal to two (2) times the height of the tower to any property line 
abutting a residential district, public property, or public street; and 
3.	Provides a setback equal to or exceeding the rear yard setback required for the 
adjoining property where the adjoining property is not in a residential district nor a 
public property or a public street. 
c.	Placement of more than one (1) tower on a lot shall be permitted, provided all setback, 
design and landscape requirements are met as to each tower. Structures may be located 
as close to each other as technically feasible, provided tower failure characteristics of the 
towers on the site will not lead to multiple failures in the event that one fails. 
d.	For a guyed structure, the site shall be of a size and shape sufficient to provide a setback 
equal to at least the height of the tower from a guy anchor to any property line abutting a 
residential district, public property or public street in addition to the size required to comply 
with subsection (10)b. above. Such setback shall be adequate to provide a vegetative, 
topographic or other buffer sufficient to obscure view to the anchor from such adjoining 
properties. 
e.	All structures and uses associated with the transmission use other than the transmission 
tower shall be located to meet the setbacks required in the zoning district where the tower 
is to be located. To encourage and accommodate shared use of a tower, the board may 
waive or reduce setback requirements by up to fifty (50) percent to accommodate the 
placement of additional buildings or other supporting equipment at a tower site. 
f.	No free-standing communication tower shall be allowed within a one thousand (1,000) foot 
radius of an existing tower within a residential area. 
g.	In no case shall a tower be located in the front yard of any lot for abutting a residential 
district. 
h.	All free-standing towers constructed after March 1, 1997, shall conform to the following 
minimum tower separation requirements:

(Ord. No. 937, § V, 2-3-1997) 


Sec. 6-56. - Shared use. 
    All new towers shall be designed to structurally accommodate the maximum number of additional 
users technically practicable. 
(1)	To encourage shared use of towers, no building permit or special use permit shall be required 
for the addition of antenna(s) to an existing tower so long as the height of the tower or structure 
on which the antenna is placed is not increased and the requirements of subsection 6-54(b) and 
section 6-55 are met. 
(2)	If a new tower is approved, the owner shall be required, as a condition of approval, to: 
a.	Record the letter of intent required by section 6-58(10) in the office of the city clerk; 
b.	Respond in a timely, comprehensive manner to a request for information from a potential 
shared use applicant; 
c.	Negotiate in good faith for shared use by third parties; and 
d.	Allow shared use where the third party seeking such use agrees in writing to pay 
reasonable, pro rata charges for sharing, including all charges necessary to modify the 
tower and transmitters to accommodate shared use, but not total tower reconstruction, and 
to observe whatever technical requirements are necessary to allow shared use without 
creating interference. 
(3)	Willful, knowing failure of an owner whose tower was approved after the effective date of this 
article [March 5, 1997], to comply with the requirement of subsections (2)a. through d. above 
shall be grounds for withholding approval of any application by such owner for a building permit 
or special use permit for any tower or antenna. 
(4)	Such conditions shall run with the land and be binding on subsequent purchasers of the tower 
site. 
(Ord. No. 937, § VI, 2-3-1997) 


Sec. 6-57. - Special use permits. 
    A request for a special use permit shall be initiated by application to the director and handled in 
accordance with special provisions of the Code of Ordinances of the City. The board may impose 
additional zoning conditions to the extent determined necessary to buffer or otherwise minimize adverse 
effects of the proposed tower or antenna on surrounding properties. 
(Ord. No. 937, § VII, 2-3-1997) 


Sec. 6-58. - Application procedures. 
    Application for a building permit for any communication tower or use of an alternative tower structure 
shall be made to the director. An application will not be considered until it is complete. A complete 
application must contain the following: 
(1)	Inventory of existing Sites. An inventory of the applicant's existing towers that are either within 
the corporate limits of the City or within one mile of the border thereof, including specific 
information about the location, height, and design of each tower. The Director may share such 
information with other applicants applying for administrative approvals or special use permits 
under this article or other organizations seeking to locate antennas within the city; provided, 
however, that the director is not, by sharing such information, in any way representing or 
warranting that such sites are available or suitable. 
(2)	Site plan or plans to scale specifying the location of tower(s), guy anchors (if any), transmission 
building and/or other accessory uses, access, parking, fences, landscaped areas, and adjacent 
land uses. 
(3)	Landscape plan to scale indicating size, spacing and type of plantings required in Section 6-
55(7). 
(4)	Utilities inventory showing the locations of all water, sewage, drainage and power lines 
impacting the proposed tower site. 
(5)	An environmental impact statement fully describing the effects that the proposed tower and/or 
antenna will have on the environment and surrounding area including the radiological impact on 
human health, impacts on adjacent residential structures and districts, impacts on structures 
and sites of historic significance and impacts on streetscapes. 
(6)	A certified statement prepared by an engineer licensed to practice in the state that the 
construction of the tower, including reception and transmission functions, will not interfere with 
the usual and customary transmission or reception of radio, television, etc., service enjoyed by 
adjacent properties. 
(7)	A description of anticipated maintenance needs, including frequency of service, personnel 
needs, equipment needs, and traffic, noise or safety impacts of such maintenance. 
(8)	A report from a professional structural engineer licensed in the state, documenting the following: 
a.	Tower height and design, including technical, engineering, economic, and other pertinent 
factors governing selection of the proposed design. A cross-section of the tower structure 
shall be including. 
b.	Total anticipated capacity of the structure, including number and types of antennas which 
can be accommodated. 
c.	Evidence of structural integrity of the tower structure. 
d.	Failure characteristics of the tower and demonstration that site and setbacks are of 
adequate size to contain debris. 
(9)	Written statements from the FAA, FCC and any appropriate state review authority stating that 
the proposed tower complies with regulations administered by that agency or that the tower is 
exempt from those regulations. 
(10)	Letter of intent to lease excess space on the tower structure and to lease additional excess land 
on the tower site when the shared use potential of the tower is absorbed, if structurally and 
technically possible. 
(11)	A reasonable pro rata charge may be made for shared use, consistent with an appropriate 
sharing of construction, financing and maintenance costs. Fees may also be charged for any 
structural or RF changes necessitated by such shared use. Such sharing shall be a condition of 
approval if approval is granted. 
a.	The applicant shall describe what range of charges are reasonably expected to be 
assessed against shared users. 
b.	The applicant shall base charges on generally accepted accounting principles and shall 
explain the elements included in the charge. 
(12)	The applicant shall quantify the additional tower capacity anticipated, including the approximate 
number and types of antennas. The applicant shall also describe any limitations on the ability of 
the tower to accommodate other uses, e.g., radio frequency interference, mass height, 
frequency or other characteristics. The applicant shall describe the technical options available to 
overcome those limitations and reasons why the technical options considered were not chosen 
to be incorporated. The Director shall approve those limitations if they cannot be overcome by 
reasonable technical means. 
(13)	Evidence of the lack of space on all suitable existing towers to locate the proposed antenna and 
of the lack of space on existing tower sites to construct a tower for the proposed antenna. 
(14)	Each applicant must make a good faith effort to substantially demonstrate that no existing or 
planned towers can accommodate the applicant's proposed antenna/transmitter as described 
below. 
a.	The applicant shall contact the owners of all existing or planned towers of a height roughly 
equal to or greater than the height of the tower proposed by the applicant. A list shall be 
provided of all owners contacted, the date of such contact, and the form and content of 
such contact. 
b.	Such contact shall be made in a timely manner; that is, sufficiently before the filing of an 
application for a building or special use permit to include a response into the application 
when filed. 
1.	Failure of a listed owner to respond shall not be relevant if a timely, good faith [effort] 
was made to obtain one. However, where an existing or planned tower is known to

presumed unreasonable.

standards or which constitute a danger to persons or property are brought into compliance or removed. 
The city may seek to have the tower or antenna removed regardless of the owners' or operators intent to

regardless of any permits, federal, state, or otherwise, which may have been granted. 
(b)	If the owner of an abandoned tower or antenna wishes to use such abandoned tower or antenna, the 
owner first must apply for and receive all applicable permits and meet all of the conditions of this

Sec. 6C-22. - Initial review of basic cable rates. 
(a)	Notice. Upon the adoption of this article and the certification of the City of Clarksdale by the FCC, the 
city shall immediately notify all cable operators in the city, by certified mail, return receipt requested, 
that the city intends to regulate subscriber rates charged for the basic service tier and associated 
equipment as authorized by the Cable Act of 1992. 
(b)	Cable operator response. Within thirty (30) days of receiving notice from the city, a cable operator 
shall file with the city its current rates for the basic service tier and associated equipment and any 
supporting material concerning the reasonableness of its rates. 
(c)	Expedited determination and public hearing. 
(1)	If the board is able to expeditiously determine that the cable operator's rates for the basic 
service tier and associated equipment are within the FCC's reasonable rate standard, as 
determined by the applicable benchmark, the board shall: 
a.	Hold a public hearing at which interested persons may express their views; and 
b.	Act to approve the rates within thirty (30) days from the date the cable operator filed its 
basic cable rates with the city. 
(2)	If the board takes no action within thirty (30) days from the date the cable operator files its basic 
cable rates with the city, the proposed rates will continue in effect. 
(d)	Extended review period. 
(1)	If the board is unable to determine whether the rates in issue are within the FCC's reasonable 
rate standard based on the material before it, or if the cable operator submits a cost-of-service 
showing, the board shall, within thirty (30) days from the date the cable operator filed its basic 
cable rates with the city and by adoption of a formal resolution, invoke the following additional 
period of time, as applicable, to make a final determination: 
a.	Ninety (90) days if the board of mayor and commissioners need more time to ensure that a 
rate is within a FCC's reasonable rate standard; or 
b.	One hundred fifty (150) days if the cable operator has submitted a cost-of-service showing 
seeking to justify a rate above the applicable benchmark. 
(2)	If the board has not made a decision within the ninety- or one hundred fifty-day period, the 
board shall issue a brief written order at the end of the period requesting the cable operator to 
keep accurate account of all amounts received by reason of the proposed rate and on whose 
behalf the amounts are paid. 
(e)	Public hearing. During the extended review period and before taking action on the proposed rate, the 
board shall hold at least one (1) public hearing at which interested persons may express their views 
and record objections. 
(f)	Objections. An interested person who wishes to make an objection to the proposed initial basic rate 
may request the city clerk to record the objection during the public hearing or may submit the 
objection in writing any time before the decision resolution is adopted. In order for an objection to be 
made part of the record, the objector must provide the city clerk with the objector's name and 
address. 
(g)	Benchmark analysis. If a cable operator submits its current basic cable rate schedule as being in 
compliance with the FCC's reasonable rate standard, the board shall review the rates using the 
benchmark analysis in accordance with the standard form authorized by the FCC. Based on the 
findings of the board, the initial basic cable rates shall be established as follows: 
(1)	If the current basic cable rates are below the benchmark, those rates shall become the initial 
basic cable rates and the cable operator's rates will be capped at that level. 
(2)	If the current basic cable rates exceed the benchmark, the rates shall be the greater of the 
cable operator's per-channel rate on September 30, 1992, reduced by ten (10) percent, or the 
applicable benchmark, adjusted for inflation and any change in the number of channels 
occurring between September 30, 1992 and the initial date of regulation. 
(3)	If the current basic cable rates exceed the benchmark, but the cable operator's per-channel rate 
was below the benchmark on September 30, 1992, the initial basic rate shall be the benchmark, 
adjusted for inflation. 
(h)	Cost-of-service showings. If a cable operator does not wish to reduce the rates to the permitted level, 
the cable operator shall have the opportunity to submit a cost-of-service showing in an attempt to 
justify an initial basic cable rate above the FCC's reasonable rate standard. The board will review a 
cost-of-service submission pursuant to FCC standards for cost-of-service review. The board may 
approve initial basic cable rates above the benchmark if the cable operator makes the necessary 
showing; however, a cost-of-service determination resulting in rates below the benchmark or below 
the cable operator's September 30, 1992 rates minus ten (10) percent, will prescribe the cable 
operator's new rates. 
(i)	Decision. 
(1)	By formal resolution. After completion of its review of the cable operator's proposed rates, the 
board shall adopt its decision by formal resolution. The decision shall include one (1) of the 
following: 
a.	If the proposal is within the FCC's reasonable rate standard or is justified by a cost-of-
service analysis, the board shall approve the initial basic cable rates proposed by the cable 
operator; or 
b.	If the proposal is not within the FCC's reasonable rate standard and the cost-of-service 
analysis, if any, does not justify the proposed rates, the board shall establish initial basic 
cable rates that are within the FCC's reasonable rate standard or that are justified by a 
cost-of-service analysis. 
(2)	Rollbacks and refunds. If the board determines that the initial basic cable rates as submitted 
exceed the reasonable rate standard or that the cable operator's cost-of-service showing 
justifies lower rates, the board may order the rates reduced in accordance with subsection (g) or 
(h) above, as applicable. In addition, the Board may order the cable operator to pay to 
subscribers refunds of the excessive portion of the rates with interest (computed at applicable 
rates published by the Internal Revenue Service for tax refunds and additional tax payments), 
retroactive to September 1, 1993. The method for paying any refund and the interest rate will be 
in accordance with FCC regulations as directed in the board's decision resolution. 
(3)	Statement of reasons for decision and public notice. If rates proposed by a cable operator are 
disapproved in whole or in part, or if there were objections made by other parties to the 
proposed rates, the resolution must state the reasons for the decision and the board must give 
public notice of its decision. Public notice will be given by advertisement once in a newspaper 
published in and having general circulation in the city. 
(j)	Appeal. The board's decision concerning rates for the basic service tier or associated equipment, 
may be appealed to the FCC in accordance with applicable federal regulations. 
(Ord. No. 902, § 2, 11-15-1993) 


Sec. 6C-23. - Review of request for increase in basic cable rates. 
(a)	Notice. A cable operator in the City of Clarksdale who wishes to increase the rates for the basic 
service tier or associated equipment shall file a request with the city clerk and notify all subscribers at 
least thirty (30) days before the cable operator desires the increase to take effect. This notice may 
not be given more often than annually and not until at least one (1) year after the determination of 
the initial basic cable rates. 
(b)	Expedited determination and public hearing. 
(1)	If the board is able to expeditiously determine that the cable operator's rate increase request for 
basic cable service is within the FCC's reasonable rate standard, as determined by the 
applicable price cap, the board shall: 
a.	Hold a public hearing at which interested persons may express their views; and 
b.	Act to approve the rate increase within thirty (30) days from the date the cable operator 
filed its request with the city. 
(2)	If the board takes no action within thirty (30) days from the date the cable operator filed its 
request with the city, the proposed rates will go into effect. 
(c)	Extended review period. 
(1)	If the board is unable to determine whether the rate increase is within the FCC's reasonable 
rate standard based on the material before it, or if the cable operator submits a cost-of-service 
showing, the board shall, by adoption of a formal resolution, invoke the following additional 
periods of time, as applicable, to make a final determination: 
a.	Ninety (90) days if the board needs more time to ensure that the requested increase is 
within the FCC's reasonable rate standard as determined by the applicable price cap; and 
b.	One hundred fifty (150) days if the cable operator has submitted a cost-of-service showing 
seeking to justify a rate increase above the applicable price cap. 
(2)	The proposed rate increase is tolled during the extended review period. 
(3)	If the board has not made a decision within the ninety- or one hundred fifty-day period, the 
board shall issue a brief written order at the end of the period requesting the cable operator to 
keep accurate account of all amounts received by reason of the proposed rate increase and on 
whose behalf the amounts are paid. 
(d)	Public hearing. During the extended review period and before taking action on the requested rate 
increase, the board shall hold at least one (1) public hearing at which interested persons may 
express their views and record objections. 
(e)	Objections. An interested person who wishes to make an objection to the proposed rate increase 
may request the city clerk to record the objection during the public hearing or may submit the 
objection in writing anytime before the decision resolution is adopted. In order for an objection to be 
made part of the record, the objector must provide the city clerk with the objector's name and 
address. 
(f)	Delayed determination. If the board is unable to make a final determination concerning a requested 
rate increase within the extended time period, the cable operator may put the increase into effect, 
subject to subsequent refund if the board later issues a decision disapproving any portion of the 
increase. 
(g)	Price cap analysis. If a cable operator presents its request for a rate increase as being in compliance 
with the FCC's price cap, the board shall review the rate using the price cap analysis in accordance 
with the standard form authorized by the FCC. Based on the findings of the board, the basic cable 
rates shall be established as follows: 
(1)	If the proposed basic cable rate increase is within the price cap established by the FCC, the 
proposed rates shall become the new basic cable rates. 
(2)	If the proposed basic cable rate increase exceeds the price cap established by the FCC, the 
board shall disapprove the proposed rate increase and order an increase that is in compliance 
with the price cap. 
(h)	Cost-of-service showing. If a cable operator submits a cost-of-service showing in an attempt to justify 
a rate increase above the price cap, the board will review the submission pursuant to the FCC 
standards for cost-of-service review. The board may approve a rate increase above the price cap if 
the cable operator makes the necessary showing; however, a cost-of-service determination resulting 
in a rate below the price cap or below the cable operator's then-current rate will prescribe the cable 
operator's new rate. 
(i)	Decision. The board's decision concerning the requested rate increase shall be adopted by formal 
resolution. If a rate increase proposed by a cable operator is disapproved in whole or in part, or if 
objections were made by other parties to the proposed rate increase, the resolution must state the 
reasons for the decision. Objections may be made at the public hearing by a person requesting the 
City Clerk to record the objection or may be submitted in writing at any time before the decision 
resolution is adopted. 
(j)	Refunds. 
(1)	The board may order refunds of subscribers' rate payments with interest if: 
a.	The board was unable to make a decision within the extended time period as described in 
Paragraph (c) above; and 
b.	The cable operator implemented the rate increase at the end of the extended review 
period; and 
c.	The board determines that the rate increase as submitted exceeds the applicable price cap 
or that the cable operator failed to justify the rate increase by a cost-of-service showing, 
and the board disapproves any portion of the rate increase. 
(2)	The method for paying any refund and the interest rate will be in accordance with FCC 
regulations as directed in the board's decision resolution. 
(k)	Appeal. The board's decision concerning rates for the basic service tier or associated equipment, 
may be appealed to the FCC in accordance with applicable federal regulations.

Sec. 6C-24. - Cable operator information. 
(a)	City may require: 
(1)	In those cases when the cable operator has submitted initial rates or proposed an increase that 
exceeds the reasonable rate standard, the board may require the cable operator to produce 
information in addition to that submitted, including proprietary information, if needed to make a 
rate determination. In these cases, a cable operator may request the information be kept 
confidential in accordance with this section. 
(2)	In cases where initial or proposed rates comply with the reasonable rate standard, the board 
may request additional information only in order to document that the cable operator's rates are 
in accord with the standard. 
(b)	Request for confidentiality. 
(1)	A cable operator submitting information to the city may request in writing that the information not 
be made routinely available for public inspection. A copy of the request shall be attached to and 
cover all of the information and all copies of the information to which it applies. 
(2)	If feasible, the information to which the request applies shall be physically separated from any 
information to which the request does not apply. If this is not feasible, the portion of the 
information to which the request applies shall be identified. 
(3)	Each request shall contain a statement of the reasons for withholding inspection and a 
statement of the facts upon which those reasons are based. 
(4)	Casual requests which do not comply with the requirements of this subsection, shall not be 
considered. 
(5)	In the events of conflicts between this article and the Mississippi Public Records Act of 1983, 
Miss. Code Ann. § 25-61-1 et seq. (1983) and as amended thereafter, the Public Records Act 
shall control. 
(c)	City board action. Requests which comply with the requirements of subsection (b) above will be 
acted upon by the board. The board will grant the request if the cable operator presents by a 
preponderance of the evidence, a case for nondisclosure consistent with applicable federal 
regulations. If the request is granted, the ruling will be placed in a public file in lieu of the information 
withheld from public inspection. 
If the request does not present a case for nondisclosure and the board denies the request, the board shall 
take one (1) of the following actions: 
(1)	If the information has been submitted voluntarily without any direction from the city, the cable 
operator may request that the City return the information without considering it. 
Ordinarily, the city will comply with this request. Only in the unusual instance that the public 
interest so requires will the information he made available for public inspection. 
(2)	If the information was required to be submitted by the board, the information will be made 
available for public inspection. 
(d)	Appeal. If the board denies the request for confidentiality, the cable operator may seek review of that 
decision from the FCC within five (5) working days of the board's decision, and the release of the 
information will be stayed pending review. 
(Ord. No. 902, § 4, 11-15-1993) 


Sec. 6C-25. - Automatic rate adjustments. 
(a)	Annual inflation adjustment. In accordance with FCC regulations, the cable operator may adjust its 
capped base per-channel rate for the basic service tier annually by the final GNP-PI index. 
(b)	Other external costs. 
(1)	The FCC regulations also allow the cable operator to increase its rate for the basic service tier 
automatically to reflect certain external cost factors to the extent that the increase in cost of 
those factors exceeds the GNP-PI. These factors include retransmission consent fees, 
programming costs, state and local taxes applicable to the provision of cable television service, 
and costs of franchise requirements. The total cost of an increase in a franchise fee may be 
automatically added to the base per-channel rate, without regard to its relation to the GNP-PI. 
(2)	For all categories of external costs other than retransmission consent and franchise fees, the 
starting date for measuring changes in external costs for which the basic service per-channel 
rate may be adjusted will be the date on which the basic service tier becomes subject to 
regulation or February 28, 1994, whichever occurs first. The permitted per-channel charge may 
not be adjusted for costs of retransmission consent fees or changes in those fees incurred 
before October 6, 1994. 
(c)	Notification and review. The cable operator shall notify the city at least thirty (30) days in advance of 
a rate increase based on automatic adjustment items. The city shall review the increase to determine 
whether the item or items qualify as automatic adjustments. If the city makes no objection within 
thirty (30) days of receiving notice of the increase, the increase may go into effect. 
(Ord. No. 902, § 5, 11-15-1993) 


Sec. 6C-26. - Enforcement. 
(a)	Refunds. The city may order the cable operator to refund to subscribers a portion of previously paid 
rates under the following circumstances: 
(1)	A portion of the previously paid rates have been determined to be in excess of the permitted tier 
charge or above the actual cost of equipment; or 
(2)	The cable operator has failed to comply with a valid rate order issued by the city. 
(b)	Fines. If the cable operator fails to comply with a rate decision or refund order, the cable operator 
shall be subject to a fine of five hundred dollars ($500.00) for each day the cable operator fails to 
comply.

service over which it currently exercises jurisdiction in such manner as to expand, rather than limit, 
municipal regulatory authority, the grantor may, if it so elects, adopt rules and regulations in these 
areas to the extent permitted by law.

shall further apply to the extent permitted by applicable federal or state law to all existing franchises 
granted prior to the effective date of this article. 
(d)	A grantee's rights are subject to the police powers of the city to adopt and enforce ordinances 
necessary to the health, safety and welfare of the public. A grantee shall comply with all applicable

(a)	A grantee shall not sell, transfer, lease, assign, sublet or dispose of, in whole or in part, either by 
forced or involuntary sale, or by ordinary sale, consolidation or otherwise, its franchise and/or cable 
system, or any of the rights or privileges granted by the franchise, without the prior consent of the 
board, which consent shall not be unreasonably denied or delayed and shall be denied only upon a 
good faith finding by the city that the proposed transferee lacks the legal, technical or financial 
qualifications to perform its obligations under the franchise agreement. Any attempt to sell, transfer, 
lease, assign or otherwise dispose of the franchise and/or cable system without the consent of the 
board shall be null and void. This provision shall not apply to sales of property or equipment in the 
normal course of business. No consent from the city shall be required for a transfer in trust, 
mortgage, or other instrument of hypothecation, in whole or in part, to secure an indebtedness, or for 
a pro forma transfer to a corporation, partnership or other entity controlling, controlled by or under 
common control with a grantee. 
(b)	The following events shall be deemed to be a sale, assignment or other transfer of a franchise and/or 
cable system requiring compliance with this section:

grantee so as to create a new controlling interest in that grantee; and 
(4)	The entry by a grantee into an agreement with respect to the management or operation of the 
grantee and/or the system. 
    The term "controlling interest" as used herein means majority equity ownership of the grantee. 
(c)	Except as provided below, no grantee may sell or otherwise transfer ownership of a franchise and/or 
cable system within a thirty-six-month period following either the acquisition or initial construction of 
said system by a grantee. In the case of a sale of multiple systems, or if the terms of the sale require 
the buyer to subsequently transfer ownership of one or more of such systems to one or more third 
parties, such transfer shall be considered a part of the initial transaction. The above described thirty-
six-month holding period shall not apply to: 
(1)	Any transfer of ownership interest in any franchise and/or cable system which is not subject to 
federal income tax liability; 
(2)	Any sale required by operation of any law or any act of any agency, any state or political 
subdivision, or of the city; or 
(3)	Any sale, assignment or transfer, to one or more purchasers, assignees, or transferees 
controlled by, controlling, of under common control with, the seller, assigner or transferrer. 
(d)	In the case of any sale or transfer of ownership of any franchise and/or cable system after the thirty-
sixth month, following acquisition of such system, the city shall have one hundred twenty (120) days 
to act upon any requests for approval of such sale or transfer that contains or is accompanied by 
such information as is required in accordance with the Federal Communications Commission 
regulations, the requirements of this article and such other reasonable information as the city, in its 
sole discretion, may request. If the city fails to render a final decision on such request within one 
hundred twenty (120) days from the receipt by the city of all required information, such request shall 
be deemed granted unless the requesting party and the city agree to an extension of same. 
(e)	Any grantee shall notify the city in writing of any foreclosure or any other judicial sale of all or a 
substantial part of the franchise property of the grantee, or upon the termination of any lease or 
interest covering all or a substantial part of said franchise property. Such notification shall be 
considered by the grantor as notice that a change in control of ownership of the franchise has taken 
place and the provisions under this section governing the consent of the grantor to such change in 
control of ownership shall apply. 
(f)	For the purpose of determining whether it shall consent to such change, transfer, or acquisition of 
control, the city may inquire into the qualifications of the prospective transferee of controlling party, 
and a grantee shall assist the city in any such inquiry. In seeking the city's consent to any change of 
ownership or control, grantee shall have the responsibility of insuring that the transferee completes 
and of application in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the grantor, which application 
shall include the information required under state and federal law as well as under section 6C-44(1) 
through (8) of this article. An application acceptable to the city, shall be submitted to the city not less 
than ninety (90) days prior to the proposed or anticipated date of transfer. The transferee shall be 
required to establish that it possesses the legal, technical and financial qualifications to operate and 
maintain the system and comply with all franchise requirements for the remainder of the term of the 
franchise. If, after considering the legal, financial, character and technical qualities of the applicant 
and determining that they are satisfactory, the city finds that such transfer is acceptable, the city shall 
consent to the transfer and assign the rights and obligations of such franchise. The consent of the 
city to such transfer shall not be unreasonably denied. 
(g)	Any financial institution having a pledge of the grantee or its assets for the advancement of memos 
for the construction and/or operation of a franchise, shall have the right to notify the city that it, or its 
designee satisfactory to the city, shall take control of and operate the cable television system, in the 
event of a grantee default in its financial obligations. Further, said financial institution shall also 
submit a plan for such operation within thirty (30) days of assuming such control that will insure 
continued service in compliance with all franchise requirements during the term the financial 
institution exercises control over the system. The financial institution shall not exercise control over 
the system for a period exceeding one (1) year unless extended by the city, in its discretion, and 
during said period of time, it shall have the right to petition the city to transfer the franchise to another 
grantee.

permits from the city and any other necessary public utilities or agencies. 
(b)	In those areas of the city where transmission or distribution facilities of all the public utilities providing 
telephone and electric power service are underground, the grantee likewise shall construct, operate 
and maintain its transmission and distribution facilities therein underground. 
(c)	In those areas of the city where grantee's cables are located on the above ground transmission or 
distribution facilities of the public utility providing telephone or electric power service, specifically 
including the Clarksdale Public Utilities Commission, and in the event that the facilities of such public 
utilities subsequently are placed underground, then the grantee likewise shall construct, operate and 
maintain its transmission and distribution facilities underground, at the grantee's sole cost and 
expense. Certain of grantee's equipment, such as pedestals, amplifiers and power supplies, which 
normally are placed above ground, may continue to remain in above-ground enclosures. 
(d)	In new residential developments in which all of the electric power and telephone utilities are 
underground, the following procedures shall apply with respect to access to and utilization of 
underground easements: 
(1)	The developer shall be responsible for contacting and surveying all franchise cable operators to 
ascertain which operators desire (or, pursuant to the terms and provisions of this article and any 
franchise agreement, may be required) to provide cable service to that development. The 
developer may establish a reasonable deadline to receive cable operator responses. The final 
development map shall indicate the cable operators that have agreed to serve the development. 
(2)	If one (1) or two (2) cable operators wish to provide service, they shall be accommodated in the 
joint utilities trench on a nondiscriminatory shared basis. If fewer than two (2) operators indicate 
interest, the developers shall provide conduit to accommodate two (2) sets of Cable Television 
cables and dedicate to the city any initially unoccupied conduit. The developer shall be entitled 
to recover the costs of such initially unoccupied conduit in the event the city subsequently 
leases or sells occupancy or use rights to any grantee. 
(3)	The developer shall provide at least ten (10) working days notice of the date that utility trenches 
will be open to the cable operators that have agreed to serve the development. When the 
trenches are open, cable operators shall have two (2) working days to begin the installation of 
their cables, and five (5) working days after beginning installation to complete installation, 
unless otherwise extended by the city. 
(4)	The final development map shall not be approved until the developer submits evidence that: 
a.	It has notified each grantee that underground utility trenches are to be open as of an 
estimated date, that each grantee will be allowed access to such trenches, including 
trenches from proposed streets to individual homes or home sites, on specified 
nondiscriminatory terms and conditions; and 
b.	It has received a written notification from each grantee that the grantee intends to install its 
facilities during the open trench period on the specified terms and conditions, or such other 
terms and conditions as are mutually agreement to the developer and such grantee, or has 
received no reply from a grantee within ten (10) days after its notification to such grantee, 
in which case the grantee will be deemed to have waived its opportunity to install its 
facilities during the open trench period. 
(5)	Sharing the joint facilities trench shall be subject to compliance with state regulatory agency and 
utility standards. If such compliance is not possible, the developer shall provide a separate 
trench for the cable television cables, with entire cost shared among the participating cable 
operators. With the concurrence of the developer, the affected utilities, and the cable operators, 
alternative installation procedures, such as the use of deeper trenches, may be utilized, subject 
to applicable state and local law. 
(6)	Any cable operator wishing to serve an area where the trenches have been closed shall be 
responsible for obtaining its own rights-of-way, its own trenching and associated costs, and 
shall repair all property to the condition which existed prior to such trenching. 
(7)	In the event that more than one franchise is awarded, the city reserves the right to limit the 
number of drop cables and/or pedestals per residence, or to require that the drop cables and/or 
pedestals be utilized only by the cable operator selected by the resident to provide service.

results of the grantee's periodic proof of performance tests conducted pursuant to Federal 
Communications Commission standards and guidelines. 
(b)	A second or subsequent verified failure to maintain specified technical standards shall constitute a 
material franchise violation.

Safety and Health Act of 1970, as amended, as well as all other applicable local, state and federal 
laws and regulations.

the service area, grantee shall provide cable service to any requested subscriber within that service 
area within thirty (30) days from the date of request, provided that the grantee is able to secure all

television equipment upon a subscriber's property shall be presumed. Where a property owner or his 
predecessor has granted an easement including a public utility easement or a servitude to another 
and the servitude by its terms contemplates a use such as grantee's intended use, the grantee shall 
not be required to obtain the written permission of the owner for the installation of cable television 
equipment.

jurisdiction to be invalid as conflicting with any federal or state law, rule and regulation now or hereafter in 
effect, or is held by such court or agency to be modified in any way in order to conform to the 
requirements of any such law, rule or regulation, such provisions shall be considered a separate, distinct, 
and independent part of this article, and such holdings shall not effect the validity and enforceability of all 
other provisions hereof. In the event that such law, rule or regulation is subsequently repealed, rescinded, 
amended or otherwise changed, so that the provision hereof which had been held invalid or modified is 
no longer in conflict with such law, rule or regulation, said provision shall thereupon return to full force in 
effect and shall thereafter be binding on the City and grantee, provided that the city shall give grantee

ARTICLE I. - STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION, FINDINGS OF FACT, PURPOSE AND OBJECTIVES 


Sec. 8A-1. - Statutory authorization. 
    The Legislature of the State of Mississippi has in Title 17, Chapter 1, Mississippi Code of 1972 
Annotated delegated the responsibility to local government units to adopt regulations designed to 
promote the public health, safety, and general welfare of its citizenry. Therefore, the Board of Mayor and 
Commissioners of the City of Clarksdale does hereby adopt the following floodplain management 
regulations. 
(Ord. No. 749, Art. I, § A, 2-4-1980; Ord. No. 1038, art. 1, § A, 12-21-2011) 


Sec. 8A-2. - Findings of fact. 
(a)	The City of Clarksdale is subject to periodic inundation, which results in loss of life and property, 
health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public 
expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely 
affect the public health, safety and general welfare. 
(b)	These flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions, both inside and outside the 
identified Special Flood Hazard Areas, causing increases in flood heights and velocities and by the 
occupancy in flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods or hazardous to other lands which are 
inadequately elevated, floodproofed, or otherwise unprotected from flood damages. 
(Ord. No. 749, Art. I, § B, 2-4-1980; Ord. No. 1038, art. 1, § B, 12-21-2011) 


Sec. 8A-3. - Statement of purpose. 
    It is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare and to 
minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to: 
(a)	Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety, and property due to water or 
erosion hazards, which result in damaging increases in erosion or in flood heights or velocities; 
(b)	Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which serve such uses, be protected 
against flood damage at the time of initial construction; 
(c)	Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural protective barriers 
which are involved in the accommodation of floodwaters; 
(d)	Control filling, grading, dredging, and other development which may increase erosion or flood 
damage; and 
(e)	Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert floodwaters or 
which may increase flood hazards to other lands. 
(Ord. No. 749, Art. I, § C, 2-4-1980; Ord. No. 1038, art. 1, § C, 12-21-2011) 


Sec. 8A-4. - Objectives. 
    The objectives of this chapter are: 
(a)	To protect human life and health; 
(b)	To minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects; 
(c)	To minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally 
undertaken at the expense of the general public; 
(d)	To minimize prolonged business interruptions; 
(e)	To minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains, electric, 
telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located in floodplains; 
(f)	To help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of flood 
prone areas in such a manner as to minimize flood blight areas; and 
(g)	To ensure that potential homebuyers are notified that property is in a floodprone area. 
(Ord. No. 749, Art. I, § D, 2-4-1980; Ord. No. 1038, art. 1, § D, 12-21-2011) 


Sec. 8A-5. - Methods of reducing flood losses. 
    In order to accomplish its purposes, this chapter includes methods and provisions for: 
(1)	Restricting or prohibiting uses which are dangerous to health, safety, and property due to water 
or erosion hazards, or which result in damaging increases in erosion or in flood heights or 
velocities; 
(2)	Requiring that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which serve such uses, be protected 
against flood damage at the time of initial construction; 
(3)	Controlling the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural protective barriers, 
which help accommodate or channel floodwaters; 
(4)	Controlling filling, grading, dredging, and other development which may increase flood damage; 
and 
(5)	Preventing or regulating the construction of flood barriers that will unnaturally divert floodwaters 
or may increase flood hazards in other areas.

flood elevations are determined. 
    Accessory structure (appurtenant structure) means a structure, which is located on the same parcel 
of property as the principal structure and the use of which is incidental to the use of the principal 
structure. Accessory structures should constitute a minimal initial investment, may not be used for human

inundation by floodwaters that can adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare. This 
includes areas downstream from dams. 
    Critical facility (also called "critical action") means facilities for which the effects of even a slight 
chance of flooding would be too great. The minimum floodplain of concern for critical facilities is the 0.2 
percent chance flood level. Critical facilities include, but are not limited to facilities critical to the health 
and safety of the public such as: emergency operations centers, designated public shelters, schools, 
nursing homes, hospitals, police, fire and emergency response installations, vital data storage centers, 
power generation and water and other utilities (including related infrastructure such as principal points of 
utility systems) and installations which produce, use or store hazardous materials or hazardous waste (as 
defined under the Clean Water Act and other Federal statutes and regulations). 
    D Zone is an area in which the flood hazard is undetermined. 
    Dam is any artificial barrier, including appurtenant works, constructed to impound or divert water, 
waste water, liquid borne materials, or solids that may flow if saturated. All structures necessary to 
maintain the water level in an impoundment or to divert a stream from its course will be considered a

floodproofing of a pre-FIRM residential structure that has not been substantially damaged or improved is 
allowed. Dry floodproofing of a post-FIRM residential building is not allowed. Non-residential structures 
may be dry floodproofed in all flood zones with the exception of the Coastal High Hazard Area or the 
Coastal AE Zone. 
    Elevated building means, for insurance purposes, a non-basement building which has its lowest 
elevated floor raised above ground level by foundation walls, shear walls, posts, pilings, columns, or 
piers.

may also be referred to as existing structures. 
    Existing manufactured home park or subdivision means a manufactured home park or subdivision for 
which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be 
affixed (including at a minimum the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site 
grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is completed before the effective date of the floodplain 
management regulations adopted by a community. 
    Expansion to an existing manufactured home park or subdivision includes the preparation of 
additional sites by the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are 
to be affixed (including the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site grading 
or the pouring of concrete pads). 
    Fill means a deposit of earthen materials placed by artificial means. 
    Five-hundred year flood means the flood that has a 0.2 percent chance of being equaled or 
exceeded in any year. Areas subject to the 0.2 percent chance flood have a moderate risk of flooding. 
    Flood (insurance definition) means a general and temporary condition of partial or complete 
inundation of two or more acres of normally dry land areas or of two or more properties (e.g. a building 
and a public street) from (1) overflow of inland or tidal waters (2) unusual and rapid accumulation or runoff 
of surface waters (3) mudflows caused by flooding. 
    Flood or flooding means a general and temporary condition of partial or complete inundation of 
normally dry land areas from: 
(a)	The overflow of inland or tidal waters. 
(b)	The unusual and rapid accumulation or runoff of surface waters from any source. 
(c)	Mudslides which are proximately caused by flooding and are akin to a river of liquid and flowing 
mud on the surfaces of normally dry land areas, as when earth is carried by a current of water 
and deposited along the path of the current. 
(d)	The collapse or subsidence of land along the shore of a lake or other body of water as a result 
of erosion or undermining caused by waves or currents of water exceeding anticipated cyclical 
levels or suddenly caused by an unusually high water level in a natural body of water, 
accompanied by a severe storm, or by an unanticipated force of nature, such as flash flood or 
an abnormal tidal surge, or by some similarly unusual and unforeseeable event which results in 
flooding. 
    Flood insurance rate map (FIRM) means an official map of a community, on which FEMA has 
delineated both the areas of special flood hazard and the risk premium zones applicable to the 
community. 
    Flood insurance study (FIS) is the document which provides an examination, evaluation, and 
determination of flood hazards and, if appropriate, corresponding water surface elevations, or an 
examination, evaluation, and determination of mudslide and/or flood-related erosion hazards. 
    Floodplain means any land area susceptible to being inundated by floodwaters from any source. 
    Floodplain administrator is the individual appointed to administer and enforce the floodplain 
management regulations. 
    Floodplain management means the operation of an overall program of corrective and preventive 
measures for reducing flood damage and preserving and enhancing, where possible, natural resources in 
the floodplain, including but not limited to emergency preparedness plans, flood control works, floodplain 
management regulations, and open space plans. 
    Floodplain management regulations means this chapter and other zoning ordinances, subdivision 
regulations, building codes, health regulations, special purpose ordinances, and other applications of 
police power which control development in flood-prone areas. This term describes federal, state, or local 
regulations in any combination thereof, which provide standards for preventing and reducing flood loss 
and damage. 
    Floodproofing certificate is an official FEMA form used to certify compliance for non-residential 
structures in non Coastal High Hazard Areas as an alternative to elevating buildings to or above the base 
flood elevation. 
    Floodway. See Regulatory floodway. 
    Floodway fringe means that area of the special flood hazard area on either side of the regulatory 
floodway. 
    Flood protection elevation is the base flood elevation plus the community freeboard. In areas where 
no base flood elevations exist from any authoritative source, the flood protection elevation can be 
historical flood elevations or base flood elevations determined and/or approved by the floodplain 
administrator plus freeboard. 
    Freeboard means a factor of safety, usually expressed in feet above the BFE, which is applied for 
the purposes of floodplain management. The City of Clarksdale adopts a freeboard 18 inches above the 
BFE. 
    Functionally dependent use means a use which cannot perform its intended purpose unless it is 
located or carried out in close proximity to water. The term includes only docking facilities, port facilities 
that are necessary for the loading and unloading of cargo or passengers, ship building and ship repair 
facilities and seafood offloading facilities. The term does not include long-term storage, manufacture, 
processing functions, sales, administrative functions, or service facilities. 
    Hardship (as related to variances of this chapter) means the exceptional difficulty that would result 
from a failure to grant the requested variance. The Board of Mayor and Commissioners requires that the 
variance is exceptional, unusual, and peculiar to the property involved. Mere economic or financial 
hardship alone is NOT exceptional. Inconvenience, aesthetic considerations, physical handicaps, 
personal preferences, or the disapproval of one's neighbors likewise cannot, as a rule, qualify as an 
exceptional hardship. All of these problems can be resolved through other means without granting a 
variance, even if the alternative is more expensive, or requires the property owner to build elsewhere or 
put the parcel to a different use than originally intended. 
    Hazard potential means the possible adverse incremental consequences that result from the release 
of water or stored contents due to failure of a dam or mis-operation of a dam or appurtenances. The 
hazard potential classification of a dam does not reflect in any way on the current condition of a dam and 
its appurtenant structures (e.g. safety, structural integrity, and flood routing capacity). 
    High hazard dam means a class of dam in which failure may cause loss of life, serious damage to 
residential, industrial, or commercial buildings; or damage to, or disruption of, important public utilities or 
transportation facilities such as major highways or railroads. Dams which meet the statutory thresholds for 
regulation that are proposed for construction in established or proposed residential, commercial, or 
industrial areas will be assigned this classification, unless the applicant provides convincing evidence to 
the contrary. A development permit is required for a structure and any associated fill downstream from a 
dam at any location where flooding can be reasonably anticipated from principal or emergency spillway 
discharges, or from overtopping and failure of the dam. 
    Highest adjacent grade means the highest natural elevation of the ground surface, prior to 
construction, next to the proposed walls of a building. 
    Historic structure means any structure that is: 
(a)	Listed individually in the National Register of Historic Places (a listing maintained by the 
Department of Interior) or preliminarily determined by the Secretary of the Interior as meeting 
the requirements for individual listing on the National Register; 
(b)	Certified or preliminarily determined by the Secretary of the Interior as contributing to the 
historical significance of a registered historic or a district preliminarily determined by the 
Secretary to qualify as a registered historic district; 
(c)	Individually listed on the State of Mississippi inventory of historic structures, or; 
(d)	Individually listed on a local inventory historic places in communities with historic preservation 
programs that have been certified by an approved state program as determined by the 
Secretary of the Interior. 
    Hydrologic and hydraulic engineering analyses means the analyses performed by a professional 
engineer, registered in the State of Mississippi, in accordance with standard engineering practices as 
accepted by FEMA, used to determine flood elevations and /or floodway boundaries. 
    Increased cost of compliance (ICC) coverage means under the standard flood insurance policy the 
cost to repair a substantially flood damaged building that exceeds the minimal repair cost and that is 
required to bring a substantially damaged building into compliance with the local flood damage prevention 
ordinance. Acceptable mitigation measures are floodproofing (nonresidential), relocation, elevation, 
demolition, or any combination thereof. All renewal and new policies with effective dates on or after June 
1, 1997, include ICC coverage. 
    Letter of map change (LOMC) is an official FEMA determination, by letter, to amend or revise 
effective Flood Insurance Rate Maps, Flood Boundary and Floodway Maps, and Flood Insurance Studies. 
LOMC's are broken down into the following categories: 
(1)	Letter of map amendment (LOMA). An amendment based on technical data showing that a 
property was incorrectly included in a designated SFHA, was not elevated by fill (only by a 
natural grade elevation), and will not be inundated by the one percent chance flood. A LOMA 
amends the current effective FIRM and establishes that a specific property is not located in a 
SFHA. 
(2)	Letter of map revision (LOMR). A revision based on technical data that, usually due to 
manmade changes, shows changes to flood zones, flood elevations, floodplain and floodway 
delineations, and planimetric features. One common type of LOMR, a LOMR-F, is a 
determination concerning whether a structure or parcel has been elevated by fill above the BFE 
and is, therefore, excluded from the SFHA. 
(3)	Conditional letter of map revision (CLOMR). A formal review and comment by FEMA as to 
whether a proposed project complies with the minimum NFIP floodplain management criteria. A 
CLOMR does not revise effective Flood Insurance Rate Maps, Flood Boundary and Floodway 
Maps, or Flood Insurance Studies. 
    Levee means a man-made structure; usually an earthen embankment designed and constructed in 
accordance with sound engineering practices to contain, control, or divert the flow of water so as to 
provide protection from temporary flooding. 
    Levee system means a flood protection system which consists of a levee, or levees, and associated 
structures, such as closure and drainage devices, which are constructed and operated in accordance with 
sound engineering practices. For a levee system to be recognized, the following criteria must be met. All 
closure devices or mechanical systems for internal drainage, whether manual or automatic, must be 
operated in accordance with an officially adopted operation manual (a copy of which must be provided to 
FEMA by the operator when levee or drainage system recognition is being sought or revised). All 
operations must be under the jurisdiction of a Federal or State agency, an agency created by Federal or 
State law, or an agency of a community participating in the NFIP. 
    Low hazard dam means a class of dam in which failure would at the most result in damage to 
agricultural land, farm buildings (excluding residences), or minor roads. 
    Lowest adjacent grade means the elevation of the sidewalk, patio, deck support, or basement 
entryway immediately next to the structure and after the completion of construction. It does not include 
earth that is placed for aesthetic or landscape reasons around a foundation wall. It does include natural 
ground or properly compacted fill that comprises a component of a building's foundation system. 
    Lowest floor means the lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area (including basement). An unfinished 
or flood resistant enclosure, used solely for parking of vehicles, building access, or storage, in an area 
other than a basement, is not considered a building's lowest floor, provided that such enclosure is not 
built so as to render the structure in violation of the non-elevation provisions of this code. 
    Manufactured home (44 CFR 59.1 definition/FEMA) means a structure, transportable in one or more 
sections, which is built on a permanent chassis and designed to be used with or without a permanent 
foundation when attached to the required utilities. The term "manufactured home" does not include a 
recreational vehicle. 
    Manufactured home park or subdivision means a parcel (or contiguous parcels) of land divided into 
two or more manufactured home lots for rent or sale. 
    Manufactured housing (24 CFR 3280.3 and 3285.5 definitions/HUD) means "...a structure, 
transportable in one or more sections, which in the traveling mode is 8 body feet or more in width or 40 
body feet in length or which when erected on-site is 320 or more square feet, and which is built on a 
permanent chassis and designed to be used as a dwelling with or without a permanent foundation when 
connected to the required utilities." 
    Map amendment means a change to an effective NFIP map that results in the exclusion from the 
SFHA or an individual structure or a legally described parcel of land that has been inadvertently included 
in the SFHA (i.e., no alterations of topography have occurred since the date of the first NFIP map that 
showed the structure or parcel to be within the SFHA. 
    Map panel number means the four-digit number followed by a letter suffix assigned by FEMA on a 
FIRM. The first four digits represent the map panel, and the letter suffix represents the number of times 
the map panel has been revised. 
    Market value means the property value (as agreed between a willing buyer and seller), excluding the 
value of land as established by what the local real estate market will bear. Market value can be 
established by independent certified appraisal; replacement cost depreciated by age of building (Actual 
Cash Value); or adjusted assessed values. 
    Mean sea level means, for the purposes of the National Flood Insurance Program, the National 
Geodetic Vertical Datum (NGVD) of 1929, North American Vertical Datum (NAVD) of 1988, or other 
datum, to which base flood elevations shown on a community's Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) are 
referenced. 
    National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) is the federal program that makes flood insurance 
available to owners of property in participating communities nationwide through the cooperative efforts of 
the Federal Government and the private insurance industry. 
    National Geodetic Vertical Datum (NGVD) means a vertical control, corrected in 1929, used as a 
reference for establishing varying elevations within the floodplain. 
    New construction means a structure or an addition to an existing structure for which the start of 
construction commenced on or after the effective date of a floodplain management regulation adopted by 
a community and any subsequent improvements to such structure or the addition. 
    New manufactured home park or subdivision means a manufactured home park or subdivision for 
which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be 
affixed (including at a minimum, the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site 
grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is completed on or after the effective date of floodplain 
regulations adopted by a community. 
    Nonresidential means, but is not limited to; small business concerns, churches, schools, farm 
buildings (including grain bins and silos), poolhouses, clubhouses, recreational buildings, mercantile 
structures, agricultural and industrial structures, warehouses, and hotels and motels with normal room 
rentals for less than 6 months duration. 
    North American Vertical Datum (NAVD) of 1988 means a vertical control, corrected in 1988, used as 
a reference for establishing varying elevations within the floodplain. 
    Obstruction means, but is not limited to, any dam, wall, wharf, embankment, levee, dike, pile, 
abutment, protection, excavation, channel construction, bridge, culvert, building, wire, fence, rock, gravel, 
refuse, fill, structure, vegetation or other material in, along, across or projecting into any watercourse 
which may alter, impede, retard or change the direction and/or velocity of the flow of water, or due to its 
location, its propensity to snare or collect debris carried by the flow of water, or its likelihood of being 
carried downstream. 
    One percent flood (100-year flood) is the flood that has a one percent chance of being equaled or 
exceeded in any given year. Any flood zone that begins with the letter A or V is subject to inundation by 
the one percent chance flood. Over the life of a 30-year loan, there is a 26-percent chance of 
experiencing such a flood within the SFHA. 
    Participating community is any community that voluntarily elects to participate in the NFIP by 
adopting and enforcing floodplain management regulations that are consistent with the standards of the 
NFIP. 
    Post-FIRM construction means new construction and substantial improvements for which start of 
construction occurred after December 31, 1974, or on or after the effective date of the initial FIRM of the 
community, whichever is later. 
    Pre-FIRM construction means new construction and substantial improvements for which start of 
construction occurred on or before December 31, 1974, or before the effective date of the initial FIRM of 
the community, whichever is later. 
    Probation is a means of FEMA formally notifying participating communities of the first of the two 
NFIP sanctions due to their failure to correct violations and deficiencies in the administration and 
enforcement of the local floodplain management regulations. 
    Public safety and nuisance means anything which is injurious to the safety or health of an entire 
community or neighborhood, or any considerable number of persons, or unlawfully obstructs the free 
passage or use, in the customary manner, of any navigable lake, or river, bay, stream, canal, or basin. 
    Recreational vehicle means a vehicle that is: 
(1)	Licensed and titled as an RV or park model (not a permanent residence); 
(2)	Built on a single chassis; 
(3)	400 square feet or less when measured at the largest horizontal projection; 
(4)	Has no attached deck, porch, or shed;

(6)	Designed to be self-propelled or permanently towable by a light duty truck, and; 
(7)	Designed primarily not for use as a permanent dwelling but as temporary living quarters for 
recreational, camping, travel, or seasonal use. 
    Regular program means the second phase of the community's participation in the NFIP in which 
second layer coverage is available based upon risk premium rates only after FEMA has competed a risk 
study for the community. 
    Regulatory floodway means the channel of a river or other watercourse and the adjacent land areas 
that must be reserved in order to discharge the base flood without cumulatively increasing the water 
surface elevation more than one foot. 
    Repair means the reconstruction or renewal of any part of an existing building for which the start of 
construction commenced on or after the effective date of a floodplain management regulation adopted by 
a community and all such regulations effective at the time of permitting must be met. 
    Repetitive loss means flood-related damages sustained by a structure on two separate occasions 
during a 10-year period for which the cost of repairs at the time of each such flood event, on the average, 
equals or exceeds 25 percent of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred. 
    Repetitive loss property is any insurable building for which two or more claims of more than 
$1,000.00 were paid by the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) within any rolling 10-year period, 
since 1978. At least two of the claims must be more than ten days apart but, within ten years of each 
other. A RL property may or may not be currently insured by the NFIP. 
    Section 1316 means that section of the National Flood Insurance Act of 1968, as amended, which 
states that no new flood insurance coverage shall be provided for any property that FEMA finds has been 
declared by a duly constituted state or local zoning authority or other authorized public body to be in 
violation of state or local laws, regulations, or ordinances that are intended to discourage or otherwise 
restrict land development or occupancy in flood-prone areas. 
    Severe repetitive loss structure means any insured property that has met at least one of the following 
paid flood loss criteria since 1978, regardless of ownership: 
(1)	Four or more separate claim payments of more than $5,000.00 each (including building and 
contents payments); or 
(2)	Two or more separate claim payments (building payments only) where the total of the payments 
exceeds the current market value of the property. 
In either case, two of the claim payments must have occurred within ten years of each other. Multiple 
losses at the same location within ten days of each other are counted as one loss, with the payment 
amounts added together. 
    Significant hazard dam means a dam assigned the significant hazard potential classification where 
failure may cause damage to main roads, minor railroads, or cause interruption of use, or service of 
relatively important public utilities. 
    Special flood hazard area (SFHA) means that portion of the floodplain subject to inundation by the 
base flood and/or flood-related erosion hazards as shown on a FHBM or FIRM as Zones A, AE, AH, AO, 
AR, AR/AE, AR/AO, AR/AH, AR/A, A99, or VE. 
    Start of construction (for other than new construction or substantial improvements under the Coastal 
Barrier Resources Act P.L. 97-348) includes substantial improvement, and means the date the building 
permit was issued, provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction, or improvement was 
within 180 days of the permit date. The actual start means the first placement of permanent construction 
of a building (including a manufactured home) on a site, such as the pouring of slabs or footings, 
installation of piles, construction of columns, or any work beyond the stage of excavation or placement of 
a manufactured home on a foundation. Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such 
as clearing, grading and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets and/or walkways; nor does it 
include excavation for a basement, footings, piers or foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor 
does it include the installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds not 
occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main building. For substantial improvement, the actual start 
of construction means the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building, 
whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building. 
    Structure (for floodplain management purposes), means a walled and roofed building, including a 
gas or liquid storage tank that is principally above ground, as well as a manufactured home. 
    Structure (for insurance purposes), means a building with two or more outside rigid walls and a fully 
secured roof, that is affixed to a permanent site; a manufactured home built on a permanent chassis, 
transported to it site in one or more sections, and affixed to a permanent foundation; or a travel trailer 
without wheels, built on a chassis and affixed to a permanent foundation, that is regulated under the 
community's floodplain management and building ordinances or laws. The term does not include a 
recreational vehicle or a park trailer or other similar vehicle, except as described in the last part of this 
definition, or a gas, or a liquid storage tank. 
    Subrogation means an action brought by FEMA when flood damages have occurred, a flood 
insurance claim has been paid, and all or part of the damage can be attributed to acts or omissions by a 
community or other third party. 
    Substantial damage means damage of any origin sustained by a structure whereby the cost of 
restoring the structure to its before damaged condition would equal or exceed 50 percent of the market 
value of the structure before the damage occurred. Substantial damage also means flood-related 
damages sustained by a structure on two separate occasions during a 10-year period for which the cost 
of repairs at the time of each flood event, on the average, equals or exceeds 25 percent of the market 
value of the structure before the damage occurred 
    Substantial improvement. 
(1)	The term "substantial improvement" means any combination of reconstruction, rehabilitation, or 
other improvement of a structure taking place over a designated 10-year period in which the 
cumulative percentage of improvement equals or exceeds 50 percent of the current market 
value of the structure before the "start of construction" of the improvement. The designated 10-
year period begins at the date of the initial improvement to the structure. The costs for 
determining substantial improvement include the costs of additions. This term includes 
structures which have incurred repetitive loss or substantial damage, regardless of the actual 
repair work performed. 
(2)	The term "substantial improvement" does not apply to: 
a.	Any project for improvement of a building required to comply with existing health, sanitary, 
or safety code specifications which have been identified by the Code Enforcement Official 
and which are solely necessary to assure safe living conditions, provided that said code 
deficiencies were not caused by neglect or lack of maintenance on the part of the current 
or previous owners; or 
b.	Any alteration of an historic structure, provided that the alteration will not preclude the 
structure's continued designation as an historic structure. 
    Substantially improved existing manufactured home parks or subdivisions means manufactured 
home parks or subdivisions where the repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation or improvement of the streets, 
utilities and pads equals or exceeds 50 percent of the value of the streets, utilities and pads before the 
repair, reconstruction or improvement commenced. 
    Suspension means the removal, with or without probation, of a participating community from the 
NFIP because the community failed to adopt and enforce the compliant floodplain management 
regulations required for participation in the NFIP. 
    Variance is a grant of relief from the requirements of this chapter. 
    Violation means the failure of a structure or other development to be fully compliant with this chapter. 
A structure or other development without the elevation certificate, other certifications, or other evidence of 
compliance required in this chapter is presumed to be in violation until such time as that documentation is 
provided. 
    Watercourse means any flowing body of water including a river, creek, stream, or a branch. 
    Water surface elevation means the height, in relation to the National Geodetic Vertical Datum 
(NGVD) of 1929, the North American Vertical Datum (NAVD) of 1988, (or other datum, where specified) 
of floods of various magnitudes and frequencies in the floodplains of coastal or riverine areas. 
    Wet floodproofing means a method of construction which allows water to enter a structure in such a 
way that will minimize damage to the structure and its contents. Wet floodproofing is appropriate for 
functionally dependent use and uses that facilitate open space use by variance only, structures utilized for 
parking or limited storage, or when all other techniques are not technically feasible. Wet floodproofing 
shall not be utilized as a method to satisfy the requirements of this chapter for bringing substantially 
damaged or improved structures into compliance. Wet floodproofing is not allowed in lieu of complying 
with the lowest floor elevation requirements for new residential buildings. 
    X Zones (shaded) are areas of 0.2 percent chance flood that are outside of the SFHA subject to the 
one percent chance flood with average depths of less than one foot, or with contributing drainage area 
less than one square mile, and areas protected by certified levees from the base flood. 
    X Zones (unshaded) are areas determined to be outside the 0.2 percent chance floodplain. 
    Zone means a geographical area shown on a Flood Hazard Boundary Map or a Flood Insurance 
Rate Map that reflects the severity or type of flooding in the area.

Sec. 8A-27. - Standards for X Zones (shaded/unshaded). 
(a)	Any area outside the FEMA studied areas lying along blue line streams shown on the United States 
Department of the Interior Geological Survey quadrants and/or areas with flood prone soils which are 
contiguous to blue line streams as shown on the City of Clarksdale Flood Prone Soils Map shall also 
be considered community flood hazard areas. These areas contiguous to blue line streams are 
defined by a buffer of five times the width of the stream at the top of the bank or twenty feet each 
side from the top of the bank, whichever is greater. 
(b)	The X Zones (shaded/unshaded) are considered to be low to moderate risk flood zones and are 
located outside the community's delineated special flood hazard area and include the following: 
(1)	Areas outside the one percent chance flood zone, but within the 0.2 percent chance flood zone, 
as determined by a detailed study; 
(2)	Areas outside the 0.2 percent chance flood zone as determined by a detailed study; and 
(3)	Areas that have not yet been studied. 
(c)	The community reserves the right to require further studies for any development within its 
jurisdiction, if there is evidence that a potential flood hazard exists. Studies can be used to designate 
community flood hazard areas. Such evidence may include but shall not be limited to: 
(1)	Eyewitness reports of historic flooding or other reports of historic flooding deemed credible by 
the community; 
(2)	Geologic features observed that resemble floodplains (such as flat areas along streams); 
(3)	Proximity to manmade or natural constrictions such as road crossings that can cause backwater 
effects; and

Sec. 8A-28. - Repetitive loss structures. 
    The community may declare any existing structure as a repetitive loss structure as required to qualify 
the structure for increased cost of compliance (ICC) benefits allowed by a National Flood Insurance 
Program flood policy claim. To be declared a repetitive loss structure, the following conditions must be 
met: 
(1)	The structure must have a flood insurance policy that includes the increased cost of compliance 
coverage; and 
(2)	The structure must have been flooded twice during a ten-year period with each flood event 
causing damage for which the repair cost equaled or exceeded 25 percent of the market value 
of the structure. 
(Ord. No. 1038, art. 3, § I, 12-21-2011) 


Sec. 8A-29. - Warning and disclaimer of liability. 
(a)	The degree of flood protection required by this chapter is considered reasonable for regulatory 
purposes and is based on scientific and engineering consideration. Larger floods can and will occur 
on rare occasions. 
(b)	Flood heights may be increased by man-made or natural causes. This chapter does not imply that 
land outside the areas of special flood hazard and community flood hazard areas or uses permitted 
within such areas will be free from flooding or flood damages. This chapter shall not create liability on 
the part of Board of Mayor and Commissioners of the City of Clarksdale or by any officer or 
employee thereof for any flood damages that result from reliance on this chapter or any 
administrative decision lawfully made hereunder.

Sec. 8A-30. - Enforcement, penalties and violations. 
(a)	Any action or inaction which violates the provisions of this chapter or permit shall be subject to the 
enforcement actions outlined in this article. Any such action or inaction that is continuous with 
respect to time is deemed to be a public nuisance and may be abated by injunctive or other equitable 
relief. The imposition of any of the penalties described below shall not prevent such equitable relief. 
(b)	Civil penalties. Violation of the provisions of this chapter or failure to comply with any of its 
requirements, including violation of conditions and safeguards established in connection with grants 
of variance or special exceptions, shall constitute a misdemeanor. Any person who violates this 
chapter or fails to comply with any of its requirements shall, upon conviction thereof, be fined not

(2)	Construction stage. 
a.	Upon establishment/placement of the lowest floor, before framing continues, to include any 
approved floodproofing method by whatever construction means, it shall be the duty of the 
permit holder to submit to the Floodplain Administrator a certification of the NAVD or 
NGVD elevation of the lowest floor or floodproofed elevation, as built, in relation to mean 
sea level. Said certification shall be prepared by or under the direct supervision of a 
registered land surveyor or professional engineer, who is authorized by the state of 
Mississippi to certify such information, and certified by same. When floodproofing is utilized 
for a particular building said certification shall be prepared by or under the direct 
supervision of a professional engineer or architect, who is authorized by the state of 
Mississippi to certify such information, and certified by same. Floodproofing shall be 
required to be 18 inches above the base flood elevation. 
b.	Any work undertaken prior to submission of the certification shall be at the permit holder's 
risk. The Floodplain Administrator shall review the lowest floor & floodproofing elevation 
survey data submitted. The permit holder immediately and prior to further progressive work 
being permitted to proceed shall correct deficiencies detected by such review. Failure to 
submit the survey or failure to make said corrections required hereby shall be cause to 
issue a stop-work order for the project. 
c.	In any lot or lots/areas that have been removed from the special flood hazard area via a 
Letter of Map Revision Based on Fill, and if the top of fill level is below the freeboard 
elevation, all new structures, additions to existing buildings or substantial improvement 
must meet the required community freeboard elevation. 
(3)	Finished construction. Upon completion of construction, a FEMA elevation certificate which 
depicts all finished construction elevations is required to be submitted to the Floodplain 
Administrator. If the project includes a floodproofing measure, a FEMA floodproofing certificate 
is required to be submitted by the permit holder to the Floodplain Administrator.

be provided. When expected velocities during the base flood are five feet per second or 
appropriate protection shall be provided by covering them with vegetative cover at a 
minimum. 
d.	Fill shall be composed of clean granular or earthen material. 
(16)	Storage or processing of materials that are hazardous, flammable, explosive, or in time of 
flooding could become buoyant and pose an obstruction to flow, are prohibited within the 
community special flood hazard areas, to include identified floodways. Storage of material or 
equipment not otherwise prohibited shall be firmly anchored to prevent flotation. 
(Ord. No. 749, Art. V, § A, 2-4-1980; Ord. No. 829, § 7, 3-23-1987; Ord. No. 1038, art. 5, § A, 
12-21-2011) 


Sec. 8A-47. - Specific standards for riverine zones. 
    In all areas of special flood hazard designated on the community's FIRM, where base flood elevation 
data have been provided (excluding CHHA and Coastal AE Zone), as set forth in Article 3, Section B, the 
following provisions, in addition to the standards of section 8A-21, are required: 
(1)	Residential construction. New construction and substantial improvement of any residential 
building (including manufactured home) shall have the lowest floor, including basement, 
elevated to no lower than 18 inches above the base flood elevation. Should solid foundation 
perimeter walls be used to elevate a structure, flood openings sufficient to automatically 
equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls of enclosures that are subject to flooding, 
shall be provided in accordance with standards of subsection (4) of this section. New 
development proposals will be designed, to the maximum extent practicable, so residential 
building sites, walkways, driveways, and roadways are located at natural grade with elevation 
not less than the base flood elevation and with evacuation routes leading directly out of the 
special flood hazard area. 
(2)	Nonresidential construction. New construction and substantial improvement of any commercial, 
industrial, or non-residential building (including manufactured building) shall have the lowest 
floor, including basement, elevated to no lower than 18 inches above the base flood elevation. 
Buildings located in all A Zones may, together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities, be 
floodproofed in lieu of being elevated provided that all areas of the building below the base flood 
elevation (plus a minimum of 18 inches of freeboard are water tight with walls substantially 
impermeable to the passage of water, and use structural components having the capability of 
resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and the effect of buoyancy. Dry floodproofing is 
allowed only where flood velocities are less than or equal to five feet per second. A registered 
professional engineer or architect shall certify that the standards of this subsection are satisfied. 
A Flood Emergency Operation Plan and an Inspection and Maintenance Plan must be provided 
by the design professional for the building. Such certification shall be provided to the Floodplain 
Administrator. New development proposals will be designed, to the maximum extent 
practicable, so non-residential building sites, walkways, driveways, and roadways are located at 
natural grade with elevation not less than the base flood elevation and with evacuation routes 
leading directly out of the special flood hazard area. 
(3)	In special flood hazard areas with base flood elevations (AE Zones) but without floodways, no 
encroachments, including fill material or structures, shall be permitted unless certification by a 
registered professional engineer is provided demonstrating that the cumulative effect of the 
proposed development, when combined with all other existing and anticipated development, will 
not increase the water surface elevation of the base flood more than one foot at any point within 
the community. The engineering certification must be supported by technical data that conforms 
to standard hydraulic engineering principles. 
(4)	Enclosures. New construction and substantial improvements that include fully enclosed areas 
formed by foundation and other exterior walls below the lowest floor shall be designed to 
preclude finished living space and designed to allow for the entry and exit of floodwaters to 
automatically equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls. Total enclosed areas will be 
limited to 299 feet. Enclosed areas, including crawl spaces, shall be used solely for parking of 
vehicles, building access, and storage. 
a.	Designs for complying with this requirement must either be certified by a professional 
engineer or architect or meet or exceed the following criteria: 
1.	Provide a minimum of two openings, on different sides of each enclosed area; if a 
structure has more than one enclosed area below the base flood elevation, each shall 
have openings on exterior walls; 
2.	The total net area of all openings shall be at least one square inch for each square 
foot of enclosed area, or the openings shall be designed and the construction 
documents shall include a statement that the design and installation will provide for 
equalization of hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls by allowing for the automatic 
entry and exit of floodwaters; 
3.	The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one foot above interior grade 
(which must be equal to in elevation or higher than the exterior grade); 
4.	Openings shall allow the passage of a three inch sphere; 
5.	Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves or other coverings or 
devices provided they permit the automatic flow of floodwaters in both directions and 
automatically equalize hydrostatic flood loads on exterior walls; and 
b.	Access to the enclosed area shall be minimum necessary to allow for parking of vehicles 
(garage door) or limited storage of maintenance equipment used in connection with the 
premises (standard exterior door) or entry to the living area (stairway or elevator); 
c.	The interior portion of such enclosed area shall not be finished or partitioned into separate 
rooms; 
d.	Property owners shall be required to execute a flood openings/venting affidavit 
acknowledging that all openings will be maintained as flood vents, and that the elimination 
or alteration of the openings in any way will violate the requirements of Article 5, Section B. 
Periodic inspections will be conducted by the Floodplain Administrator to ensure 
compliance. 
(5)	Detached storage buildings, sheds, or other like accessory improvements, excluding detached 
garages, carports, and boat houses, shall solely be used for parking of vehicles and storage. 
Such storage space shall not be used for human habitation and shall be limited to storage of 
items that can withstand exposure to the elements and have low flood damage potential. The 
storage space shall be constructed of flood resistant or breakaway materials, and equipment 
and service utilities, such as electrical outlets, shall be limited to essential lighting and other 
incidental uses, and must be elevated or floodproofed. Flood openings in accordance with the 
standards of subsection (4) of this section shall also be required. These accessory structures 
shall be constructed and placed on the building site so as to offer the minimum resistance to the 
flow of floodwaters. Accessory improvements and other appurtenant structures shall be firmly 
anchored to prevent flotation that may result in damage to other structures. 
(6)	Property owners shall be required to execute and record with the structure's deed a non-
conversion agreement declaring that the area below the lowest floor of the structure or the 
detached accessory building shall not be improved, finished or otherwise converted; the 
community will have the right to inspect the enclosed area. 
(7)	Standards for manufactured homes and recreational vehicles. 
a.	All manufactured homes placed, or substantially improved, on individual lots or parcels, in 
existing manufactured home parks or subdivisions, in expansions to existing manufactured 
home parks or subdivisions, in new manufactured home parks or subdivisions or in 
substantially improved manufactured home parks or subdivisions, must meet all the 
requirements for new construction, including elevation and anchoring and the flood 
openings requirements of subsection (4) of this section. Manufactured homes must be: 
1.	Elevated on a permanent foundation to have its lowest floor elevated to no lower than 
18 inches above the base flood elevation; and 
2.	Securely anchored to an adequately anchored foundation system to resist flotation, 
collapse, and lateral movement. 
b.	All manufactured homes placed or substantially improved, excepting manufactured homes 
that have incurred substantial damage as a result of a flood, in an existing manufactured 
home park or subdivision must be elevated so that: 
1.	The lowest floor of the manufactured home is elevated to no lower than 18 inches 
above the base flood elevation and be securely anchored to an adequately anchored 
foundation support system to resist floatation, collapse, and lateral movement, or 
2.	The manufactured home chassis is supported by reinforced piers or other foundation 
elements of at least an equivalent strength, of no less than 36 inches in height above 
the highest adjacent grade and adequately anchored foundation support system to 
resist floatation, collapse, and lateral movement. 
c.	All recreational vehicles placed on sites must: 
1.	Be on site for fewer than 180 consecutive days; 
2.	Be fully licensed and ready for highway use; or 
3.	Meet all the requirements for new construction, including anchoring and elevation 
requirements of this Article 5, Section B(8)(a) or Article 5, Section B(8)(b)(i) above. 
A recreational vehicle is ready for highway use if it is licensed and insured in accordance 
with the state of Mississippi motor vehicle regulations, is on its wheels or jacking system, is 
attached to the site only by quick disconnect type utilities and security devices and has no 
permanently attached additions. 
(8)	Floodways. Located within areas of special flood hazard adopted by reference in Article 3, 
Section B, are areas designated as floodways. Since the floodway is an extremely hazardous 
area due to the velocity of floodwaters which carry debris, potential projectiles and has erosion 
potential, the following provisions shall apply. 
a.	Prohibit encroachments, including fill, new construction, substantial improvements, and 
other developments unless certification (with supporting technical data) by a registered 
professional engineer is provided demonstrating that encroachments shall not result in any 
increase in flood levels during occurrence of the base flood discharge; 
b.	If subsection (8)a of this section is satisfied, all new construction and substantial 
improvements shall comply with all applicable flood damage prevention standards of article 
V. 
c.	Prohibit the placement of manufactured homes (mobile homes), except in an existing 
manufactured homes (mobile homes) park or subdivision. A replacement manufactured 
home may be placed on a lot in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision 
provided the anchoring standards of section 8A-47(2), and the standards of subsections (1) 
through (3) of this section and the encroachment standards of subsection (8)(a) of this 
section, are met.

    When base flood elevation data and floodway data are not available in accordance with section 8A-
20, in Special Flood Hazard Areas and Community Flood Hazard Areas without base flood elevation data, 
new construction and substantial improvements shall be elevated or floodproofed to elevations 
established by the community. The following provisions in addition to the standards of section 8A-46 and 
the enclosure standards of section 8A-46 shall apply: 
(1)	Require that all new subdivision proposals and other proposed developments (including 
proposals for manufactured home parks and subdivisions) greater than 50 lots or five acres, 
whichever is lesser, include within such proposals base flood elevation data; 
(2)	The Floodplain Administrator shall obtain, review, and reasonably utilize any base flood 
elevation and floodway data available from a federal, state, or other source, in order to 
administer the provisions of article V. When such data are available, standards of section 8A-
47, shall apply. If data is not available from subsection (1) of this section or outside sources, 
then the following provisions shall apply. 
(3)	No encroachments, including fill material or other development, shall be located within a 
distance of the stream bank equal to five times the width of the stream at the top of the bank or 
twenty feet each side from the top of the bank, whichever is greater, unless certification by a 
registered professional engineer is provided demonstrating that such encroachment shall not 
result in any increase in flood levels during the occurrence of the base flood discharge. The 
enclosure standards of section 8A-48 shall apply. 
(4)	The Floodplain Administrator shall require that a single lot applicant develop the base flood 
elevation for the development site, utilizing accepted engineering practices and procedures. 
Upon review of the submitted data, the Administrator may accept or reject the proposed base 
flood elevation. When such data is accepted, standards of section 8A-48, shall apply. 
(5)	Fill within the area of special flood hazard shall result in no net loss of natural floodplain storage. 
The volume of loss of floodwater storage due to filling in the special flood hazard area shall be 
offset by providing an equal volume of flood storage by excavation or other compensatory 
measures at or adjacent to the development site. 
(6)	Notify, in riverine situations, adjacent communities and the State Coordinating Office prior to 
any alteration or relocation of a watercourse, and submit copies of such notifications to FEMA. 
Assure that the flood carrying capacity within the altered or relocated portion of any watercourse 
is maintained. 
(7)	Require that all manufactured homes be placed or installed using methods and practices which 
minimize flood damage. Manufactured homes must be elevated and anchored to resist flotation, 
collapse, or lateral movement. Dry stacked blocks (stacked without the use of mortar or cement 
to bond them together) are not allowed within the Special Flood Hazard Area.

water systems located and constructed to minimize flood damage. 
(c)	All subdivision proposals shall have adequate drainage provided to reduce exposure to flood 
hazards. 
(d)	Base flood elevation data shall be provided for all new subdivision proposals and other proposed 
development (including manufactured home parks and subdivisions), which is greater than 50 lots or 
five acres, whichever is the lesser. 
(e)	All subdivision and other development proposals which involve disturbing more than 1000 square 
feet of land shall include a stormwater management plan which is designed to limit peak runoff from 
the site to predevelopment levels for the one, ten, and 100-year rainfall event. These plans shall be 
designed to limit adverse impacts to downstream channels and floodplains. Single residential lots 
involving less than one acre of land disturbance are not subject to this regulation. 
(f)	All preliminary plans for platted subdivisions shall identify the flood hazard area and the elevation of 
the base flood. 
(g)	All final subdivision plats will provide the boundary of the special flood hazard area, the floodway 
boundary, and the base flood elevations. 
(h)	In platted subdivisions, all proposed lots or parcels that will be future building sites shall have a 
minimum buildable area outside the natural (non-filled) 1% chance annual floodplain. The buildable 
area shall be large enough to accommodate any primary structure and associated structures such as 
sheds, barns, swimming pools, detached garages, on-site sewage disposal systems, and water 
supply wells, where applicable. 
(i)	Approval shall not be given for streets within a subdivision, which would be subject to flooding in the 
base flood. All street surfaces must be located at or above the base flood elevation. 
(j)	Where only a small portion of the subdivision lot or lots is in an A zone Special Flood Hazard Area 
inundated by one percent chance flood with no base flood elevations determined and there is 
sufficient ground slope on the site to avoid possible flooding of structures in X Zones (unshaded)

(Ord. No. 1038, art. 6, § B, 12-21-2011) 


Sec. 8A-63. - Variance procedures. 
    In passing upon such applications, the Board of Mayor and Commissioners shall consider all 
technical evaluations, relevant factors, and standards specified in other sections of this chapter, and: 
(1)	The evaluation must be based on the characteristics unique to that property and not be shared 
by adjacent parcels. The characteristics must pertain to the land itself, not to the structure, its 
inhabitants, or its owners; 
(2)	Variances should never be granted for multiple lots, phases of subdivisions, or entire 
subdivisions; 
(3)	The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the injury of others; 
(4)	The danger of life and property due to flooding or erosion damage; 
(5)	The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood damage and the effect of 
such damage on the individual owner and the community; 
(6)	The importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to the community; 
(7)	The necessity of the facility to be at a waterfront location, where applicable; 
(8)	The availability of alternative locations for the proposed use which are not subject to flooding or 
erosion damage; 
(9)	The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated development; 
(10)	The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan and floodplain management 
program for that area; 
(11)	The safety of access to the property in times of flood for ordinary and emergency vehicles; 
(12)	The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise, and sediment transport of the floodwaters 
and the effects of wave action, if applicable, expected at the site, and; 
(13)	The costs of providing governmental services during and after flood conditions, including 
maintenance and repair of public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water 
systems, and streets and bridges and culverts; 
(14)	Upon consideration of factors listed above, and the purpose of this chapter, the Board of Mayor 
and Commissioners may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems 
necessary to further the purposes of this chapter; 
(15)	Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any increase in flood levels 
during the base flood discharge would result.

(a)	Variances shall only be issued when there is: 
(1)	A showing of good and sufficient cause; 
(2)	A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship; and 
(3)	A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, 
additional threats to public expense, create nuisance, cause fraud on or victimization of the 
public, or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances. 
(b)	The provisions of this chapter are minimum standards for flood loss reduction; therefore any 
deviation from the standards must be weighed carefully. Variances shall only be issued upon a 
determination that the variance is the minimum necessary deviation from the requirements of this 
chapter, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief. In the instance of a Historic Structure, a 
determination that the variance is the minimum necessary so as not to destroy the historic character 
and design of the building. (See section 8A-66.) 
(c)	Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice specifying the difference 
between the base flood elevation and the elevation to which the lowest floor is to be built and stating 
that the cost of flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the 
reduced lowest floor elevation. 
(d)	The Floodplain Administrator shall maintain the records of all appeal actions and report any 
variances to the Federal Emergency Management Agency and Mississippi Emergency Management 
Agency upon request. (See section 8A-65.) 
(e)	Upon consideration of the factors listed above and the purposes of this chapter, the Board of Mayor 
and Commissioners may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary 
to further the purposes of this chapter. 
(f)	Variances shall not be issued "after the fact."

(a)	Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice over the signature of a 
community official that: 
(1)	The issuance of a variance to construct a structure below the base flood elevation will result in 
increased premium rates for flood insurance up to amounts as high as $25.00 for $100.00 of 
insurance coverage; and 
(2)	Such construction below the base flood level increases risks to life and property. A copy of the 
notice shall be recorded by the Floodplain Administrator in the Office of the City of Clarksdale 
City Clerk and shall be recorded in a manner so that it appears in the chain of title of the 
affected parcel of land. 
(b)	The Floodplain Administrator will maintain a record of all variance actions, including justification for 
their issuance, and report such variances issued in the community's biennial report submission to the 
Federal Emergency Management Agency.

Sec. 8A-66. - Historic structures. 
    Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of "historic structures" only upon a 
determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structure's continued 
designation as a "historic structure" and the variance is the minimum to preserve the historic character 
and design of the structure.

(Ord. No. 988, § 6, 10-28-2002) 


Sec. 11A-7. - Designation of landmarks, landmark sites, and historic districts. 
    By ordinance, the City of Clarksdale, acting through its Board of Mayor and Commissioners, may 
establish landmarks, landmark sites, and historic districts within the area of its jurisdiction. Such 
landmarks, landmark sites, or historic districts shall be designated following the criteria as specified in 
Section 11A-3 above. 
A.	The Historic Preservation Commission shall initiate a continuing and thorough investigation of 
the archaeological, architectural, cultural, and historic significance of the City of Clarksdale's 
resources. The findings shall be collected in a cohesive format, made a matter of public record, 
and made available for public inspection. The Historic Preservation Commission will work 
toward providing complete documentation for locally designated historic districts, which will 
normally include: 
1.	An inventory of all property within the boundary of the historic district, with photographs of 
each building and an evaluation of its significance to the historic district. Building 
evaluations are to be used only as a reference or guide, and shall not be used as the

2.	An inventory which would be in format consistent with the statewide inventory format of the 
Historic Preservation Division of the Mississippi Department of Archives and History 
(SHPO).

members of the Historic Preservation Commission, or by an organization interested in historic 
preservation or by an owner of the property being nominated. A nomination shall contain 
information as specified by the Historic Preservation Commission. The Historic Preservation

3.	A written justification as to the proposed boundaries. 
4.	A written statement of the significance of the proposed historic district and the reasons 
therefor.

Mayor and Commissioners of the City in its evaluation of the proposed historic district. 
F.	After the nomination of a resource to the Board of Mayor and Commissioners of the City by the 
Historic Preservation Commission for possible local designation, the resource shall be fully 
protected by the provisions of this ordinance for a period of six months, as if it were already 
designated. 
G.	Any property designated under any previous city ordinance shall remain designated. 
H.	No historic district or districts shall be designated until the MDAH has been notified by certified 
letter by the City and invited to make recommendations and comments concerning the 
proposed district boundaries. The MDAH may comment by letter, telephone, e-mail or in person 
through designated staff. The City shall provide to the MDAH the dates of the next two (2) public 
meetings at which action on the designation of such historic district might be taken so that the 
MDAH may comment in a timely manner. Failure of the MDAH to comment by the date of the 
second such meeting relieves the City of any responsibility for awaiting and responding to such 
analysis, and the City may, at any time thereafter, take such action as it deems necessary and 
appropriate to create the proposed historic district or to decline to create the proposed historic 
district as the Board of Mayor and Commissioners of the City, in its sole discretion, deems 
appropriate and in the best interests of the City of Clarksdale. 
I.	If a proposed ordinance is to designate a landmark or landmark site, it may be presented to the 
Board of Mayor and Commissioners of the City with the recommendation of the Historic 
Preservation Commission that it be adopted without submission to the MDAH. 
J.	The Board of Mayor and Commissioners of the City shall conduct a public hearing, after proper 
notice, to discuss the proposed designation and boundaries thereof. Written notice of the public 
hearing shall be published once a week for at least three (3) consecutive weeks in the 
Clarksdale Press Register, a newspaper published and having general circulation in the City of 
Clarksdale, which is authorized to publish legal notices in accordance with law, weekly for three 
(3) consecutive weeks. The first publication of such notice of public hearing shall be made not 
less than twenty-one (21) days prior to the date of the public hearing and the last publication not 
more than seven (7) days prior to such date.

designation of a historic district, landmarks or landmark site. 
M.	The Historic Preservation Commission shall maintain, in its official files, an updated list and map 
of local designations, and will provide copies of such map(s) to other governmental agencies, 
specifically including the Board of Mayor and Commissioners of the City, within one (1) week of 
the preparation of a new version of such map. 
(Ord. No. 988, § 7, 10-28-2002) 


Sec. 11A-8. - Certificates of appropriateness. 
A.	No exterior feature, including exterior colors, of any resource shall be altered, relocated, or 
demolished until an application for a certificate of appropriateness of such work has been submitted 
to the Historic Preservation Commission and the Historic Preservation Commission has 
recommended to the Board of Mayor and Commissioners of the City the approval thereof, if the 
Historic Preservation Commission finds and determines that a proposed construction, alteration, 
demolition, subdivision or relation is consistent with the design review guidelines established by the 
Historic Preservation Commission and a specific finding that the proposed construction alteration, 
demolition, subdivision or relocation would be compatible with the character of a historic district or 
landmark or landmark site, and does not compromise the historic and architectural integrity of the 
historic district, landmark or landmark site. 
B.	The Board of Mayor and Commissioners of the City may require that a property owner post a bond in 
such amount as the Historic Preservation Commission recommends to guaranty satisfactory 
completion of a relocation project. 
C.	No construction, alteration, demolition, subdivision or relocation of a resource or which affects a 
resource shall be undertaken without the owner thereof having first obtained a certificate of 
appropriateness. 
D.	The Historic Preservation Commission, whenever it recommends denial of a certificate of 
appropriateness, must state, in writing, the reasons for such recommendation of a denial. The Board 
of Mayor and Commissioners of the City shall consider the same in determining whether to issue a 
certificate of appropriateness. In the event of the denial of a certificate of appropriateness, an 
applicant may resubmit a new application at any time, accept that a applicant must wait six (6) 
months whenever an application for a certification of appropriateness is denied for a landmark 
property of statewide or national significance and notice of any second or subsequent application 
shall be sent to MDAH as well as to the Historic Preservation Commission. 
E.	The denial of a certification of appropriateness shall be binding upon local building inspectors and 
the Public Works Department, the agency responsible for issuing building permits, and shall prevent 
the issuance of other building permits for the same parcel until a certificate of appropriateness is 
approved. A certification of appropriateness shall be required for work which does not otherwise 
require a building permit. A certificate of appropriateness may be evidence by either a written and 
dated letter to an owner or applicant or such a letter accompanied by a signed and dated stamp on 
the face of any and all architectural project drawings prepared for a project. 
F.	A certificate of appropriateness shall expire at the end of six (6) months, if work has not been begun 
and substantially completed within said time frame.

the Board of Mayor and Commissioners of the City the approval or denial of all applications for 
certificates of appropriateness. 
H.	In recommending whether to approve and deny any applications for certificates of appropriateness, 
the Historic Preservation Commission shall seek to accomplish the purposes of this ordinance and 
the Mississippi Local Government Historic Preservation Law of 1978, Miss. Code Ann. § 39-13-1 et 
seq. (Rev. 2001). 
I.	A certification of appropriateness shall not be required for work deemed by the Historic Preservation 
Commission to be ordinary maintenance or repair of any resource. 
J.	All proceedings, decisions and recommendations of the Historic Preservation Commission shall be in 
writing and shall state the findings of the Historic Preservation Commission, its recommendations 
and the reasons therefore. 
(Ord. No. 988, § 8, 10-28-2002)

resource for which a permit, variance, or other authorization from either the City Building Official or 
the City is also required, shall make application therefore in the form and manner required by the 
applicable City code section or ordinance. Any such application shall also be considered an 
application for a certificate of appropriateness, and shall include such additional information as may 
be required by the Historic Preservation Commission or this Ordinance. After receipt of any such 
application, the City Building Official shall assure himself that the application is proper and complete. 
B.	No building permit shall be issued by the City Building Official which affects a resource without a 
certificate of appropriateness. In the event that a building permit need not be obtained for a building, 
structure or object to be erected within a historic district or on a landmark or landmark site, a 
certificate of appropriateness is nevertheless required before such building, structure or object may 
be erected. 
C.	Each application shall be reviewed in accordance with the following procedure: 
1.	When any such application is filed, the City Building Official shall immediately notify the Historic 
Preservation Commission Chairman or Vice-Chairman, if the Chairman is unavailable, that an 
application has been filed. 
2.	If, at the time of filing of an application, there is not a Historic Preservation Commission meeting 
already scheduled within thirty (30) days of the filing, the Chairman or Vice-Chairman may set a 
time and date, which shall be not later than fifteen (15) days after the filing of the application, for 
a hearing by the Historic Planning Commission, and the City Building Official shall be so 
informed. 
3.	The applicant shall, upon request, have the right to a preliminary conference with the Historic 
Preservation Commission staff, if any, and/or the City Building Official for the purpose of making 
any changes or adjustments to the application which might be more consistent with the Historic 
Preservation Commission's and the City's standards as set forth in the Historic Preservation 
Commission's rules and regulations and in this Ordinance. 
4.	Not later than eight (8) calendar days before the date set for the said hearing, the City Building 
Official shall mail notice thereof by regular U. S. first class mail postage prepaid, to the applicant 
at the address in the application, and to all members of the Historic Preservation Commission. 
5.	Notice of the time and place of said hearing may, in the discretion of the Historic Preservation 
Commission, be given by publication in the Clarksdale Press Register, a newspaper published 
and having general circulation in the City at least ten (10) days before such hearing and by 
posting such notice on the main bulletin board in the lobby of City Hall, 121 Sunflower Avenue, 
Clarksdale, Mississippi 38614. 
6.	At such hearing, the applicant for a certificate of appropriateness shall have the right to present 
any relevant evidence in support of the application. Likewise, the City shall have the right to 
present any additional relevant evidence in support of or opposition to the application. 
7.	The Historic Preservation Commission shall have the right to recommend additional changes 
and modifications to enable the applicant to meet the requirements of the Commission. 
Compliance by the applicant with such recommendations may be made a condition precedent 
to the issuance of the certificate of appropriateness. 
8.	Within twenty-one (21) days after the adjournment of the hearing on an application, the Historic 
Preservation Commission shall act upon it, either recommending its approval or denial to the 
Board of Mayor and Commissioners of the City, or the Historic Preservation Commission may, 
for good cause, defer action until the next meeting of the Historic Preservation Commission, 
giving consideration to the factors set forth in Section IX hereof. The Historic Preservation 
Commission shall makes its findings of fact and its recommendations to the Board of Mayor and 
Commissioners in writing within five (5) working days following the meeting at which its decision 
is made. The Board of Mayor and Commissioners of the City will ordinarily act upon the 
recommendation of the Historic Preservation Commission at its next regular weekly meeting 
following receipt of the decision of the Historic Preservation Commission. The Historic 
Preservation Commission shall forward a copy of its findings and recommendations to the 
applicant and the City Building Official. Whenever the Historic Preservation Commission 
recommends denial of the certificate of appropriateness, it must state the reasons for such 
denial in writing. Likewise, whenever the Board of Mayor and Commissioners accepts and 
approves the recommendation of the Historic Preservation Commission and denies the 
issuance of the certificate of appropriateness, the City Board must state its reasons for such 
denial in writing, which may include reliance upon the findings and recommendations of the 
Historic Preservation Commission. Thereafter, an applicant may resubmit a new application at 
any time, except that an applicant must wait six (6) months whenever an application for a 
certificate of appropriateness is denied for a landmark property of statewide or national 
significance and notice of any second or subsequent application must be sent to the Mississippi 
Department of Archives and History as well as to the local historic preservation commission. 
9.	In all cases of applications affecting National Historic Landmarks, at least two-thirds of the 
members of the Historic Preservation Commission must affirmatively recommend the approval 
of a certificate of appropriateness in order that it be granted. A majority vote of the Board of 
Mayor and Commissioners of the City approving the issuance of a certificate of appropriateness 
in such event shall be sufficient. 
10.	The issuance of a certificate of appropriateness shall not relieve an applicant for a building 
permit, special use permit, variance, or other authorization from compliance with any and all 
other requirements or provisions of the laws and ordinances of the City concerning zoning, land 
use, subdivision rules and regulations, construction, repair or demolition. 
11.	Denial of a certificate of appropriateness by the Board of Mayor and Commissioners shall be 
binding upon the City Building Inspector or the Public Works Department, the agency 
responsible for issuing building permits, and shall prevent the issuance of other building permits 
for the same parcel until a certificate of appropriateness is approved and issued. A certificate of 
appropriateness may be required for work which does not require a building permit. A certificate 
of appropriateness may be evidenced by either a written and dated letter to an owner or 
applicant or such a letter accompanied by a signed and dated stamp on the face of any and all 
architectural or project drawings prepared for a project. 
12.	A certificate of appropriateness shall expire, without further action on the part of the City, after 
six (6) months if work has not begun on the resource. 
13.	The Historic Preservation Commission may recommend, and the Board of Mayor and 
Commissioners of the City may adopt a reasonable schedule of fees to cover the Historic 
Preservation Commission's and the City's administrative and other costs in the application and 
approval process, including the costs of publication of any notices of public hearings, 
inspections, photographs or similar costs. 
14.	The Historic Preservation Commission shall comply with the provisions of the Mississippi Open 
Meetings Law, Miss. Code Ann. § 25-41-1 et seq. (Rev. 1999) regarding notice of special

Sec. 11A-11. - Unreasonable economic hardship. 
A.	When a claim of unreasonable economic hardship is made as a result of the effect of this ordinance, 
the owner of record must present evidence sufficient to prove that, as a result of the Historic 
Preservation Commission's action, he is unable to obtain a reasonable return or a reasonable 
beneficial use. The owner of record shall submit, by affidavit, to the Historic Preservation 
Commission for its review at a minimum the following information: 
1.	The date the property was acquired by its current owner. 
2.	The price paid for the property (if acquired by purchase), and the relationship (if any) between 
the buyer and the seller of the property. 
3.	The mortgage history of the property, including any current mortgage. 
4.	The current fair market value of the property. 
5.	The equity in current use and in alternative uses.

relevant to the determination of unreasonable economic hardship. 
C.	The Historic Preservation Commission may receive and consider studies and economic analyses 
from other city agencies and from private organizations relating to the property in question. 
D.	Should the Historic Preservation Commission determine that the owner's present return is not 
reasonable, it must consider whether there are other uses currently allowed that would provide a 
reasonable return, and whether such a return could be obtained through investment in the property 
for rehabilitation purposes. 
E.	Should the applicant satisfy the Historic Preservation Commission that he will suffer an unreasonable 
economic hardship if a certificate of appropriateness is not approved, the Historic Preservation 
Commission shall recommend the approval of such certificate to the Board of Mayor and 
Commissioners of the City.

appeal the decision of the Historic Preservation Commission to the Board of Mayor and 
Commissioners of the City by filing his notice with the City Clerk of the City within ten (10) days from 
the date of such decision. 
B.	If a property owner in a historic district, or the owner of the historic landmark or property site is 
denied a Certificate of Appropriateness, the property owner may appeal directly to the Chancery

(1)	"Slot amusement machine" or "machine" means any mechanical device or contrivance which is 
operated, played, worked, manipulated, or used by inserting or depositing any coin, slug, token, 
or thing of value in which may be seen any picture or heard any music, or wherein any game 
may be played, or any form of diversion had. 
(2)	"Person" means and includes any individual, firm, partnership, joint venture, association, 
corporation, estate, trust, or other group or combination acting as a unit and includes the plural 
as well as the singular in number. 
(c)	Tax levied. There is hereby levied and imposed one-half (1/2) of the hereinafter described tax as 
authorized by House Bill 943, Regular Session, 1970 Mississippi Legislature, upon each person 
engaging in the business of owning or placing on location for the purpose of operation any slot 
amusement machine, annual license taxes according to the following schedule: 
(1)	For each machine wherein may be seen any picture or heard any music, a license tax for each 
such machine the sum of eighteen dollars ($18.00). 
(2)	For each machine (not elsewhere specifically taxed in this section) wherein or whereby any 
game may be played or any form of diversion had, a license tax for each such machine the sum 
of thirty dollars ($30.00).

Sec. 14-156. - Exemptions. 
    The provisions of this article shall not apply in the following circumstances, which shall constitute 
valid exemptions to the operation of the curfew: 
(1)	At any time, if a minor is accompanied by his or her parent. 
(2)	When accompanied by an adult authorized by a parent of such minor to take the parent's place 
in accompanying said minor for a designated period of time and purpose within a specified area. 
(3)	Until the hour of 12:00 a.m., if the minor is on a specific errand as directed by his or her parent 
either verbally or in writing. 
(4)	If the minor is legally employed, for the period of thirty (30) minutes before to thirty (30) minutes 
after work, while going directly between his or her home and place of employment. This 
exemption shall also apply if the minor is in a public place during curfew hours in the course of 
his or her employment. In order to avail himself or herself of this exemption, such minor must be 
carrying, on his or her person, a written statement from the employer attesting to the place and 
hours of employment. 
(5)	An emergency affecting life or property which initially serves as a cause for the minor's public 
presence. 
(6)	Until the hour of 12:00 a.m., if the minor is on the property of or on the sidewalk directly 
adjacent to the place where such minor resides or the place immediately adjacent thereto, if the 
owner of the adjacent property does not communicate an objection to the minor and to the city 
police department or an officer or agent thereof. "Immediately adjacent" as used herein shall not 
exceed one hundred (100) feet from the place of the minor's residence. 
(7)	Returning home, by a direct route from, and within thirty (30) minutes of the termination of any 
special function of entertainment or a school activity or activity of a religious or other voluntary 
association or a place of public entertainment, such as a movie, play or sporting event. This 
exception will not apply beyond 11:30 p.m. on Sunday through Thursday, or 12:30 a.m. on 
Saturday and Sunday. If the event is not commercial in nature or does not have a fixed, publicly 
known time at which it will end or does end, the sponsoring organization shall register in 
advance with the chief of police of the city police department or his designee, at least twenty-
four (24) hours in advance, informing the chief, or his designee, of the time which such event is 
scheduled to begin, the place at which it shall be held, the time at which it shall end and the 
name of the sponsoring organization. Any minors who attend such function shall be required to 
be in their homes or usual places of abode within thirty (30) minutes after the special function 
concludes. 
(8)	In the case of reasonable necessity, but only after such minor's parent has communicated to the 
city police department the facts establishing such reasonable necessity relating to the specified 
street or public place at a designated time for a described purpose, including place of origin and 
destination. A copy of such communication or the police record thereof, duly certified by the 
chief to be correct, an appropriate notation of the time it was received and of the names and 
addresses of such parent and minor shall constitute evidence of qualification under this 
exemption. Simple verbal authorization from any law enforcement officer shall not be sufficient 
to claim this exception. 
(9)	When a minor is attending or traveling to or from an activity involving or exercising First 
Amendment rights protected by the United States Constitution, such as the free exercise of 
religion, freedom of speech and the right of assembly. Such minor shall evidence the bona fides 
of such exercise and provide notice to city officials by first delivering to the police department a 
written communication signed by such minor and countersigned, if practicable, by his or her 
parent, specifying his or her home address and telephone number, addressed to the mayor of 
the city and specifying further, when, where and in what manner said minor will be on the 
streets or public places of the city at night during hours when the article is still otherwise 
applicable to said minor, in the exercise of such First Amendment right as is specified in such 
communication. 
(10)	When a minor is, with parental consent, in a motor vehicle engaged in bona fide interstate or 
intrastate travel through the city, particularly on U.S. Highway 61, U.S. Highway 49 and any 
access roads to these major thoroughfares. This exemption shall also apply to interstate travel 
beginning or terminating in the city. 
(11)	When authorized, by special permit from the chief of police carried on the person of the minor 
thus authorized, as follows: when necessary nighttime activities of the juvenile may be 
inadequately provided for by other provisions of this article, then recourse may be had to the 
chief of police, either for a regulation as provided in subsection (l) hereof, or for a special permit, 
as the circumstances warrant. Upon the findings of reasonable necessity for the use of a public 
place to the extent warranted by a written application signed by a juvenile and by the parent of 
the juvenile, if feasible, stating 
a.	The name, age and address of the juvenile; 
b.	The name, address and telephone number of a parent of the juvenile; 
c.	The height, weight, sex, color of eyes and hair and other physical characteristics of the 
juvenile; 
d.	The necessity that requires the juvenile to remain upon a public place during curfew hours 
otherwise applicable; 
e.	The public place; and 
f.	The beginning and ending of a period of time involved by date and hour; 
The chief of police may grant a permit in writing for such juvenile's use of a public [place] at 
such hours as in the opinion of the chief of police may reasonably be necessary and consistent 
with the purposes of this article. In an emergency, this may be handled by telephone or other 
effective communication, with a corresponding record being made contemporaneously to the 
chief of police or the person designated by the chief of police to act upon his behalf in an 
emergency, at the police station. 
(12)	When authorized, by regulation issued by the chief of police and other similar cases of 
reasonable necessity, similarly handled but adopted to reasonably necessary nighttime 
activities of more juveniles than can readily be dealt with on an individual special permit basis. 
Normally, such regulation by the chief of police permitting use of public places should be issued 
sufficiently in advance to permit appropriate publicity through news media and through other 
agencies, such as the schools, and shall define the activity, the scope of the use of the public 
places permitted, the period of time involved not to extend more than one (1) hour beyond the 
time for termination of the activity, and the reason for finding that the regulation is reasonably 
necessary and is consistent with the purposes of this article. 
(13)	When the juvenile is married or has been married pursuant to state law. 
(14)	In the case of an operator of an establishment, when the operator has notified the police that a 
juvenile was present on the premises of the establishment during curfew hours and refused to 
leave. 
(15)	The foregoing exemptions and their several limitations, such as provisions for notification, are 
severable as hereinafter provided, but here reemphasized. Additional, also severable, 
exemptions, broadening with the progress towards maturity of minors enrolled respectively at 
elementary, junior high and high schools, will be considered by the board of mayor and 
commissioners as warranted by future experience illuminated by the use of student government 
associations, school personnel, citizens, associations, ward and/or neighborhood 
spokesperson, parents, juvenile and police officers, youth court officials and persons in authority 
concerned positively with minors, as well as with juvenile delinquency.

Sec. 14-157. - Operator responsibility. 
    It shall be unlawful for any operator of an establishment to knowingly permit a juvenile to remain at 
the establishment under circumstances not constituting an exception, or otherwise beyond the scope of 
this article. The term "knowingly" includes knowledge that an operator should reasonably be expected to 
have concerning the patrons of the establishment. The standard for "knowingly" shall be applied through 
an objective test: whether a reasonable person in the operator's position should have known that the 
patron was juvenile in violation of this article.

Sec. 14-158. - Violations. 
(a)	Any law enforcement officer, upon finding a minor in violation of this article, shall ascertain the name 
and address of such minor and warn the minor that he or she is in violation of curfew, and shall direct 
the minor to proceed at once to his or her home or usual place of abode. The law enforcement officer 
shall report such action to the police chief or his designee, who shall in turn, notify the parent, 
guardian or person having custody or control of such minor. 
(b)	If such minor: 
(1)	Refuses to heed such warning or direction by any law enforcement officer; 
(2)	Shall refuse to give such law enforcement officer his or her correct name and address; or 
(3)	If the minor has been warned on any previous occasion that he or she is in violation of curfew; 
    He or she shall be taken to the police department and the parent, guardian or other adult person 
having the care and custody of such minor shall be immediately contacted. If, after this contact, there is 
still probable cause to believe that the minor was violating this article, the minor shall be held until the 
parent comes to the police department to take charge of the minor. When the parent arrives, he or she 
shall be given a copy of this article. If the parent, guardian or other adult person above cannot be located,

requested, send to the minor's parent written notice of said violation with a warning that any 
subsequent violation will result in a full enforcement of this article, including enforcement of 
parental responsibility and the application of applicable penalties. Said notice shall be sent to 
the minor's parent at his or her last known address. Evidence of the mailing of the notice 
required hereunder as specified shall constitute sufficient notice of the minor's violation, whether 
actually received by the parent or not; or have the parent execute an acknowledgment of notice 
of first violation by a minor, with a warning that any subsequent violation will result in a full 
enforcement of this article, including enforcement of parental responsibility and the application 
of applicable penalties, and a copy of same shall be provided to the parent. 
(2)	If, after the mailing of the warning notice set forth in section 14-158, subsection (d) (1) above of 
any first violation by a minor, a parent violates this article in connection with a second or 
subsequent offense by a minor, the offending parent, guardian or other adult person having the 
care or custody of the minor subject to the provisions of this article found in violation thereof 
may be fined an amount, not to exceed one thousand dollars ($1,000.00) and costs, or 
imprisoned for not more than ninety (90) days, or subjected to sentencing to the municipal work

(a)	Severability is intended throughout and within the provisions of this article. If any provision, including 
inter alia any exception, part, phrase or term or the application thereof to any person or circumstance 
is held invalid, the application to other persons or circumstances shall not be affected thereby, and 
the validity of the article in any and all other respects shall not be affected thereby. The board of 
mayor and commissioners of the city does not intend a result that is absurd, impossible to execute or 
unreasonable. It is intended that the article be held inapplicable in such cases, if any, where its 
application would be unconstitutional. A constitutional construction is intended and shall be given.

opinions shall be in response to good faith, signed letters addressed to the mayor or to a city 
commissioner questioning the article as: 
(1)	Ambiguous; 
(2)	having a potentially chilling effect on constitutional rights specifically invoked; or 
(3)	otherwise invalid, or in all three (3) categories with respect to proposed conduct definitely 
described. 
    This administrative remedy must be exhausted prior to presenting to any court a question in any of 
the three (3) categories. The board of mayor and commissioners does not intend a result through the 
enforcement of the article that is absurd, impossible of execution or unreasonable. The board of mayor 
and commissioners intends that the article be held inapplicable in such cases, if any, where its application 
would be unconstitutional under the Constitution of the State of Mississippi or the Constitution of the 
United States of America.

(b)	By a surety company authorized to transact business in the state;

council or any city officer may be made liable by reason of any accident or injury to persons or 
property through the fault of the permittee either in not properly guarding the excavation or for 
any other injury resulting from the negligence of the permittee, and further conditioned to fill up, 
restore and place in good and safe condition as near as may be to its original condition, and to 
the satisfaction of the city engineer, all openings and excavations made in streets, and to 
maintain any street where excavation is made in as good condition for the period of twelve (12) 
months after said work shall have been done, usual wear and tear excepted, as it was in before

accompanied with a cash deposit, made to the city engineer for deposit with the city treasurer, as follows: 
a sum equal to one dollar ($1.00) per square foot of surface of each excavation to be made in streets 
which have been paved; a sum equal to fifty cents ($0.50) for each square foot of surface of each such 
excavation to be made in streets which are not paved. No deposit shall be less than fifty dollars ($50.00). 
Any person intending to make openings, cuts or excavation in streets may make and maintain with the 
city treasurer a general deposit in the sum of one thousand dollars ($1,000.00), and the person so 
depositing shall not be required to make the special deposits provided in this section but shall, however, 
be required to comply with all other applicable provisions of this article. Any special or general deposit 
made hereunder shall serve as security for the repair and performance of work necessary to put the 
street in as good a condition as it was prior to the excavation if the permittee fails to make the necessary 
repairs or to complete the proper refilling of the opening and the excavation work under the excavation 
permit. Upon the permittee's completion of the work covered by such permit in conformity with this article 
as determined by the city engineer, two-thirds ( 2/3 ) of such cash deposit, except in the case of an 
annual deposit, shall be promptly refunded by the city to the permittee and the balance shall be refunded 
by the city to the permittee upon the expiration of such twelve-month period; provided, however, that as to

annual deposit shall be refunded at the expiration of a twelve-month period following the completion of 
such excavation work; and provided further that the city may use any or all of any such deposit to pay the 
cost of any work the city performs to restore or maintain the street as herein provided in the event the 
permittee fails to perform such work, in which event the amount refunded to the permittee shall be 
reduced by the amount thus expended by the city. 
(Ord. No. 727, § 8, 8-28-1978) 


Sec. 17-27. - Routing of traffic. 
    The permittee shall take appropriate measures to assure that during the performance of the 
excavation work traffic conditions as nearly normal as practicable shall be maintained at all times so as to 
cause as little inconvenience as possible to the occupants of the abutting property and to the general 
public, provided that the city engineer may permit the closing of streets to all traffic for a period of time 
prescribed by him if in his opinion it is necessary. The permittee shall route and control traffic including its 
own vehicles as directed by the city police department. The following steps shall be taken before any 
street may be closed or restricted to traffic: 
(a)	The permittee must receive the approval of the city engineer and the police department therefor; 
(b)	The permittee must notify the chief of the fire department and any ambulance service, public or 
private, which operates within the city limits of any street so closed;

department before traffic is moved back to its normal flow so that any necessary adjustments 
may be made; 
(d)	Where flagmen are deemed necessary by the city engineer they shall be furnished by the 
permittee at its own expense. Through traffic shall be maintained without the aid of detours, if 
possible. In instances in which this would not be feasible the city engineer will designate 
detours. The city shall maintain roadway surfaces of existing streets designated as detours 
without expense to the permittee but in case there are no existing streets the permittee shall 
construct all detours at its expense and in conformity with the specifications of the city engineer. 
The permittee will be responsible for any unnecessary damage caused to any streets by the 
operation of its equipment.

stations and fire hydrants. Materials or obstructions shall not be placed within fifteen (15) feet of fire 
plugs. Passageways leading to fire escapes or firefighting equipment shall be kept free of piles of 
materials or other obstructions. 
(Ord. No. 727, § 10, 8-28-1978) 


Sec. 17-29. - Protection of traffic. 
    The permittee shall erect and maintain suitable timber barriers to confine earth from trenches or 
other excavations in order to encroach upon streets as little as possible. The permittee shall construct 
and maintain adequate and safe crossings over excavations and across streets under improvement to 
accommodate vehicular and pedestrian traffic at all street intersections. Vehicular crossings shall be 
constructed and maintained of plank, timbers and blocking of adequate size to accommodate vehicular 
traffic safely. Decking shall be not less than four (4) inches thick and shall be securely fastened together 
with heavy wire and staples. Pedestrian crossings shall consist of planking three (3) inches thick, twelve 
(12) inches wide and of adequate length, together with necessary blocking. The walk shall be not less 
than three (3) feet in width and shall be provided with a railing as required by the city engineer.

engineer and the utility company or person owning the utility. If it becomes necessary to remove an 
existing utility this shall be done by its owner. No utility owned by the city shall be moved to accommodate 
the permittee unless the cost of such work be borne by the permittee. The cost of moving privately owned 
utilities shall be similarly borne by the permittee unless it makes other arrangements with the person 
owning the utility. The permittee shall support and protect by timbers or otherwise all pipes, conduits, 
poles, wires or other apparatus which may be in any way affected by the excavation work, and do 
everything necessary to support, sustain and protect them under, over, along or across said work. In case 
any of said pipes, conduits, poles, wires or apparatus should be damaged, they shall be repaired by the 
agency or person owning them and the expense of such repairs shall be charged to the permittee and his 
or its bond shall be liable therefor. The permittee shall be responsible for any damage done to any public 
or private property by reason of breaking of any water pipes, sewer, gas pipe, electric conduit or other 
utility and its bond shall be liable therefor. 
    Prior to applying for an excavation permit as provided in this article, the permittee shall inform itself 
as to the existence and location of all underground utilities, and shall indicate the same on the plan of 
excavation submitted with the application for the excavation permit. Prior to the commencement of any 
excavation work, the permittee shall notify the utility company or person owning the utility of any existing 
utility which lies within the location or area of the proposed excavation work for the purpose of protecting 
the utility from damage. Thereafter, the utility company or person owning the utility, upon receiving such 
advance notification, shall, within a reasonable time, but not more than forty-eight (48) hours after said 
notification make investigation to determine the location of its utility in the location or area of the proposed 
excavation work, and mark by some reasonable and customary means the location of such utility in or 
near the location or area of the proposed excavation work so as to enable the permittee or other persons 
engaged in such excavation work to locate said utility in advance of and during such excavation work, or 
shall advise the permittee that marking is not necessary. 
(Ord. No. 727, § 12, 8-28-1978) 


Sec. 17-31. - Protection of adjoining property.

adjoining property by providing proper foundations and taking other measures suitable for the purpose. 
Where in the protection of such property it is necessary to enter upon private property for the purpose of 
taking appropriate protective measures, the permittee shall obtain a license from the owner of such 
private property for such purpose and if he cannot obtain a license from such owner the city engineer may 
authorize him to enter the private premises solely for the purpose of making the property safe. The 
permittee shall, at its own expense shore up and protect all buildings, walls, fences or other property likely 
to be damaged during the progress of the excavation work and shall be responsible for all damage to 
public or private property or streets resulting from its failure properly to protect and carry out said work. 
Whenever it may be necessary for the permittee to trench through any lawn area, the sod shall be 
carefully cut and rolled and replaced after ditches have been back filled as required in this article. All 
construction and maintenance work shall be done in a manner calculated to leave the lawn area clean of 
earth and debris and in a condition as nearly as possible to that which existed before such work began. 
The permittee shall not remove even temporarily any trees or shrubs which exist in parking strip areas or 
easements across private property without first having notified and obtained the consent of the property 
owner, or in the case of public property the appropriate city department or city official having control of 
such property. 
(Ord. No. 727, § 13, 8-28-1978)

maintained until the work shall be completed or the danger removed. At twilight there shall be placed 
upon such place of excavation and upon any excavated materials or structures or other obstructions to 
streets suitable and sufficient lights which shall be kept burning throughout the night during the 
maintenance of such obstructions. It shall be unlawful for any one to remove or tear down the fence or 
railing or other protective barriers or any lights provided there for the protection of the public.

(Ord. No. 727, § 16, 8-28-1978) 


Sec. 17-35. - Care of excavated materials. 
    All material excavated from trenches and piled adjacent to the trench or in any street shall be piled 
and maintained in such manner as not to endanger those working in the trench, pedestrians or users of 
the streets, and so that as little inconvenience as possible is caused to those using streets and adjoining 
property. Where the confines of the area being excavated are too narrow to permit the piling of excavated 
material beside the trench, such as might be the case in a narrow alley, the city engineer shall have the 
authority to require that the permittee haul the excavated material to a storage site and then rehaul it to 
the trench site at the time of backfilling. It shall be the permittee's responsibility to secure the necessary 
permission and make all necessary arrangements for all required storage and disposal sites. 
(Ord. No. 727, § 17, 8-28-1978) 


Sec. 17-36. - Damage to existing improvements. 
    All damage done to existing improvements during the progress of the excavation work shall be 
repaired by the permittee. Materials for such repair shall conform with the requirements of any applicable 
code or ordinance. If upon being ordered the permittee fails to furnish the necessary labor and materials 
for such repairs, the city engineer shall have the authority to cause said necessary labor and materials to 
be furnished by the city and the cost shall be charged against the permittee, and the permittee shall also 
be liable on his or its bond therefor. 
(Ord. No. 727, § 18, 8-28-1978) 


Sec. 17-37. - Property lines and easements. 
    Property lines and limits of easements shall be indicated on the plan of excavation submitted with the 
application for the excavation permit and it shall be the permittee's responsibility to confine excavation 
work within these limits. 
(Ord. No. 727, § 19, 8-28-1978) 


Sec. 17-38. - Cleanup. 
    As the excavation work progresses all streets and private properties shall be thoroughly cleaned of 
all rubbish, excess earth, rock and other debris resulting from such work. All clean-up operations at the 
location of such excavation shall be accomplished at the expense of the permittee and shall be completed 
to the satisfaction of the city engineer. From time to time as may be ordered by the city engineer and in 
any event immediately after completion of said work, the permittee shall at his or its own expense clean 
up and remove all refuse and unused materials of any kind resulting from said work and upon failure to do 
so within twenty-four (24) hours after having been notified to do so by the city engineer, said work may be 
done by the city engineer and the cost thereof charged to the permittee, and the permittee shall also be 
liable for the cost thereof under the surety bond provided hereunder. 
(Ord. No. 727, § 20, 8-28-1978) 


Sec. 17-39. - Protection of water courses. 
    The permittee shall provide for the flow of all water courses, sewers or drains intercepted during the 
excavation work and shall replace the same in as good condition as it found them or shall make such 
provisions for them as the city engineer may direct. The permittee shall not obstruct the gutter of any 
street but shall use all proper measures to provide for the free passage of surface water. The permittee 
shall make provisions to take care of all surplus water, muck, silt, slickings or other runoff pumped from 
excavations or resulting from sluicing or other operations and shall be responsible for any damage 
resulting from its failure to so provide. 
(Ord. No. 727, § 21, 8-28-1978) 


Sec. 17-40. - Breaking through pavement. 
    Whenever it is necessary to break through existing pavement for excavation purposes and where 
trenches are to be four (4) feet or over in depth, the pavement in the base shall be removed to at least six 
(6) inches beyond the outer limits of the subgrade that is to be disturbed in order to prevent settlement, 
and a six-inch shoulder of undisturbed material shall be provided in each side of the excavated trench. 
The face of the remaining pavement shall be approximately vertical. A power driven concrete saw shall 
be used so as to permit complete breakage of concrete pavement or base without ragged edges. Asphalt 
paving shall be scored or otherwise cut in a straight line. No pile driver may be used in breaking up the 
pavement. 
(Ord. No. 727, § 22, 8-28-1978) 


Sec. 17-41. - Tunnels. 
    Tunnels under pavement shall not be permitted except by permission of the city engineer and if 
permitted shall be adequately supported by timbering and backfilling under the direction of the city 
engineer. 
(Ord. No. 727, § 23, 8-28-1978) 


Sec. 17-42. - Backfilling. 
    Backfilling in any street opened or excavated pursuant to an excavation permit issued hereunder 
shall be compacted to a degree equivalent to that of the undisturbed ground in which the trench was dug. 
Compacting shall be done by mechanical tappers or vibrators, by rolling in layers or by water settling, as 
required by the soil in question and sound engineering practices generally recognized in the construction 
industry. The decision as to whether a trench shall be backfilled by water settling shall be based upon 
such engineering practices and shall be made by the city engineer. When water is taken from a fire 
hydrant the permittee shall assign one man to operate the hydrant and shall make certain that said man 
had been instructed by the city water department in the operation of the hydrant. The city water 
department shall likewise be notified at both the beginning and end of the job so that the condition of the 
fire hydrants can be checked on both occasions. Any damage done to the hydrant during the excavation 
shall be the responsibility of the permittee. Water shall be paid for by the permittee on the terms agreed 
upon with the city water department. 
(Ord. No. 727, § 24, 8-28-1978) 


Sec. 17-43. - Backfilling by water settling. 
    When backfilling is done by water settling, excavated materials above utility installations shall be 
deposited uniformly in layers of not more than five (5) feet in thickness and shall be thoroughly flooded. 
During the flooding the water shall be allowed to flow slowly to the trench from high points and shall be 
worked down to the full depth of the layer of backfill with bars. All bars used shall be long enough to 
extend entirely through the layer being filled and shall be forced down through the layer being filled and 
shall be forced down through the loose backfill material. As the bars are withdrawn the water shall be 
allowed to flow downward around the bar. The channel or hole formed by the bar shall be kept open and 
the water kept running into it until the fill has settled. All work shall be done in such manner as to obtain a 
relative compaction through the entire depth of the backfill of not less than that existing adjacent to the 
excavation. 
(Ord. No. 727, § 25, 8-28-1978) 


Sec. 17-44. - Dry backfilling. 
    Backfilling up to the first eighteen (18) inches above the top of the utility pipes or similar installations 
shall be done with thin layers. Each layer is to be tamped by manual or mechanical means. Layers that 
are hand tamped shall not exceed four (4) inches in thickness. Layers that are power tamped shall not 
exceed six (6) inches in thickness. The same requirements shall apply to the remainder of the backfilling 
if tamping is the method used for backfilling. Backfilling of all pipes of over twenty-four (25) inches in 
diameter shall be carried up to the spring line of the pipe in three-inch layers, with each layer moistened 
and thoroughly tamped with suitable mechanical equipment. The backfill around all pipes twenty-four (24) 
inches or less in diameter shall be flooded or tamped as specified above to a depth of eighteen (18) 
inches above the top of the pipe before any additional backfilling is placed thereon. 
(Ord. No. 727, § 26, 8-28-1978) 


Sec. 17-45. - Backfill material. 
    Whenever any excavation for the laying of pipe is made through rock, the pipe shall be laid six (6) 
inches above the rock bottom of the trench and the space under, around and six (6) inches above the 
pipe shall be backfilled with clean river sand, noncorrosive soil or one-quarter (1/4) inch minus gravel. 
Broken pavement, large stones and debris shall not be used in the backfill. 
(Ord. No. 727, § 27, 8-28-1978) 


Sec. 17-46. - Backfilling at the surface. 
    Backfilling shall be completed by placing the backfill material well up over the top of the trench. For 
dry backfilling, the material shall be compacted with a roller of an approved type or with the rear of a truck 
carrying at least five (5) tons until the surface is unyielding. The surface shall then be graded as required. 
(Ord. No. 727, § 28, 8-28-1978) 


Sec. 17-47. - Restoration of surface. 
    The permittee shall restore the surface of all streets, broken into or damaged as a result of the 
excavation work, to its original condition in accordance with the specifications of the city engineer. The 
permittee may be required to place a temporary surface over openings made in paved traffic lanes. 
Except when the pavement is to be replaced before the opening of the cut to traffic, the fill above the 
bottom of the paving slab shall be made with suitable material well tamped into place and this fill shall be 
topped with a minimum of at least one inch of bituminous mixture which is suitable to maintain the 
opening in good condition until permanent restoration can be made. The crown of the temporary 
restoration shall not exceed one inch above the adjoining pavement. The permittee shall exercise special 
care in making such temporary restorations and must maintain such restorations in safe traveling 
condition until such time as permanent restorations are made. The asphalt which is used shall be in 
accordance with the specifications of the city engineer. If in the judgment of the city engineer it is not 
expedient to replace the pavement over any cut or excavation made in the street upon completion of the 
work allowed under such permit by reason of the looseness of the earth or weather conditions he may 
direct the permittee to lay a temporary pavement of wood or other suitable material designated by him 
over such cut or excavation to remain until such time as the repair of the original pavement may be 
properly made. 
    Permanent restoration of the street shall be made by the permittee in strict accordance with the 
specifications prescribed by the city engineers to restore the street to its original and proper condition, or 
as near as may be. 
    Acceptance or approval of any excavation work by the city engineer shall not prevent the city from 
asserting a claim against the permittee and his or its surety under the surety bond required hereunder for 
incomplete or defective work if discovered within twelve (12) months from the completion of the 
excavation work. The city engineer's presence during the performance of any excavation work shall not 
relieve the permittee of its responsibilities hereunder. 
(Ord. No. 727, § 29, 8-28-1978) 


Sec. 17-48. - City's right to restore surface. 
    If the permittee shall have failed to restore the surface of the street to its original and proper 
condition upon the expiration of the time fixed by such permit or shall otherwise have failed to complete 
the excavation work covered by such permit, the city engineer, if he deems it advisable, shall have the 
right to do all work and things necessary to restore the street and to complete the excavation work. The 
permittee shall be liable for the actual cost thereof and twenty-five (25) per cent of such cost in addition 
for general overhead and administrative expenses. The city shall have a cause of action for all fees, 
expenses and amounts paid out and due it for such work and shall apply in payment of the amount due it 
any funds of the permittee deposited as herein provided and the city shall also enforce its rights under the 
permittee's surety bond provided pursuant to this article. 
    It shall be the duty of the permittee to guarantee and maintain the site of the excavation work in the 
same condition it was prior to the excavation for two (2) years after restoring it to its original condition.

    If in his judgment traffic conditions, the safety or convenience of the traveling public or the public 
interest require that the excavation work be performed as emergency work, the city engineer shall have 
full power to order, at the time the permit is granted, that a crew of men and adequate facilities be 
employed by the permittee twenty-four (24) hours a day to the end that such excavation work may be 
completed as soon as possible. 
(Ord. No. 727, § 33, 8-28-1978) 


Sec. 17-52. - Emergency action. 
    In the event of any emergency in which a sewer, main, conduit or utility in or under any street breaks, 
bursts or otherwise is in such condition as to immediately endanger the property, life, health or safety of 
any individual, the person owning or controlling such sewer, main, conduit, or utility, without first applying 
for and obtaining an excavation permit hereunder, shall immediately take proper emergency measures to 
cure or remedy the dangerous conditions for the protection of property, life, health and safety of 
individuals. However, such person owning or controlling such facility shall apply for an excavation permit 
not later than the end of the next succeeding day during which the city engineer's office is open for 
business, and shall not proceed with permanent repairs without first obtaining an excavation permit 
hereunder.

private property must be done only when such mobile or transient operator has the written consent of 
the owner or other person in control of said private property where the repairs or replacements are 
conducted. 
(f)	No person, firm or corporation shall make any repairs to or replacement of parts of any motor 
vehicles for compensation belonging to any other person, firm or corporation without first obtaining

as the same shall be in effect from time to time under the ordinances of the City of Clarksdale, or the 
laws of the State of Mississippi.

[ARTICLE] VI. - PLANNED AND OVERLAY DISTRICTS 


[Sec. 600.] - General purpose of planned and overlay districts. 
    The purpose of an overlay districts is to apply supplemental development regulations that apply to 
unique development situations where very specific goals or development considerations. The 
development regulations are applied in addition to the base zoning districts. The purpose of planned 
district is to provide a regulatory mechanism whereby creativity and high quality design may be 
accommodated, encouraged and documented. 


[Sec. 601.] - Flood Plain Overlay District. 
    Floodplain areas. Certain areas along the Sunflower River and its tributaries have been designated 
as floodplain areas. These areas are delineated by means of a line showing the maximum probable flood 
elevation for each area. Building permits will be issued for construction in these areas only if the 
application for a permit is accompanied by evidence that the site is to be filled to an elevation sufficient to 
eliminate the flood hazard, or that the building is to be constructed in such a manner as to render the 
building floodproof. If the zoning administrator determines that the plans for filling and/or construction are 
adequate, he may issue a permit for construction. If there is any question concerning issuance of a 
permit, such question shall be referred to the Board of Mayor and Commissioners for determination. 


[Sec. 602.] - Historic Areas Overlay District. 
1.	Purpose and intent. It is the intent of this district to preserve the historic sites and structures of the 
City of Clarksdale. The requirements of the district are designed to protect and preserve historic 
and/or architectural value; create an aesthetic atmosphere, strengthen the economy, protect and 
enhance the City's attractions to tourists and visitors and the support and stimulus to business and 
industry thereby provided; and to promote education and patriotic heritage of the present and future 
citizens of the community. 
2.	Permitted uses. Any use permitted by the existing zoning classification is also permitted by the H-1 
Historic District. 
3.	Conditional uses. Any use listed as a conditional use by the existing zoning classification is also 
permitted by the H-1 Historic District. 
4.	Yard and bulk requirements. Each site in the City of Clarksdale Historic District shall be subject to 
such bulk requirements are listed in the existing zoning classification. 
5.	Additional regulations. Any designated Historic Overlay Zone shall demonstrate a quality of 
significance in American history, architecture, archeology and culture and shall possess integrity of 
location, design, setting, materials, workmanship, feeling and association. Further, areas eligible for 
Historic Overlay District designation shall demonstrate all or some of the following characteristics: 
a.	Association with events that have made a significant contribution to the broad patterns of our 
history; or 
b.	Association with the lives of persons significant in our past; or 
c.	Embodiment of distinctive characteristics of a type, period, or method of construction or that 
represent the work of a master, or that possess high artistic values, or that represent a 
significant and distinguishable entity who's components may lack individual distinction; or 
d.	Potential for yielding archaeological information. 
6.	Historic district commission recommendation. 
a.	No Historic Overlay District shall be implemented without the recommendation of the Clarksdale 
Preservation Commission in accordance with the terms of the adopted Preservation Ordinance. 
b.	Exterior Building Appearance and Quality - When construction, alteration or repair of any 
structure within the H-1 Historic Overlay Zone, the same shall be subject to review by the 
Clarksdale Preservation Commission in accordance with the duties, responsibilities, and 
procedures as set forth in the Clarksdale Preservation Ordinance. 
7.	Design guidelines. The following Design Guidelines shall be observed when designing any new 
construction, alteration or repair of any structure within the H-1 Historic Overlay Zone. Design 
guidelines are criteria and standards which the Clarksdale Historic Zoning Commission must 
considered in determining the appropriateness of proposed work within a historic district. 
a.	General guidelines for rehabilitation of existing structure. 
(1)	Every reasonable effort shall be made to provide a compatible use for property which 
requires minimal alteration of the building, structure or site and its environment, or to use a 
property for its originally intended purpose. 
(2)	The distinguishing original qualities or character of a building, structure or its site and its 
environment shall not be destroyed. The removal or alternation of any historic material or 
distinctive architectural feature should be avoided when possible. 
(3)	All buildings, structures and sites shall be recognized as products of their own time. 
Alterations that have no historical basis and which seek to create an earlier appearance 
shall be discouraged. 
(4)	Changes which may have taken place in the course of time are evidence of the history and 
development of a building, structure or site and its environment. These changes may have 
acquired significance in their own right and this significance shall be encouraged. 
(5)	Distinctive stylistic features or examples of skilled craftsmanship which characterize a 
building, structure or site shall be treated with sensitivity. 
(6)	Deteriorated architectural features shall be repaired rather than replaced, wherever 
possible. In the event replacement is necessary, the new material should match the 
material being replaced in composition, design, color, texture and other visual qualities. 
Repair or replacement of missing architectural features should be based on accurate 
duplications of features, substantiated by historic, physical or pictorial evidence rather than 
on conjectural designs or the availability of different architectural elements from other 
buildings or structures. 
(7)	The surface cleaning of structures shall be undertaken with the gentlest means possible. 
Sandblasting and other cleaning methods that will damage the historic building materials 
shall not be undertaken. 
(8)	Every reasonable effort shall be made to protect and preserve archaeological resources 
affected by, or adjacent to any project. 
(9)	New design for alterations and additions to existing properties shall not be discouraged 
when such alterations and additions do not destroy significant historical, architectural or 
cultural material and such design is compatible with the size, scale, color, material and 
character of the property, neighborhood or environment. 
(10)	Where possible, new additions or alterations to structures shall be done in such a manner 
that if such additions or alterations were to be removed in the future, the essential form and 
integrity of the structure would be unimpaired. 
(11)	The use of aluminum or vinyl siding or other such trim work is not expressly prohibited, but 
is discouraged. The use of such, however, should utilize materials which meet the 
character of the era in which said structure was originally constructed in terms of color and 
other characteristics. 
b.	Alterations to existing buildings and property. 
(1)	Definition. A change in building material; the addition or elimination of any architectural 
feature of a structure; a repair that reconstructs any part of an existing building; an addition 
that extends or increases floor area or height of any building; or construction of an 
appurtenance. 
(2)	General principles. These guidelines shall apply only to the exteriors of buildings and to 
areas of lots visible from public rights-of-way. 
(3)	Proposals for exterior work to be done on public facades. Front and street related 
elevations shall be more carefully reviewed than that the level of review given other 
facades. 
(4)	Every reasonable effort shall be made to provide a compatible use for a property, requiring 
minimal alteration of the building, structure or site and its environment, or to use a property 
for its originally intended purpose. 
(5)	The distinguishing original qualities or character of a building structure or site and its 
environment shall not be destroyed. The removal or alteration of any historic material or 
distinctive architectural feature should be avoided. 
(6)	All buildings, structures and sites shall be recognized as products of their own time. 
Alterations that have historical basis and which seek to create an earlier appearance shall 
be discouraged. 
(7)	Changes which may have taken place in the course of time are evidence of the history and 
development of a building, structure or site and its environment. These changes may have 
acquired significance in their own right and this significance shall be recognized and 
respected. 
(8)	Distinctive stylistic features or examples of skilled craftsmanship which characterize a 
building, structure or site shall be treated with sensitivity. 
(9)	Deteriorated architectural features shall be repaired rather than replaced whenever 
possible. In the event replacement is necessary, the new material should match the 
material being replaced in composition, design, color, texture and other visual qualities. 
Repair or replacement of missing architectural features should be based on accurate 
duplication of features, substantiated by historic physical or pictorial evidence rather than 
on conjectural designs or the availability of different architectural elements from other 
buildings or structures. When no physical or pictorial evidence is available, design of 
features may be based on conjecture. 
(10)	The surface cleaning of structures shall be undertaken with the gentlest means possible. 
Sandblasting and other cleaning methods that damage historic building materials shall not 
be undertaken. 
(11)	Every reasonable effort shall be made to protect and preserve archaeological resources 
affected by, or adjacent to any project. 
(12)	New design for alterations and additions to existing properties shall not be discouraged 
when such alterations or additions do not destroy significant historical, architectural, size, 
scale, color, material and character of the property, neighborhood or environment. 
(13)	Whenever possible, new additions or alterations to structures shall be done in such a 
manner that if such additions or alterations were to be removed in the future, the essential 
form and integrity of the structure would be unimpaired. 
c.	Additions. 
(1)	Additions are areas that increase the living or working space of a structure. This does not 
include the addition of architectural elements. 
(2)	Generally, an addition should be situated at the rear of the building in such a way it does 
not disturb either front or side public facades. 
(3)	Additions should follow the guidelines for new conditions. 
d.	Roofs. 
(1)	Original roof pitch and configuration should be maintained. 
(2)	The original size and shape of dormers should be maintained. Dormers generally should 
not be introduced where none existed originally. 
(3)	Original roof materials and color should be retained. If replacement is necessary, original 
materials should be used. Asphalt shingles may be substituted for original roofing when it 
is not economically feasible to replace or repair with original materials or when the original 
roof is beyond repair. The color and texture of asphalt shingles should be appropriate to 
the architectural style and period of the structure. 
e.	Porches. 
(1)	Original details and shape - outline roof height and roof pitch - should be retained. 
(2)	Original porch materials and architectural details should be maintained. If different 
materials are substituted, they should be appropriate to the architectural style and period of 
the house. 
(3)	The enclosing of front porches is inappropriate. 
(4)	The enclosing of side porches may be considered appropriate if the visual openness and 
character of the original porch is maintained. 
f.	Windows. 
(1)	The original size and shape of windows should be maintained. 
(2)	The original number and arrangement of panes should be maintained. 
(3)	The characteristic window shape in the area is vertically rectangular higher than it is wide. 
Horizontal windows and picture windows are generally not appropriate. 
(4)	New window openings should not be introduced unless they match the existing window 
configuration and their placement harmonizes with the existing rhythm of openings. 
(5)	Original windows should not be filled in. 
g.	Doors. 
(1)	The original size and shape of door openings should be maintained 
(2)	Original transoms, side lights and doors should be maintained. 
(3)	Replacement doors should be compatible with original doors in terms of style and material. 
Flush doors are generally inappropriate. 
(4)	Generally, new door openings should not be introduced on facades visible from the street. 
(5)	Original door openings should not be filled in. 
h.	Architectural details. 
(1)	Original details should not be removed. 
(2)	The replacement of irreparable details should be close visual approximations of originals. 
(3)	The replacement of missing original details should be based on accurate duplication, or 
should be close visual approximations of the originals, based on historic, physical or 
pictorial documentation. 
(4)	Architectural details of any period or style not original to the building shall not be 
introduced. 
(5)	Changes that have taken place in the course of time which are evidence of the history and 
development of a building and its environment may have acquired significance in their own 
right; their significance should be recognized and respected. 
i.	Materials. 
(1)	Original building materials include wood, brick, stone, terra cotta and stucco. Original roof 
materials include slate, metal and on twentieth century buildings, asphalt shingles. 
(2)	Original building and roofing materials should be retained. If replacement is necessary, it 
should be with original material appropriate to the architectural style and period of the 
house. 
j.	Masonry. 
(1)	Masonry repainting should be done with care to match the original mortar color. The use of 
Portland cement should be avoided when repainting old brick. 
(2)	Original tooling configuration and joint width should be maintained. 
(3)	Cleaning should be done with the gentlest means possible. Since sandblasting causes 
severe damage to brick and mortar, its use should be avoided. 
(4)	The painting of brick is inappropriate unless it is mismatched or so deteriorated that it 
cannot withstand weather. If painting is necessary, original natural color should be used. 
(5)	Painting of stone is inappropriate. 
k.	Wood. 
(1)	Wood siding should be retained if possible. Original siding should not be covered or 
replaced with a material or texture not original and not aesthetically compatible. 
(2)	Replacement wood siding should be consistent with the original in size, direction and lap 
dimension. 
(3)	Original wall shingles should be maintained. 
l.	Color. The Clarksdale Preservation Commission shall approve appropriate historic paint colors 
in conjunction with requests for certificates of appropriateness. 
m.	Appurtenances. Appurtenances related to a building (fence, walls, street lamps, steps, paving, 
sidewalks and signs) should be visibly compatible with the environment to which they are 
related. 
n.	Fences. 
(1)	Low retaining walls in front yards should be kept where they exist. Introduction of retaining 
walls where none existed should be avoided. 
(2)	New or reclaimed iron fencing may be appropriate for properties with pre-1900 houses. 
Iron fencing is generally not appropriate for later houses. 
(3)	Wood picket fences are appropriate in front and /or rear yard of houses. 
(4)	Board fences, usually taller, with wider boards set close together, are appropriate only 
around rear yards. 
(5)	Chain link or woven fences are generally inappropriate for front or visible side yards. They 
may be used in rear yards. If a portion of a rear fence is visible from the street, it should be 
camouflaged. 
o.	Signs. 
(1)	The appearance, size, position, method of attachment, texture of materials, color and 
design of signs shall be in keeping with the collective characteristics of the structure 
surrounding the property on which the sign will be located. 
(2)	Off-site signs shall not be permitted. 
(3)	Business signs shall comply with the Clarksdale Sign Ordinance except as modified as 
follows: 
(4)	Buildings and signs may be illuminated by remote light sources, provided that these light 
sources are shielded to protect adjacent properties. 
(5)	Signs attached to the structure shall not cover any architectural detail. 
p.	Landscaping. 
(1)	All aspects of site development should be sympathetic to the character of landscape 
development, type of plans and spatial treatment of adjacent properties. 
(2)	Wherever possible, healthy existing trees should be retained, as they are an amenity 
requiring many years to replace. Grading and construction should avoid disturbance to 
such trees. 
(3)	To provide a consistent effect in residential areas, the preferred street trees are 2- to 21/2-
inch caliper oak, planted on average 50 feet on center. 
(4)	To provide a more immediate effect in commercial areas and offset the larger scale 
structures, the preferred street trees are 3- to 31/2-inch caliper oak, planted no further apart 
than 50 feet on center. 
(5)	Evergreen species are desirable for screening views, such as views into parking or service 
areas. 
(6)	As an extension of the surrounding natural landscape, plant species should be native or 
well-adapted to the region. 
(7)	Suggested shade tree species include: Willow Oak, Pin Oak, Scarlet Oak, Bald Cypress, 
Tulip Tree, Honey locust and Red Maple. 
(8)	Suggested flowering tree species include: Magnolia, Crape Myrtle, Washington Hawthorne, 
Golden Rain Tree, Red Bud, Japanese Cherry, Crabapple and Bradford Pear. 
(9)	Suggested shrub species at 24- to 36-inch height include: Wax Leaf Ligustrum, Florida 
Jasmine, Variegated Privet, Elaeagnus, Golden Euonymus, Gold Spot Euonymus, 
Manhattan Euonymus, Japanese Cleyera, Burford Holly and Azalea. 
(10)	Suggested shrub species at 18- to 24-inch height include: Andorra Juniper, Pfizer Juniper, 
Mugho Pine, Dwarf Japanese Holly, Dwarf Chinese Holly, Variegated Privet, Manhattan 
Euonymus and Florida Jasmine. 
(11)	Suggested screening plants include: Loblolly Pine, White Pine, Virginia Pine, Savannah 
Holly, Foster Holly and Red Leaf Photinia. 
(12)	On site areas adjacent to streets, lawn areas must be established or be sodded prior to 
occupancy of the project. 
(13)	Planting plans approved by the Commission must be maintained as originally designed. 
Any diseased, dying or dead plants should be treated or removed by the property owner. 
Appropriate, durable plants should be installed. 
(14)	Where needed, irrigation must be provided to ensure robust planting areas. 
(15)	To prevent accidents, irrigation systems must be installed below ground, with spray heads 
flush with the ground surface. 
q.	New construction. 
(1)	Definition. The construction of any freestanding structure on any lot. 
(2)	General principles. 
(a)	These guidelines shall apply only to the exteriors of buildings and to areas of lots 
visible from public rights-of-way. 
(b)	The public facades - front and street related elevations - of proposals for new 
buildings shall be more carefully reviewed than other facades. 
(c)	Since construction in a historic district has usually taken place continuously from the 
late nineteenth and early twentieth century, a variety of building types and styles result 
which demonstrate the changes in building tastes and technology over the years. New 
buildings should continue this tradition while complementing and being compatible 
with other buildings in the area. 
(d)	Reconstruction may be appropriate when it reproduces facades of a building which no 
longer exists and which was located in the historic district if: the building would have 
contributed to the historical and architectural character of the area; if it will be 
compatible in terms of style, height, scale, massing and material with the buildings 
immediately surrounding the lot on which the reproduction will be built; and if it is 
accurately based on pictorial documentation. 
(e)	Because new buildings usually relate to an established pattern and rhythm of existing 
buildings, other on the same and opposite sides of a street, the dominance of that 
pattern and rhythm must be respected and not disrupted. 
(f)	New construction should be consistent with existing buildings along a street in terms 
of height, scale, setback and rhythm; relationship of materials, textures, details, color, 
roof shape, orientation and proportion and rhythm of openings. 
(3)	Height. New buildings shall be constructed to a height which is compatible with the height 
of adjacent buildings. 
(4)	Scale. The size of a new building; its mass in relation to open spaces; and its windows, 
doors, openings and porches should be visually compatible with the surrounding buildings 
(5)	Setback and rhythm of spacing. 
(a)	The setback from front and side yard property lines established by adjacent buildings 
must be maintained. When a definite rhythm along a street is established by uniform 
lot and building width, infill new buildings should maintain the rhythm. 
(b)	All setbacks and yard requirements must have approval of the Clarksdale Zoning 
Appeals Board, if different from the current requirements of the Clarksdale Zoning 
Ordinance. 
(c)	Relationship of materials, texture, details and material color. The relationship and use 
of materials, texture, details and material color of a new building's public facades shall 
be visually compatible with and similar to those of adjacent buildings, or shall not 
contrast conspicuously. 
(6)	Roof shape. The roofs of new buildings shall be visually compatible, by not contrasting 
greatly with the roof shape and orientation of surrounding buildings. 
(7)	Orientation. The site orientation of new buildings shall be consistent with that of adjacent 
buildings and shall be visually compatible. Directional expression shall be compatible with 
the surrounding building, whether that expression is vertical, horizontal or non-directional. 
(8)	Proportion and rhythm of openings. The relationship of width to height of windows and 
doors and the rhythm of solids to voids in new buildings shall be visually compatible with 
the surrounding buildings. 
r.	Additions to existing buildings. 
(1)	New additions to existing buildings should be kept to minimum and should be compatible in 
scale, materials and texture; additions should not be visually jarring or contrasting. 
(2)	Addition should not be made to the public facades of existing buildings. Additions may be 
located to the rear of existing buildings in ways which do not disturb the public facades. 
(3)	The creation of an addition through enclosure of a front facade porch is inappropriate and 
should be avoided. 
s.	Outbuildings. 
(1)	Garages and storage buildings should reflect the character of the existing house and 
surrounding buildings and should be compatible in terms of height, scale, roof shape, 
materials, texture and details. 
(2)	The location and design of outbuildings should not be visually disruptive to the character of 
the surrounding buildings 
t.	Appurtenances. Appurtenances related to new buildings, including driveways, sidewalks, 
lighting, fences and walls, shall be visually compatible with the environment of the existing 
buildings and sites to which they relate. 
u.	Sidewalks. Sidewalk additions and repair must be compatible with any existing sidewalk design 
and material. 
v.	Demolition. 
(1)	Definition. The tearing down of a building. 
(2)	General principles. Since the purpose of historic zoning is to protect historic properties, the 
demolition of a building which contributes historically or architecturally to the character and 
significance of the district is inappropriate and should be avoided. 
(3)	Guidelines. 
(a)	Demolition is inappropriate if: 
i)	A building is of such architectural or historical interest and value that its removal 
would be detrimental to the public interest. 
ii)	A building is of such old or unusual or uncommon design and materials that it 
could not be reproduced or be reproduced without great difficulty and expense, 
or; 
iii)	It proposed replacement would make a less positive visual contribution to the 
district, would disrupt the character of the district or would be visually 
incompatible. 
(b)	Demolition is appropriate if: 
i)	A building has lost its architectural and historical integrity and importance and its 
removal will not result in a more negative, less appropriate visual effect on the 
district; 
ii)	A building does not contribute to the historical or architectural character and 
importance of the district and its removal will result in a more positive, 
appropriate visual effect on the district; or 
iii)	The denial of the demolition will result in an economic hardship on the applicant 
as determined by the Clarksdale Preservation Commission. 
w.	Relocation. 
(1)	Definition. The moving of a building in a district from one site to another. 
(2)	General principles. 
(a)	The moving of an existing building which retains architectural and historical integrity 
and which contributes to the architectural and historical character of the district should 
be avoided. 
(b)	The moving out of the district of a building which does not contribute to the historical 
and architectural integrity of the district or which has lost architectural integrity due to 
deterioration and neglect shall be appropriate if its removal or the proposal for its 
replacement will result in a more positive appropriate visual effect on the district. 
(3)	Guidelines for relocation. 
(a)	Relocated buildings must be carefully rebuilt to retain and maintain original 
architectural details and materials. 
(b)	A building may be moved into the district if it maintains a sense of architectural unity in 
terms of style, height, scale, massing, materials, texture and setback with existing 
buildings along the street. 
(c)	A building may be moved from one site to another in the district if: 
i)	The integrity of location and setting the building in its original location has been 
lost or is seriously threatened; 
ii)	The new location will be similar in setting and siting; 
iii)	The building will be compatible with the buildings adjacent to the new location in 
style, height, scale, materials and setbacks; and 
iv)	The relocation of the building will not result in a negative visual effect on the site 
and surrounding building from which it will be removed. 
x.	Exceptions. When the strict application of these design guidelines would result in severe 
hardship or injustice, the preservation commission may vary these guidelines so that a 
rehabilitation project may be conducted in a reasonable manner, but so that at the same time 
general intent and spirit of the design guidelines is preserved. 


[Sec. 603.] - Manufactured Home Overlay District. 
    The purpose of the Manufactured Home Overlay is to provide for development of manufactured

[Sec. 605.] - Planned Unit Development District. 
[1.]	The purpose of the Planned Unit Development District is to provide for the development of planned 
total communities that provide a full range of residential types as well as certain commercial, office, 
or light industrial uses designed to serve the inhabitants of the districts consistent with the 
Comprehensive Plan. For purposes of this Ordinance a Planned Unit Development shall be a tract of 
land at least 4 acres in area, under single corporation, firm, partnership or association ownership, 
planned and developed as an integrated unit, in a single development operation or a programmed 
series of development operations and according to an approved Preliminary Site Plan. 
[2.]	Preliminary site plan required. The "PUD" District shall be established only upon application, after 
public hearing as specified in the amendatory procedures of this Ordinance and shall require an 
approved Preliminary Site Plan meeting the site plan standards of this Ordinance. The approved site 
plan will govern the development of the land and all development plans thereof. 
[3.]	Minimum district area. The Minimum area for a "PUD" District shall be four (4) acres. 
[4.]	Permitted uses. A list of permitted uses within each Planned Unit Development must be submitted 
with the application for establishment of the District and the preliminary site plan and must be 
approved by the Planning Commission and Board of Mayor and Commissioners upon application by 
the owner of the property. 
[5.]	Procedures. An application for rezoning to "PUD" District shall be accompanied by a Preliminary Site 
Plan and text presenting the following: 
a.	Proposed land uses and population densities 
b.	Proposed primary circulation pattern 
c.	Proposed parks and playgrounds 
d.	Delineation of the units or phases to be constructed together with a proposed timetable 
e.	Proposed means of dedication of common open space areas and organizational arrangements 
for the ownership, maintenance and preservation of common open space 
f.	Relationship to the City's Comprehensive Plan, land uses in the surrounding area and to the 
general plan of the PUD. Rezoning procedures shall be in accordance with the procedures set 
forth by this Ordinance. Following the initial rezoning procedure, the proposed development 
shall follow all applicable procedures and requirements governing the subdivision of land. No 
building permits shall be issued until a final plat of the proposed development, or portion 
thereof, is approved, filed, and recorded. No building designed or intended to be used, in whole 
or in part, for commercial purposes shall be constructed prior to the construction of less than 
25% of the dwelling units proposed in the plan, or construction of 100 dwellings units, whichever 
is smaller. If construction of the "PUD" District is restarted within two years of the date of 
approval, the Board and Mayor and Commissioners may consider rezoning the site to its 
previous classification. 
g.	The applicant, by showing good cause why he cannot adhere to the proposed timetable 
described in 4d, may seek an extension of not more than one (l) year at a time. A request for 
extension shall be submitted in writing to the Board of Mayor and Commissioners. 
[6.]	Review standards. The site plan must provide for and conform entirely to the following standards and 
requirements: 
a.	In order to encourage ingenuity, imagination, and high quality design, regulations on residential 
areas will not specify minimum lot area per dwelling unit but will limit density in residential areas 
to 5 families per acre in single family dwellings or 20 families per acre in multi-family dwellings. 
This will allow clustering of dwellings to provide maximum open space. 
b.	Street widths and improvement thereof, as well as off street parking facilities must conform to 
county standards or in lieu of such standards, to requirements established by the Board of 
Mayor and Commissioners. 
c.	Provisions for water supply, sanitary sewers, storm water drainage, and connections shall be 
made to the satisfaction and requirements of the Board of Mayor and Commissioners and the 
appropriate state authority. 
d.	All improvements are to be installed and maintained by the developer unless other 
arrangements approved by the Board of Mayor and Commissioners are made. 
e.	The Board of Mayor and Commissioners may require other special improvements as they are 
required if they are deemed reasonable and essential, and may require that appropriate deed 
restrictions to be filed enforceable by the Board of Mayor and Commissioners for 20 years. 
f.	A minimum total area of 10% of the gross residential area shall be set aside as parks and 
playgrounds. Of this 10%, a maximum of one half may be covered with water. A maximum of 
5% of the area designated to be parks and playgrounds may be covered with structures to be 
used in the recreational use of the area. Parks and playgrounds must be suitably improved for 
its intended use but parks and playgrounds containing natural features clearly worthy of 
preservation may be left unimproved. 
g.	The developer shall also submit sketches of the plan for the entire project showing the 
relationship of uses, street patterns, open space and the general character of the proposed 
development, including a schematic drawing illustrating a typical segment of the development. 
h.	After approval, filing, and recording of the plan, a building permit may be issued in accordance 
with the approved plan. 


[Sec. 606.] - C-4 Planned Commercial District. 
1.	Purpose. The purpose of this district is to provide for modern, attractive, and efficient retail, personal, 
and professional commercial facilities with access needs which demand location along major arterial 
roadways. Uses permitted in this district are frequently automobile- oriented, and, as such, this 
district is most appropriately located along or at intersections of urban arterial or collector roadways. 
2.	Application to existing commercial. Where existing commercial development is zoned C-4 Planned 
Commercial but not conforming to the provisions of the C-4 Planned Commercial Zone, said 
development shall fall under the provisions for nonconforming uses. 
3.	Permitted uses. No specific uses are specified for C-4 Planned Commercial Zone. The applicant for 
a planned commercial district shall submit a list of uses which will be permitted. The Planning 
Commission may delete certain requested uses where it has been determined that the proposed use 
will not be compatible with surrounding area or will be in conflict with the General Development Plan 
of Clarksdale, Mississippi. 
4.	Prohibited uses. Uses specifically prohibited in the C-4 Planned Commercial District shall be as 
follows: 
[a.]	Adult entertainment. 
[b.]	Night clubs, bars and taverns. 
[c.]	Salvage yards. 
[d.]	Outside storage. 
5.	Preliminary site plan required. The "C-4" Planned Commercial District shall be established only upon 
application, after public hearing as specified in the amendatory procedures of this Ordinance and 
shall require an approved plan in accordance with the site plan meeting the site plan standards of 
this Ordinance in order to provide for modern commercial centers of integrated design. 
6.	Visibility areas at entrances/intersections. The design and placement of the landscaping materials 
within the parking areas and front lot line and side lot line buffer yards will be at the discretion of the 
Owner, provided, however, the landscaping shall not obstruct the view between access drives and 
public streets. When an access drive intersects a public street, all landscaping within the areas 
described below shall provide unobstructed cross-visibility at a level between thirty (30) inches and 
seven feet above existing street grade. The sight visibility area is defined as the area formed from 
the intersection point of the proposed access drive and the public right of way for a distance of thirty-
five (35) feet in all directions from said intersection point. 
7.	Traffic access control standards. In order to promote the safety of the motorist and pedestrian and to 
minimize traffic congestion and conflict by reducing the points of contact, the following regulations 
shall apply. 
a.	Maximum width of driveway opening at property line: 35 feet. 
b.	Minimum throat length of driveway (measured from property line to first parking aisle): 50 feet 
for access to "Urban Arterial," 30 feet for all other public rights-of-way. 
c.	Location of driveways: Driveways shall be so located that vehicles entering or leaving the 
establishment will not interfere with the free movement of traffic or create a hazard on the public 
right-of-way. Where feasible, they shall be located where there are not sharp curves and steep 
grades and where sight distance is adequate for safe traffic operation. Driveways should not be 
located within intersections, interchanges, or on highways immediately approaching them. They 
shall be so located that they will not interfere with the placement of signs, signals, or other 
devices that affect traffic operation. 
8.	Review and approval. 
a.	The Planning Commission shall study the preliminary plan and supporting data and may make 
suggestions for changes and adjustments. After the Commission approves the preliminary plan 
and construction schedule, it shall submit same with a brief report to the Board of Mayor and 
Commissioners. Whenever the Board of Mayor and Commissioners approves the preliminary 
plan and supporting material, one copy shall be filed in the Public Works office and one copy 
shall be given to the Owner. Upon receipt of the approved preliminary plan, the Owner may 
proceed with final plans and specifications for all or for any portion of the project that is agreed 
upon. The final plans and specifications shall be reviewed and approved by the Planning 
Commission and transmitted to the Board of Mayor and Commissioners for approval. Upon 
approval by the Board of Mayor and Commissioners, one copy shall be filed in the Planning 
Commission office. No building permit shall be issued until a final plat of the proposed 
development, or portion thereof, is approved, filed, and 
b.	Modification of site plan. The Planning Commission or the Board of Mayor and Commissioners 
may require modification of a site plan as a prerequisite for approval. Required modifications 
may be more restrictive than district regulations and may include, but not be limited to, provision 
for additional buffer yards, landscaping and screening, installation of erosion control measures, 
improvement to access and circulation systems, rearrangement of structures or uses within the 
site, and location and character of signs and other modifications deemed necessary to ensure 
compatibility with the surrounding environment and to protect public health, safety, and welfare. 
Lapse of approval. A site plan approval shall become void two (2) years after the date on which 
the approval became effective unless the applicant receives a building permit and diligently 
carries out construction prior to expiration of that period, or a specific time extension is 
requested of and approved by the Board of Mayor and Commissioners. A site plan approval 
may establish a longer effective period as a specific condition of the application. The Board of 
Mayor and Commissioners may grant one (1) year extension of a site plan approval, provided 
that the applicant files a written request for an extension stating the reasons for the request prior 
to the date of expiration of the approval. 
c.	Modification of site plan approval. The Planning Commission may approve an application for 
modification of a previous site plan approval if it is determined that the modification does not 
affect findings relating to the criteria described herein, leading to the original approval. 
d.	New applications following denial or revocation. No application for approval of the same or 
substantially the same site may be filed within one (1) year of the date of denial of a site plan 
review by the Planning Commission and/or the Board of Mayor and Commissioners. 
e.	Approval to run with the land. A site plan approval pursuant to these provisions shall run with 
the land and shall continue to be valid upon change of ownership of the site or structure that 
was the subject of the application. 
9.	Site development regulations. The following minimum development standards shall be observed in 
the "C-4" Planned Commercial District.

accommodate the number of vehicles that ordinarily are likely to be attracted to the development in 
question. 
2.	The presumptions established by this article are that: 
a.	A development must comply with the parking standards set forth herein, and 
b.	Any development that does meet these standards is in compliance. However, the Table of 
Parking Requirements is only intended to establish a presumption and should be flexibly 
administered, as provided in this section. 
c.	Uses in the Table of Parking Requirements, are indicated by a numerical reference keyed to the 
Table of Permissible Uses. When determination of the number of parking spaces required by 
this table results in a requirement of a fractional space, any fraction of one-half or less may be 
disregarded, while a fraction in excess of one- half shall be counted as one parking space. 
d.	The Board recognizes that the Table of Parking Requirements cannot and does not cover every 
possible situation that may arise. Therefore, in cases not specifically covered, the permit-issuing 
authority is authorized to determine the parking requirements using this table as a guide.

[Sec. 803.] - Flexibility in administration required. 
1.	The Board of Mayor and Commissioners recognizes that, due to the particularities of any given 
development, the inflexible application of the parking standards set forth in this section may result in 
a development either with inadequate parking space or parking space far in excess of its needs. The 
former situation may lead to traffic congestion or parking violations in adjacent streets as well as 
unauthorized parking in nearby private lots. The latter situation wastes money as well as space that 
could more desirable be used for valuable development or environmentally useful open space. 
Therefore, as suggested in this section, the permit-issuing authority may permit deviations from the 
presumptive requirements of this section and may require more parking or allow less parking 
whenever it finds that such deviations are more likely to satisfy the standard set forth. 
2.	Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the permit-issuing authority may allow deviations from 
the parking requirements set forth herein when it finds that: 
a.	A residential development is irrevocably oriented toward the elderly; 
b.	A business is primarily oriented to walk-in trade. 
3.	Whenever the permit-issuing authority allows or requires a deviation from the presumptive parking 
requirements set forth in this section, it shall enter on the face of the permit the parking requirement 
that it imposes and the reasons for allowing or requiring the deviation. 
4.	If the permit-issuing authority concludes, based upon information it receives in the consideration of a 
specific development proposal, that the presumption established by this section for a particular use 
classification is erroneous, it shall initiate a request for an amendment to the Table of Parking 
Requirements. 


[Sec. 804.] - Parking space dimensions. 
1.	Each parking space shall contain a rectangular area at least 19 feet long and 9 feet wide. Lines 
demarcating parking spaces may be drawn at various angles in relation to curbs or aisles, so long as 
the parking spaces so created contain within them the rectangular area required by this section; 
2.	In parking areas containing 10 or more parking spaces, up to 20 percent of the parking spaces need 
contain a rectangular area of only 72 feet in width by 15 feet in length. If such spaces are provided, 
they shall be conspicuously designated as reserved for small or compact cars only; 
3.	Wherever parking areas consist of spaces set aside for parallel parking, the dimensions of such 
parking spaces shall be not less than 22 feet by 9 feet. 


[Sec. 805.] - Required widths of parking aisles and driveways. 
1.	Parking area aisle widths shall conform to the following table, which varies the width requirement 
according to the angle of parking.

2.	Driveways shall be not less than 10 feet in width for one-way traffic and 18 feet in width for two-way 
traffic, except that 10 feet wide driveways are permissible for two-way traffic when (I) the driveway is 
not longer than 50 feet, (ii) it provides access to not more than 6 spaces, and (iii) sufficient turning 
space is provided so that vehicles need not back into a public streets. 


[Sec. 806.] - General design requirements. 
1.	Unless no other practicable alternative is available, vehicle accommodation areas shall be designed 
so that, without resorting to extraordinary movements, vehicles may exit such areas without backing 
onto a public street. This requirement does not apply to parking areas consisting of driveways that 
serve one or two dwelling units, although backing onto arterial streets is discouraged. 
2.	Vehicle accommodation areas of all developments shall be designed so that sanitation, emergency, 
and other public service vehicles can serve such developments without the necessity of backing 
unreasonable distances or making other dangerous or hazardous turning movements. 
3.	Every vehicle accommodation area shall be designed so that vehicles cannot extend beyond the 
perimeter of such area onto adjacent properties or public rights-of-way such areas hall also be 
designed so that vehicles do not extend over sidewalks or tend to bump against or damage any wall, 
vegetation, or other obstruction. 
4.	Circulation areas shall be designed so that vehicles can proceed safely without posing a danger to 
pedestrians or other vehicles and without interfering with parking areas.

    Unless otherwise specifically provided, or unless clearly required by the context, the words and 
phrases defined in this section shall have the meaning indicated when used in this article. 
    Billboard: An off-premises sign owned by a person, corporation, or other entity that engages in the 
business of selling the advertising space on that sign. 
    Effective date of this article: The effective date of this article as originally adopted, or the effective 
date of an amendment to it if the amendment makes a sign nonconforming. 
    Freestanding sign: A sign that is attached to, erected on, or supported by some structure (such as a 
pole, mast, frame, or other structure) that is not itself an integral part of or attached to a building or other 
structure whose principal function is something other than the support of a sign. A sign that stands 
without supporting elements, such as "sandwich sign", is also a freestanding sign. If the message is 
removed from a structure that was originally designed and used as a freestanding sign, this structure 
shall still be considered a sign. 
    Internally illuminated signs: Signs where the source of the illumination is inside the sign and light 
emanates through the message of the sign, rather than being reflected of the surface of the sign from an 
external source. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, signs that consist of or contain tubes that 
(i) are filled with neon or some other gas that glows when an electric current passes through it and (ii) are 
intended to form or constitute all or part of the message of the sign, rather than merely providing 
illumination to other parts of the signs that contain the message, shall also be considered internally 
illuminated signs. 
    Off-premises signs: A sign that draws attention to or communicates information about a business, 
service, commodity, accommodation, attraction, or other enterprise or activity that exists or is conducted, 
sold, offered, maintained, or provided at a location other than the premises on which the sign is located. A 
sign that draws attention to a cause or advocates or proclaims a political, religious, or other 
noncommercial message shall also be an off-premises sign unless such sign is excluded from regulation. 
    On-Premises sign: A sign that draws attention to an accommodation, attraction, or other enterprise 
or activity that exists or is conducted, sold, offered, maintained, or provided on the premises where the 
sign is located. 
    Temporary sign: A sign that (i) is used in connection with a circumstance, situation, or event that is 
designed, intended, or expected to take place or to be completed within a reasonably short or definite 
period after the erection of such sign, or (ii) is intended to remain on the location where it is erected or 
placed for a period of not more than 15 days. If a sign display area is permanent but the message 
displayed is subject to periodic changes, that sign shall not be regarded as temporary. 
    Sign: Any device that: 
(i)	Is sufficiently visible to persons not located on the lot where such device is located to 
accomplish either of the objectives set forth in subdivision ii of this definition; and 
(ii)	Is designed to attract the attention of such persons or to communicate information to them. 


[Sec. 901.] - Permit required for signs. 
1.	Except as otherwise provided (Signs Excluded from Regulation and certain Temporary Signs) all 
signs shall require a permit in conformance with these regulations. 
2.	Permit Exceptions and Additional Regulations 
a.	No sign may be constructed, erected, moved, enlarged, illuminated or substantially altered 
except in accordance with the provisions of this section. Mere repainting or changing the 
message of a sign shall not in and of itself be considered a substantial alteration. 
b.	If plans submitted for a building permit, include sign plans in sufficient detail that the permit-
issuing authority can determine whether the proposed sign or signs comply with the provisions 
of this chapter, then issuance of the requested permit shall constitute approval of the proposed 
sign or signs. 
c.	Signs not approved as provided or exempted may be constructed, erected, moved, enlarged, 
illuminated or substantially altered only in accordance with a sign permit issued by the 
administrator. 
3.	Sign permit applications and sign permits shall be governed by the same provisions of this chapter 
applicable to building permits. 
4.	In the case of a lot occupied or intended to be occupied by multiple business enterprises (e.g., a 
shopping center), sign permits shall be issued in the name of the lot owner or his agent rather than in 
the name of the individual business enterprise requesting a particular sign. The City may assist the 
owner by suggesting a formula whereby the maximum square footage of sign area allowed on the lot 
may be allocated equitably among all tenants, but the City shall be responsible for enforcing a 
private restriction. 


[Sec. 902.] - Signs excluded from regulation. 
    The following signs are exempt from regulation: 
1.	Signs not exceeding four square feet in area that are in customarily associated with residential use 
and that 3 are not of a commercial nature, such as (i) signs giving property identification names or

1.	For the purpose of determining the number of signs, a sign shall be considered to be a single display 
surface or display device containing elements organized, related, and composed to form a unit. 
When matter is displayed in a random manner without organized relationship of elements each 
element shall be considered a single sign. 
2.	A two-sided or multi-sided sign shall be regard as one sign so long as:

exceeds five feet; and 
b.	With respect to double faced (back to back) signs, the distance between the backs of each face 
of the sign does not exceed three feet. 


[Sec. 905.] - Computation of sign area. 
1.	The surface area of a sign shall be computed by including the entire area within a single, continuous, 
rectilinear perimeter of not more than eight straight lines, or a circle or an ellipse, enclosing the 
extreme limits of the writing, representation, emblem, or other display, together with any material or 
color forming an integral part of the background of the display or used to differentiate the sign from 
the backdrop or structure against which it is placed, but not including any supporting framework or 
bracing that is clearly incidental to the display itself. 
2.	If the sign consists of more than one section or module, all of the area including that between 
sections or modules, shall be included in the computation of the sign area. 
3.	With respect to two-sided, multi-sided, or three-dimensional signs, the sign surface area shall be 
computed by including the total of all sides designed to attract attention or communicate information 
that can be seen at any one time by a person from one vantage point. Without otherwise limiting the 
generality of the foregoing: 
a.	The sign surface area of a double faced, back to back sign shall be calculated by using the area 
of only one side of such sign, so long as the distance between the backs of such signs does not 
exceed three feet. 
b.	The sign surface area of a double faced sign constructed in the form of a "V" shall be calculated 
by using the area of on y one side of such sign (the larger side if there is a size difference), so 
long as the angle of the "V' does not exceed 30 degrees and at no point does the distance 
between the backs of such sides exceed five feet. 


[Sec. 906.] - Total sign surface area. 
1.	Unless otherwise provided in this article, the total surface area devoted to all signs on any lot shall 
not exceed the limitations set forth in this section, and all signs except temporary signs shall be 
included in this calculation. 
2.	Unless otherwise provided, the maximum sign surface area permitted on any lot in any residential 
district is eight square feet. 
3.	Subject to the other provisions of this section, the maximum sign surface area permitted on any lot in 
a commercial district other than the C-3 district or manufacturing district shall be determined as 
follows: 
a.	There may be not more than 0.5 square feet of sign surface area per linear foot of lot street 
frontage up to 200 feet of frontage. 
b.	The sign surface area of any sign located on a wall of a structure may not exceed 50 percent of 
the total surface area of the wall on which the sign is located. 


[Sec. 907.] - Freestanding sign surface area. 
1.	For purposes of this section, a side of a freestanding sign is any plane or flat surface included in the 
calculation of the total sign surface. For example, wall signs typically have one side. Freestanding 
signs typically have two sides (back to back), although four sided and other multi-sided signs are 
also common. 
2.	A single side of a freestanding sign may not exceed 0.3 square feet in surface area for every linear 
foot of street frontage along the street toward which such signs is primarily oriented. However, in no 
case may a single side of a freestanding sign exceed 50 square feet in surface area if the lot on 
which the sign is located has less than 200 feet of frontage on the street toward which that sign is 
primarily oriented, 75 square feet on lots with 200 or more but less than 400 feet of frontage, and 100 
square feet on lots with 400 or more feet of frontage. 
3.	In the C-3 district, a single side of a freestanding sign may not exceed 0.75 square feet in surface 
area for every linear foot of street frontage along the street toward which such sign is primarily 
oriented. However, in no case may a single side of such signs exceed 250 square feet in surface 
area. 
4.	With respect to freestanding signs that have no discernible sides, such as spheres or other shapes 
not composed of flat planes, no such freestanding sign may exceed the maximum total surface area 
allowed. 


[Sec. 908.] - Number of freestanding signs. 
1.	Except as authorized by this section, no development may have more than one freestanding sign. 
2.	If a development is located on a corner lot that has at least 100 feet of frontage on each of the two 
intersecting public streets, then the development may have not more than one freestanding sign 
along each side of the development bordered by such streets. 
3.	If a development is located on a lot that is bordered by two public streets that do not intersect at the 
lot's boundaries (double front lot), then the development may have not more than one freestanding 
sign on each side of the development bordered by such streets. 


[Sec. 909.] - Subdivision and multi-family development entrance. 
    Signs at any entrance to a residential subdivision or multi-family development, there may be not 
more than two signs identifying such subdivision or development. A single side of any such sign may not 
exceed 16 square feet nor may the total surface area of all such signs located at a single entrance 
exceed 32 square feet. 


[Sec. 910.] - Location and height requirements. 
1.	Freestanding signs shall observe the setback requirements. 
2.	No sign may extend above any parapet or be placed upon any roof surface, except that for purposes 
of this section, roof surfaces constructed at an angle of 75 degrees or more from horizontal shall be 
regarded as wall space. This subsection shall not apply to displays, including lighting erected in 
connection with the observation of holidays on the roofs of residential structures. 
3.	No sign attached to a building may project more than 12 inches from the building wall. 
4.	No sign or supporting structure may be located in or over the traveled portion of any public right-of-
way unless the sign is attached to a structural element of a building and an encroachment permit has 
been obtained from the City. 
5.	No part of a freestanding sign may exceed a height, measured from ground level, of 30 feet in the C-
3, M-1, and M-2 districts and 15 feet in all other districts. 


[Sec. 911.] - Sign illumination and signs containing lights. 
1.	Unless otherwise prohibited by this chapter, signs may be illuminated if such illumination is in 
accordance with this section. 
2.	No sign within 150 feet of a residential zone may be illuminated between the hours of midnight and 6 
a.m., unless the impact of such lighting beyond the boundaries of the lot where it is located is entirely 
inconsequential. 
3.	Lighting directed toward a sign shall be shielded so that it illuminates only the face of the sign and 
does not shine 


[Sec. 912.] - Miscellaneous restrictions and prohibitions. 
1.	No off-premises signs, except those exempted from regulation or from permit requirements, may be 
located in any district other than a C-2, M-1, or M-2 district. (option of Industrial Districts only) 
2.	No sign may be located so that it substantially interferes with the view necessary for motorists to 
proceed safely through intersections or to enter onto or exit from public streets or private roads. 
3.	Signs that revolve or are animated or that utilize movement or apparent movement to attract the 
attention of the public are prohibited. Without limiting the foregoing, banners, streamers, animated 
display boards, pennants, and propellers are prohibited, but signs that only move occasionally 
because of wind are not prohibited if their movement (i) is not a primary design feature of the sign, 
and (ii) is not intended to attract attention to the sign. The restriction of this subsection shall not apply 
to signs indicating the time, date, or weather conditions. 
4.	No sign may be erected so that by its location, color, size, shape, nature, or message it would tend 
to obstruct the view of or be confused with official traffic signs or other signs erected by 
governmental agencies. 
5.	Freestanding signs shall be securely fastened to the ground or to some other substantial supportive 
structure so that there is virtually no danger that either the sign or the supportive structure may be 
moved by the wind or other forces of nature and cause injury to persons or property. 


[Sec. 913.] - Maintenance of signs. 
1.	All signs and all components, thereof, including without limitation supports braces, and anchors, shall 
be kept in a state of good repair. With respect to free standing signs, components (supporting 
structures, backs, etc.) not bearing a message shall be constructed of materials that blend with the 
natural environment or shall be painted a neutral color to blend with the natural environment. 
2.	If a sign other than a billboard advertises a business, service, commodity, accommodation, 
attraction, or other enterprise or activity that is no longer operating or being offered or conducted that 
sign shall be considered abandoned and shall, within 30 days after such abandonment be removed 
by the sign owner, owner of the property where the sign is located or other party having control over 
such sign. 
3.	If the message portion of a sign is removed, leaving only the supporting "shell" of a sign or the 
supporting braces, anchors, or similar components, the owner of the sign or the owner of the 
property where the sign is located or other person having control over such sign shall, within 30 days 
of the removal of the message portion of the sign, either replace the entire message portion of the 
sign or remove the remaining components of the sign. This subsection shall not be construed to alter 
the effect of prohibiting the replacement of a nonconforming sign. Nor shall this subsection be 
construed to prevent the changing of the message of a sign. 
4.	The area within 10 feet in all directions of any part of a freestanding sign shall be kept clear of all 
debris and all undergrowth more than five inches in height. 


[Sec. 914.] - Unlawful cutting of trees or shrubs. 
1.	No person may, for the purpose of increasing or enhancing the visibility of any sign, damage, trim, 
destroy or remove any trees, shrubs, or other vegetation located: 
a.	Within the right-of-way of any public street or road, unless the work is done pursuant to the 
express written authorization of the Public Works Director; 
b.	On property that is not under the ownership or control of the person doing or responsible for 
such work, unless the work is done pursuant to the express authorization of the person owning 
the property were such trees or shrubs are located; 
c.	In any area where such trees or shrubs are required to remain under a permit issued under this 
Ordinance. 


[Sec. 915.] - Nonconforming signs. 
1.	No person may engage in any activity that causes an increase in the extent of nonconformity of a 
nonconforming sign. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, no nonconforming sign may be 
enlarged or altered in such a manner as to aggravate the nonconforming condition. Nor may 
illumination be added to any nonconforming sign. 
2.	A nonconforming sign may not be moved or replaced except to bring the sign into complete 
conformity with this chapter. 
3.	If a nonconforming sign is destroyed by natural causes, it may not thereafter be repaired, 
reconstructed or replaced except in conformity with all the provisions of this chapter, and the 
remnants of the former sign structure shall be cleared from the land. For purposes of this section, a 
nonconforming sign is "destroyed" if damaged to an extent that the cost of repairing the sign to its 
former stature or replacing it with an equivalent sign equals or exceeds the value (tax value if listed 
for tax purposes) of the sign so damaged. 
4.	The message of a nonconforming sign may be changed so long as this does not create any new 
nonconformities (for example, by creating an off-premises sign under circumstances where such a 
sign would not be allowed). 
5.	Subject to the other provisions of this section, nonconforming signs may be repaired and renovated 
so long as the cost of such work does not exceed within any 12-month period 50 percent of the value 
(tax value if listed for tax purposes) of such sign. 
6.	If a nonconforming sign other than a billboard advertises a business, service, commodity, 
accommodation, attraction, or other enterprise or activity that is no longer operating or being offered 
or conducted, that sign shall be considered abandoned and shall be removed within 30 days after 
such abandonment by the sign owner, owner of the property where the sign is located, or other party 
having control over such sign. 
a.	If a nonconforming billboard remains blank for a continuous period of 180 days, that billboard 
shall be deemed abandoned and shall, within 30 days after such abandonment, be altered to 
comply with this article or be removed by the sign owner, owner of the property where the sign 
is located or other person having control over such sign. For purposes of this section, a sign is 
"blank" if: (1) it advertises a business, service, commodity, accommodation, attraction, or other 
enterprise or activity that is no longer operating or being offered or conducted; or (2) The 
advertising message it displays becomes illegible in whole or substantial part; or (3)The 
advertising copy paid for by a party other than the sign owner or promoting an interest other 
than the rental of the sign has been removed. 
b.	As soon as reasonably possible after the effective date of this chapter, the administrator shall 
make every reasonable effort to identify all the nonconforming signs within the City's planning 
jurisdiction. He shall then contact the person responsible for each such sign (as well as the 
owner of the property where the nonconforming sign is located if different from the former) and 
inform such person (i) that the sign is nonconforming, (ii) how it is nonconforming, (iii) what must 
be done to correct it and by what date, and (iv) the consequences of failure to make the 
necessary corrections the administrator shall keep complete records of all correspondence, 
communications, and other actions taken with respect to such nonconforming signs. 


[Sec. 916.] - Amortization of nonconforming signs. 
1.	A nonconforming sign that exceeds the height size, or spacing limitations by more than 10 percent or 
that is nonconforming in some other way shall comply with the forgoing upon change of business 
occupancy. 
2.	If the nonconformity consists of too many freestanding signs on a single lot or an excess of total sign 
area on a single lot, the person responsible for the violation may determine which sign or signs need 
to be altered or removed to bring the development into conformity with the provisions of this article. 
3.	The following types of nonconforming signs shall be altered to comply with the provisions of this 
article or removed within 12 months after the effective date of this article: 
a.	Portable signs and temporary signs. 
b.	Banners. 


[ARTICLE] X. - SCREENING AND TREES 


[Sec. 1000.] - Screening standard established. 
1.	Where commercially zoned, industrially zoned, multi-family zoned, or Manufactured Home zoned 
project, adjoins other residentially zoned property, prior to the issuance of a building permit, a 
screening barrier will be erected by the developer of the commercial, industrial, multi-family, or 
Manufactured Home property which separates the adjoining yard, and adequately screens the 
residential uses from any noise, sight, sound, odor, or other noxious offense which might be related 
by the commercial, industrial, multi-family, or Manufactured Home property use. 


[Sec. 1001.] - Descriptions of screening. 
    The following three basic types of screens are hereby established and are used as the basis for 
screening requirements. 
1.	Type A, Opaque Screening. A screen that is opaque from the ground to a height of at least 6 
feet, with intermittent visual obstructions from the opaque portion to a height of at least 16 feet. 
The screening intended to include all visual contact between uses and to create a strong 
impression of special separation. 
2.	Type B, Semi-Opaque Screening. A screen that is opaque from the ground to a height of six 
feet, within intermittent visual obstructions from above the opaque portion to a height of at least 
16 feet. The semi- opaque screen is intended to partially block visual contact between uses and 
to create a strong impression of the separation of spaces. 
3.	Type C, Broken Screen. A screen composed of intermittent visual obstructions from the ground 
to a height of 16 feet. The broken screen is intended to create the impression of a separation of 
spaces without necessarily eliminating visual contact between the spaces. 


[Sec. 1002.] - Subdivisions. 
    When undeveloped land is subdivided and undeveloped lots only are sold, the subdivider shall not 
be required to install any screening. Screening shall be required, if at all, only when the lots are 
developed, and the responsibility for installing such screening shall be determined in accordance with the 
other requirements of Part I of this article. 


[Sec. 1003.] - Required trees along dedicated streets. 
    Along both sides of all newly created streets that are constructed in accordance with the public street 
standards set forth in Subdivision Regulations for Clarksdale, the developer shall either plant or retain 
sufficient trees so that between the paved portion of the street and a line running parallel to and 50 feet 
from the center line of the street, there is for every 30 feet of street frontage at least an average of one 
deciduous tree that has or will have when fully mature a trunk at least 12 inches in diameter. 


[Sec. 1004.] - Retention and protection of large trees. 
    Every development shall retain all existing trees 18 inches in diameter or more unless the retention 
of such trees would unreasonably burden the development. 
1.	No excavation or other subsurface disturbance may be undertaken within the drip line of any 
tree 18 inches in diameter or more, and no impervious surface (including, but not limited to, 
paving or buildings) may be located within 122 feet (measured from the center of the trunk) of 
any tree 18 inches in diameter or more unless compliance with this section would unreasonably 
burden the development. For purposes of this section, a drip line is defined as a perimeter 
formed by the points farthest away from the trunk of a tree where precipitation falling from the 
branches of that tree lands on the ground. 
2.	The retention or protection of trees 18 inches in diameter or more unreasonably burdens a 
development, the desired location of improvements on a lot or the proposed activities on a lot 
would have to be substantially altered and such alteration would work an unreasonable 
hardship upon the developer. 
3.	If space that would otherwise be devoted to parking cannot be so used because of the 
requirements, and, as a result, the parking requirements set forth cannot be satisfied, the 
number of required spaces may be reduced by the number of spaces "lost" because of the up to 
a maximum of 15 percent of the required spaces. 


[Sec. 1005.] - Shade trees in parking areas. 
1.	Vehicle accommodation areas must be shaded by deciduous trees (either retained or planted by the 
developer) that have or will have when fully mature a trunk at least 12 inches in diameter, when trees 
are planted by the developer to satisfy the requirements of this section. Trees shall be two and one 
half inched in caliper at planting. 
2.	Each tree of the type described above shall be presumed to shade a circular area having a radius of 
15 feet with the trunk of the tree as the center, and there must be sufficient trees so that, using this 
standard, 20 percent of the vehicle accommodation area will be shaded; 
3.	No paving may be placed within 12 feet (measured from the center of the trunk) of any tree retained 
to comply with this section and new trees planted to comply with this section shall be located so that 
they are surrounded by at least 200 square feet of unpaved area; 
4.	Vehicle accommodation areas shall be laid out and detailed to prevent vehicles from striking trees. 
Vehicles will be presumed to have a body overhang of three feet, six inches. 


[ARTICLE] XI. - ADMINISTRATION 


[Sec. 1100.] - Interpretation and conflict. 
    In interpreting and applying this regulation, its provisions shall be held to be the minimum 
requirements necessary for the promotion of public safety, health, convenience, comfort, prosperity and 
general welfare. It is not intended by this regulation to interfere with or annul any easements, covenants 
or other agreements between parties unless they violate this regulation. When two (2) specific provisions 
of this regulation conflict or a provision of this regulation conflicts with any other code, statute, law, 
Ordinance or regulation, the most restrictive section shall apply. 


[Sec. 1101.] - Enforcement by zoning administrator. 
    There is hereby established the office of zoning administrator. It shall be the duty of the zoning 
administrator to enforce this regulation in accordance with the provisions hereof. The zoning administrator 
shall issue all building permits. All departments, officials and public employees of the City of Clarksdale 
vested with the duty or authority to issue other permits or licenses shall conform to the provisions of this 
regulation and shall not issue a permit for any use, building or purpose in conflict with the provisions of 
this regulation. Any permit or license issued in conflict with the provisions of this regulation shall be null 
and void. 


[Sec. 1102.] - Required building permits. 
    It shall be unlawful to commence the excavation or filling of any lot or parcel for any construction of 
any building, to begin construction of any building, to commence the moving or alteration of any building, 
or to commence the development of land for use not requiring a building, until the zoning administrator 
has issued a building permit for such work. Applications for building permits for uses to be served by 
septic tanks shall be accompanied by a sewerage layout permit from the Coahoma County Health 
Department. Failure to install the septic tanks and filter field according to the layout described in the 
permit shall constitute a violation of this Ordinance. 


[Sec. 1103.] - Duties of zoning administrator. 
1.	Findings of compliance. The zoning administrator shall act upon all applications on which he is 
authorized to act by the provisions of this regulation within seven (7) days after these are filed in full 
compliance with all the applicable requirements as specified. He shall either issue a building permit 
within said seven (7) days or shall notify the applicant in writing of his refusal of such permit and the 
reasons therefor. Failure to so notify the applicant in case of such refusal within said seven (7) days 
shall entitle the applicant to submit his request to the Planning Commission for recommendation to 
the Board of Mayor and Commissioners. 
2.	Findings of noncompliance. If the zoning administrator finds that any of the provisions of this 
regulation are being violated, he shall notify in writing the person responsible for such violations, 
indicating the nature of the violations and ordering the action necessary to correct it. He shall order 
discontinuance of illegal use of land, buildings or structures; removal of illegal buildings or structures 
or of additions, alterations or structural changes thereto; discontinuance of any illegal work being 
done; or shall take any other action authorized by this regulation to insure compliance with or to 
prevent violation of its provisions. 


[Sec. 1104.] - Expiration of building permits. 
    If the work described in any building permit has not begun within ninety (90) days from the date of 
issuance thereof, said permit shall expire and be canceled by the zoning administrator, and written notice 
thereof shall be given to the persons affected, together with notice that further work as described in the 
canceled permit shall not proceed unless and until a new building permit has been obtained. 


[Sec. 1105.] - Required conformance with building plans. 
    Building permits are issued on the basis of plans and applications approved by the zoning 
administrator and authorize only the use, arrangement and construction set forth in such approved plans 
and applications, and any other use, arrangement or construction at variance with that authorized shall be 
deemed violation of this regulation. 


[Sec. 1106.] - Duties of planning commission. 
    In carrying out its functions and duties, the Planning Commission shall have authority to review and 
recommend applications for conditional uses and variances, and to review and make recommendations 
on other matters involving this regulation. 
1.	Powers; conditional uses. 
a.	The Planning Commission shall have the power and original jurisdiction to review, in 
accordance with the provisions of this regulation, applications filed for conditional uses. In 
considering an application for a conditional use, the Planning Commission shall give due 
regard to the nature and condition of all adjacent use and structures and the consistency 
herewith of the proposed use and development. Before recommending a use as a 
conditional use, the Planning Commission shall determine whether the proposed use 
would be hazardous, harmful, noxious, offensive or a nuisance to the surrounding 
neighborhood by reason of noise, smoke, odor, vibration, dust and dirt, cinders, noxious 
gases, glare and heat, fire and safety hazards, sewage wastes and pollution, transportation 
and traffic, and aesthetic and psychological effects. Upon review of an application for a 
conditional use, the Planning Commission may recommend such requirements and 
conditions with respect to location, construction, maintenance and operation, in addition to 
those expressly stipulated in this regulation for the particular conditional use as the 
Planning Commission may deem necessary for the protection of adjacent properties and 
public interest. A conditional use shall not be recommended by the Planning Commission 
unless and until: 
b.	A written application for a conditional use is submitted to the zoning administrator 
indicating the section of this regulation under which the conditional use is sought and 
stating the grounds on which it is requested. 
c.	The Planning Commission shall make a finding that recommending the conditional use will 
not adversely affect the surrounding neighborhood or the public interest. 
d.	The findings of the Planning Commission shall be forwarded by the zoning administrator to 
the Board of Mayor and Commissioners for final determination. 
2.	Powers; variances. 
a.	The Planning Commission shall have the power to review applications for variances from 
the provisions or requirements of this regulation and to recommend to vary or adapt the 
strict application of any of the requirements of these regulations in the case of 
exceptionally irregular, narrow, shallow or steep lots, or other exceptional physical 
conditions, whereby such strict application would result in practical difficulty or 
unnecessary hardship that would deprive the owner of the reasonable use of the land or 
building involved, but in no other case. In recommending any variance, the Planning 
Commission shall prescribe any conditions that it deems to be necessary or desirable. 
However, no variance in the strict application of any provision of these regulations shall be 
recommended by the Planning Commission unless it finds: 
(1)	Written application for a variance has been submitted. 
(2)	That there are special circumstances or conditions, fully described in the findings, 
applying to the land or building for which the variance is sought, which circumstances 
or conditions are peculiar to such land or buildings and do not apply generally to land 
or buildings in the neighborhood, and that said circumstances or conditions are such 
that the strict application of the provisions of these regulations would deprive the 
applicant of the reasonable use of such land or buildings. 
(3)	That, for reasons fully set forth in the findings, the granting of the variance is 
necessary for the reasonable use of the land or building and that the variance as 
recommended by the Planning Commission is the minimum variance that will 
accomplish this purpose. 
(4)	That the granting of the variance will be in harmony with the general purpose and 
intent of these regulations, and will not be injurious to the neighborhood or otherwise 
detrimental to the public welfare. In addition to considering the character and use of 
adjoining buildings and those in the vicinity, the Planning Commission, in determining 
its findings, shall take into account the number of persons residing or working in such 
buildings or upon such land and traffic conditions in the vicinity. 
b.	The findings of the Planning Commission shall be forwarded by the zoning administrator to 
the Board of Mayor and Commissioners for final determination. 
c.	Expiration of variances and conditional uses - Every conditional permit or variation of the 
application of the literal provisions of this regulation, allowed or granted, as provided in this 
article, shall expire and be of no force or effect six (6) months from the date thereof, unless 
the beneficiary of such variation or conditional permit shall have actually, within the sixth 
month period, put the subject property to the purpose for which such variation or 
conditional permit shall have been granted or allowed. 
3.	Public notice required. 
a.	Applications for conditional uses or variances shall be made in writing and submitted to the 
zoning administrator at least fifteen (15) days prior to the date when such is to be reviewed 
by the Planning Commission. Public notice of such application and hearing shall be 
provided by means of a sign or signs erected in a conspicuous location on the property, 
using at least one sign for every two hundred (200) feet of frontage on each street upon 
which the property abuts. Property shall be posted with sign at least two (2) feet by three 
(3) feet in size, with the lower edge of the sign at least three (3) feet above ground level in 
letters legible from the nearest street as follows: PUBLIC NOTICE - This property is being 
considered for a (conditional use) (variance). For further information contact the Zoning 
Administrator, City Hall, 121 Sunflower Avenue, Clarksdale, Mississippi (662-621-8142). 
b.	The Planning Commission shall hold a public hearing upon the application and all persons 
having an interest in such application shall have the opportunity to be heard. A 
recommendation shall be rendered to the Board of Mayor and Commissioners within 
fourteen (14) days after the hearing is held. 


[ARTICLE] XII. - AMENDMENTS 


[Sec. 1200.] - Declaration of policy. 
1.	For the purpose of establishing and maintaining sound, stable and desirable development within the 
City of Clarksdale, Mississippi, this regulation, and as here used the term "regulation" shall be

Commissioners, the Planning Commission, or by any person, firm or corporation filing application 
therefor. 
2.	No amendment to this regulation shall be adopted whereby the regulations and restrictions so 
established are not uniform for each district having the same zoning classification and bearing the 
same symbol or designation on the Zoning Map. No amendment to this regulation shall be adopted
