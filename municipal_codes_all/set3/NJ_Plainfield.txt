reason by the valid judgment or decree of any court of competent
jurisdiction, such unconstitutionality or invalidity shall not affect any of the
remaining words, clauses, sentences, paragraphs, subsections and sections

invalid word, clause, sentence, paragraph, subsection or section.

(c) The City of Plainfield recognizes that there are inherent additional costs
and expenses relating to additional notifications of delinquencies
necessitating additional record keeping, collections, and
communications to licensees and therefore establishes a late fee where
a license is due to be renewed on February 1 of each year.
(1) Each licensee may be given a thirty-day grace period to pay any
and all license renewal fees if such a request is made, in writing,
within fourteen (14) days prior to February 1 of each year to the
Plainfield Health Division. The decision to allow for such an
extension shall be in the sole discretion of the Director of the
Plainfield Health Division or his/her designee.
(2) There shall be a late fee of Fifteen Dollars ($15.00) for failure to
renew each week in which said renewal has not been completed, in
addition to the required license renewal fee.
(3) Nothing herein shall be construed to require a licensee who has
successfully applied for an extension as set forth in Section
1:1-15(c) (1), to pay a late fee during and for the period of the
extension.
(d) The City of Plainfield, through its Health Division, is required to make
periodic inspections and reinspections to insure against public hazards.
This obligation, when required to be performed repeatedly as a result of
the licensee's failure to comply with established health and safety
standards, causes the City of Plainfield to assume additional expense
§ 1:1-15 § 1:1-15
1:12
and costs, therefore the City of Plainfield has established a fee of
Forty Dollars ($40.00) for re-inspections, conditional approvals and the
attendant re-inspection.
(1) Where a licensee's establishment has, as a result of the Plainfield
Health Division's initial inspection, failed to receive a rating of
satisfactory, each and every reinspection thereafter shall require
the licensee to pay a fee of Forty Dollars ($40.00) for each required
reinspection.
(2) Where a licensee has received a conditional approval, such licensee
shall be subject to a daily inspection and shall pay a fee of Forty
Dollars ($40.00) per daily inspection.
(3) Where the Plainfield Health Division, after any first inspection,
finds that the licensee has failed to achieve a minimum rating of
satisfactory, a summons shall be issued to the said licensee for
violating the appropriate rules, regulations, New Jersey State
Statutes and/or this section. Should, in the discretion of the
Plainfield Health Division, the licensee's premises creates an
immediate hazard to the public health, the Plainfield Health
Division shall immediately close the licensee's facilities. In that
event, the Plainfield Health Division shall cause the alleged
violation to be heard in the Municipal Court of the City of Plainfield
within seventy-two (72) hours thereof.
(e) Any person or entity found to have violated this section shall be fined as
follows:
(1) For a first offense the fine shall be not less than One Hundred
Dollars ($100.00) and not more than Three Hundred Dollars
($300.00);
(2) For a second offense the fine shall be not less than Two Hundred
Fifty Dollars ($250.00) and not more than Five Hundred Dollars
($500.00);
(3) For a third and any subsequent offense the fine shall not be less
than Seven Hundred Fifty Dollars ($750.00) and not more than One
Thousand Five Hundred Dollars ($1,500.00);
(4) All fines imposed hereinabove shall be in addition to any and all
reinspection fees as described in Section 1:1-15 (d).

the summons and complaint in an action to foreclose on a mortgage
against the subject property, but prior to vesting of title in the creditor
or any other third party, the creditor shall register the property and pay
the applicable registration fee as set forth in this article, and if the
property is found to be a nuisance or in violation of any applicable state
or local code, the local public officer, City Clerk or other authorized
municipal official shall notify the creditor, which shall have the
responsibility to abate the nuisance or correct the violation in the same
manner and to the same extent as the title owner of the property, to
such standard or specification as may be required by state law or

and property owners; creating unsafe and nuisance conditions;
and contributing to the devaluation of property values.

(3) Is wrecked, junked, stripped, inoperable, or in a state of
disrepair such that it is unsightly or unsafe; or
(4) Is in such mechanical or physically damaged or deteriorating
condition that it could not be immediately operated in a safe
manner, or if operated on a public roadway would be subject
to a violation of N.J.S.A. 39:3-44 (unsafe vehicle).
(A) A motor vehicle shall be deemed "inoperable" where
any of the following conditions exist:
(i) It is being dismantled for sale, salvage, reclamation
of parts, or repair.
(ii) It does not have all of its main component parts
properly attached.
(iii)Where any other additional conditions exist which
cause the vehicle to be incapable of being driven
lawfully and safety under its own power.

radiator, motor, windows, doors, muffler, body or
essential parts of the engine, and all such other parts
or equipment as are necessary for the vehicle to be

nuisance may include, but is not limited to, property maintenance activities,
law enforcement activities associated with abandoned and foreclosed
properties, and any other activities reasonably related to the abatement of
any nuisance created by abandoned or foreclosed properties.
§ 6:2-8. Certification prior to adoption of resolution.
Prior to the adoption of a resolution to attach a lien to real property, a
member of the administration with knowledge of the abatement activities
must furnish a certification setting forth the following:
(1) Nothing in this section shall be construed to prohibit the
placing, keeping or storage of a motor vehicle referenced

lawfully existing new or used car dealers or junkyard which
otherwise complies with all federal, state and municipal
laws, nor shall they apply to the temporary storage of
registered, insured vehicles awaiting repairs at service
stations.
(d) Parking or storage of motor vehicles on public property. The
parking of storage of motor vehicles on public property shall be
governed by state law or as otherwise provided by City ordinance.

§ 6:3-14. Appeal from intrusion detection device requirements. [MC
1973-25, § 1, July 16, 1973]
(a) It is neither the intent nor in the spirit of this article to require the
installation of burglar alarm equipment in any commercial
establishment.
However, if after all the requirements of this article have been satisfied,
the establishment is plagued by continued unlawful entries, because
of either the condition of the structure or the nature of the business,
the enforcing authority may require the installation and maintenance of
Underwriters' Laboratories certified burglar alarm equipment covering
all access points or a combination of interior devices including, but not
limited to photo-electrical, ultrasonic, microwave, proximity and sound
devices. The enforcing authority may require that the equipment used
be a local alarm, local alarm with police connection, central station
system.
(b) The person responsible for compliance may request that the enforcing
authority allow the commercial establishment to substitute
Underwriters' Laboratories certified burglar alarm equipment or
intrusion detection device for the physical security devices required by
this article. The enforcing authority shall grant this request subject to
the requirements set forth in Section 6:3-6.
(c) Nothing contained in this ordinance shall prevent a commercial
establishment from installing and maintaining burglar alarm systems or
intrusion detection devices. Access points covered by a burglar alarm
system or intrusion detection device shall not require the installation of
additional security devices as noted in this code. However those access
points not covered by a burglar alarm or intrusion detection device
must conform to the Code. If a burglar alarm or intrusion detection
device is installed, it shall be maintained in an operative condition at all
times, and it shall be unlawful for any owner or occupant to reduce the
effectiveness of the system or device, except where necessary to make
tests, repairs, revisions, or additions.
(a) Within ten (10) days after the receipt of written notice from the Chief of
Police requiring the installation and maintenance of photoelectric,
ultrasonic, or other intrusion detection device, the person responsible
for compliance therewith may appeal in writing to the Department of
Public Affairs and Safety. In filing such notice of appeal, the appellant
shall set forth the specific grounds wherein it is claimed there was an
error or abuse of discretion by the Chief of Police, or wherein the
issuance of the written notice was not supported by proper evidence.
(b) Upon receipt of such appeal, the Department of Public Affairs and
Safety shall set the matter for hearing and cause notice thereof to be
given to the appellant and to the Chief of Police, or his authorized
representative, not less than five (5) days prior to the date set for the
hearing. At such hearing the appellant shall show cause on the grounds

device. If the decision is affirmed or modified by the Department of
Public Affairs and Safety, the appellant shall be given written notice
thereof by the Chief of Police setting forth the installation to be made
and the period of time within which the same shall be completed. In no
event shall the period be less than originally granted appellant.

"Redevelopment Law").
The City Council has designated certain real property within the City as an

with any properties so designated after the adoption of this Ordinance, the
"Rehabilitation Areas").
The City Council has duly adopted redevelopment plans governing one or
more of the Redevelopment Areas and/or the Rehabilitation Areas (together
with any redevelopment plans so enacted after the date of this Ordinance,
the "Redevelopment Plans").
Pursuant to Section 8 of the Redevelopment Law, the City may collect
revenue from a prospective developer to defray the costs of the City acting
as the redevelopment entity.
Pursuant to Section 16 of the Redevelopment Law, in order to effectuate
low or moderate income housing projects (regardless of whether or not
such housing projects are within areas in need of redevelopment or areas
in need of rehabilitation), the City may (i) receive and accept funds or
other financial assistance, (ii) cooperate with a private entity to construct,
rehabilitate or operate publicly assisted housing, (iii) provide technical
assistance and support to private developers interested in constructing
low and moderate income housing, and (iv) enter into all contracts and
agreements necessary or incidental to the performance of the duties
authorized by the Redevelopment Law.
The City has received, and anticipates continuing to receive, applications
and/or proposals (each an "Application") for the redevelopment of property
located within the Redevelopment Areas (or the Rehabilitation Areas) and
subject to the Redevelopment Plans, or for the development of low or
moderate income housing projects, submitted by proposed developers (each
a "Prospective Developer") to the City for review and consideration (as
described in each such Application, the "Project").
The City desires to enter into negotiations with Prospective Developers, for
(i) a redevelopment agreement and/or (ii) an agreement for long or short
term financial assistance, as may be applicable or appropriate for each
respective Project (each an "Agreement").

a mechanism whereby it can enter into escrow agreements governing the
deposit and disposition of funds to cover the City's costs.

to effectuate the transaction contemplated therein, to offset any and all
professional or out of pocket costs incurred by the City with respect to

personally liable, jointly and severally for the relocation costs.

MC 2016-12 § 3, May 9, 2016]
respect to Employees covered by a collective bargaining agreement in
effect at the time of the effective date of this article, no provision of
this article shall apply until the expiration of the collective bargaining
agreement; however, if the terms of an expired collective bargaining
agreement provide paid sick leave that is more generous than provided
by this article, those terms of the expired collective bargaining
agreement apply to the extent required by law.
(1) All Employees accrue a minimum of one hour of paid sick time for every
30 hours actually worked, subject to the limits set forth below in
paragraphs (2) and (3).

not required to provide more than 40 hours of paid sick time in a
calendar year;
(3) Employers who employ fewer than ten Employees for compensation are
not required to provide more than 24 hours of paid sick time in a
calendar year, except for Employees who are child care workers, home
health care workers and food service workers. For child care workers,
home health care workers and food service workers, Employers are
required to provide up to 40 hours of paid sick time, so long as the
hours are accrued in a calendar year as set forth in paragraph (1)
above.
(4) In determining the number of Employees performing work for an
Employer, all Employees performing work for compensation on a fulltime,
part-time, or temporary basis shall be counted, provided that
where the number of Employees who work for an Employer for
compensation fluctuates, business size may be determined for the
current calendar year based upon the average number of Employees
who worked for compensation during the preceding calendar year.
(5) Employees who are exempt from overtime requirements under 29
U.S.C. § 213(a)(1) of the Federal Fair Labor Standards Act are assumed

accrual unless their normal work week is less than 40 hours, in which
case paid sick time accrues based upon that normal work week.
(6) Employees begin to accrue Paid Sick Time on the first day of
employment. Employees are entitled to use accrued Paid Sick Time
beginning on the 90th calendar day of their employment and thereafter
Employees are entitled to use Paid Sick Time as it is accrued.
(7) Accrued but unused Paid Sick Time shall be carried over to the
following calendar year, provided that no Employer shall be required to
carry over more than forty (40) hours of unused Paid Sick Time from
one calendar year to the next or allow the use of more than forty (40)

hours of Paid Sick Time in a calendar year. An Employer shall not be
required to carry over unused Paid Sick Time if the Employee is paid
for any unused Paid Sick Time at the end of the calendar year in which
such time is accrued.
(8) Any Employer with a paid leave policy, such as a paid time off policy,
that provides an amount of paid leave sufficient to meet the total annual
accrual requirements of this section that may be used for the same
purposes and under the same conditions as paid sick time under this
article is not required to provide additional paid sick time.
(9) Nothing in this section shall be construed as requiring financial or other
reimbursement to an Employee from an Employer upon the Employee's
termination, resignation, retirement, or other separation from
employment for accrued paid sick time that has not been used.
(10) If an Employee is transferred to a separate division, entity, or location,
but remains employed by the same Employer in Plainfield, the
Employee is entitled to all paid sick time accrued at the prior division,
entity, or location and is entitled to use all paid sick time as provided in
this section. If there is a separation from employment and the employee
is rehired within six (6) months of separation, previously accrued
unpaid sick time that had not been used shall be reinstated. Further, the
employee is entitled to use accrued unpaid sick time and accrue
additional unpaid sick time at the re-commencement of employment.
(11) When a different employer succeeds or takes the place of an existing
employer, all employees of the original employer who remain employed
by the successor employer are entitled to all paid sick time accrued
when employed by the original employer and are entitled to use all paid
sick leave previously accrued.
(12) At its sole discretion, an Employer may loan paid sick time to an
Employee in advance of accrual by such Employee. A decision by an
Employer to deny a loan request by an Employee shall not subject the
Employer to any liability under this Ordinance.
(1) Paid Sick Time shall be provided to an Employee by an Employer for:
(A) An Employee's mental or physical illness, injury, or health
condition; an Employee's need for medical diagnosis, care, or

or health condition; care of a Family Member who needs medical

(C) Closure of the Employee's place of business by order of a public
official due to a public health emergency or an Employee's need to
care for a child whose school or place of care has been closed by
order of a public official due to a public health emergency, or care
for Family Member when it has been determined by the health
authorities having jurisdiction or by a health care provider that the
Family Member's presence in the community would jeopardize the
health of others because of the Family Member's exposure to a
communicable disease, whether or not the Family Member has
actually contracted the communicable disease.
(2) Nothing in this article prohibits an Employer from requesting that an
Employee confirm in writing following use of Paid Sick Time that the
Paid Sick Time was used for an authorized purpose under this article.
(3) Where the need to use Paid Sick Time is foreseeable, an Employer may
require reasonable advance notice of the intention to use Paid Sick
Time. In no event shall an Employee be required to give notice more
than seven days prior to the date such sick time is to begin. Where such
need is not foreseeable, an Employer may require an Employee to
provide notice of the need for the use of sick time before the beginning
of the Employee's work shift or work day or, in cases such as
emergencies where advance notice is not possible, notice shall be
provided by the Employee as soon as practicable.
(4) An Employer may not require, as a condition of an Employee's taking
Paid Sick Time, that the Employee search for or find a replacement
worker to cover the hours during which the Employee is absent.
(5) Accrued sick time may be used in the smaller of hourly increments or
the smallest increment that the employer's payroll system uses to
account for absences or use of other time.
(6) After an Employee has used Paid Sick Time for 3 consecutive days or 3
consecutive instances, an Employer may require an Employee to
provide reasonable documentation that the time has been used for a
purpose covered by Subsection (1). In this instance, the Employer may
require documentation signed by a health care professional indicating
that the Paid Sick Time was necessary; however, an Employer may not
require that the documentation explain the nature of the illness.
(1) No person shall interfere with, restrain, or deny the exercise of, or the
attempt to exercise, any right protected under this article.
(2) No person shall retaliate against an Employee because the Employee
has properly exercised rights protected under this article.

May 9, 2016]
Any Employer who violates the provisions of this article shall, upon
conviction thereof, be punished by a fine not exceeding $2,000. Each day on

2016-12 § 8, May 9, 2016]
Employers shall allow the Agency reasonable access to records and to
monitor compliance with the requirements of this article. An Employer's
failure to maintain or retain adequate records documenting hours worked
by an Employee and Paid Sick Time taken by an Employee creates a
rebuttable presumption that the Employer has violated this article, absent
clear and convincing evidence otherwise.
(1) All Employers shall give written notice to each Employee at the
commencement of the Employee's employment (or as soon as
practicable if the Employee is already employed on the effective date of
this law) regarding Employee's rights under this article. Such notice
shall describe the right to paid sick time, the accrual rate and the
amount of Paid Sick Time, and the terms of its use under this article; the
right to be free from retaliation for properly requesting use of Paid Sick
Time; and the right to file a complaint or bring an action in municipal
court if paid sick time is denied by the employer or the employee is
retaliated against for requesting or taking paid sick time. Such notice
shall be in English and the primary language spoken by that Employee,
so long as the primary language of that Employee is also the primary
language of at least 10% of the Employer's workforce.
(2) Employers shall also display a poster in a conspicuous and accessible
place in each business establishment where Employees are employed
containing the information required in Subsection (1). The poster shall
be in English and in any language that is the first language of at least
10% of the Employer's workforce.
(3) The Agency can create and make available to Employers notices and
posters in English and Spanish and any other languages deemed
appropriate by the Agency that contain the information required under
Subsection (1) for Employers' use in complying with this section.

(1) The Agency shall coordinate implementation and enforcement of this
article and promulgate appropriate guidelines or regulations for such
purposes.

of violations of this article and impose fines or penalties provided for in
this article, or any further relief deemed appropriate by the court
including but not limited to restitution, reinstatement, injunctive or
declaratory relief.
(5) Submitting a complaint to the Agency is neither a prerequisite nor a bar
to bringing a private action.
(6) The Agency shall have the power to do outreach to inform the residents
of the City of their rights under this article and to publicize online and
in other media the names of Employers who violate this article.
(1) An Employer may not require disclosure of the specific details relating
to an Employee's or an Employee's Family Member's medical condition
as a condition of providing Paid Sick Time under this article. If an
Employer possesses health information about an Employee or
Employee's Family Member, such information shall be treated as
confidential and shall not be disclosed by the Employer except to the
affected Employee or with the permission of the affected Employee.
(2) The Agency shall maintain confidential the identity of any complaining
person unless disclosure of the identity is necessary for resolution of
the investigation. The Agency shall, to the extent practicable, notify a
complaining person that the Agency will be disclosing his or her
identity prior to such disclosure.

Employer from the adoption or retention of a paid sick time policy more
generous than the one required herein.

This Article provides minimum requirements pertaining to Paid Sick Time
and shall not be construed to preempt, limit, or otherwise affect the
applicability of any other law, regulation, requirement, policy, or standard
that provides for greater accrual or use by Employees of sick time, whether
paid or unpaid, or that extends other protections to Employees.
§ 8:5-13. Severability. [MC 2016-08 § 13, March 14, 2016; MC
2016-12 § 13, May 9, 2016]
If any provision of this article or application thereof to any person or
circumstance is judged invalid, the invalidity shall not affect other
provisions or applications of the Article that can be given effect without the
invalid provision or application, and to this end the provisions of this article
are declared severable.
(2) Nothing in this article shall be construed as diminishing the obligation
of an Employer to comply with any contract, collective bargaining
agreement, employment benefit plan, or other agreement providing
more generous paid sick time to an Employee than required herein.
(3) Nothing in this article shall be construed as diminishing the rights of
public Employees regarding paid sick time or use of paid sick time as
provided in the laws of the State of New Jersey pertaining to public
Employees.

secured by S2177, the "New Jersey Security and Financial

resulting from, caused by, arising out of or as a consequence of the
provisions of towing, wrecking, storage and/or emergency services provided
at the request of the City pursuant to this article. This shall include but not
be limited to any liability which may arise from the tower's disposal, storage

certificates thereof satisfactory to the City, shall be furnished thirty (30)
days prior to issuance of license, and on an annual basis thereafter.

protect the public health, safety or welfare, the next rotation tower on
the list shall be called for that particular towing event.
(c) The Police Division may contact the next rotation tower if a response is
not made within twenty (20) minutes of being notified. Failure to
respond within a twenty (20) minute period on three (3) or more

(a) In the event a complaint is received by the City involving the improper
or unsatisfactory performance of services by a rotation tower, a
violation of this article, excessive charges or damage to motor vehicle
while in the custody of the tower, written notice of same shall be
provided by the Chief of Police to the tow operator involved. The tow
operator shall have the opportunity to respond, in writing, within seven
(7) days.
(b) Within fourteen (14) days of receipt of the tow operator's response, or
within twenty-one (21) days of receipt of the complaint, if no response is
received, the matter shall be presented by the Police Chief to the
Director of Public Affairs and Safety. The Director shall, thereafter,
consider the matter and may request that the complainant and the tow
operator appear and give testimony regarding the complaint. If good
cause exists, the Director may file a written request with the Council for
suspension or revocation of the license.
(a) The City Council shall have the right to suspend or revoke any rotation
wrecker license issued, upon written complaint of the Director of Public
Affairs and Safety, and upon determination that there is good cause for
revocation or suspension based upon a violation of this article. Written
notice of such complaint and the basis of the complaint shall be given
upon at least ten (10) days notice to the tow operator, and said operator
shall have an opportunity to be heard.
After considering the matter and the evidence presented, the City
Council shall make its findings and conclusions relative to the
complaint, which shall constitute their decision. If the Council finds in
favor of the complainant and against the rotation tower, the Council
may consider and impose the following penalties:

§ 9:16A-22. Miscellaneous provisions. [MC 2001-27, June 18, 2001]
(4) Such other penalty as the Council deems just and appropriate
under the circumstances. In considering the imposition of a
suspension, revocation or other penalty, the Council shall take into
account factors including, but not limited to, any prior violations of
the tower, the nature and seriousness of the complaint, the danger
to the health, safety and welfare of the public.
(b) Failure to surrender the license upon revocation shall constitute a
violation of this article.
(c) Nothing contained herein shall prevent or limit the right of any person
to commence or maintain an action for damages or any other relief
directly against any rotation tower in a court of competent jurisdiction.
(a) Copies of this article and the schedule of fees that may be charged by

clearly visible to the public, a schedule of the fees that may be charged
for all services provided pursuant to this article.
(c) The City reserves the right to make periodic unannounced inspections
of personnel, vehicles, equipment and storage areas of all rotation
towers.
(d) The relationship between a rotation tower and the City is one of an
independent contractor. Neither party shall be construed in any manner
whatsoever to be an employee of the other, nor shall any employee or
agent furnished by any party be construed to be an employee or agent
of the other party. Inclusion on the rotation tower's list shall not be
construed or considered as a joint venture, partnership, association,
contract of employment or profit sharing agreement.
(e) The City shall not be liable or responsible for compensating the rotation
tower for any of the services performed under this article unless those
services are performed for City vehicles. Compensation shall be the
responsibility of the owner of the towed motor vehicle, and the rotation
tower shall proceed directly against the owner.
(f) The rotation tower shall, at all times, be solely responsible for the
conduct of its employees. No licensee shall discriminate as to hiring or
employment practices. The licensee shall be required to sign a
nondiscrimination statement.

regulations concerning wages, hours and terms of employment.

§ 9:16A-24. Enforcement. [MC 2001-27, June 18, 2001]
The Chief of Police is hereby designated to enforce the provisions of this
article as well as the rules and regulations promulgated hereunder in
accordance with due process of law.
(a) A junk vehicle is defined as a motor vehicle ascertained not to be stolen
and to be one which can be certified for a junk title certificate under
N.J.S.A. 39:6A-3. If the vehicle is unclaimed by the owner or other
person having legal right thereto for a period of (15) fifteen business
days, the tow operator shall notify the Plainfield Police Division, Traffic
Section, that the vehicle has been held for the statutory time and that
the vehicle is ready for auction in a public place.
(b) An abandoned vehicle is defined as a motor vehicle which cannot be
certified for a junk title certificate pursuant to N.J.S.A. 39:10A-3. If the
vehicle is unclaimed by the owner or other person having legal right
thereto for a period of twenty (20) business days, the tow operator shall
notify the Plainfield Police Division, Traffic Section, that the vehicle has
been held for the statutory time and the vehicle is ready for sale.
(c) Proceeds from the sale of junk or abandoned vehicles shall be used to
satisfy any towing or storage charges which may have accumulated on
the vehicle, less a Twenty-Five Dollar ($25.00) administrative fee to
offset the reasonable costs incurred by the City for processing, of
notification, publication and conduct of the auction. Excess auction
proceeds shall be paid to the City of Plainfield. If the auctions proceeds
for a vehicle are insufficient to cover the accumulated costs, due to the
tow operator, the tow operator shall waive such excess, and no further
funds shall be due from the City or the purchaser of the vehicle. This
waiver does not apply to the owner or other persons entitled to the
vehicle that shall remain liable for the tow operators' bill.
(d) This section governing disposition of unclaimed vehicles will be
administered in accordance with N.J.S.A. 39:10A-1 et seq.
(e) Pursuant to N.J.S.A. 39:10A-1 on the possession of a motor vehicle
found abandoned, the possession shall be reported immediately by the
Police Division to: (1) Director of the Division of Motor Vehicles on a
prescribed form, for verification and (2) the National Automobile Theft
Bureau.

The terms used in this Code of Ethics are hereby defined as follows:
(a) The public judges its government by the way public officials and
employees conduct themselves in the posts to which they are elected or
appointed.
(b) The people have a right to expect that every public official and
employee will conduct himself in a manner that will tend to preserve
public confidence in and respect for the government he represents.
(c) Such confidence and respect can best be promoted if every public
official and employee, whether paid or unpaid, and whether elected or
appointed, will uniformly:
(1) Treat all citizens with courtesy, impartiality, fairness and equality
under the law; and,
(2) Avoid both actual and potential conflicts between their private selfinterest
and the public interest.
(d) To help public officials and employees achieve these goals is one of the
objectives of the Code of Ethics.
(e) The otter objective is based on the proposition that no man can serve
two masters, nor should he attempt to do so. Therefore, this Code of
Ethics proposes to relieve him of the impossible task of judging himself.
Instead, under the provisions of the Charter, this Code places judgment
in the hands of the Council which will review the facts and measure
them by the yardstick of public morality established by this Code.
(a) Financial interest. Any interest which shall yield, directly or indirectly, a
monetary or other material benefit (other than the duly authorized
salary or compensation for his services to the City) to the official or
employee or to any person employing or retaining the services of the
official or employee.
(b) Official or employee. Any person elected or appointed to, or employed
or retained by, any public office or public body of the municipality
whether paid or unpaid and whether part-time or full-time.
(c) Personal interest. Any interest arising from blood or marriage
relationships or from close business or political association whether or
not any financial interest is involved.

1:713
§ 11:18-6. Minority and female employment obligations. [MC
1981-15, § 1, September 8, 1981]
When hiring workers in each construction trade, the contractor or
subcontractor will make every good faith effort to meet the goal for
utilization of minority and female employees in the performance of his/her
construction contract as established by N.J.A.C. 16:27-5.2. However, in no
event shall said goals, for each project, be less than twenty (20) percent,
with the exception of the classification of laborers where the goal shall be
not less than fifty (50) percent.
§ 11:18-7. Minority and female owned business participation policy.
[MC 1981-15, § 1, September 8, 1981]
It shall be the policy of the City of Plainfield that minority and female owned
businesses receive a "fair share" of all construction projects covered under
the language, terms and conditions of this ordinance. Contractors and
subcontractors designated to perform in city projects, will to the maximum
extent possible, procure, purchase, and obtain materials, supplies and
services from minorities and female suppliers that meet the qualifying
terms of this ordinance.
(a) It shall be understood that the contractor in complying with this
ordinance, will attempt to fill his/her goal from among Plainfield
residents first. If the minority and/or female employment goals cannot
be satisfied from among Plainfield residents, the contractor or
subcontractor shall immediately contact the City's Affirmative Action
Compliance Office. The Affirmative Action Compliance Officer, in
appropriate cases, will assist the contractor and/or subcontractor in
seeking minority and female applicants from Union County and then the
regional jurisdiction if need be.
(b) The contractor, in hiring for each job, shall make every effort to employ
persons residing within the geographical jurisdiction of the appropriate
union in order to insure that minorities and females employed on the
project will be brought into the permanent construction industry's area
labor force.
(c) The contractor will submit with his/her bid, anticipated goals for the
utilization of minority and female journeymen in the trades, and
laborers specified above in the performance of contract, together with a
projected manpower utilization program. These goals are to be
expressed in terms of man-hours to be worked by minority and female
journeymen and laborers during the performance of the contract and
must be substantially uniform throughout the duration of the contract.
(a) In accordance with the terms and conditions of this ordinance the City
shall award construction contracts to the lowest responsible bidder. In
order to meet the criterion of being a "responsible bidder", the general
contractor, if any part of the contract is subcontracted, must utilize
minority or female subcontractors to the extent of no less than twenty-
§ 11:18-6 § 11:18-7
1:714
five (25) percent of the total contract amount. A bidder that does not
meet this minimum level of twenty-five (25) percent minority or female
participation shall not be considered as a responsible bidder.
(b) Within ten (10) working days after the contract is executed, the
contractor shall provide a report of responses, proposals, and bids,
including the dollar amount of goods and services purchased from
minority or female owned businesses as well as the dollar amount of
goods and services purchased from non-minority or female owned
suppliers. The report shall specify the action taken by the prime
contractor in response to the proposals or bids received from minority
or female owned firms and/or joint ventures between minority or female
owned businesses. In all cases, wherein the contractor is obligated to
enter into negotiations in "good faith". In cases where proposals or bids
from minority and/or female suppliers are rejected, such rejections
shall require a written statement from the prime contractor, justifying
such rejection.
(c) The City further recognizes that in "highly specialized" craft areas there
may not be sufficient minority or female contractors or subcontractors
to participate at the level specified in this policy. In such cases, and
upon verification of its Compliance Officer, the City at its discretion may
determine not to require the provisions of this policy as a part of the
contract specification.
(d) In order to protect the financial integrity of all subcontractors, the City,
before making any payment hereinunder, may require the general
contractor to furnish releases or receipts from any or all persons
performing work and supplying materials or services, if such action is
deemed necessary to protect the City's interest.
(e) No contractor or subcontractor can be held as "being not in
compliance" if minority and/or female crafts persons are not available
to fulfill the affirmative action requirements either in the appropriate
unions or by referral. In such cases, however, the City shall consider the
contractor or subcontractor to be operating under a state of
"conditional compliance". Under such state, the contractor or
subcontractor is obligated to strive for a state of full compliance at the
earliest date possible. Failure on the part of either party to put forth "a
good faith effort" to locate minorities and/or females, and upon
substantial proof of the availability of same, the City may move to evoke
the punishment herein listed for violations of this policy.
(f) Notwithstanding the recognition of overt attempts on the part of a
contractor and/or subcontractor to disqualify a minority or female
subcontractor or supplier without substantial proof of nonqualification,
there shall be nothing implied or intended in this language to suggest
that a contractor or subcontractor would jeopardize the quality of the
work on a project by employing unqualified minorities and/or females or
purchasing inferior goods and services from minority and/or female
businesses. The City of Plainfield shall hold the contractor and/or

1981-15, § 1, September 8, 1981]
The contracting parties shall agree that nothing contained in this document
is intended to preclude the contractor or subcontractor from complying with
the hiring hall provisions in any applicable collective bargaining agreement
or hiring hall arrangement; except where the practices of a union or
apprenticeship program will result in the exclusion of minority and female
persons or the failure to refer minority group persons and females
consistent with the county employment goals.

projects up to, and within the limits of the law.
(g) To further the intent of this ordinance and to fully comply with N.J.S.A.

"responsible bidder", the responsibility of such bidder, in addition to
giving satisfactory proof of his/her ability to furnish the requisite
materials and perform the work properly, the bidder shall give
satisfactory proof of the quality of his affirmative action plan and the
City in awarding the contract shall take into consideration not only the
lowest bid and the ability of the bidder, but also the quality of the
affirmative action plan of the bidder as evidence by past performance,
documentation, and present plan.
(a) The contractor or subcontractor shall inform the City's Affirmative
Action Compliance Officer immediately of any activities that impedes
his/her efforts to comply with the terms and conditions of this
document.
The contractor and/or subcontractor will consider for employment
minorities and females who meet the qualifications for journeymen
and/or laborers that are recommended by the City's Affirmative Action
Compliance Office. If the contractor or subcontractor fails to employ
persons referred, then he/she shall submit a written explanation of his/
her failure to employ such persons within twenty four (24) hours of such
referral to the City's Compliance Officer.
(b) A contractor or subcontractor shall not be deemed to have exercised
"good faith" under this ordinance, if he/she fails to pursue the goals
expressed in this ordinance solely because of union opposition even if
the union threatens a work stoppage because of the implementation of
the terms and conditions of this ordinance. It shall be the position of the
City of Plainfield that the contractor as the "principal employer" is
responsible for the treatment of all referrals in accordance with the
terms and conditions of this ordinance.

the apparent low bidder shall be required to attend a pre-award conference
called by the appropriate department head. At that conference the City's
Compliance Officer is responsible for certifying that the apparent low,
responsible bidder has satisfied all of the terms and conditions of this
ordinance as set forth in the articles herein contained.

before the full Commission.
(a) The contractor must submit at the time of this conference the
contractor's and subcontractor's weekly payroll records for all crafts
covered under the contract provisions. In addition, a monthly
cumulative summary of the project man-hours must be provided on a
craft-by-craft basis and identified as to minority/female or non-minority
or non-female status. No contract shall be awarded without these
conditions being met, unless the contractor and/or subcontractor
submits valid reasons for non compliance. In such cases, the City's
Compliance Officer and the appropriate department head shall set a
time limit for compliance, not to exceed five (5) days.
(a) At the discretion of the Construction Compliance Committee, one
member or the full committee may accompany the Compliance Officer
on project site visits, pre-bid conferences, and project site meetings

Affirmative Action Compliance Officer shall provide forms or prescribe
forms for monthly project manning reports. Each project manning
report shall identify the estimated employment requirements, by trade
or craft, of the construction contractor and subcontractor for the
duration of the construction project work by each contractor and
subcontractor. The City's Affirmative Action Office, construction
contractors and subcontractors shall use these reports which shall be
submitted by the contractor in accordance with N.J.A.C. 17:27-7.6, to
monitor compliance with the requirements of this policy.
(a) The Affirmative Action Compliance Officer shall issue a written alert
notice to a contractor and/or appropriate unions, whenever, in the
Compliance Officer's opinion the contractor/subcontractor has violated
the terms and/or conditions of this ordinance. If the alert notice is not

the time specified, the Compliance Officer shall follow-up the alert
notice by issuing a written "violation notice". Upon issuance of such
notice the contractor/subcontractor will have five (5) working days to
remove the violation(s). If the violations have not been removed within
that period, the Human Relations Commission will so notify the City
Administrator and recommend the appropriate action. The City
Administrator may issue, thereafter, an order for withholding of

§ 12:8-1. Scope and purpose. [MC 2007-05, § 1, August 22, 2007]
(a) Policy statement. Flood control, groundwater recharge, and pollutant
reduction through nonstructural or low impact techniques shall be
explored before relying on structural BMPs. Structural BMPs should be
integrated with nonstructural stormwater management strategies and
proper maintenance plans. Nonstructural strategies include both
environmentally sensitive site design and source controls that prevent
pollutants from being placed on the site or from being exposed to
stormwater. Source control plans should be developed based upon
physical site conditions and the origin, nature, and the anticipated
quantity or amount of potential pollutants. Multiple stormwater
management BMPs may be necessary to achieve the established
performance standards for water quality, quantity, and groundwater
recharge.
(b) Purpose. It is the purpose of this article to establish minimum
stormwater management requirements and controls for "major
development," as defined in Section 12:8-2.
(c) Applicability.
(1) This article shall be applicable to all site plans and subdivisions for
the following major developments that require preliminary or final
site plan or subdivision review:
(A) Nonresidential major developments; and
(B) Aspects of residential major developments that are not
preempted by the Residential Site Improvement Standards at
N.J.A.C. 5:21.
(2) This article shall also be applicable to all major developments
undertaken by the City of Plainfield.
(d) Compatibility with other permit and ordinance requirements.
Development approvals issued for subdivisions and site plans pursuant
to this article are to be considered an integral part of development
approvals under the subdivision and site plan review process and do not
relieve the applicant of the responsibility to secure required permits or
approvals for activities regulated by any other applicable code, rule,
act, or ordinance. In their interpretation and application, the provisions
of this article shall be held to be the minimum requirements for
promotion of the public health, safety, and general welfare. This article
is not intended to interfere with, abrogate, or annul any other
ordinances, rule or regulation, statute, or other provision of law except
that, where any provision of this article imposes restrictions different
from those imposed by any other ordinance, rule or regulation, or other

through the use of nonstructural and structural stormwater
management strategies and measures, the option selected
complies with the requirements of Section 12:8-4(f) and (g) to the
maximum extent practicable;
(3) The applicant demonstrates that, in order to meet the requirements
of Section 12:8-4(f) and (g), existing structures currently in use,
such as homes and buildings, would need to be condemned; and
(4) The applicant demonstrates that it does not own or have other
rights to areas, including the potential to obtain through
condemnation lands not falling under subsection (d)(3) above
within the upstream drainage area of the receiving stream, that
would provide additional opportunities to mitigate the
requirements of Section 12:8-4(f) and (g) that were not achievable
on site.

(1) To the maximum extent practicable, the standards in Section
12:8-4(f) and (g) shall be met by incorporating nonstructural
stormwater management strategies set forth at Section 12:8-4(e)
into the design. The applicant shall identify the nonstructural
measures incorporated into the design of the project. If the
applicant contends that it is not feasible for engineering,
environmental, or safety reasons to incorporate any nonstructural
stormwater management measures identified in subsection (e)(2)

specified in Section 12:8-4(g)(1);
§ 12:8-4 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 12:8-4
1:763
(iv) Where the New Jersey Department of Environmental
Protection determines, pursuant to the New Jersey
Register of Historic Places Rules at N.J.A.C. 7:4-7.2(c), that
action to meet this standard is an undertaking that
constitutes an encroachment or will damage or destroy the
New Jersey Register listed historic property.
(4) Any land area used as a nonstructural stormwater management
measure to meet the performance standards in Section 12:8-4(f)
and (g) shall be dedicated to a government agency, subjected to a
conservation restriction filed with the appropriate County Clerk's
office, or subject to an approved equivalent restriction that ensures
that measure or an equivalent stormwater management measure
approved by the reviewing agency is maintained in perpetuity.
(5) Guidance for nonstructural stormwater management strategies is
available in the New Jersey Stormwater Best Management
Practices Manual. The BMP Manual may be obtained from the

standards to control erosion, encourage and control infiltration and
groundwater recharge, and control stormwater runoff quantity
impacts of major development.
(A) The minimum design and performance standards for erosion
control are those established under the Soil Erosion and
Sediment Control Act, N.J.S.A. 4:24-39 et seq. and
implementing rules.
(B) The minimum design and performance standards for
groundwater recharge are as follows:
(i) The design engineer shall, using the assumptions and
factors for stormwater runoff and groundwater recharge
calculations at Section 12:4-5, either:
[a] Demonstrate through hydrologic and hydraulic
analysis that the site and its stormwater management
measures maintain one hundred percent (100%) of the
average annual preconstruction groundwater
recharge volume for the site; or
[b] Demonstrate through hydrologic and hydraulic
analysis that the increase of stormwater runoff volume
from preconstruction to post-construction for the
2-year storm is infiltrated.
§ 12:8-4 § 12:8-4
1:764
(ii) This groundwater recharge requirement does not apply to
projects within the "urban redevelopment area," or to
projects subject to paragraph (iii) below.
(iii) The following types of stormwater shall not be recharged:
[a] Stormwater from areas of high pollutant loading. High
pollutant loading areas are areas in industrial and
commercial developments where solvents and/or
petroleum products are loaded/unloaded, stored, or
applied, areas where pesticides are loaded/unloaded
or stored; areas where hazardous materials are
expected to be present in greater than "reportable
quantities" as defined by the United States
Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) at 40 CFR
302.4; areas where recharge would be inconsistent
with Department approved remedial action work plan
or landfill closure plan and areas with high risks for
spills of toxic materials, such as gas stations and
vehicle maintenance facilities; and
[b] Industrial stormwater exposed to "source material."
"Source material" means any material(s) or
machinery, located at an industrial facility, that is
directly or indirectly related to process,
manufacturing or other industrial activities, which
could be a source of pollutants in any industrial
stormwater discharge to groundwater. Source
materials include, but are not limited to, raw
materials; intermediate products; final products;
waste materials; by-products; industrial machinery
and fuels, and lubricants, solvents, and detergents
that are related to process, manufacturing, or other
industrial activities that are exposed to stormwater.
(iv) The design engineer shall assess the hydraulic impact on
the groundwater table and design the site so as to avoid
adverse hydraulic impacts. Potential adverse hydraulic
impacts include, but are not limited to, exacerbating a
naturally or seasonally high water table so as to cause
surficial ponding, flooding of basements, or interference
with the proper operation of subsurface sewage disposal
systems and other subsurface structures in the vicinity or
downgradient of the groundwater recharge area.
(C) In order to control stormwater runoff quantity impacts, the
design engineer shall, using the assumptions and factors for
stormwater runoff calculations at Section 12:8-5, complete one
(1) of the following:

(i) Demonstrate through hydrologic and hydraulic analysis
that for stormwater leaving the site, post-construction
runoff hydrographs for the 2-, 10-, and 100-year storm
events do not exceed, at any point in time, the
preconstruction runoff hydrographs for the same storm
events;
(ii) Demonstrate through hydrologic and hydraulic analysis
that there is no increase, as compared to the
preconstruction condition, in the peak runoff rates of
stormwater leaving the site for the 2-, 10-, and 100-year
storm events and that the increased volume or change in
timing of stormwater runoff will not increase flood damage
at or downstream of the site. This analysis shall include the
analysis of impacts of existing land uses and projected
land uses assuming full development under existing zoning
and land use ordinances in the drainage area;
(iii) Design stormwater management measures so that the
post-construction peak runoff rates for the 2-, 10-, and
100-year storm events are 50, 75 and 80 percent,
respectively, of the preconstruction peak runoff rates. The
percentages apply only to the post-construction
stormwater runoff that is attributable to the portion of the
site on which the proposed development or project is to be
constructed. The percentages shall not be applied to postconstruction
stormwater runoff into tidal flood hazard
areas if the increased volume of stormwater runoff will not
increase flood damages below the point of discharge; or
(iv) In tidal flood hazard areas, stormwater runoff quantity
analysis in accordance with paragraphs (i), (ii) and (iii)
above shall only be applied if the increased volume of
stormwater runoff could increase flood damages below the
point of discharge.
(2) Any application for a new agricultural development that meets the
definition of major development at Section 12:8-2 shall be
submitted to the appropriate Soil Conservation District for review
and approval in accordance with the requirements of this section
and any applicable Soil Conservation District guidelines for
stormwater runoff quantity and erosion control. For the purposes of
this section, "agricultural development" means land uses normally
associated with the production of food, fiber and livestock for sale.
Such uses do not include the development of land for the
processing or sale of food and the manufacturing of agriculturally
related products.
(g) Stormwater runoff quality standards.
§ 12:8-4 § 12:8-4
1:766
(1) Stormwater management measures shall be designed to reduce the
post-construction load of total suspended solids (TSS) in
stormwater runoff by eighty percent (80%) of the anticipated load
from the developed site, expressed as an annual average.
Stormwater management measures shall only be required for
water quality control if an additional one-quarter (1/4) acre of
impervious surface is being proposed on a development site. The
requirement to reduce TSS does not apply to any stormwater runoff
in a discharge regulated under a numeric effluent limitation for
TSS imposed under the New Jersey Pollution Discharge Elimination
System (NJPDES) rules, N.J.A.C. 7:14A, or in a discharge
specifically exempt under a NJPDES permit from this requirement.
The water quality design storm is one and one-quarter (1.25)
inches of rainfall in two (2) hours. Water quality calculations shall
take into account the distribution of rain from the water quality
design storm, as reflected in Table 1. The calculation of the volume
of runoff may take into account the implementation of
nonstructural and structural stormwater management measures.

(2) For purposes of TSS reduction calculations, Table 2 below presents
the presumed removal rates for certain BMPs designed in
accordance with the New Jersey Stormwater Best Management
Practices Manual. The BMP Manual may be obtained from the
address identified in Section 12:8-7, or found on the Department's
website at www.njstormwater.org. The BMP Manual and other
sources of technical guidance are listed in Section 12:8-7. TSS
§ 12:8-4 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 12:8-4
1:767
reduction shall be calculated based on the removal rates for the
BMPs in Table 2 below. Alternative removal rates and methods
of calculating removal rates may be used if the design engineer
provides documentation demonstrating the capability of these
alternative rates and methods to the review agency. A copy of any
approved alternative rate or method of calculating the removal
rate shall be provided to the Department at the following address:
Division of Watershed Management, New Jersey Department of
Environmental Protection, PO Box 418, Trenton, New Jersey,
08625-0418.
(3) If more than one (1) BMP in series is necessary to achieve the
required eighty percent (80%) TSS reduction for a site, the
applicant shall utilize the following formula to calculate TSS
reduction:
R = A + B — (AxB)/100
Where
R = Total TSS percent load removal from application of
both BMPs, and
A = The TSS percent removal rate applicable to the first
BMP
B = The TSS percent removal rate applicable to the
second BMP

percent (80%) TSS removal rate shall apply to each drainage area,
unless the runoff from the subareas converge on site in which case
the removal rate can be demonstrated through a calculation using
a weighted average.
§ 12:8-4 § 12:8-4
1:768
(5) Stormwater management measures shall also be designed to
reduce, to the maximum extent feasible, the post-construction
nutrient load of the anticipated load from the developed site in
stormwater runoff generated from the water quality design storm.
In achieving reduction of nutrients to the maximum extent feasible,
the design of the site shall include nonstructural strategies and
structural measures that optimize nutrient removal while still
achieving the performance standards in Section 12:8-4(f) and (g).
(6) Additional information and examples are contained in the New
Jersey Stormwater Best Management Practices Manual, which may
be obtained from the address identified in Section 12-8.7.
(7) In accordance with the definition of FW1 at N.J.A.C. 7:9B-1.4,
stormwater management measures shall be designed to prevent
any increase in stormwater runoff to waters classified as FW1.
(8) Special water resource protection areas shall be established along
all waters designated Category One at N.J.A.C. 7:9B, and perennial
or intermittent streams that drain into or upstream of the Category
One waters as shown on the USGS Quadrangle Maps or in the
County Soil Surveys, within the associated HUC14 drainage area.
These areas shall be established for the protection of water quality,
aesthetic value, exceptional ecological significance, exceptional
recreational significance, exceptional water supply significance,
and exceptional fisheries significance of those established Category
One waters. These areas shall be designated and protected as
follows:
(A) The applicant shall preserve and maintain a special water
resource protection area in accordance with one (1) of the
following:
(i) A 300-foot special water resource protection area shall be
provided on each side of the waterway, measured
perpendicular to the waterway from the top of the bank
outwards or from the center line of the waterway where
the bank is not defined, consisting of existing vegetation or
vegetation allowed to follow natural succession is
provided.
(ii) Encroachment within the designated special water
resource protection area under paragraph (i) above shall
only be allowed where previous development or
disturbance has occurred (for example, active agricultural
use, parking area or maintained lawn area). The
encroachment shall only be allowed where applicant
demonstrates that the functional value and overall
condition of the special water resource protection area will
be maintained to the maximum extent practicable. In no
case shall the remaining special water resource protection
§ 12:8-4 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 12:8-4
1:769
area be reduced to less than one hundred fifty (150) feet
as measured perpendicular to the top of bank of the
waterway or center line of the waterway where the bank
is undefined. All encroachments proposed under this
subparagraph shall be subject to review and approval by
the Department.
(B) All stormwater shall be discharged outside of and flow through
the special water resource protection area and shall comply
with the Standard for Off-Site Stability in the "Standards for
Soil Erosion and Sediment Control in New Jersey," established
under the Soil Erosion and Sediment Control Act, N.J.S.A.
4:24-39 et seq.
(C) If stormwater discharged outside of and flowing through the
special water resource protection area cannot comply with the
Standard for Off-Site Stability in the "Standards for Soil
Erosion and Sediment Control in New Jersey," established
under the Soil Erosion and Sediment Control Act, N.J.S.A.
4:24-39 et seq., then the stabilization measures in accordance
with the requirements of the above standards may be placed
within the special water resource protection area, provided
that:
(i) Stabilization measures shall not be placed within one
hundred fifty (150) feet of the Category One waterway;
(ii) Stormwater associated with discharges allowed by this
section shall achieve a ninety-five percent (95%) TSS postconstruction
removal rate;
(iii) Temperature shall be addressed to ensure no impact on
the receiving waterway;
(iv) The encroachment shall only be allowed where the
applicant demonstrates that the functional value and
overall condition of the special water resource protection
area will be maintained to the maximum extent
practicable;
(v) A conceptual project design meeting shall be held with the
appropriate Department staff and Soil Conservation
District staff to identify necessary stabilization measures;
and
(vi) All encroachments proposed under this section shall be
subject to review and approval by the Department.
(D) A stream corridor protection plan may be developed by a
regional stormwater management planning committee as an
element of a regional stormwater management plan, or by a
municipality through an adopted municipal stormwater
§ 12:8-4 § 12:8-4
1:770
§ 12:8-5. Calculation of stormwater runoff and groundwater
recharge. [MC 2007-05, § 5, August 22, 2007]
management plan. If a stream corridor protection plan for a
waterway subject to Section 12:8-4(g)(8) has been approved
by the Department of Environmental Protection, then the
provisions of the plan shall be the applicable special water
resource protection area requirements for that waterway. A
stream corridor protection plan for a waterway subject to
subsection (g)(8) shall maintain or enhance the current
functional value and overall condition of the special water
resource protection area as defined in subsection (g)(8)(A)(i)
above. In no case shall a stream corridor protection plan allow
the reduction of the Special Water Resource Protection Area
to less than one hundred fifty (150) feet as measured
perpendicular to the waterway subject to this subsection.
(E) Subsection (g)(8) does not apply to the construction of one (1)
individual single-family dwelling that is not part of a larger
development on a lot receiving preliminary or final subdivision
approval on or before February 2, 2004, provided that the
construction begins on or before February 2, 2009.
(a) Stormwater runoff shall be calculated in accordance with the following:
(1) The design engineer shall calculate runoff using one (1) of the
following methods:
(A) The USDA Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS)
methodology, including the NRCS runoff equation and
dimensionless unit hydrograph, as described in the NRCS
National Engineering Handbook Section 4 — Hydrology And
Technical Release 55 — Urban Hydrology for Small
Watersheds; or
(B) The Rational Method for peak flow and the Modified Rational
Method for hydrograph computations.
(2) For the purpose of calculating runoff coefficients and groundwater
recharge, there is a presumption that the preconstruction condition
of a site or portion thereof is a wooded land use with good
hydrologic condition. The term "runoff coefficient" applies to both
the NRCS methodology at Section 12:8-5(a)(1)(A) and the Rational
and Modified Rational Methods at Section 12:8-5(a)(1)(B). A runoff
coefficient or a groundwater recharge land cover for an existing
condition may be used on all or a portion of the site if the design
engineer verifies that the hydrologic condition has existed on the
site or portion of the site for at least five (5) years without
interruption prior to the time of application. If more than one (1)
land cover have existed on the site during the five (5) years
immediately prior to the time of application, the land cover with the
§ 12:8-4 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 12:8-5
1:771
§ 12:8-6. Standards for structural stormwater management
measures. [MC 2007-05, § 6, August 22, 2007]
lowest runoff potential shall be used for the computations. In
addition, there is the presumption that the site is in good
hydrologic condition (if the land use type is pasture, lawn, or park),
with good cover (if the land use type is woods), or with good
hydrologic condition and conservation treatment (if the land use
type is cultivation).
(3) In computing preconstruction stormwater runoff, the design
engineer shall account for all significant land features and
structures, such as ponds, wetlands, depressions, hedgerows, or
culverts, that may reduce preconstruction stormwater runoff rates
and volumes.
(4) In computing stormwater runoff from all design storms, the design
engineer shall consider the relative stormwater runoff rates and/or
volumes of pervious and impervious surfaces separately to
accurately compute the rates and volume of stormwater runoff
from the site. To calculate runoff from unconnected impervious
cover, urban impervious area modifications as described in the
NRCS Technical Release 55 – Urban Hydrology for Small
Watersheds and other methods may be employed.
(5) If the invert of the outlet structure of a stormwater management
measure is below the flood hazard design flood elevation as defined
at N.J.A.C. 7:13, the design engineer shall take into account the
effects of tailwater in the design of structural stormwater
management measures.
(b) Groundwater recharge may be calculated in accordance with the
following:
(1) The New Jersey Geological Survey Report GSR-32 A Method for
Evaluating Ground-Water Recharge Areas in New Jersey,
incorporated herein by reference as amended and supplemented.

permeability and texture; drainage area and drainage patterns; and
the presence of solution-prone carbonate rocks (limestone).
(2) Structural stormwater management measures shall be designed to
minimize maintenance, facilitate maintenance and repairs, and
ensure proper functioning. Trash racks shall be installed at the
intake to the outlet structure as appropriate, and shall have parallel
bars with one (1) inch spacing between the bars to the elevation of
the water quality design storm. For elevations higher than the
water quality design storm, the parallel bars at the outlet structure
shall be spaced no greater than one-third (1/3) the width of the
diameter of the orifice or one-third (1/3) the width of the weir, with
a minimum spacing between bars of one (1) inch and a maximum
spacing between bars of six (6) inches. In addition, the design of
trash racks must comply with the requirements of Section
12:8-8(b).
(3) Structural stormwater management measures shall be designed,
constructed, and installed to be strong, durable, and corrosion
resistant. Measures that are consistent with the relevant portions
of the Residential Site Improvement Standards at N.J.A.C. 5:21-7.3,
7.4, and 7.5 shall be deemed to meet this requirement.
(4) At the intake to the outlet from the stormwater management basin,
the orifice size shall be a minimum of two and one-half (2 1/2)
inches in diameter.
(5) Stormwater management basins shall be designed to meet the
minimum safety standards for stormwater management basins at

engineer demonstrates that the proposed measure and its design will
accomplish the required water quantity, groundwater recharge and
water quality design and performance standards established by Section
12:8-4 of this article.
(c) Manufactured treatment devices may be used to meet the requirements
of Section 12:8-4 of this article, provided the pollutant removal rates
are verified by the New Jersey Corporation for Advanced Technology
and certified by the Department.

such reports to the Boards as may be required.
In accordance with the above enforcement powers, the Zoning Officer, upon
becoming aware of a violation of this chapter, is to forward a letter to the
owner of the property upon which the violation has been found to exist
and request immediate compliance with this chapter, or the halting of the
construction activity, within ten (10) days of the date of the letter. If no, or
an inadequate, response is received from the property owner within that
time, the Zoning Officer is to forward a certified letter to the property owner

noncompliance is deemed an additional offense subject to the reissuance
of a separate summons. This procedure does not, in any way, restrict the

any time and seek immediate resolution of the matter if a determination is

When a structure or improvement requires immediate repair to preserve
the continued habitability of the structure and/or the health and safety of its
occupants or others, emergency repairs may be performed in accordance
with City Codes, without first obtaining a Certificate of Appropriateness.
Under such circumstances, the repairs performed shall be only such as are
necessary to protect the health and safety of the occupants of the structure
or others and/or to maintain the habitability of the structure. A request
for the Commission's review shall be made simultaneously with the onset
of emergency work. Such emergency work shall be permitted only if the
Construction Official certifies to the administrative officer the immediate
necessity for such permit issuance. Upon notice by the administrative
officer to the full Historic Preservation Commission by telephone, personal
contact or other appropriate means of communication, at least three (3)
members of the Commission shall convene as soon as possible and such
convening members shall proceed to review the Certificate of
Appropriateness application as provided in this chapter. Subsequent to such
review, a Certificate of Appropriateness may be issued upon a majority vote
of the members convened.

Official Map
§ 17:6-1. Establishment. [MC 2002-29 § 17:6-1, December 2, 2002]
The City Council may by ordinance adopt or amend an official map of the
City which shall reflect the appropriate provisions of the City of Plainfield,
which shall reflect appropriate provisions of the City's master plan,
provided that the City Council may adopt an official map or an amendment
or revision thereto which, in whole or in part, is inconsistent with the
appropriate designations in the sub-plan elements of the master plan, but
only by the affirmative vote of a majority of its full authorized membership
with the reasons for so acting recorded in the minutes when adopting the
official map. Prior to the hearing on the adoption of any official map or any
amendment thereto, the City Council shall refer the proposed official map
or amendment to the Planning Board pursuant to N.J.S.A. 40:55D-1 et seq.
The official map shall be deemed conclusive with respect to the location and
width of streets and public drainage ways and the location and extent of
flood control basins and public areas, whether or not such streets, ways,
basins or areas are improved or unimproved or are in actual physical
existence. Upon receiving an application for development, the City may
reserve for future public use, the aforesaid streets, ways, basins, and areas
in the manner provided in N.J.S.A. 40:55D-1 et seq.
§ 17:6-2. Change or addition to Map. [MC 2002-29 § 17:6-2,
December 2, 2002]

than as contained in this article of the layout, widening, changing the course
of or closing of any street or the widening or changing the course of any
public drainage way or changing the boundaries of a flood control basin or
public area, shall be subject to relevant provisions of N.J.S.A. 40:55D-1 et
seq.
§ 17:6-3. Issuance of permits for structures. [MC 2002-29 § 17:6-3,
December 2, 2002]
For purpose of preserving the integrity of the official map of the City, no
permit shall be issued for any building or structure in the bed of any street
or public drainage way, flood control basin or public area reserved pursuant
to N.J.S.A. 40:55D-32 et seq. as shown on the official map, or shown on
a plat filed pursuant to this chapter before adoption of the official map,
except as herein provided. Whenever one or more parcels of land, upon
which is located the bed of such a mapped street or public drainage way,
flood control basin or public area reserved pursuant to N.J.S.A. 40:55D-32
cannot yield a reasonable return to the owner unless a building permit is
granted, the Board of Adjustment may, in a specific case, by an affirmative
vote of a majority of the full authorized membership of the Board, direct
the issuance of a permit for a structure in the bed of such mapped street or
§ 17:6-1 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 17:6-3
1:1071
public drainage way or flood control basin or public area reserved pursuant
to N.J.S.A. 40:55D-32 which will as little as practicable increase the cost
of opening such street, or tend to cause a minimum change of the official
map and the City shall impose reasonable requirements as a condition of
granting the permit so as to promote the health, morals, safety and general
welfare of the public.
The Board of Adjustment shall not exercise the power otherwise granted by
this section if the proposed development requires approval by the Planning
Board of a subdivision or site plan in conjunction with which the Planning
Board has power to direct the issuance of a permit pursuant to N.J.S.A.
40:55D-60.
§ 17:6-4. Building lot to abut street. [MC 2002-29 § 17:6-4,
December 2, 2002]
No permit for the erection of any structure shall be issued unless the lot
abuts a street giving access to such proposed structure. Such street shall
have been duly placed on the official map or shall be:
§ 17:6-5. Appeals. [MC 2002-29 § 17:6-5, December 2, 2002]
Where the enforcement of the above section hereof would entail practical
difficulty or unnecessary hardship, or where the circumstances of the case
do not require the structure to be related to a street, the Board of
Adjustment may upon application or appeal, vary the application of the
above section hereof and direct the issuance of a permit subject to
conditions that will provide adequate access for firefighting equipment,
ambulances and other emergency vehicles necessary for the protection of
health and safety and that will protect any future street layout shown on the
official map or on a general circulation plan element of the City's master
plan.
The application process identified in Article VIII of this chapter shall apply
to applications or appeals pursuant to this article.
A. An existing State, County or municipal street or highway; or
B. A street shown upon a plat approved by the Planning Board; or
C. A street on a plat duly filed in the office of the County Recording Officer
prior to the passage of an ordinance under this act or any prior law
which required prior approval of plats by the City Council or other
authorized body.
Before any such permit shall be issued, such street shall have been
certified to be suitably improved to the satisfaction of the City Council,
or such suitable improvements shall have been assured by means of
a performance guarantee, in accordance with standards and
specifications for road improvements approved by the City Council, as
adequate in respect to the public health, safety and general welfare of
the special circumstance of the particular street.
§ 17:6-3 § 17:6-5
1:1072
The Board of Adjustment shall not exercise the power otherwise granted by
this section if the proposed development requires approval by the Planning
Board of a subdivision, site plan or conditional use in conjunction with
which the Planning Board has power to direct the issuance of a permit
pursuant to N.J.S.A. 40:55D-60.

§ 17:7-2. Adoption of capital improvement program. [MC 2002-29
§ 17:7-2, December 2, 2002]
Whenever the Planning Board has prepared a capital improvement program
pursuant to the above section, it shall recommend such program to the City
Council. The City Council may adopt such program with any modification
A. The City Council may authorize the Planning Board from time to time to
prepare a program of municipal capital improvement projects projected
over a term of six (6) years, and amendments thereto. Such program
may encompass major projects being currently undertaken or future
projects to be undertaken, with Federal, State, County and other public
funds or under Federal, State or County supervision.
1. The first year of such program shall, upon adoption by the City
Council, constitute the capital budget of the City as required by
N.J.S.A. 40A:4-43 et seq. The program shall classify projects in
regard to the urgency and need for realization, and shall
recommend a time sequence for their implementation. The
program may also contain the estimated cost of each project and
indicate probable operating and maintenance costs, the source and
amount of probable revenues, if any, as well as existing sources of
funds or the need for additional sources and amounts of funds for
the implementation and operation of each project. The program
shall, as far as possible, be based on existing information in the
possession of the departments and agencies of the City and shall
take into account public facility needs indicated by the prospective
development shown in the master plan of the City as permitted by
other municipal land use controls.
2. In preparing the program, the Planning Board shall confer, in a
manner deemed appropriate by the Board, with the Mayor, the
Chief Fiscal Officer, other municipal officials and agencies, and the
school Board or other appropriate Boards or commissions.
3. Any such program shall include an estimate of the displacement of
persons and establishments caused by each recommended project.
B. In addition to any of the requirements in subsection A of this section,
whenever the Planning Board is authorized and directed to prepare a
capital improvements program, every municipal department, authority
or agency shall, upon request of the Planning Board, transmit to said
Board a statement of all capital projects proposed to be undertaken by
such City department, authority or agency, during the term of the
program, for study, advice and recommendation by the Planning Board.
§ 17:7-1 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 17:7-2

§ 17:7-3. Review of capital projects. [MC 2002-29 § 17:7-3,
December 2, 2002]
Any public agency proposing a capital project shall refer the action to the
Planning Board before taking action necessitating the expenditure of any
public funds for the project. The Planning Board shall have the right to
review the location, character or extent of the project for recommendation
in conjunction with the master plan. The public agency shall not act on
the project without the Planning Board's review and recommendations. The
Planning Board shall have forty-five (45) days from the date of the referral
to conduct its review and make its recommendations. This requirement
shall apply to action by any housing, parking, highway, special district, or
other authority, redevelopment agency, school board of other similar public
agency, State, County or Municipal.

Required Development Approvals, Development Permits And
Approval Process
§ 17:8-1. Approvals required. [MC 2002-29 § 17:8-1, December 2,
2002; MC 2005-25 § 1, December 19, 2005]
A. Development Permit:
1. It is the intent of this chapter to utilize a development permit even
if a construction permit or approving authority action may not be
required but where regulatory oversight is necessary to insure
proper and safe installation of site elements such as fences,
swimming pools, sheds and other site elements or structures as
seen fit by the Zoning Officer. A development permit is considered a
prior approval for issuance of a construction permit under the
regulations of the Uniform Construction Code. The issuance of a
construction permit or certificate of occupancy shall be deemed to
require the issuance of a development permit.
2. No structure or part thereof shall be erected, raised, moved,
extended, enlarged, altered, or demolished and no land shall be
altered, filled or used unless and until a development permit has
been granted by the Zoning Officer. No lot or lots shall be occupied,
used, raised in grade six (6) inches cleared, fenced, or altered or
improved in any way in whole or in part for any purpose
whatsoever unless and until the Zoning Officer issues a
development permit. A development permit shall be required for
the use of any land, even if there is no structure.
3. The Zoning Officer shall review all applications for improvements
and upon finding the improvement in accordance with this chapter
issue a development permit upon payment of the fee specified in
Article XII of this chapter. Whenever there shall be a change
contemplated in the use of any lot or lots which do not have a
structure upon them, a new development permit shall be required.
4. Where the proposed construction is either a new structure or an
addition to an existing structure, the applicant shall submit three
(3) sets of plot plans, building floor plans and architectural
elevations to the Zoning Officer. The plot plan shall show finished
grades, open spaces, the established front yard building lines
within one hundred (100) feet of both sides of the structure upon
which the land is located and such other information that the
Zoning Officer determines is necessary to show that the proposed
structure shall comply with all of the requirements of this chapter
for the zone district in which the lot is located. Said plan shall be
drawn to scale and shall show actual dimensions and figures. All
building plans and plot plans shall be signed and sealed by an
appropriate New Jersey licensed professional authorized by the
New Jersey Administrative Code to prepare such plans. The owner
§ 17:8-1 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 17:8-1
1:1077
of a single family dwelling unit may prepare and sign said building
plans and shall file an affidavit to that effect with said plans.
5. No development permit shall be issued for the erection, moving,
extending, enlarging, or altering of any structure, or part thereof,
unless and until the plan and intended uses therefore indicate that
such structure is designed to conform in all respects to the
provisions of this and all other applicable ordinances of the City. No
development permit shall be issued by the Zoning Officer until final
approval has been granted by the appropriate approving authority.
Development permits for developments requiring a variance from
this chapter shall only be issued upon receipt of a written order
from the appropriate authority, or upon the satisfaction of all
conditions contained within a memorialized resolution of approval.
6. No development permit shall be issued for the erection, moving,
extending, enlarging, or altering of any structure, or any part
thereof, including a single and two-family dwelling unit, unless and
until the grading and drainage of the site has been reviewed and
approved by the City Engineer. All applications for building permits
and all plans submitted for such applications that are not submitted
to the Planning Board or Board of Adjustment shall be forwarded to
the City Engineer for review and approval of the grading and
drainage. Such review shall not be required for the extension,
enlargement or alteration of a single or two-family dwelling unit
where such construction would not increase the lot coverage of the
existing structure by more than twenty-five percent (25%).
7. No development permit shall be issued prior to the issuance of a
Certificate of Appropriateness as may be required pursuant to
Article X.
8. It shall be the duty of the Zoning Officer to issue such permits as
may be required when it is sufficiently demonstrated that the land
use, structure, and all other relevant aspects of an application for
development conform with all of the requirements of this chapter,
and that all other reviews and actions, if any, as required by other
State and local regulations have been complied with and all
necessary approvals have been secured.
9. When the Zoning Officer determines that the applicant's proposed
development does not meet the requirements of this chapter, the
Zoning Officer shall refuse to issue a permit in writing and direct
the applicant to request approval from the appropriate approving
authority. The applicant may appeal this decision to the Board of
Adjustment for a reversal of the Officer's decision in accordance
with Article III of this chapter.
10. If it shall appear at any time to the Zoning Officer that the
development permit or development application or accompanying
plans are in any respect false or misleading, or that site work is
§ 17:8-1 § 17:8-1
1:1078
being performed upon the premises differing materially from that
called for in the applications filed with him under existing zoning
laws or ordinances, the Zoning Officer may revoke any permit
issued, it shall be the duty of the person holding the same to
surrender it and all copies thereof to the Zoning Officer. After
applicable permits have been revoked, the Zoning Officer shall,
before issuing any revised permit, require the applicant to file
an indemnity bond in favor of the City with sufficient surety
conditioned for compliance with this chapter and all laws and
ordinances then in force, and in a sum sufficient to cover the cost
of removing the structure if it does not comply.
11. Whenever the City or any duly constituted Board, agency or
department thereof is acting in or pursuant to the performance of a
governmental function, carrying out a legislative mandate or in the
exercise of its private right as a corporate body, any City owned,
operated or controlled building, structure, facility or use either
existing or proposed shall not be subject to the provisions of this
chapter.
B. Subdivision. Any owner of land lying within the City of Plainfield shall,
prior to the subdivision or resubdivision of land as defined by this
chapter, and before conveying legal or equitable title to such
subdivision or any part thereof, obtain final approval of a subdivision
plat pursuant to the provisions of this chapter. Such approval shall be a
condition precedent to filing of such plats with the County Recording
Officer. Failure to obtain final subdivision approval as required shall
subject the property owner to the provisions of N.J.S.A. 40:55D-54 and
40:55D-55.
C. Site Plan:
1. No permit for any development, except as hereinafter provided,
may be issued until approval of a site plan by resolution of the
Planning Board or Zoning Board of Adjustment has been granted.
Any owner of land lying within the City of Plainfield shall, except as
hereinafter provided, prior to any change of use of land requiring a
certificate of occupancy, or commencement or enlargement of any
use requiring fencing, walls or landscape screening pursuant to
this chapter, or prior to any improvement of land involving
excavation, removal of soil, clearing of any site, or placing of any fill
on land contemplated for development, or before any construction
or alteration of any structure or parking area that would extend the
exterior dimensions of such area, or requiring additional parking,
obtain final site plan approval pursuant to the provisions of this
chapter. Site plan approval is required for conversions of one- and
two-family dwelling units to three- or more family dwelling units.
2. The following developments shall be exempt from site plan review,
but shall require approval by the Zoning Officer in order to ensure
compliance with all provisions of this chapter:
§ 17:8-1 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 17:8-1
1:1079
a. The construction of a single-family detached or two-family
dwelling unit buildings, and construction of structures and
establishment of uses accessory thereto;
b. Change of tenancy or occupancy for nonresidential uses where
the change does not require relief from any provisions of this
chapter, and where the administrative officer has found the
amount and size of existing parking to conform to the
requirements of this chapter;
c. Interior alterations to permitted nonresidential structures and
uses that comprise less than an aggregate of two-thousand
(2,000) square feet, and where the administrative officer has
found that parking conforms to the requirements of this
chapter;
d. Exterior alterations to residential and nonresidential
structures to cosmetically enhance the appearance of a
building or structure, provided said exterior alterations do not
change or enlarge the perimeter of the building or structure,
and do not require relief from any provisions of this chapter;
e. Four hundred (400) square feet or less of additional principal
or accessory building floor area, or other development less

A. Preapplication Conference/Informal Review - see N.J.S.A. 40:55D-10.1.
B. If an applicant does not request a preapplication conference or informal
concept plan review, or upon completion of the conference submits an
application, the following process is to be followed:
1. An applicant may file an application for development with the
Board of Adjustment for action without prior application to the
Zoning Officer per N.J.S.A. 40:55D-72.
2. All applicants shall submit one (1) original and two (2) copies of an

plans or plats as per Article VIII of this chapter, and the application
fees as provided for in Article XIII of this chapter.
3. An applicant may file a sketch plat of a major subdivision for
preliminary discussion before the preliminary plat is prepared. The
review of the sketch plat is designed to enable the approving
authority and the applicant to discuss principles involved in the
application before the applicant has gone to the expense of
completing detailed engineering drawings. Any review or
acceptance of a sketch plat is not tantamount to an approval and
does not constitute approval, recording, or the commencement of
construction.
4. The Planning Division, in consultation with the City Engineer if
necessary, shall determine the completeness of the application as
follows and advise the applicant in writing as required. This
process will continue until the application is deemed complete. An
application for development shall be complete for purposes of
commencing the applicable time period for action by a Board when
so certified by the administrative officer. In the event that the
administrative officer does not certify the application to be
complete within forty-five (45) days of the date of its submission,
the application shall be deemed complete upon the expiration of
§ 17:8-6 § 17:8-7

the forty-five (45) day period for purposes of commencing the
applicable time period unless:
a. The application lacks information indicated on the official
checklist;
b. The administrative officer has notified the applicant, in writing,
of the deficiencies in the application within forty-five (45) days
of submission of the application.
5. If the application is deemed incomplete, the applicant may request
that one (1) or more of the submission requirements be waived, in
which event the Board shall grant or deny the request within fortyfive
(45) days of the date of the application being deemed complete.
Nothing herein shall be construed as diminishing the applicant's
obligation to prove in the application process that such applicant is
entitled to approval of the application. The administrative officer
may subsequently require correction of any information found to be
in error, and submission of additional information not specified in
this chapter or any revisions in the accompanying documents, as
are reasonably necessary for approval of the application for
development have been met.
6. Upon the preliminary determination of a complete application, the
applicant shall submit fifteen (15) additional copies of the
application documents and plans/plats. These additional sets are to
be no larger than 11" x 17" sheets. Failure to so submit within
seven (7) days of the determination of completeness will render the
application incomplete. Upon their receipt, the Board Secretary
shall schedule a hearing under the provisions of Article I of this
chapter. A hearing shall be held on all applications for
development.
7. Upon receipt of the information required under Article VIII, the

2, 2002]
screening, landscaping and location of structures; and exterior lighting
both for safety reasons and street lighting, except that nothing herein
shall be construed to prevent the city from modifying by ordinance
such general terms and conditions of preliminary approval as related to
public health and safety;
B. That the applicant may submit for final approval on or before the
expiration date of preliminary approval the whole or section(s) of the
preliminary subdivision plat or site plan;

provided that if the design standards have been revised by ordinance,
such revised standards may govern;
D. That the approving authority grants an extension of preliminary
approval, and preliminary approval has expired before the date on
which the extension is granted, the extension shall begin on what
otherwise would be the expiration date. (The developer may apply for
the extension either before or after what would otherwise be the

ninety-first (91st) day after the developer receives the last legally
required approval from the other governmental entities, whichever
occurs later.
Failure by the applicant to submit all required documents for final

A. Before granting of final approval for subdivision plats or site plans, or
as a condition to the issuance of a development permit, the approving
authority may require and shall accept the following in accordance with
§ 17:8-10 § 17:8-11
1:1092
the standards adopted by this chapter for the purpose of assuring the
installation and maintenance of on tract improvements.
1. A performance guaranty in favor of the City in an amount not to
exceed one hundred twenty percent (120%) of the cost of
installation shall be posted. The cost shall be determined by the
City Engineer according to the method of calculation set forth in
N.J.S.A. 40:55D-53.4 and this chapter for improvements. The City
deems improvements necessary and appropriate, including streets,
grading, pavement, gutters, curbs, sidewalks, street lighting, shade
trees, surveyors' monuments as shown on the final map and as
required by the Map Filing Law, (N.J.S.A. 46:23-9.9 et seq.), water
mains, culverts, storm sewers, sanitary sewers or other means of
sewage disposal, drainage structures, erosion control and
sedimentation control devices, public improvements of open space
and, in the case of site plans only, other on-site improvements and
landscaping. The City Engineer shall review the improvements
required by the approving authority which are to be bonded and
itemize their cost. Said itemization shall be the basis for
determining the amount of the performance guaranty and
maintenance guaranty required by the approving authority and
shall be appended to each performance guaranty posted by the
obligor. The City Engineer shall forward an estimate of the cost of
improvements to the obligor within thirty (30) days of the date of
receipt of a request sent by certified mail for said estimate.
2. A maintenance guaranty shall be posted with the City Council for a
period not to exceed two (2) years after final acceptance of the
improvement, in an amount not to exceed fifteen percent (15%) of
the cost of the improvement, which cost shall be determined by the
City Engineer according to the method of calculation set forth in
N.J.S.A. 40:55D-53.4 and this chapter. In the event that other
governmental agencies or public utilities automatically will own the
utilities to be installed or that the improvements are covered by a
performance or maintenance guaranty to another governmental
agency, no performance or maintenance guaranty, as the case may
be, shall be required for such utilities or improvements.
B. The City Clerk shall forward a copy of the Council resolution and the
performance and/or maintenance bond to the Board Secretary and City
Engineer upon release thereof.
C. The amount of any performance guaranty may be reduced by the City
Council by resolution, when portions of the improvements have been
certified by the City Engineer to have been completed. The time allowed
for installation of the improvements for which the performance
guaranty has been provided may be established by the City Council
resolution. As a condition or as part of any extension of time, the
amount of any performance guaranty shall be increased or reduced, as
the case may be, to an amount not to exceed one hundred twenty
percent (120%) of the cost of installation, which cost shall be
§ 17:8-11 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 17:8-11
1:1093
determined by the City Engineer according to the method of calculation
set forth in N.J.S.A. 40:55D-53.4 as of the time of the passage of the
resolution.
D. If the required improvements are not completed or corrected in
accordance with the performance guaranty, the obligor and surety, if
any, shall be liable thereon to the City for the reasonable cost of the
improvements not completed or corrected, and the City may, either
prior to or after the receipt of the proceeds thereof, complete such
improvements. Such completion or correction of improvements shall be
subject to the public bidding requirements of the "Local Public
Contracts Law".
E. Upon substantial completion of all required site improvements and
appurtenant utility improvements, and the connection of same to the
public system, the obligor shall notify the City Council in writing, by
certified mail addressed in care of the City Clerk, of the completion of
said improvements and shall send a copy simultaneously to the City
Engineer. Thereupon, the City Engineer shall inspect all of the
improvements and shall file a detailed list and report, in writing, with
the City Council, and simultaneously with the obligor, indicating either
approval, partial approval or rejection of the improvements with a
statement of reasons for any rejection not later then forty-five (45) days
after receipt of the obligor's request. The list prepared by the City
Engineer shall state, in detail, with respect to each improvement
determined to be incomplete or unsatisfactory, the nature and extent of
the incompleteness of each improvement or the nature and extent of,
and remedy for, the unsatisfactory state of each completed
improvement determined to be unsatisfactory.
The report shall also identify each improvement determined to be
complete and satisfactory together with a recommendation as to the
amount of reduction to be made in the performance guaranty relating
to the completed and satisfactory improvement, in accordance with the
itemized cost estimate prepared by the City Engineer and appended to
the performance guaranty as per above.
F. The City Council, by resolution, shall either approve the improvements
determined to be complete and satisfactory to the City Engineer, or
reject any or all of these improvements upon the establishment in the
resolution of cause for rejection, and shall approve and authorize the
amount of reduction to be made in the performance guaranty relating
to the improvements accepted, in accordance with the itemized cost
estimate prepared by the City Engineer and appended to the
performance guaranty. This resolution shall be adopted not later than
forty-five (45) days after the receipt of the list and report prepared by
the City Engineer. Upon adoption of the resolution by the City Council,
the obligor shall be released from all liability pursuant to its
performance guaranty except for that portion adequately sufficient to
secure completion or correction of the improvements not yet approved,
provided that thirty (30%) percent of the amount of the performance
§ 17:8-11 § 17:8-11
1:1094
guaranty posted may be retained to ensure completion of all
improvements.
G. If the City Engineer fails to send or provide the list and report as
requested by the obligor within forty-five (45) days from the receipt of
the request, the obligor may apply to the Court in a summary manner
for an order compelling the City Engineer to provide the list and report
within a stated time and the cost of applying to the Court, including
reasonable attorney's fees, may be awarded to the prevailing party.
H. If the City Council fails to approve or reject the improvements
determined by the City Engineer to be complete and satisfactory or
reduce the performance guaranty for the complete and satisfactory
improvements within forty-five (45) days from the receipt of the City
Engineer's list and report, the obligor may apply to the Court in a
summary manner for an order compelling, within a stated time,
approval of the complete and satisfactory improvements and approval
of a reduction in the performance guaranty for the approval complete
and satisfactory improvements in accordance with the itemized cost
estimate prepared by the City Engineer and appended to the
performance guaranty, and the cost of applying to the Court, including
reasonable attorney's fees, may be awarded to the prevailing party.
I. In the event that the obligor has made a cash deposit with the City or
approving authority as part of the performance guaranty, then any
partial reduction granted in the performance guaranty shall be applied
to the cash deposit in the same proportion as the original cash deposit
bears to the full amount of the performance guaranty.
J. If any portion of the required improvements is rejected, the approving
authority may require the obligor to complete or correct such
improvements and, upon completion or correction, the same procedure
of notification as set forth in this section shall be followed. Nothing
herein, however, shall be construed to limit the right of the obligor to
contest by legal proceedings any determination of the City Council or
the City Engineer.
K. The obligor shall reimburse the City for all reasonable inspection fees
paid the City Engineer for the foregoing inspection of improvements
provided that the municipality may require the developer to place a
deposit for the inspection fees in an amount not to exceed, except for
extraordinary circumstances, the greater of five hundred ($500.00)
dollars or five percent (5%) of the cost of improvements, which cost
shall be determined pursuant to N.J.S.A. 40:55D-53.4. For those
developments for which the reasonably anticipated fees are less than
ten thousand ($10,000.00) dollars, fees may, at the option of the
developer, be made in two (2) installments. The initial amount deposited
by a developer shall be fifty percent (50%) of the reasonably anticipated
fees. When the balance on deposit drops to ten percent (10%) of the
reasonably anticipated fees because the amount deposited by the
developer has been reduced by the amount paid to the City Engineer,
§ 17:8-11 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 17:8-11
1:1095
§ 17:8-12. Final site plan/subdivision approval procedures. [MC
2002-29 § 17:8-12, December 2, 2002]
for inspections, the developer shall deposit the remaining fifty percent
(50%) of the reasonably anticipated fees. For those developments for
which the reasonably anticipated fees are ten thousand ($10,000.00)
dollars or greater, fees may, at the option of the developer, be made in
four (4) installments. The initial amount deposited by a developer shall
be twenty-five percent (25%) of the reasonably anticipated fees. When
the balance on deposit drops to ten percent (10%) of the reasonably
anticipated fees because the amount deposited by the developer has
been reduced by the amount paid to the City Engineer, for inspections,
the developer shall make additional deposits of twenty-five percent
(25%) of the reasonably anticipated fees. The City Engineer shall not
perform any inspection if sufficient funds to pay for those inspections
are not on deposit. In the event that final approval is by stages or
sections of development pursuant to N.J.S.A. 40:55D-38, the provisions
of this section shall apply by stage or section.
L. To the extent that any of the improvements have been dedicated to the
municipality on the subdivision plat or site plan, the City Council shall
be deemed, upon the release of any performance guaranty required
pursuant to this section, to accept dedication for public use of streets or
roads and any other improvements made thereon according to the site
plans and subdivision plats approved by the approving authority,
provided that such improvements have been inspected and have
received final approval by the appropriate City officials.
A. The applicant may submit to the Secretary of the Board, which granted
such approval application for final approval. Such submission for final
site plan approval is to include five (5) sets of appropriate application
forms, site plans, and required documents in addition to the fee as
provided for in Article XIII of this chapter. Submissions for final
subdivision approval shall include five (5) sets of the appropriate
application forms, one (1) original and five (5) copies of the revised
deed or plat, and required documents, in addition to the fee as provided
for in Article XIII of this chapter.
B. The approving authority shall grant final approval to the submittal if the
detailed drawings, specifications and estimates of the application
conform to the standards adopted by this chapter for final approval, the
conditions of preliminary approval and, in the case of a major
subdivision, the standards prescribed by the "Map Filing Law" (N.J.S.A.
46:23-99, et seq.).
C. Final approval shall be granted or denied within forty-five (45) days
after submission of a complete application to the Board Secretary, or
within such further time as may be consented to by the applicant.
Failure of the approving authority to act within the period prescribed
shall constitute final approval and a certificate by the administrative
officer as to the failure of the approving authority to act shall be issued

§ 17:8-13. Rights and effect of final approval. [MC 2002-29
§ 17:8-13, December 2, 2002]
§ 17:8-14. Filing of plats. [MC 2002-29 § 17:8-14, December 2,
2002]
on request of the applicant, and it shall be sufficient in lieu of the
written endorsement or other evidence of approval herein required,
and shall be so accepted by the County Recording Officer for purposes
of filing subdivision plats.
A. The zoning requirements applicable to the preliminary approval first
granted and all other rights conferred upon the developer pursuant to
preliminary approval, whether conditionally or otherwise, shall not be
changed for a period of two (2) years after the date on which the
resolution of final approval is adopted; provided that in the case of
subdivision the rights conferred by this section shall expire if the plat
has not been duly recorded within the time period provided. If the
developer has followed the standards prescribed for final approval, and,
in the case of a subdivision, has duly recorded the plat as required, the
approving authority may extend such period of protection for
extensions of one (1) year but not to exceed three (3) extensions.
Notwithstanding any other provisions of this chapter or the Municipal
Land Use Law, the granting of final approval terminates the period of
preliminary approval.
B. Whenever the approving authority grants an extension of final
approval, and final approval has expired before the date on which the
extension is granted, the extension shall begin on what otherwise would
be the expiration date. The developer may apply for the extension either
before or after what would otherwise be the expiration date.
C. The approving authority shall grant an extension of final approval for a
specific period but not exceeding one (1) year from what would
otherwise be the expiration date, if the developer proves to the
reasonable satisfaction of the authority that the developer was barred
or prevented, directly or indirectly, from proceeding with the
development because of delays in obtaining legally required approvals
from other governmental entities and that the developer applied
promptly for and diligently pursued the required approvals. A developer
shall apply for the extension before (1) what would otherwise be the
expiration date of final approval or (2) the ninety-first (91st) day after
the developer receives the last legally required approval from the other
governmental entities, whichever occurs later.
A. Recording of Final Approval of Subdivision:
1. Final approval of a subdivision shall be evidenced by the signature
of the City Engineer and the Chair and Secretary of the approving
authority on the instruments.
§ 17:8-12 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 17:8-14
1:1097
2. Final approval of a major subdivision shall expire ninety-five (95)
days from the date of the signing of the plat unless within such
period the plat shall have been duly filed with the County
Recording Officer. The approving authority may, for good cause
shown, extend the period recording for an additional period not to
exceed one hundred ninety (190) days from the date of signing of
the plat.
3. The approving authority may extend the one hundred ninety (190)
day period for filing a minor subdivision plat or deed if the
developer proves to their reasonable satisfaction that the developer
(1) was barred or prevented, directly or indirectly, from filing
because of delays in obtaining legally required approvals from
other governmental or quasi-governmental entities, and (2) applied
promptly for and diligently pursued the required approvals. The
length of the extension shall be equal to the period of delay caused
by the wait for the required approvals, as determined by the
authority. The developer may apply for the extension either before
or after what would otherwise be the expiration date.
4. The signature of the Chair and Secretary of the approving authority
shall not be affixed except pursuant to Article VIII of this chapter.
B. It shall be the duty of the County Recording Officer to notify the
approving authority and the City Tax Assessor in writing within seven
(7) days of the filing of any plat, identifying such instrument by its title,
date of filing and official number. If the County Recording Officer
records any plat without such approval, such recording shall be deemed
null and void, and by written request of the City Council the plan shall
be expunged from the official records.

§ 17:9-18.2. Transit Oriented Development Downtown Zones
(TODD). [MC 2012-20, November 26, 2012]
A. Purpose. The purposes of the Historic Park Zone are to provide open
space, preserve scenic qualities and resources; to provide contrasts to
the built environment; to provide opportunities for existing and future
outdoor recreational activities; to protect environmentally sensitive
areas; to provide adequate opportunities for location of existing and
future public utilities, facilities, and service; to preserve the function,
capacity, and water quality of the City's stormwater drainage system,
and to prevent development of non-park related uses.
B. Permitted Uses. See Schedule A.
C. Accessory Uses. See Schedule A.
Editor's Note: The schedules referred to herein may be found as an
attachment to this chapter.
A. Purpose. The purpose of the Transit Oriented Development Downtown
Zones (TODD) is to provide the foundation for a complementary mixture
of appropriately intensive commercial and high-density residential land
uses in close proximity to the downtown train station. The TODD Zones
are intended to be pedestrian friendly to create a symbiotic benefit
through the provision of an aesthetically improved, vibrant, and
commercially active downtown for Plainfield residents and visitors. The
TODD Zones consolidate most of the existing zones within an
irregularly based one-quarter (1/4) mile distance from the downtown
Plainfield train station. The TODD Zones are seven (7) distinct zone

A. Statutory Authorization, Findings of Fact, Purpose and Objectives. [MC
2017-38 § 1.0]
1. Statutory Authorization.
The Legislature of the State of New Jersey has in N.J.S.A. 40:48-1,
et seq., delegated the responsibility to local governmental units to
adopt regulations designed to promote public health, safety, and
general welfare of its citizenry. Therefore, the City Council of the
City of Plainfield, of the State of New Jersey does ordain as follows.
2. Findings of Fact.
a. The flood hazard areas of the City of Plainfield are subject to
periodic inundation which results in loss of life and property,
health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and
governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for
flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base, all
of which adversely affect the public health, safety, and general
welfare.
b. These flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of
obstructions in areas of special flood hazard which increase
flood heights and velocities, and when inadequately anchored,
causes damage in other areas. Uses that are inadequately
flood-proofed, elevated or otherwise protected from flood
damage also contribute to the flood loss.
3. Statement of Purpose.
It is the purpose of this section to promote the public health, safety,
and general welfare, and to minimize public and private losses due
to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed:
a. To protect human life and health;
§ 17:9-29 § 17:9-30
1:1126
b. To minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood
control projects;
c. To minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated
with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the
general public;
d. To minimize prolonged business interruptions;
e. To minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as
water and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines,
streets, bridges located in areas of special flood hazard;
f. To help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound
use and development of areas of special flood hazard so as to
minimize future flood blight areas;
g. To insure that potential buyers are notified that property is in
an area of special flood hazard; and
h. To ensure that those who occupy the areas of special flood
hazard assume responsibility for their actions.
4. Methods of Reducing Flood Losses.
In order to accomplish its purposes, this section includes methods
and provisions for:
a. Restricting or prohibiting uses which are dangerous to health,
safety, and property due to water or erosion hazards, or which
result in damaging increases in erosion or in flood heights or
velocities;
b. Requiring that uses vulnerable to floods including facilities
which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at
the time of initial construction;
c. Controlling the alteration of natural floodplains, stream
channels, and natural protective barriers, which help
accommodate or channel flood waters;
d. Controlling filling, grading, dredging, and other development
which may increase flood damage; and,
e. Preventing or regulating the construction of flood barriers
which will unnaturally divert flood waters or which may
increase flood hazards in other areas.

equals or exceeds twenty-five percent (25%) of the market value of the
structure before the damages occurred.
SUBSTANTIAL IMPROVEMENT — Any reconstruction, rehabilitation,
addition, or other improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals
or exceeds fifty percent (50%) of the market value of the structure
before the "start of construction" of the improvement. This term
includes structures which have incurred "substantial damage,"
regardless of the actual repair work performed or "repetitive loss." The
term does not, however, include either:
VARIANCE — A grant of relief from the requirements of this section
which permits construction in a manner that would otherwise be
prohibited by this section.
VIOLATION — The failure of a structure or other development to be
fully compliant with this section. A new or substantially improved
structure or other development without the elevation certificate, other
certifications, or other evidence of compliance required in 44 CFR
§ 60.3(b)(5), (c)(4), (c)(10), (e)(2), (e)(4), or (e)(5) is presumed to be in
violation until such time as that documentation is provided.
Any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing
violations of State or local health, sanitary or safety code
specifications which have been identified by the local code
enforcement officer and which are the minimum necessary to
assure safe living conditions; or
1.
Any alteration of a "historic structure," provided that the alteration
will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a
"historic structure."

34039C0040F; whose effective date is September 20, 2006.
c. Best Available Flood Hazard Data. These documents shall take
precedence over effective panels and FIS in construction and
development regulations only. Where the effective mapping or
base flood elevation conflict or overlap with the best available
flood hazard data, whichever imposes the more stringent
requirement shall prevail.
The above documents are hereby adopted and declared to
be a part of this ordinance. The Flood Insurance Study maps
and advisory documents are on file at the Planning and
Engineering Division at 515 Watchung Ave., Plainfield, NJ
07060.
3. Penalties for Noncompliance.
No structure or land shall hereafter be constructed, relocated to,
extended, converted, or altered without full compliance with the
terms of this section and other applicable regulations. Violation
of the provisions of this section by failure to comply with any of
its requirements (including violations of conditions and safeguards
established in connection with conditions) shall constitute a
misdemeanor. Any person who violates this section or fails to
comply with any of its requirements shall upon conviction thereof
be fined not more than five hundred ($500.00) dollars or
imprisoned for not more than thirty (30) days, or both, for each
violation, and in addition shall pay all costs and expenses involved
in the case. Nothing herein contained shall prevent the City of

1:1133
the Zoning Officer to issue violations for failure to comply with the
provisions of this ordinance.
4. Abrogation and Greater Restrictions.
This section is not intended to repeal, abrogate, or impair any
existing easements, covenants, or deed restrictions. However,
where this section and other ordinance, easement, covenant, or
deed restriction conflict or overlap, whichever imposes the more
stringent restrictions shall prevail.
5. Interpretation.
In the interpretation and application of this section, all provisions
shall be:
a. Considered as minimum requirements;
b. Liberally construed in favor of the Governing Body; and,
c. Deemed neither to limit nor repeal any other powers granted
under State statutes.
6. Warning and Disclaimer of Liability.
The degree of flood protection required by this section is
considered reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on
scientific and engineering considerations. Larger floods can and
will occur on rare occasions. Flood heights may be increased by
man-made or natural causes. This section does not imply that land
outside the area of special flood hazards or uses permitted within
such areas will be free from flooding or flood damages.
This section shall not create liability on the part of the City of
Plainfield, any officer or employee thereof or the Federal Insurance
Administration, for any flood damages that result from reliance
on this section or any administrative decision lawfully made
thereunder.

where applicable;
(f) The availability of alternative locations for the
proposed use which are not subject to flooding or
erosion damage;
(g) The compatibility of the proposed use with existing
and anticipated development;
(h) The relationship of the proposed use to the
comprehensive plan and floodplain management
program of that area;
(i) The safety of access to the property in times of flood
for ordinary and emergency vehicles;
(j) The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise,
and sediment transport of the flood waters and the
effects of wave action, if applicable, expected at the
site; and,
(k) The costs of providing governmental services during
and after flood conditions, including maintenance and
repair of public utilities and facilities such as sewer,
gas, electrical, and water systems, and streets and

(5) Upon consideration of the factors of subsection
17:9-30d4a and the purposes of this section, the Zoning
Board of Adjustment may attach such conditions to the
granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the
purposes of this section.
(6) The Floodplain Manager shall maintain the records of all
appeal actions, including technical information, and report
any variances to the Federal Insurance Administration
upon request.
b. Conditions for Variances.
(1) Generally, variances may be issued for new construction
and substantial improvements to be erected on a lot of
one-half acre or less in size contiguous to and surrounded
by lots with existing structures constructed below the base
flood level, providing items (a) - (k) in subsection
§ 17:9-30 § 17:9-30
1:1138
17:9-30D4a(4) have been fully considered. As the lot size
increases beyond the one-half acre, the technical
justification required for issuing the variance increases.
(2) Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of
historic structures upon a determination that the proposed
repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structure's
continued designation as a historic structure and the
variance is the minimum necessary to preserve the historic
character and design of the structure.
(3) Variances shall not be issued within any designated
floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base
flood discharge would result.
(4) Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that
the variance is the minimum necessary, considering the
flood hazard, to afford relief.
(5) Variances shall only be issued upon:
(a) A showing of good and sufficient cause;
(b) A determination that failure to grant the variance
would result in exceptional hardship to the applicant;
and,
(c) A determination that the granting of a variance will
not result in increased flood heights, additional
threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense,
create nuisances, cause fraud on or victimization of
the public as identified in subsection 17:9-30D4a(4),
or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances.
(6) Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given
written notice that the structure will be permitted to be
built with a lowest floor elevation below the base flood
elevation and that the cost of flood insurance will be
commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the
reduced lowest floor elevation.

Zoning Officer, which can only be granted upon good cause. Such
use shall not be rebuilt except as a conforming use.
2. Normal maintenance and repair of a structure containing a
nonconforming use is permitted, provided that it does not extend

structure and does not increase the intensity of use. Nothing in this
section shall prevent the strengthening or restoring to a safe or
lawful condition any part of any structure declared unsafe by the
Construction Official.
3. A building containing residential nonconforming uses may be
altered in any way to improve interior livability. No structural

1. A nonconforming use or structure abandoned in accordance with
this chapter and accompanied by an intent on the part of the owner
to abandon such use as evidenced by some act or failure to act
which carries with it a sufficient implication that the owner neither
claims or retains any interest in the subject matter of the

implication shall be rebuttably presumed by nonuse for any period
of two (2) or more years. Nonuse by successive owners shall be
considered continuous nonuse.
2. The change of a nonconforming use or structure to a more or
entirely conforming use for any period of time shall be considered
an abandonment of the previous nonconforming use, and a
reversion to the previous nonconforming use shall not be

A. The Approving Authority may require as a condition of approval that a
developer contribute a pro rata share for reasonable and necessary offtract
improvements as a result of the proposed subdivision or site plan
in accordance with the provisions of this section. Off-tract
improvements shall include:
1. Street improvements, water, sewer, drainage or other facilities or
other improvements that may be subsequently authorized by the
Municipal Land Use Law and necessary easements therefor, where
the need for the provision of such improvements off-tract is, in
whole or part, made necessary by the proposed subdivision or site
plan and based on the circulation and utility elements of the Master
Plan.
2. Off-tract improvements may consist of new improvements or the
extension or modification of existing improvements made
necessary in whole or in part by the subdivision or site plan.
B. Prior to the grant of final approval of any subdivision or site plan and
prior to the issuance of any construction permits for any land use
requiring subdivision or site plan approval pursuant to the LUO, or for
any residence or other use of land on an unimproved street or where
any off-tract improvements have not yet been installed, the developer
shall pay its pro rata share of the cost of providing any reasonable and
necessary off-tract improvements. All payments shall be made in the
manner set forth hereinafter, it being the intent of this section that the
developer shall bear that portion of the cost of the improvements which
bears a rational nexus to the needs created by the subdivision or site
plan.
C. The approving authority shall review each subdivision and site plan
application to determine the need for off-tract improvements and the
total cost of such improvements. The approving authority shall
determine the proportionate amount that is the responsibility of the
developer.
D. In cases where the need for any off-tract improvements are required
and where the approving authority determines that properties other
than the developer's will be benefited by the improvement, the
Approving Authority shall forward a report to City Council, containing a
list and description of all such improvements, together with its request
that the City Council determine, as set forth hereinafter, how the
improvements should be undertaken.
E. Where the Approving Authority has determined that properties other
than the developer's will benefit from the installation of off-tract
improvements, and has forwarded a report to the City Council, the City
Council shall, within forty-five (45) days, make the following
determinations:
§ 17:9-37.2 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 17:9-37.2
1:1151
1. That the recommended off-tract improvement should be
undertaken in the manner recommended by the Approving
Authority;
2. The extent to which the improvement should be constructed by the
City as a general improvement or as a local improvement and as
part of the capital improvement program.
3. The City Engineer shall estimate, with the aid of such City officials
or departments or other persons having pertinent information or
expertise, the cost of the total improvement and the proportionate
share assessed to the developer's property will be specially
benefited therefrom.
4. Once the City Council has made the determinations described
above, the developer shall be required, as a condition of final
approval of the development, to provide a combination of
performance and maintenance guaranties, cash contributions,
developer's agreements and/or other forms of surety permitted by
law, to insure payment to the City.
F. The amounts of money required pursuant to this section shall be
estimated sums, and such amounts shall be redetermined by the City
Engineer following completion of all off-tract improvements to ensure
that the developer shall pay only its pro-rata share of the cost thereof.
In the event that the payment made by the developer is less than its
share of the actual cost of the improvements, then the developer shall
be required to pay its additional proportionate share of the cost thereof.
G. Should the developer pay the portion of the cost of improvements
determined to be its pro-rata share under protest, legal action shall be
instituted within one (1) year of such payment in order to preserve the
right to a judicial determination as to the fairness and reasonableness
of such amount.
H. In the event that the developer shall not be required to install the offtract
improvements but is required to pay its pro-rata share of the cost
therefor, then in that event there shall be paid to the City the amount of
the developer's share of the determined cost of the off-tract
improvement. All monies received by the City in accordance with the
provisions of this section shall be deposited in an interest bearing
account, and such funds shall only be used for improvements for which
they are deposited or improvements serving the same purpose. If the
improvements are not initiated within ten (10) years from the date of
payment, or other mutually agreeable period of time, all deposited
funds shall be returned to the developer, or its legal successor in
interest, together with accumulated interest, less ten (10%) percent of
accumulated interest for administrative costs. If after reasonable and
diligent inquiry, the City is unable to locate the developer or its
successor in interest in order to return said funds, then the funds shall

Authority, in consultation with the City Engineer, shall determine
whether any off-tract improvements are required, based on the
circulation and utility elements of the Master Plan. The engineer for the
Approving Authority shall prepare a report as to the reasonable and
necessary off-tract improvements and the fair share payable by the
developer. Payment of the fair share shall be a condition of approval.
The developer's fair share of the improvements shall be paid in full
prior to the issuance of any construction permits or as otherwise
required by the approving authority.

feet from the building facade and should not encroach into the
public right-of-way unless approved by the City Council.
4. The retail merchandise shall not be displayed in cardboard boxes,
but rather shall be placed either on the sidewalk itself or upon a
display table or rack as appropriate to the nature of the
merchandise.
5. The merchandise may contain additional signage indicating the
product(s) displayed and its price. Each additional sign shall not be
larger than one (1) square foot, and the total additional signage
associated with the outdoor display shall consist of no more than

congested or whether the flow of traffic is impeded or
inconvenienced.
3. No storage or sales area may interfere with an existing required
parking lot or loading or access areas. If such storage or sales use
is conducted from a parking lot or area, sufficient parking must be
demonstrated for both the existing and proposed uses. If a site

with the terms of the license.
R. Permits for sidewalk cafes shall be valid for one (1) year from the date
of issuance of the permit. Applicants receiving site plan approval for a
sidewalk cafe area shall obtain a permit each year they wish to continue
the area from the City Health Department provided that the operations
have not changed and the applicant is in compliance with Health
Department standards.
S. Insurance. No permit required by this chapter for a sidewalk cafe area
shall be issued until the applicant shall have first filed with the
approving committee a comprehensive general liability policy issued to
the applicant by a public liability insurance company authorized to do
business in the State of New Jersey in the amounts specified. Such
insurance shall name the City of Plainfield as additional insured with
respect to the operation and maintenance of the sidewalk cafe area in
the amounts specified by Corporation Counsel. The insurance coverage
required by this section shall at all times be maintained for the full
amount, and shall contain a clause obligating the company issuing same
to give not less than thirty (30) days written notice to the City Clerk
before cancellation or amendments of any of the terms thereof. The
cancellation of any such policy shall have the immediate affect of
suspending the permit to operate the sidewalk cafe until a new policy
complying with the provisions of this section is filed with the approving
committee and a new permit is issued by the Health Department.

December 2, 2002; MC 2007-04 Exh. A, June 20, 2007; MC 2010-27,
§§ 23—25, November 22, 2010; MC 2012-20, November 26, 2012;
MC 2013-01, May 13, 2013; MC 2013-13, December 9, 2013]
such storage. All such storage is to be in accordance with local,
State, and Federal regulations and performance standards.
5. Vehicles stored at auto service stations, auto dealerships, auto
repair, and auto body facilities are not subject to above outdoor
storage regulations 2 and 3. Vehicular storage at such legally
permitted uses is permitted in front yards, subject to the provision
of a minimum five (5) feet curbed landscape buffer between the
public right-of-way and the vehicles. All vehicles must be stored
inside structures or within designated parking/storage spaces. All
vehicles stored on site shall be awaiting sale, rent, lease, repair, or
pick-up.
A. No nonresidential driveway shall be located within ten (10) feet of an
existing adjacent residential property nor within five (5) feet of any

within the site shall be-five (5) feet. This does not apply for one- and twofamily
dwellings.
E. A parking lot shall be located to the rear of a building and/or the
interior of the site where its visual impact to adjacent properties and
the public right-of-way can be minimized. Parking lots shall be
prohibited in any required side yard setback area or front yard area.
F. The total number of off-street parking spaces and loading spaces
required for all uses or combination of uses shall be provided as
specified in this section. Any building or site containing more than one
(1) use shall meet the combined parking space and loading
requirements for all uses, based on the area utilized for each separate
use. The parking space schedule and loading space schedule in this
section represents general parking and loading requirements
acceptable to the City. Since a specific use may generate parking usage
and/or loading/unloading activities that deviates from the requirements
enumerated in this section, documentation and testimony shall be
presented to the Board as to the anticipated parking usage and loading
activities. The parking requirements for any use not specifically
§ 17:9-41 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 17:9-42
1:1161
indicated shall be determined by the Board based on evidence
presented at the time of the application and based on requirements for

North Avenue Historic District Zones, there shall be provided, at the
time that any building or structure is erected, enlarged, increased in
capacity or has a change of use, parking spaces in accordance with the
requirements of the following schedule.
1. Consistent with the principles for TODD, the proximity to and
availability of mass transit and the pedestrian orientation of
development in the TODD Zones, parking requirements that are
otherwise required for the uses set forth in the schedule are
modified to reduce and eliminate the number of parking spaces
required, with the specific intent of regulating parking through
zoning rather than as a design and performance standard.
Nevertheless, the concepts for shared parking and use of on-street
parking in the Residential Site Improvement Standards are
incorporated into the schedule.
2. Consistent with the principles for TODN, the proximity to and
availability of mass transit and the pedestrian orientation of
development in the TODN Zones, parking requirements that are
otherwise required for the uses set forth in the schedule are
modified to reduce and eliminate the number of parking spaces
required, with the specific intent of regulating parking through
zoning rather than as a design and performance standard.
Nevertheless, the concepts for shared parking and use of on-street
parking in the Residential Site Improvement Standards are
incorporated into the schedule.

K. For uses not specifically described herein, parking requirements shall
be determined by the approving authority during a public hearing.
These requirements are considered minimum standards, and parking
may be provided in excess of these requirements, but in no case shall
the provided parking for nonresidential uses exceed these minimum
requirements by more than ten percent (10%). This restriction shall not
apply to single- and two-family dwelling units.
L. All permitted and required accessory off-street parking spaces shall be
located on the same lot as the use to which the spaces are accessory, or
upon an adjacent lot in common ownership.
M. All loading areas shall be located on the same lot as the use being
served. No loading area shall be located in a front yard. There shall be
no loading in a yard abutting, or in a public right-of-way. No loading
space shall be located within forty (40) feet of an intersection of any two
(2) public rights-of-way. The off-street loading space shall be located on
the property so as to permit any vehicle to be parked in the loading
space with no portion of the vehicle extending into the public street.
1. Loading spaces shall be provided and designed as required for all
uses in the LUO. Shared loading areas, with shared ingress/egress
§ 17:9-42 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 17:9-42
1:1165
points and properly recorded shared access easements, are
encouraged in order to reduce access points at the public rightof-
way. Shared loading areas are subject to approving authority
review and approval.
2. In all TODN Zones loading spaces shall be provided and designed
as required for all uses in the LUO. Shared loading areas, with
shared ingress/egress points and properly recorded shared access
easements, are encouraged in order to reduce access points at the
public right-of-way. Shared loading areas are subject to approving
authority review and approval.
N. No commercial parking garage or area for twenty-five (25) or more
vehicles shall have an entrance or exit for vehicles within one thousand
(1,000) feet along the same side of a street upon which is located a
school, public playground, house of worship, hospital, public library or
institution for dependents or children, except where such property is in
another block or on another street on which the zone line does not abut.
Such access shall not be closer to the intersections of any two (2)
streets than fifty (50) feet. No access drive or driveway shall be located
in any residential district to provide access to uses other than those
permitted in such residential zone. No driveway shall serve any use
other than the permitted use on the lot upon which the driveway is
located.
O. In all districts, for every building, or part thereof, which is to be utilized
for a childcare facility there shall be provided one (1) off-street loading
area (pick-up/drop-off) which shall have a minimum dimension of ten
(10) feet by twenty-five (25) feet.
P. In all zone districts and for all uses except single- and two-family
dwellings, parking lots or individual spaces shall be prohibited within
front yard areas. The front yard parking permitted accessory to oneand
two-family dwellings is only those spaces directly in front of usable
garages in accordance with the Residential Site Improvement
Standards. No other front yard parking is permitted.
Q. Parking spaces are to be a minimum of nine feet by eighteen (9x18)
feet.
R. Use and occupancy of any structure containing two (2) or more
residential dwelling units is subject to and conditioned upon an
equitable distribution of off-street accessory parking spaces among
those occupying the structure. Use and occupancy is further
conditioned upon the property owner providing the tenants of each
dwelling unit such parking as approved by the Planning Board or
Zoning Board or other approving authority at no additional cost to the
tenant. In addition, if parking is included in the rental agreement, such
parking as required by the Residential Site Improvement Standards
shall be provided. On-site parking shall not be provided to any party
§ 17:9-42 § 17:9-42
1:1166
other than a resident of said structure, nor shall the parking be used for
any purpose other than parking.
S. TODD Zones.
1. In the TODD/TD Zones, on-site parking spaces for residential units
and any other parking that is provided must be on site.
2. In all other TODD Zones, on-site parking is not required. Parking
requirements and optional parking shall be provided by one of the
following options, or a combination of the following options: (1) onsite
parking; (2) purchase of long-term parking permits from the
City Parking Bureau that must be renewed in order to retain
Certificates of Occupancy, in which case the property owner bears
the obligation of obtaining the permits and providing them to the
tenants; or (3) contribution to a public parking deck.
3. Shared parking is encouraged in all TODD Zones and is required
for the residential component of all mixed use developments. The
methodology to calculate the number of shared parking spaces
shall be that found in the most recent publication of the Urban
Land Institute Shared Parking or approved equivalent.
4. Alternative parking standards to those shown in the Table of
Parking Regulations shall be accepted if the applicant
demonstrates these standards better reflect local conditions.
Factors affecting minimum number of parking spaces include
household characteristics, availability of mass transit, urban versus
suburban location, and available off-site parking resources.
5. The approving authority may reduce the minimum number of
parking spaces required where the applicant can demonstrate the
following to the Board's satisfaction:
a. Variations in the accumulation of vehicles by hour, by day, or by
season; or
b. Relationships that exist among the land uses that result in
visiting multiple land uses on the same auto trip; or
c. Another shared parking approach.
6. A developer of new commercial and mixed use construction or
residential rehabilitation, that requires the provision of parking
spaces, may undertake a study, conducted by a transportation
planner or engineer, to determine the modal split for travel by its
employers and visitors. Based on the expected distribution of travel
modes, the approving authority shall determine the parking
requirement applicable to the proposed development. The
authority can reduce the actual provision of parking spaces by
requiring the applicant to pave, construct or pay for, through the
parking structure mechanism, only the number of parking spaces
§ 17:9-42 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 17:9-42
1:1167
determined necessary, based on the agree-upon results of the
modal split study.
7. Where possible, connections or provisions for future connections to
abutting parking lots serving retail or service uses shall be shown
on the site plan.
T. TODN Zones.
1. In the TODN/PSR1 and PSR2 Zones, parking spaces for residential
units must be on site.
2. In all other TODN Zones, parking requirements shall be satisfied by
one of the following options, or a combination of the following
options: (1) on-site parking; (2) purchase of long-term parking
permits from the City Parking Bureau that must be renewed in
order to retain certificates of occupancy, in which case the property
owner bears the obligation of obtaining the permits and providing
them to the tenants; or (3) adjacent to the property via crosseasements/
long-term leases in order to create a seamless shared
parking experience for patrons and residents in the area.
3. Shared parking is encouraged in all TODN Zones and is required
for the residential component of all mixed use developments. The
methodology to calculate the number of shared parking spaces
shall be that found in the most recent publication of the Urban
Land Institute Shared Parking or approved equivalent.
4. Alternative parking standards to those shown in the Table of
Parking Regulations shall be accepted if the applicant
demonstrates these standards better reflect local conditions.
Factors affecting minimum number of parking spaces include
household characteristics, availability of mass transit, urban versus
suburban location, and available off-site parking resources.
5. The approving authority may reduce the minimum number of
parking spaces required where the applicant can demonstrate the
following to the Board's satisfaction:
a. Variations is the accumulation of vehicles by hour, by day, or by
season; or
b. Relationships that exist among the land uses that result in
visiting multiple land uses on the same auto trip; or
c. Another shared parking approach.
6. A developer of new commercial and mixed use construction or
residential rehabilitation, that requires the provision of parking
spaces, may undertake a study, conducted by a transportation
planner or engineer, to determine the modal split for travel by its
employers and visitors. Based on the expected distribution of travel
modes, the approving authority shall determine the parking

§ 17:9-43. Parking lot landscaping. [MC 2002-29 § 17:9-43,
December 2, 2002]
The interior area of all parking lots shall be landscaped to provide visual
relief from the undesirable and monotonous appearance of extensive
parking areas, and to provide shading that will reduce solar heat gain
to both the surface of the parking lot and vehicles parked thereon. Such
landscaped areas shall be provided in protected planting islands or
peninsulas within the perimeter of the parking lot and shall be placed so as
not to obstruct the vision of motorists. The area and types of plantings shall
be provided based on the number of parking spaces in the lot, as follows:
requirement applicable to the proposed development. The
authority can reduce the actual provision of parking spaces by
requiring the applicant to pave, construct or pay for, through the
parking structure mechanism, only the number of parking spaces
determined necessary, based on the agree-upon results of the
modal split study.
7. Where possible, connections or provisions for future connections to
abutting parking lots serving retail or service uses shall be shown
on the site plan.
A. For parking lots with ten (10) spaces or less, no such interior
landscaping shall be required if the Board determines there is adequate
landscaping directly surrounding the perimeter of the parking lot. If the
Board finds that such landscaping is inadequate, then the requirements
of subsection B2 below shall apply.
B. For parking lots with eleven (11) or more spaces, a minimum of five
percent (5%) of the interior area of the parking lot shall be provided
with planting islands containing a minimum of one (1) deciduous tree
planted for every five (5) parking spaces abutting such island. Planting
islands in parking lots shall also conform to the following requirements:
1. The minimum width of planting islands shall be five (5) feet on the
side of parking spaces ten (10) feet between parking bays. If
sidewalks are incorporated through either the long sides of the
landscape islands between parking bays or through the landscape
islands on the sides of parking spaces, their width shall be added to
these requirements.
2. No more than eight (8) parking spaces shall be placed in one (1)
row of parking without an intervening landscape island.
3. Where the parking lot design will result in pedestrians cutting
perpendicularly through landscape islands, sidewalks shall be
installed at regular intervals across the islands.
4. The remainder of any such interior planting areas not containing
trees shall be planted with low-growing evergreen shrubs.

without hindering necessary lighting coverage.
A. Porches. For all residential structures, porches shall not be located in
the required side yard setback area but may be located in the required
front or rear yard setback area, provided they do not extend more than
eight (8) feet into the front yard setback area. Porches shall not be
closer than seventeen (17) feet to the front property line and twentytwo
(22) feet to the rear property line. The porch shall be considered a
permanent encroachment into the front or rear yard setback of the
principal building. The required setbacks shall continue to be measured
from the foundation of the principal use. Porch flooring shall be tongue
and groove material and not made of structural lumber/pressure
treated decking.
B. Decks. For residential structures, decks shall not be located in a front

adjacent public and private property and protect privacy;
g. Encourage replacement of preexisting nonconforming signs
and abandoned signs with signs that conform to this article and
section and the Design Standards;

C. General standards.
1. The Sign Design Standards which are adopted separately are
specifically incorporated herein by reference and made a part of
this article and section.237
2. Any sign not expressly permitted by this section is prohibited.
3. Material. Signs shall be constructed of durable materials,
maintained in good condition and not allowed to deteriorate or
become dilapidated. All signs, together with all supports,
appurtenances, braces, anchors and other parts, shall be kept in
continual repair, including cleaning, painting, replacing of
defective parts and otherwise maintaining a presentable condition.
Lack of proper maintenance shall be considered abandonment and
is subject to removal upon notification by the Zoning Officer or
Construction Code Official.
4. Appurtenances and supporting structures. Notwithstanding the
restrictions found elsewhere in this article concerning sign shape
and area, sign appurtenances and sign supporting structures shall
be permitted only when designed as an integral part of the sign,
constructed of similar materials, and graphically compatible in
color, shape, position, and scale with the permitted sign face. Sign
appurtenances and supporting structures shall not increase the
proposed sign area by greater than 15%. Sign appurtenances and
sign supporting structures shall not extend above or below the sign
face by more than 25% of the sign face height and shall not project
outward beyond the face of the proposed sign.
5. Setback. The sign setback shall be measured from the property line
to the nearest part of the sign, including any appurtenance,
supporting structure, base, frame or decorative elements.
6. Height. Sign height shall be measured between the grade
immediately below the sign and the highest point of the highest
element of the sign. Wall signs shall not project above the top or
beyond the ends of the wall surface upon which they are placed,
nor shall wall signs be placed on a parapet or similar architectural
device such that the sign would project above the elevation of the
roof behind such parapet or other device.
7. Area. Sign area shall be computed by determining the total area of
any signboard, sign face or sign background at its largest
horizontal and vertical dimensions, including framing, trim or
237. Editor's Note: The Plainfield Signage Design Standards are included as an attachment to
this chapter.
§ 17:9-51 § 17:9-51
1:1186
molding, and the area of the appurtenance or other sign supporting
structure, regardless of whether the framing, trim, molding,
support structure, or appurtenance conveys a message or any part
of the message on the sign. Where there is no framing, the sign
area shall be deemed to be the area of the smallest rectangular
figure that can encompass all of the figures and their supporting
logos or elements, if any. For double-faced signs, only one display
face shall be measured in computing the total sign area where the
sign faces are parallel, or where the interior angles formed by the
faces are 45° or less. The maximum area for a window sign is 25%
of the window.
8. Projections. No wall sign may project from the outer face of a wall
or extend over any public right-of-way more than nine inches unless
otherwise provided for in this article. Any wall sign which projects
more than nine (9) inches from the outer wall face shall be
considered a blade sign and must conform to all applicable
provisions for blade signs set forth in this article. An awning is not a
wall sign.
9. Alterations. Any sign alteration, except those specified in
§ 17:9-51C.1, and nonstructural maintenance and/or repairs,
requires conformance to all requirements of this article, except as
provided in Subsection H, entitled "Preexisting nonconforming
signs."
10. Illumination. Signs, including channel letter signs, may be
spotlighted or backlighted from the rear with a diffused light
source, unless such illumination is specifically prohibited
elsewhere in this section. Individual letters/numbers/symbols
forming a sign are permitted to have internal illumination;
internally illuminated box signs (internally illuminated boxes that
are larger than the individual letters and illuminate anything other
than individual letters/numbers/symbols) are not permitted. All
illumination shall be subject to the following.
a. All lighting sources shall be completely shielded from the view
of vehicular traffic.
b. Such illumination shall not project light above the highest
elevation of the front wall of the building for wall-mounted
signs or more than five feet above ground level for
freestanding signs.
c. Backlighted signs shall not have a white or light-colored
background or signboard.
d. Where a sign is located on a lot adjacent to a lot used for
residential purposes, it shall not permit any light to shine into
or onto adjacent or upper-story residential uses or to cause a
nuisance to the adjacent residential use.
§ 17:9-51 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 17:9-51
1:1187
e. No illuminated sign located on a lot adjacent to or across the
street from any residential district and visible from such
residential district shall be illuminated between the hours of
11:00 p.m. and 7:00 a.m., unless the use to which the sign
pertains is open for business during those hours. Neon signs
shall not be illuminated after 9:00 p.m.
f. All wiring for permanent illuminated signs shall be installed
and maintained so that it is not within public view. The running
of wiring or conduit along the exterior wall of a building to
access a sign is specifically prohibited unless, in the judgment
of the Construction Official, there is no practical way to run the
conduit so that it is not within public view.
g. No illuminated sign shall be of such a color or located in such a
manner as to be confused with, or to diminish or detract in any
way from, the effectiveness of any traffic signal or similar
official safety or warning device or public purpose sign.
h. Digital display signs shall be limited to nonresidential zone
districts and limited to one per site. Digital display signs shall
have a minimum duration of eight seconds for each message
displayed on the screen; only one message may be displayed
per screen. The transition (dwell) time between messages shall
be one second or less, without any special effects such as visual
dissolve, fading, flashing or video.
11. Ground-floor uses having a side or rear facade fronting on a
parking lot shall be permitted to have one additional sign on the
facade of the building facing the parking lot, provided that such
sign meets all of the standards of this article and the Design
Guidelines.

section and removed in accordance with this requirement shall not
be replaced unless it conforms to all requirements of this section
and proper permits are obtained.

§ 17:10-23. Application to governmental agencies. [MC 2002-29
§ 17:10-23, December 2, 2002]
It is recognized that the intent and purposes of this article would not be
fully served if the City were to control the actions of others but fail to apply
similar constraints to itself. Accordingly, a Certificate of Appropriateness
shall be required before final approval of any City actions on public as well
as private lands, streets, easements and rights-of-way. This requirement
shall be deemed to include any action by any party which requires the
approval or concurrence of the City or any City agency and which is not
otherwise covered by the provisions of this chapter.
In those circumstances where the City cannot require compliance, as in
certain cases involving the County, State and Federal governments, the City
urges, most strongly, the voluntary cooperation of such agencies in seeking
a Certificate of Appropriateness and hereby authorizes the Commission to
consider such requests and applications.
§ 17:10-24. Other requirements unaffected. [MC 2002-29
§ 17:10-24, December 2, 2002]

permit or other action as otherwise provided for.
§ 17:10-25. Violation penalties. [MC 2002-29 § 17:10-25, December
2, 2002]
Any person violating any of the provisions of this article shall, upon
conviction thereof, be subject to the penalties herein.
A. A separate offense shall be deemed committed on each day during or on
which a violation occurs or continues.
B. If any person shall undertake any activity vis-a-vis a historic site or
improvement within a historic district without first having obtained and
posted a Certificate of Appropriateness, such person shall be deemed to
be in violation of this chapter.
C. Upon learning of the violation, the Zoning Officer shall personally serve
upon the owner of the lot whereon the violation is occurring a notice
describing the violation in detail and giving the owner ten (10) days to
abate the violation by restoring the site or improvement to its status
quo ante. If the owner cannot be personally served within the
municipality with the said notice, a copy shall be posted on site and a

§ 17:10-26. Injunctive relief. [MC 2002-29 § 17:10-26, December 2,
2002]
In the event that any action, which would permanently and adversely
change a historic site or historic district, such as demolition or removal
is about to occur without a Certificate of Appropriateness having been
issued, the Zoning Officer is hereby authorized to apply to the Superior
Court of New Jersey for such injunctive relief as is necessary to prevent the
destruction of such site or district.

December 2, 2002]
copy sent by certified mail, return receipt requested, to the owner at
the last known address as it appears on the municipal tax rolls.
D. In the event that the violation is not abated within ten (10) days of
service or posting on site, whichever is earlier, the Zoning Officer shall
cause to be issued a summons and complaint, returnable in the
municipal court, charging violation of this chapter.
E. The penalty for violations shall be as follows:
1. For each day, up to ten (10) days -- not more than twenty-five
($25.00) dollars per day;
2. For each day, eleven (11) to twenty-five (25) days -- not more than
fifty ($50.00) dollars per day;
3. For each day beyond twenty-five (25) days -- not more than seventyfive
($75.00) dollars per day.
If any person shall undertake any activity vis-a-vis a historic site
or improvement within a historic district without first having,
obtained a Certificate of Appropriateness, he shall be required to
restore same.
A. Recognizing the need for preventive maintenance to insure the
continued useful life of historic sites and structures in historic districts,
the Plainfield City Council hereby declares that code enforcement vis-avis
historic sites and structures in historic districts is a high municipal
priority.
B. All historic sites and all buildings and structures in a historic district
shall be maintained so that all exterior walls, roofs, stairs, porches,
windows and door frames are in a watertight condition. Cornices,
entablatures, wall facings, trim and similar decorative features shall be
maintained so as to prevent deterioration and any deterioration which
adversely affects the overall character of the building or the district in
which the building is located is prohibited.
§ 17:10-25 § 17:10-27
1:1214
C. In the event that any landmark or improvement in a historic district
deteriorates to the point that, in the best estimate of the Division of
Inspections, the cost of correcting the outstanding code violations
equals more than twenty-five percent (25%) of the cost of replacing the
entire improvement on which the violations occur, the Division shall
serve personally or by certified mail, return receipt requested, a notice
on the owner of the site or structure, listing the violations, the estimate
for their abatement, and the replacement cost of the improvement and
stating that if the owner does not take all necessary remedial action
within ninety (90) days, or such extensions as the Division shall for good
cause grant, The City of Plainfield's designated official may, at the
expiration of ninety (90) days, enter upon the property and abate such
violations itself and cause the cost thereof to become a lien on the
property.
D. Upon receipt of such notice, the owner may, within ten (10) days after
such receipt, notify the Division of Inspections of his/her wish to have a
hearing as to the allegations and estimates set forth in the Division's
notice. Such hearing shall be conducted by the Commission and shall,
so far as possible, be a formal proceeding in which the Division of
Inspections shall establish the matters alleged in the notice by a
preponderance of the evidence.
E. If the owner does not request a hearing, the procedures set forth in
subsection C above shall be binding. If a hearing is requested, the
administrative officer will, within ten (10) days following the hearing,
serve on the owner an opinion in writing setting forth his conclusions
and the reasons therefore. Such opinion shall be deemed to be a first
notice pursuant to subsection C hereof.
F. Thereafter, if the owner does not comply, the Division may enter onto
the premises and by use of municipal labor or outside contractors or
both, perform such work as is necessary to abate all violations.
G. The head of the Division shall then certify to City Council the cost of
such work, plus all administrative, clerical and legal costs and overhead
attributable thereto and shall present the same to City Council.
H. The City Council may, by resolution, vote to cause the sum so certified
to become a lien upon the site or property, payable within the next
quarter's property taxes, and, if not then paid, bearing interest at the
same rate as delinquent taxes.
I. In addition to the remedies set forth herein, any violation of the
preventive maintenance standards of this chapter shall be subject to
the penalties set forth in Section 17:10-25 of this chapter.

It shall be the duty of all municipal officials of the City of Plainfield
reviewing all permit applications involving real property or improvements
thereon to determine whether such application involves any activity which
should also be the subject of an application for a Certificate of
Appropriateness or subject to review by the Historic Preservation
Commission. If it should, the Officer shall inform both the Secretary of the
Commission and the applicant.

ARTICLE XI
Site Plan And Subdivision Design And Performance Standards
§ 17:11-1. General improvement standards. [MC 2002-29 § 17:11-1,
December 2, 2002]
Unless the approving authority grants design waivers or exceptions,
improvements shall be installed in complete accordance with the standards
of this chapter, with other particular specifications approved by the
approving authority and City Engineer and with all other applicable
municipal, County, State and Federal regulations. Should improvements
be required that are not provided for within the particular sections of
this chapter, they shall be designed and constructed in accordance with
good planning and engineering practice and recognized design standards.
The developer shall submit detailed design calculations and construction
specifications where required. Prior to initiating such specialized design,
the particular standards to be utilized shall be submitted for review by the
approving authority and City Engineer.
§ 17:11-2. General design standards. [MC 2002-29 § 17:11-2,
December 2, 2002]
A. All site plan and subdivision plats shall conform to design standards
that will encourage desirable development patterns within the City. The
site plan or subdivision shall conform to the proposals and conditions
shown on the City's official map and master plan. The streets, drainage
rights-of-way, school sites, public parks and playgrounds and other
municipal facilities shown on the adopted master plan and official map
shall be considered in the review of site plans and subdivision plats.
Where the master plan or official map makes no provisions for streets
and drainage rights-of-way, they shall be shown on the final plat as
required by the approving authority, and shall be such as to lend
themselves to the harmonious development of the City and the
enhancement of the public welfare.
B. Responsibility for Design. Within the criteria established by and subject
to the review and approval of the approving authority, the design of a
site plan or subdivision is the responsibility of the applicant who shall
bear the entire cost of any and all investigations, tests, reports, surveys,
samples, calculations, environmental assessments, designs, researches
or any other activity necessary to the completion of the design. The
standards set forth in this chapter shall be taken to be the minimum
necessary to meet its purposes as set forth herein. The responsibility of
the approving authority shall be to see that these minimum standards
are followed and, in those cases not covered by these standards,
sufficient precautions are taken to assure that the eventual design is
conducive to the implementation of the purposes of this chapter and the
City master plan. The approving authority may employ professionals in
various disciplines to advise and assist it in its determinations. Any
decisions of the approving authority regarding the suitability or

and relationship to the residential site improvement standards. [MC
2002-29 § 17:11-3, December 2, 2002; MC 2007-04, Exh. A, June 20,
2007]
sufficiency of any design proposal, taken upon advice of its
professionals and subject to the provisions of this chapter, shall be
deemed conclusive.
C. Design Data. To properly execute the design of a site plan or
subdivision, it is anticipated that the applicant will obtain or cause to be
obtained certain design data including, but not limited to, soil tests and
analyses, environmental assessments, traffic studies and traffic
projections, surveys, reports and similar design data. Any and all such
data obtained by the applicant, or by others retained to complete the
design, shall be made available to the approving authority and its
employees and professional consultants, for the purpose of reviewing
the proposed design. Should the approving authority determine that the
design data submitted is not sufficient for the purpose of completing a
full review of the proposal, it may request the applicant to provide such
additional information as is deemed necessary. Until the applicant
supplies information required by the checklist for completeness or the
approving authority grants a submission waiver, no application under
the provisions of this chapter shall be deemed complete. Nothing
contained herein shall be interpreted to prevent the approving
authority from making or causing to be made such independent studies,
calculations or other undertakings as it deems necessary in the review
of any application for development.
D. Design Standards. When an applicant determines that it is necessary to
utilize design standards other than those established herein, the
applicant shall apply for a waiver from the approving authority. Any
substitute standards should generally be nationally recognized, or in
accordance with the Residential Site Improvement Standards (RSIS).
Design standards not specifically authorized by the chapter or the RSIS
may not be utilized unless the approving authority grants a waiver.
E. Design Waivers. In certain instances, preexisting conditions or peculiar
conditions of the land may authorize the waiver of the design standards
contained in the chapter. The approving authority may consider and, for
cause shown, may waive strict conformance with design standards as
may be reasonable and within the general purpose and intent of this
chapter if compliance is impracticable or will exact undue hardship
because of peculiar conditions pertaining to the land.
A. Site plans and subdivisions shall conform to the design standards set
forth in this chapter.
B. The RSIS (N.J.A.C. 5:21-1 et seq.) shall govern those site improvements
within its scope and which are carried out, or intended or required to be
carried out, in connection with any application for residential

repaired, renovated and restored to comply with this section.
B. Massing. A building shall not be permitted to have a total measurement
greater than one hundred fifty (150) feet in length along any wall, roof
or footprint plane. Building wall offsets, including both projections and
recesses, shall be provided along any building wall measuring greater
than fifty (50) feet in length in order to provide architectural interest
and variety to the massing of a building and relieve the negative visual
effect of a single, long wall. The total measurement of such offsets shall
equal a minimum of ten percent (10%) of the building wall length. The
maximum spacing between such offsets shall be forty (40) feet. The
minimum projection or depth of any individual offset shall not be less
than two (2) feet. Roofline offsets shall be provided along any roof
measuring longer than seventy-five (75) feet in length in order to

building wall, may project out horizontally from the vertical building
wall plane and shall be ornamented with moldings, brackets and other
details that shall be appropriate to the architectural style of a building.
The middle section of a building may be horizontally divided at floor,
lintel or sill levels with belt courses. Building courses shall be
considered an integral part of the design of a building and shall be
architecturally compatible with the style, materials, colors, and details
of the building.
D. Continuity of Treatment. The architectural treatment of a facade or roof
shall be completely continued around all visibly exposed sides of a
building. All sides of a building shall be architecturally designed so as to
be consistent with regard to style, materials, colors and details.

architecturally compatible with the style, materials, colors and details
of such building. The minimum permitted roof pitch shall be eight
on twelve (8/12) and all gables on a building shall be of the same
pitch. A flat roof may be permitted on a building of a minimum of
two (2) stories in height, provided that all visibly exposed walls shall
have an articulated cornice that projects out horizontally from the
vertical building wall plane. A mansard roof may be permitted, but
only if such is located on the third story of a building, completely
and integrally enclosing such story. Flat or mansard roofs shall be
prohibited on all one (1) story buildings. Architectural embellishments
that add visual interest to roofs, such as dormers, belvederes, masonry
chimneys, cupolas, clock towers and such similar elements shall be
permitted, provided that such are architecturally compatible with the
style, materials, colors and details of the building.
F. Windows. Fenestration shall be architecturally compatible with the
style, materials, colors and details of a building. Windows shall be
vertically proportioned wherever possible the location of windows on
the upper stories of a building shall be vertically aligned with the
location of windows and doors on the ground level of such building.
Permitted retail and personal service business uses located in business
districts may have large pane display windows on the ground level,
provided that such window shall be framed by the surrounding wall and
shall not comprise greater than seventy-five percent (75%) of the total
ground level facade area of such building. All other windows shall be
double-hung or casement types. A building designed of an architectural
style that normally has windows with muntins or divided lights shall
utilize them. Such muntin or divided light grids may be the snap-on
type, if fitted on the exterior of the window or between the glazing of
the window units.
G. Entrances. All entrances to a building shall be defined and articulated
by utilizing such elements as lintels, pediments, pilasters, columns,
porticoes, porches, overhangs, railings, balustrades and other such
elements, where appropriate. Any such element utilized shall be
architecturally compatible with the style, materials, colors and details
of such building.
H. Physical Plant. All air conditioning units, HVAC systems, exhaust pipes
or stacks and elevator housing shall be shielded from view. Such
shielding shall be accomplished by utilizing the walls or roof of the
building or a penthouse-type screening device that shall be designed to
be architecturally compatible with the style, materials, colors and
details of such building.
I. Materials, Colors and Details. All materials, colors and details used on
the exterior of a building shall be architecturally compatible with the
style of such building, as well as with each other. A building designed of
an architectural style that normally includes certain integral materials,
colors and/or details shall have such incorporated into the design of

standards shall be used to prepare and review any site plan or
subdivision for apartment or townhouse. For the purpose of this
section, assisted living facilities shall not be considered residential
development.
1. Building Type Mix. In developments of twenty-five (25) or more
dwelling units, the mix of building types shall be such that not more
than fifty percent (50%) of the total number of dwelling units shall
be located in the same type of building. In developments of fifty
(50) or more dwelling units, the mix of building types shall be such
that not more than forty percent (40%) of the total number of
238. Editor's Note: Former Subsection L, Awnings and canopies, was repealed 11-19-2018 by
Ord. No. MC 2018-24.
§ 17:11-7 § 17:11-8
1:1222
dwelling units shall be located in the same type of a building. The
building type mix for each section or phase of a development plan
need not reflect the building type mix prescribed for the entire
development. In such cases, the Board shall require, as a condition
of final approval on a particular phase or section of a development
plan, the provision that future phases or sections shall bring the
building type mix into conformance with the above standards.

§ 17:11-14. Lot configuration. [MC 2002-29 § 17:11-14, December 2,
2002]
Subdivision and site plan layout shall be designed to encourage the
development of the land which, through the standards adopted in this
chapter, provide for flexibility in planning and development and that respect
the natural character of the land, its drainage system, soil capabilities,
groundwater and aquifer recharge quality, and to include only those uses
that are compatible with allowed uses in the zoning district and existing
uses on adjacent lands. Such compatibility shall be determined on the
basis of inventories of the natural features of the site, plans indicating
the physical relationship among types of uses and any natural or artificial
barriers, existing or planned, between different uses both within and
adjacent to the proposed development. Subdivision plans shall be designed
to meet these goals and the following guidelines:
§ 17:11-15. Parking.
D. Construction and Repair Specifications. All loading areas shall be
constructed or repaired to specifications as approved by the City
Engineer.
A. Sidelines of lots shall be at right angles or radial to the street lines,
unless a waiver from the rule will give a more practical and rational
street and lot plan.
B. Lots with double frontage and reverse corner lots shall be avoided
where practicable.
C. Where a subdivision borders on a railroad right-of-way, a major arterial
or collector, or any other major source of noise, the subdivision is to be
designed to reduce noise in residential lots to a reasonable level, and to
retain limited access to such facilities by such measures as a parallel
street, a landscaped buffer area, or lots with increased setbacks.
D. Lots shall ordinarily be rectangular in shape.
E. Pie slice-shaped lots are not permitted.
F. Flag-shape lots are not permitted.
G. Each lot must front upon an approved public street.
H. Where extra width has been dedicated, or proposed for dedication or
reservation, for the widening of existing streets, lots shall begin at such
new street line and all setbacks shall be measured from such line.
I. Where there is a question as to the suitability of a lot or lots for their
intended use due to environmental factors such as poor drainage
conditions or flood conditions, the Board having jurisdiction may
withhold approval of such lots. If approval is withheld, the Board shall
give reasons for such withholding on the record.
§ 17:11-13 § 17:11-15

§ 17:11-18. Sidewalk and walkway design standards. [MC 2002-29
§ 17:11-18, December 2, 2002]
6. All nonresidential uses shall be designed to have a temporary
designated refuse and recyclable storage area located within the
building occupied by such use. Such storage area may be located
anywhere within the interior of a building, including basements,
storage closets or attached garages, but shall not be situated in a
hallway or corridor necessary for internal circulation or emergency
access. Such area shall be designed to accommodate the average
accumulated volume of designated recyclables and refuse per
occupant per period of collection and any necessary storage
equipment.
B. Residential Uses.
1. All dwelling units shall be designed to have a temporary designated
recyclable and refuse storage area located either within the
interior of such unit in the kitchen, laundry room, basement or
storage closet or in an attached garage or private rear yard area.
2. Such area shall be designed to accommodate the average
accumulated volume of designated recyclables and refuse per
dwelling unit per period of collection and any necessary storage
equipment. The minimum size of such storage area shall be six (6)
square feet.
A. Location and Spacing. The Board may require shade trees to be massed
at critical points along the street, such as the visual termination of a
curve in the roadway. Planting sites shall be indicated on the
preliminary plat.
The placement and type of shade trees shall be such so as not to
interfere with below-grade utilities, roadways, sidewalks or
streetlights.
B. Specifications. Shade trees shall be planted at a minimum size of two
and one-half (1/2) inches in caliper, ten (10) feet to twelve (12) feet in
height and shall be planted according to accepted horticultural
standards. All shade trees to be planted shall be nursery-grown, or
substantially uniform size and shape and shall have straight trunks.
Ornamental trees need not have straight trunks, but must conform in all
other respects with the provisions for trees and tree plantings outlined
in this section. All shade trees shall be planted in a dormant state, or at
other times only with the approval of the Department of Public Works.
A. Applicability. This section shall apply to all site plan and subdivision
applications that involve the construction of a new public sidewalk or
§ 17:11-16 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 17:11-18
1:1237
private walkway or repair of an existing public sidewalk or private
walkway not regulated by the Residential Site Improvement Standards
(RSIS).
B. Pedestrian Circulation. Walkway systems shall promote pedestrian
activity both within the site itself and throughout the community by its
integration with the City sidewalk system. Walkways shall be separate
from motor vehicle circulation to the greatest extent possible and shall
provide a pleasant route for users that will promote enjoyment of the
site and encourage incidental social interaction among pedestrians.
C. Lot Access. Such access shall be designed for the safety, control,
efficient movement, convenience and encouragement of pedestrian
traffic into and out of the site and to promote pedestrian circulation
generally within the City.
D. Construction and Repair Specifications. All sidewalks and walkways
shall meet the construction or material specifications as set forth in
applicable City ordinances or as approved by the City Engineer. This
shall also apply to recommendations by the City Engineer regarding the
maintenance, repair or upgrading of existing sidewalks located in that
portion of the public right-of-way that directly abuts the tract to be
developed.
E. Materials. The Board may waive the paving material specifications
required by subsection D above, if the applicant can demonstrate that
the substitute paving materials will be architecturally compatible with
the style, materials, colors and details of buildings and other structures
on the site and adjacent properties and will create a more attractive
development generally. In no instance, however, shall a sidewalk
located in a public right-of-way be permitted to be constructed of
asphalt.
F. Public Sidewalks. Sidewalks shall be provided in the right-of-way along
all public and private streets. The location and width of sidewalks shall
be consistent with the location and width of existing sidewalks adjacent
to or near the site to be developed, but in no case shall be less than four
(4) feet in width.
G. Private Walkways. Walkways shall be located on a site to facilitate
pedestrian access between the public sidewalk, buildings, parking lots
and other facilities and to provide for pedestrian circulation generally
within a site. Where walkways abut the ends of parking spaces and
wheel stops are not provided, the minimum width of such walkways
shall be a minimum of five (5) feet in order to provide for the front ends
of vehicles to overhang onto such walkways with appropriate space
remaining for the passage of pedestrians. In no case shall a private
walkway be less than four (4) feet in width.

1:1238
§ 17:11-19. Soil conservation. [MC 2002-29 § 17:11-19, December 2,
2002]
The purpose of this section is to control unregulated and uncontrolled
excavation, removal, placement and movement of soil and other mineral
deposits that can result in conditions detrimental to the public health,
safety, and welfare. While State Soil Conservation Service regulations
control soil erosion and runoff for areas of disturbance in excess of five
thousand (5,000) square feet, much of the development in the City occurs
on small lots with less substantial areas of disturbance. Soil movement has
therefore been uncontrolled. This has resulted in soil runoff onto properties
adjacent to construction, muddy streets and blocked public ways, the
introduction of soil deposits into the City stormwater system, and the
removal of valuable topsoil. This regulation is an attempt to reduce such
harmful effects to the environment and character of the City.
A. All topsoil from disturbed areas of properties shall be set aside on the
premises separately from other subsoil. No such topsoil shall be
removed from a site. Topsoil moved during the course of construction
shall be redistributed on all regraded surfaces so as to provide at least
four inches (4) of even cover to all disturbed areas of the site and shall
be stabilized by seeding or planting in accordance with Soil
Conservation Service Standards.
B. Soil mounds are to be maintained on the property in a manner as to
prevent erosion onto adjacent properties. No soil is to be located so as
to block pedestrian access across the property within the public rightof-
way. Proper safeguards such as the placement of temporary
plantings and walls are to be taken by the contractor at all times to
insure such soil stabilization.
C. An appropriately sized refuse container shall be maintained at all times
on the subject property for use by the site contractor. All stumps and
other tree parts, litter, brush, weeds, excess or scrap building materials
or other debris shall be removed from the site and disposed of in
accordance with the law. No site generated waste shall be buried on
site except in accordance with N.J.A.C. 7:26-17 and the requirements of
the Construction Official. Subsoil removal from the property will be
accomplished in accordance with accepted Soil Conservation Service
methods and the requirements of the Construction Official. All
appropriate measures, including installation of stone tracking areas,
and the washing down of trucks, are to be taken if necessary to reduce
the potential for tracking mud into streets. Mud cannot be allowed to
flow into streets. The contractor will take all necessary actions required
by the Construction Official to eliminate site soil runoff.
D. Maximum efforts are to be taken during construction to preserve
existing plantings when deemed appropriate by the approving
authority. No material or temporary soil deposits are to be placed
within three (3) feet of shrubs or fifteen (15) feet of tree trunks
designated to be retained by the approving authority. Protective
§ 17:11-19 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 17:11-19
1:1239
§ 17:11-20. Architectural design standards in the TODD/CBD,
NAHD, CLAD, and PD Zones. [MC 2012-20, November 26, 2012]
barriers are to be installed around plants at the above distances that
are to remain on site during the construction. Plantings that are
designated to be retained but die within one (1) year of completed
construction activity are to be removed by the contractor and replaced,
either on site or in public areas, with plantings equal in caliper and type
to what was removed, or if that is unreasonable, with twice the number
of plants, but at the minimum size provided in this chapter at locations
approved by the approving authority.
E. The contractor is to advise the Construction Official in writing of the
intended soil conservation measures on site during construction. No
building permit for activities related to new construction is to be issued
by the Construction Official without this submission being made and
accepted.
F. Nothing in this section shall be construed to supersede or remove the
need to obtain Somerset-Union Soil Conservation Service approval
where required. Nothing in the above shall be construed to affect or
apply to any person engaged in a State mandated cleanup plan provided
that all operations are performed in accordance with the approved plan
and provided that notice of the cleanup plan is filed with the
Construction Official at least forty-eight (48) hours prior to the
commencement of any activity, and such activity is subject to inspection
by the Zoning Officer.
A. New buildings shall be oriented to the front yard and relate to public
rights-of-way or plazas, both functionally and visually. The primary
orientation of a building shall not be towards a parking lot.
B. Fire escapes shall be prohibited on the front façade of any building.
C. Buildings shall include, at ground level, design elements that
encourage pedestrian interest such as large windows, multiple entries
and clear signage.
D. Security grilles and doors found to be necessary for security purposes
must be at least sixty percent (60%) open construction to allow
visibility. Solid "rolling service doors" fabricated of interlocking slats or
panels with no openings are not permitted.
E. The intent of these standards is to create a historically appropriate and
architecturally attractive urban style of building construction sensitive
to the intended function and active use of the TODD. Towards that goal:
1. Buildings shall form a strong continuous street wall to define and
relate to the public space in front of them and along the street
frontage.
§ 17:11-19 § 17:11-20
1:1240
2. Buildings shall reflect the history of the City in their style and
materials.
3. Buildings shall directly contribute to the attractiveness, safety and
function of the street and public areas.
4. Buildings shall be designed to accommodate a range of uses over
time without the need to be demolished and rebuilt.
5. Buildings that accommodate retail at grade level shall emphasize
the retail component over the building's architectural character
and style.
6. Buildings shall be constructed in a manner and with materials that
are highly durable and will continue to look good over time,
especially adjacent to public and pedestrian areas.
7. It is the intent of this Code to encourage a variety of building and
design solutions in response to the standards and regulations
outlined herein.
F. Block Face. The intent of the adoption of specific regulations regarding
building walls is to create structures that have building facades that are
continuous to create a strong transition at the right-of-way line and to
contribute to the creation of an attractive pedestrian environment.
Realizing that goal requires the allowance of some limited variation and
opportunities for such uses as outside dining, pocket parks and special
building features.
1. Street facades shall contain continuous building frontage with the
exception of a midblock access to parking which is to be no greater
than thirty (30) feet or less than fifteen (15) feet in width, or less
than sixteen (16) feet in height for vehicular access and pedestrian
safety. Continuous building frontage shall be considered to be met
if eighty percent (80%) or more of the building façade is built to the
right-of-way line. The provisions in this paragraph do not apply to
the CLAD Zone when public open space is dedicated in the front
yard.
2. Facades shall be built parallel to the street frontage, except at
street intersections, where facades containing a primary building
entrance may be curved or angled toward the intersection for
historic or sight triangle purposes.
G. Building Form.
1. All buildings shall be designed and constructed so that they have a
distinct base, middle and top.
2. All windows shall have a vertical proportion.
3. Any building that is located at a corner of a street right-of-way
intersection in the TODD/CBD, NAHD, and CLAD Zones shall be
§ 17:11-20 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 17:11-20
1:1241
considered a hallmark building. Existing buildings with their
distinctive architectural features shall be preserved. New
structures shall be designed to take advantage of the location,
such as an accentuated entry and unique building articulation
that is offset from the front wall planes and extends above the
main building eave or parapet line. Corner entries may count as a
primary entry for both interesting streets.
4. Drive-through windows are prohibited due to the essential purpose
of the TODD Zones to enhance pedestrian access and reduce
vehicular conflicts.
5. Ground floors of buildings in the TODD/CBD, NAHD, CLAD and PD
Zones shall be designed to accommodate permitted use other than
residential uses. This design shall include placing entry doors at
grade with no elevated stoop, having clear glass windows
comprising no less than sixty percent (60%) of the ground floor
façade and interior ceiling clear heights no less than fourteen (14)
feet.
H. Architectural Features.
1. Buildings that are greater than four (4) stories in height shall be set
back at the fifth floor and above, at least twelve (12) feet behind the
building face of the first four (4) floors along street frontages.
2. Windows, except for retail at grade, shall be vertical in proportion
and have a minimum four-inch inset.
3. No glass curtain walls shall be permitted.
4. Each building and separate leased space at grade in the TODD/
NAHD Zone shall have a functioning primary entry from the public
right-of-way. Entries must be inset from the front building plane by
at least three (3) feet. Functioning entries must be located no
greater than seventy (70) feet apart.
I. External Façade Materials. The following shall apply to all exterior
walls of buildings and parking structures that are clearly visible from a
public street, walkway or open space.
1. The ground floor exterior walls, excluding windows, doors, and
other openings shall be faced with brick, stone, or cultured stone.
2. A minimum of eighty-five percent (85%) of exterior walls, excluding
windows, doors, and other openings, shall be faced with brick,
stone or cultured stone.
3. Fifteen percent (15%) of exterior walls, excluding windows, doors,
and other openings, shall be constructed of noncombustible
materials including exterior stucco and Class PB exterior insulating
and finishing systems (EIFS). Stucco and EIFS shall only be used
for walls, architectural features, and embellishments not subject to
§ 17:11-20 § 17:11-20
1:1242
§ 17:11-21. Pedestrian design standards in the TODD/CBD, NAHD,
CLAD, CD, and TD Zones. [MC 2012-12, November 26, 2012]
physical contact. In the TODD/TD, cementitious fiberboard may be
used for up to ten percent (10%) of the façade provided it is above
the ground floor.
4. Windows and glazing shall be limited to a minimum of thirty
percent (30%) and a maximum of seventy percent (70%) of each
front yard building elevation.
5. Unpainted metal, galvanized metal, or metal subject to ordinary
rusting, shall not be used as a building material. Factory finished
metal elements, as well as metals that develop an attractive
oxidized finish, such as copper or weathering steel, may be used as
architectural accents.
J. Color.
1. The dominant color of all buildings in the TODD/CBD, NAHD,
CLAD, and PD Zones shall be colors that coordinate with and
complement existing commercial architecture in those zones.
2. There are no restrictions on accent colors that comprise less than
0.5% of the building façade, except that fluorescent colors are
prohibited.
3. Light color, energy reflective roof colors are encouraged. Dark,
heat absorbing colors are prohibited. Reflective colors may be used
in conjunction with solar panels, which are encouraged on roof
areas, provided they are screened from public view. Any proposal to
install solar panels in the TODD/NAHD is subject to Historic
Preservation Commission review.
K. The ground floor of building adjacent to a right-of-way shall be designed
for a permitted use for a minimum depth of twenty-five (25) feet.
L. Structures in the TODD/TD Zone are not subject to the architectural
standards herein, but are subject to the applicable residential or
nonresidential architectural standards found elsewhere in the Land Use
Ordinance.
A. Pedestrian walkways shall be provided between bus stops and building
entrances and, where possible, between the downtown train station and
adjacent buildings.
B. The approving authority may require the provision of pedestrian rightof-
way easements with a minimum dimension of ten (10) feet through
the center of blocks that are more than six hundred (600) feet long in
order to provide convenient pedestrian access to transit stops,
shopping, the Green Brook or other community facilities.

ARTICLE XII
Stormwater Management
§ 17:12-1. Stormwater management requirements. [MC 2002.29
§ 17:12.1, December 2, 2002]
A. All development shall be provided with a stormwater management plan
consisting of, but not limited to, inlets, manholes and pipes where
necessary for proper surface drainage. The system shall be adequate to
carry off and/or store the stormwater and natural surface runoff, which
originates not only within the property in question, but also beyond the
tract boundaries.
B. Where possible, all runoff within a site shall ultimately leave the site in
the same watershed in which it originated and shall be released in such
a manner so as to not overload existing drainage systems, create
flooding creating a need for additional drainage facilities on other
public or private lands or increase predevelopment erosion of adjacent
lands.
C. The peak rate of runoff from a site during and after development shall
not exceed the predevelopment peak rate of runoff. Development
upstream of known areas of problem flooding shall be required to
further reduce the peak rate of runoff below the predeveloped rate.
Where the upstream tributary drainage area exceeds fifty (50) acres,
the standards established in the Technical Manual for Stream
Encroachment, N.J.A.C. 7:13-2.8, Stormwater Management, NJDEP,
shall govern.
D. The increase in volume of runoff from a site, during and after
development, from the predevelopment total of volume of runoff shall
be minimized. Runoff control measures shall be used to retard or
reduce -runoff and increase recharge. Depending on the soil
characteristics natural and artificial recharge area and systems should
be employed whenever practical to minimize the volume of surface
water runoff. These include, but are not limited to, infiltration pits, dry
wells, infiltration trenches and the extensive use of sheet flow through
vegetated areas. The use of such measures will not eliminate or reduce,
even partially, the need for other requirements of this section.
E. The peak rate of runoff for areas of up to twenty (20) acres shall be
calculated by the rational method or derivatives. The equation for the
rational method is as follows:
Qp = CIA
Where
Qp = The peak runoff rate in cubic feet per second (cfs).
C = The runoff coefficient.
§ 17:12-1 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 17:12-1
1:1249
I = The average rainfall intensity in inches per hour (in/hr), occurring
at the time of concentration Tc (min).
T = The time of concentration in minutes (min).
A = The size of the drainage area in acres (ac).
1. Typical runoff coefficients (C values) are provided in the Technical
Manual for Stream Encroachment, prepared by the New Jersey
Department of Environmental Protection (NJDEP), page 51, Table
3.1-2(B1). Runoff coefficient C used in the rational formula shall be
weighted if there is more than one (1) kind of land use within the
drainage basin under consideration.
2. The time of concentration (tc) is defined as the time required for
water to reach the point in question from the most hydraulically
distant point in the basin. Time of concentration (tc) shall be
estimated from the Nomograph for the Determination of Time of
Concentration, prepared by the State of New Jersey Highway
Authority. The analysis shall also consider the procedure outline in
Section 3.12(c) for Technical Release (TR) Number 55, Urban
Hydrology for Small Watersheds, United States Department of
Agriculture, Soil Conservation Series, as supplemented and
amended (SCS method).
3. Rainfall intensity as a function of duration and storm recurrence
frequency shall be based upon geographically appropriate data as
depicted in the plates in Technical Paper Number 25, Rainfall
Intensity Duration-Frequency Curves, United States Department of
Commerce, Weather Bureau, as supplemented and amended.
Intensity curves may be based on local rainfall frequency data,
where available. In all instances, a minimum time of concentration
of five (5) minutes should be used.
4. The peak rate of runoff for areas greater than twenty (20) acres
shall be calculated by hydrograph analysis method as outlined in
the latest edition of Urban Hydrology for Small Watersheds
Technical Release Number 55 (TR55).
F. Runoff Volume Calculation. Runoff volume shall be calculated by the
hydrograph analysis method as outlined in the latest edition of Urban
Hydrology for Small Watershed Technical Release Number 55 (SCS
method). This method shall be used for watersheds having drainage
areas greater than twenty (20) acres. For drainage areas of less than
twenty (20) acres, the rational method triangular hydrograph
approximation with the peak rate occurring at the time of concentration
and the end of the hydrograph at three (3) times the time of
concentration may be used as an alternative.
G. System Design.
§ 17:12-1 § 17:12-1
1:1250
1. Collection systems shall be designed to accommodate the intensity
for a storm frequency of once in ten (10) years for storm drainage
facilities located in or affecting streets of the rural, local and minor
collector classifications. A storm frequency of once in twenty-five
(25) years shall be utilized for systems affecting secondary arterial
and major collector streets as well as all open channels.
2. Hydraulic capacity for open channel or closed conduit flow shall be
determined by the Manning equation or charts/nomographs based
on the Manning equation. The hydraulic capacity is termed "Q" and
is expressed as discharge in cubic feet per second. The Manning
equation is as follows:
Qp = 1.486 AR 2/3
S1/2
n
Where
n = Manning's roughness coefficient.*
A = Cross-sectional area of flow in square feet.
R =
Hydraulic radius in feet (R = Q/P, where P is equal to
the wetted perimeter).
S = Slope of conduit in feet per foot.
*NOTE: The Manning roughness coefficients to be utilized are
shown in the Technical Manual for Stream Encroachment, NJDEP,
Table 3.2-11 (A-1).
3. Velocities in open channels at design flow shall not be less than
five-tenths (0.5) foot per second and not greater than that velocity
which will begin to cause erosion or scouring of the channel.
Permissible velocities for swales, open channels and ditches are
allowed for the appropriate soil type based on the Soil
Conservation Service Standards for Soil Erosion and Sediment
Control in New Jersey, as amended.
4. Velocities in closed conduits at design flow shall be at least two (2)
feet per second but not more than ten (10) feet per second.
5. No pipe size in the storm drainage system shall be less than fifteen
(15) inches in diameter.
6. All discharge pipes shall terminate with a precast concrete flared
end section or a cast-in-place concrete headwall with or without
wingwalls as conditions dictate.
7. The spacing of inlets shall be such that surface water shall not flow
for more than five hundred (500) feet or the quantity of water is
such that it caused ponding of water deeper than two (2) inches at
Type B and Type E inlets, whichever is the lesser distance. If due to
§ 17:12-1 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 17:12-1
1:1251
the slope of the approach prior to the inlet, eighty percent (80%)
of the stormwater does not enter the inlet, decreased spacing and
depth of water permissible shall be required. Sufficient inlets will
be placed to eliminate any flow exceeding two (2) cubic feet per
second across any roadway intersections or pedestrian crosswalk.
8. Dished gutters shall be permitted at any street intersection on rural
and local streets and at the intersection of rural and local streets
with minor collector streets and at the intersection of minor
collector streets with major collector streets where the street of the
lower classification is to be officially designated and signed as a
stop street. In such case, the dished gutter shall cross only the
street of the lower classification. At the intersections of primary
and secondary arterial streets and major collector streets,
sufficient catch basins, at the discretion of the reviewing agency,
shall be installed at each street intersection to avoid gutter
overflow and at low points in the street grade, and dished gutters
shall not be permitted.
9. Manhole spacing shall increase with pipe size. The maximum
spacing shall be five hundred (500) feet for fifteen (15) to eighteen
(18) inches; six hundred (600) feet for twenty-one (21) to thirty-six
(36) inches; and seven hundred (700) feet for forty-two (42) inches
and greater.
H. Construction Standards for Pipe.
1. Materials used in the construction of storm sewers shall be
constructed of reinforced concrete, ductile iron, corrugated
aluminum or corrugated steel unless site and other conditions
dictate otherwise. Reinforced concrete pipe shall be used unless
the applicant can demonstrate that the use of other materials will
be more beneficial due to the proposed installation. Cost will not be
a consideration in this analysis. Specifications referred to, such as
American Standards Association, American Society for Testing and
Materials, American Water Works Association, etc., should be the

§ 17:12-1 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 17:12-1
1:1253
I. Construction Standards for Inlets, Catch Basins and Manholes. Inlets,
catch basins and manholes shall be designed in accordance with State
Highway Department Standard Plans and Specifications. Frames shall
be Campbell Foundry Company Pattern Number 2541, 2548, with eightinch
curb face, and 3432, 3440, for Type E inlets, or approved equal. All

and the words "STORM SEWER" shall be cast integrally in the
cover.
J. Detention Facilities.
1. Development shall use the best available technology to
accommodate stormwater management by natural drainage
strategies as indicated in subsection D of this section.
2. Detention and all other stormwater management facilities shall
conform to the standards under the New Jersey Stormwater
Management Act, N.J.S.A. 40:55D-93 et seq.
3. Where detention facilities are deemed necessary, they shall
accommodate site runoff generated from two-year, ten-year and
one hundred-year storms considered individually, unless the
detention basin is classified as a dam, in which case the facility
must also comply with the Dam Safety Standards, N.J.A.C. 7:20.
These "design storms" shall be defined as either a twenty-four-hour
storm using the rainfall distribution recommended by the United
States Soil Conservation Service (such as United States Soil
Conservation Service, Urban Hydrology for Small Watersheds,
Technical Release Number 55) or as the estimated maximum
rainfall for the estimated time of concentration of runoff at the site
when using a design method such as the modified rational method.
Runoff greater than that occurring from the one hundred-year,
twenty-four-hour storm will be passed over an emergency spillway.
§ 17:12-1 § 17:12-1
1:1254
Detention will be provided such that, after development, the peak
rate of flow from the site will not exceed that by similar storms
prior to development.
4. In calculating the site runoff to be accommodated by a detention
facility, the method to be used is a tabular hydrograph method as
presented in TR Number 55 (SCS method), as supplemented and
amended. The pre-developed lands in the site shall be assumed to
be in good condition, if the lands are woods, or with conservation
treatment, if the land is cultivated, regardless of conditions existing
at the time of concentration.
5. Detention facilities shall be located as far horizontally from surface
water and as far vertically from groundwater as is practicable. A
complete soils report for the detention basins and surrounding
areas shall be submitted. The report should address the effect
groundwater will have on the construction and maintenance of the
detention basins.
6. Only one-half (1/2) of the area devoted to detention or retention
facilities shall be considered non-impervious surfaces in calculating
the maximum percentages as set forth in other sections of this
chapter. The area devoted shall be the area encompassed by the
depth of water to the emergency spillway, plus one (1) foot.
7. The top of the excavation or the toe of the outside slope shall be set
back twenty-five (25) feet from adjoining nonresidential property
lines and fifty (50) feet from an adjoining property line of a lot on
which there is a residential use. The edge of the design high water
for the detention basins shall be set back one hundred (100) feet
existing or proposed dwelling units.
8. The top of the excavation or the toe of the outside slope shall be set
back fifty (50) feet from the edge of the pavement from adjoining
roads and shall be set back twenty-five (25) feet from the adjoining
right-of-way line for any right-of-way dedicated for use as a public
road.
9. Dry Detention Basins. The following design standards shall apply to
all dry detention basins:
a. The maximum embankment side slopes shall have the ratio of
one (1) vertical to three (3) horizontal.
b. Basin bottom shall meet the following specifications:
(1) Traverse slope (to low flow channel); minimum two
percent (2%);
(2) Low flow channel if sodded: minimum slope two percent
(2%);
§ 17:12-1 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 17:12-1
1:1255
(3) Low flow channel if concrete; slope not less than one
percent (1%);
(4) Riprap low flow channel will not be accepted.
c. An area ten (10) feet wide with a maximum slope of two
percent (2%) shall be constructed at the top of the bank
surrounding the basin.
d. Vegetation stabilization cover shall be provided throughout the
basin and landscaping shall be provided on the perimeter of
the basin as approved by the Board's landscape architect.
e. The basin floor shall lie a minimum of two (2) feet above the
seasonal high groundwater table.
10. Wet detention/retention basins are discouraged. Wet basins may be
permitted only if no other above ground stormwater management
facility is feasible.
11. Underground detention/retention basins are discouraged.
Underground detention/retention basins may be permitted only if
no other above ground stormwater management facility is feasible.
K. Protecting Water Quality.
1. In addition to addressing water quantity generated by
development, a stormwater management system shall also enhance
the water quality of stormwater runoff.
2. In order to enhance water quality of stormwater runoff, stormwater
management shall provide for the control of a water quality design
storm. The water quality design storm shall be defined as the oneyear
frequency SCS Type III twenty-four-hour storm or a one and
twenty-five-hundredths-inch two-hour rainfall.
3. The water quality design storm shall be controlled by best
management practices. These include but are not limited to the
following:
a. In dry detention basins, provisions shall be made to ensure that
the runoff from the water quality design storm is retained such
that not more than ninety percent (90%) will be evacuated
prior to thirty-six (36) hours for all nonresidential projects or
eighteen (18) hours for all residential project. The retention
time shall be considered a brim-drawdown storage. The
retention time shall be reduced in any case which would
require an outlet size diameter of three (3) inches or less.
Therefore, three-inch diameter orifices shall be the minimum
allowed. The depth of the water quality storm should not
exceed two (2) feet in depth.
§ 17:12-1 § 17:12-1
1:1256
b. In permanent ponds or wet basins, the water quality
requirements of this section shall be satisfied where the
volume of permanent water is at least three (3) times the
volume of runoff produced by the water quality design storm.
L. Principal Outlets Quantity Control.
1. All principal outlet structures shall be concrete block or reinforced
concrete. All construction joints are to be watertight. The outlet
structure can consist of a riser, culvert pipe and/or weir outlet and
must be accessible from the buffer area/access road when the basin
is operational at full design flow for the 100-year design storm
event. To minimize the chance of clogging and to facilitate
cleaning, outlet openings, other than subsection K3a above, shall
be at least six (6) inches in diameter. Similarly, riser pipes, if
utilized, shall be at least eight (8) inches in diameter. All pipe joints
are to be watertight, reinforced concrete pipe. In addition, trash
racks and/or antivortex devices may be required where deemed
necessary by the City. Outlet control structures should be protected
by maintenance free trash racks. Trash racks should be designed to
be on an incline with a clear opening area large enough so that
debris buildup does not impede the area of the opening it protects.
The trash rack should be a hinged rack and should avoid moving
parts. It should be able to be opened to gain access for cleaning the
outlet pipe, and should be made of a noncorrosive material
(stainless steel or aluminum).
2. Eight-inch thick antiseep collars are to be installed along outlet
pipes. Such collars shall be constructed of reinforced concrete with
minimum Number 5 bars, each way, and two (2) inches of cover.
3. Where applicable, a concrete cradle shall be provided for outlet
pipes.
4. Suitable lining shall be placed upstream and downstream of
principal outlets as necessary to prevent scour and erosion. Such
lining shall conform to the criteria contained in Standards for Soil
Erosion and Sediment Control in New Jersey, published by the New
Jersey State Soil Conservation Committee.
5. All outlet facilities shall be designed to prevent the potential hazard
of a child's or an adult's either being carried into the opening or
being held against the outlet by the pressure of the flowing stream
waters, even during a one hundred-year storm.
6. Safe outlet structure design can encompass either outlet risers,
gratings, trash racks or other means that, in the opinion of the
Planning or Zoning Board, provide the desired level of safety.
7. Outlet structures should be designed to facilitate outlet operation
and maintenance as the water level rises and to permit clearing
either during or after a storm. Structural support members, steps,
§ 17:12-1 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 17:12-1
1:1257
rungs or ladders should be provided to allow easy escape
opportunities for a child or an adult without having these support
members, ladders, etc., impede the clearing of trash from the
outlet structure or the upward movement of trash from the outlet
structure or the upward movement of trash as the water level rises.
8. The use of thin metal plates for trash rack bars, hand hold supports,
sharp crested weirs or orifices are prohibited because of the
potential for accidents. Wire mesh fabric is similarly prohibited due
to its poor suitability for trash clearance.
9. Any outlet protective facility should have lockable hinged
connections providing adequate access to thoroughly clean the
area enclosed by the structure and to facilitate removal of
accumulated debris and sediment around the outlet structure.
10. The outlet protective structure should have negligible influence
upon the hydraulic performance of the outlet structure.
11. All outlet structures shall be structurally sound and shall be
designed to withstand, without failure or permanent deformation,
all structural loads, hydrostatic, dynamic or otherwise, which
impact upon it during the design life of the installation. They shall
be maintenance free to the maximum extent possible.
12. The detention/retention basin side slope walls shall be graded to
slopes no greater than three (3) horizontal to one (1) vertical for a
distance no less than twenty-five (25) feet on all sides of the outlet
structure.
13. Other means of attaining the same outlet safety condition, such as
inaccessible outlet locations, weirs, cascades, etc., will be
considered as approvable if the same goals were attained.
14. Existing basins and outlet structures shall be revised by the
respective responsible owners to comply with the above-defined
goals within one (1) year of the enactment of this amendment.
M. Principal Outlets Quality Control.
1. Based upon the requirement limiting the size of the outlet to a
minimum of six (6) inches in diameter, water quality control shall
be maintained by providing an amount of storage equal to the total
amount of runoff which will be produced by the one-year frequency
SCS Type III twenty-four-hour storm or a one and twenty-fivehundredths-
inch, two-hour rainfall at the bottom of the proposed
detention basin along with a minimum three-inch diameter outlet.
2. The invert(s) of the principal outlet(s) used to control the larger
storms for flood control purposes should be set at the elevation of
the water surface elevation required to produce the water quality
storage volume. Therefore, the principal outlets would be utilized
§ 17:12-1 § 17:12-1
1:1258
for storms in excess of the one and twenty-five-hundredths-inch,
two-hour event which, in turn, would be completely controlled by
the lower three (3) inch outlet. If the above requirements would
result in a pipe smaller than three (3) inches in diameter, the period
of retention shall be waived so that three (3) inches will be the
minimum pipe size used. It should be remembered that, in all cases,
the basin should be considered initially empty (i.e., the storage
provided for the quality requirements and the discharge capacity
of its outlet should be utilized during the routing of the larger flood
control storms).
N. Emergency Spillways.
1. Vegetated emergency spillways shall have side slopes not
exceeding three (3) horizontal to one (1) vertical.
2. Emergency spillways not excavated from noncompacted soil shall
be suitably lined and shall comply with criteria contained in
Standards for Soil Erosion and Sediment Control.
3. Maximum velocities in emergency spillways shall be checked based
on the velocity of the peak flow in the spillway resulting from the
routed emergency spillway hydrograph. Where maximum velocities
exceed those contained in Standards for Soil Erosion and Sediment
Control in New Jersey, suitable lining shall be provided.
O. Dams and Embankments.
1. The minimum top widths of all dams and embankments are listed
below. These values have been adopted from the Standards for Soil
and Sediment Control in New Jersey, published by the New Jersey
State Soil Conservation Committee.
MINIMUM TOP WIDTHS FOR DAMS & EMBANKMENTS
Height (feet) Top Width (feet)
0-15 10
15-20 12
20-25 14
2. The design top elevation of all dams and embankments after all
settlement has taken place shall be equal to or greater than the
maximum water surface elevation in the basin resulting from the
routed freeboard hydrograph. Therefore, the design height of the
dam or embankment, defined as the vertical distance from the top
down to the bottom of the deepest cut, shall be increased by the
amount needed to ensure the design top elevation will be
maintained following all settlement. This increase shall not be less
than five percent (5%). Where necessary, the Engineer shall require
consolidation tests of the undisturbed foundation soil to more
accurately determine the necessary increase.
§ 17:12-1 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 17:12-1
1:1259
3. Maximum side slopes for all dams and embankments are three (3)
horizontal to one (1) vertical.
4. All earth fill shall be free from brush, roots and other organic
material subject to decomposition.
5. Cutoff trenches are to be excavated along the dam or embankment
center line to impervious subsoil or bedrock.
6. Safety ledges shall be constructed on the side slopes of all
detention basins having a permanent pool of water. The ledges
shall be four (4) to six (6) feet in width and located approximately
two and one-half (2-1/2) to three (3) feet below and one (1) to one
and one-half (1-1/2) feet above the permanent water surface.
7. The fill material in all earth dams and embankments shall be
compacted to at least ninety-five percent (95%) of the maximum
density obtained from compaction tests performed by the
appropriate method in ASTM D698.
8. The top of bank for facilities constructed in cut and the toe of slope
for facilities constructed in fill shall be located no closer than ten
(10) feet to an existing or proposed property line.
9. Detention basins shall be sodded, attractively buffered and
landscaped and designed as to minimize propagation of insects,
particularly mosquitoes. All landscaping and buffering shall be
approved by the City.
P. Detention Facilities in Flood Hazard Areas. There will be no detention
basins in the floodway except for those on-stream and shall comply with

1. Responsibility for operation and maintenance of detention
facilities, including periodic removal and disposal of accumulated
particulate material and debris, shall remain with the owner or
owners of the property with permanent arrangements that it shall
pass to any successive owner, unless assumed by a government
agency. If portions of the land are to be sold, legally binding

§ 17:12-1 § 17:12-1

established entity to be permanently responsible for maintenance,
hereinafter in this section referred to as the "responsible person."
2. Prior to granting final approval to any project subject to review
under this section, the applicant shall enter into an agreement with
the municipality (or County) to ensure the continued operation and
maintenance of the detention facility. This agreement shall be in a
form satisfactory to Corporation Counsel and may include, but may
not necessarily be limited to, personal guaranties, deed
restrictions, covenants and bonds. In cases where property is
subdivided and sold separately, a homeowners, association or
similar permanent entity should be established as the responsible
entity, absent an agreement by a governmental agency to assume
responsibility.
a. An applicant seeking approval for construction of a detention
facility shall provide the funds necessary to permanently
maintain the facility. The amount necessary to permanently
maintain the facility shall be calculated by the Planning Board
Engineer based upon current estimates for maintenance with
an annual increase of four percent (4%). The Planning Board
Engineer shall also assume that the investment will yield a
return equal to the ninety-day certificate of deposit interest
rate paid by the City fiduciary institution or its successor on
the date the calculation is made.
b. The form of security for the maintenance of the facility shall be
approved by Corporation Counsel.
3. In the event that the detention facility becomes a danger to public
safety or public health or if it is in need of maintenance, the
municipality shall so notify in writing the responsible person. From
that notice, the responsible person shall have fourteen (14) days to
effect such maintenance and repair of the facility in a manner that
is approved by the City Engineer or his designee. If the responsible
person fails or refuses to perform such maintenance and repair, the
municipality may proceed to do so and shall bid the cost thereof to
the responsible person.
S. Division of Coastal Resources.
1. All projects containing stream encroachments within the flood
hazard area and one hundred-year floodplain, at locations having a
drainage area of over fifty (50) acres and all projects of special
concern, as defined in N.J.A.C. 7:13-5, are subject to the approval of

to secure proper drainage away from buildings and to prevent the
collection of stormwater in pools.
V. For both major and minor subdivisions, land subject to periodic or
occasional flooding (floodplain areas) shall not be plotted for residential
occupancy nor for any other purpose which may endanger life or
property or aggravate the flood hazard. Such land within a plat shall be
considered for open spaces or other similar uses.
W. Where a minor or major subdivision is traversed by a watercourse,
surface or underground drainage way or drainage system, channel or
stream, there shall be provided and dedicated a drainage right-of-way
easement to the City conforming substantially with the lines of such
watercourse and of such further width or construction, or both, as will
be adequate to accommodate expected stormwater runoff, fifteen (15)
feet beyond the bank top on at least one (1) side for access to the
drainage right-of-way and, in any event, meeting any minimum widths
and locations shown on the adopted official map or master plan. Such
easement dedication shall be expressed on the plat as follows:
"Drainage and utility right-of-way easement granted to the City of
Plainfield." No relocation, construction or reconstruction shall take
place within the area of the easement, nor shall any structures be
located within such area, nor shall any action be taken which may alter
or impair the effectiveness of present or future drainage facilities or
cause soil erosion without prior approving authority or City Council
approval.
X. Prohibitions on the Discharge of Storm Drainage and Groundwater.
1. Stormwater, groundwater, rainwater, street drainage, subsurface
drainage or yard drainage shall not be discharged through direct or
indirect connections of a sump pump, cellar drain or any other
means of conveyance into a community sanitary sewer owned or
operated by the Plainfield Municipal Utility Authority (PMUA) or
any sewerage authority.

section shall be fined not less than fifty ($50.00) dollars for a first

shall be held in trust by the City in an interest bearing account in a
banking or savings and loan institution in New Jersey. This institution
shall be insured by an agency of the Federal government. The Chief
Financial Officer shall notify the applicant in writing of the name and
address of the institution or depository in which the deposit is made and
the amount of the deposit. If the amount of interest exceeds one
hundred ($100.00) dollars, the entire amount shall belong to the
applicant and shall be refunded to him/her by the Chief Financial
Officer annually or at the time the deposit is repaid or applied to the
purposes for which it was deposited. The City may retain for

approving authority. The application review and inspection charges
shall be limited to professional charges for review of applications,
review and preparation of documents and inspections of developments
under construction and review by outside consultants when an
application is of a nature beyond the scope of the expertise of the
professionals normally utilized by the City. The only costs that shall be
added to any such charges shall be typical out-of-pocket expenses of
any such professionals or consultants incurred in processing
applications and conducting inspections. The City or approving
authority shall not bill the applicant for any municipal clerical or
administrative functions, overhead expenses, meeting rooms charges,
or any other municipal costs and expenses except as provided for
N.J.S.A. 40:55D-53, nor shall any municipal professional add such
charges to any bill. If the salary, staff support and overhead for a
professional are provided by the City, the charge shall not exceed two
hundred percent (200%) of the sum of the products resulting from
multiplying (1) the hourly base salary of each of the professionals,
which shall be established annually by ordinance by (2) the number of
hours spent by the respective professional on the review of the
§ 17:13-20 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 17:13-20

fees and charges shall be at the same rate as all other work of the same
nature performed by the professional for the municipality when fees are
not reimbursed or otherwise imposed on applicants or developers.

result in the placement of a lien on the property for payment as per

1. An applicant is to submit the above required escrow amount to the
appropriate Board Secretary at the time of submission, and as part
of the concept plan or preliminary application. The review of the
adequacy of this fee shall be a component of the completeness
review conducted by the administrative officer. Prior to making a
determination of completeness upon any application, the
administrative officer shall review said application to determine
whether the escrow amount submitted is sufficient. If the
administrative officer determines that the submitted amount is
insufficient to cover professional costs anticipated by the
application, appropriate additional funds shall be deposited by the
applicant prior to the administrative officer declaring the
application complete. The application shall not be declared
complete or placed on an agenda for public hearing until such time
as all escrow fees deemed sufficient are submitted.
2. Each applicant for subdivision, site plan, variance, or for an appeal,
interpretation, or other action authorized by this chapter, shall
agree, in writing, at the time of the first submission of an
application for development, to pay all reasonable costs for
professional review of the application. This includes all costs
incurred with any informal review of a concept plan that may have
preceded the submission of a preliminary application. Additionally,
each applicant shall agree, in writing, to pay all reasonable costs
for the municipal inspection of the constructed improvement. All
such costs for review and inspection must be paid before any
construction permit is issued.
3. Each payment charged to a deposit made for the review of
applications, the review and preparation of documents, and
inspections of improvements shall be pursuant to a voucher from
the professional. That voucher shall identify the personnel
performing the services and, for each date, the services performed,
the hours spent to one-quarter (1/4) hour increments, the hourly
rate, and the expenses incurred.
4. All professionals shall submit vouchers to the Chief Financial
Officer of the City on a monthly basis in accordance with schedules
and procedures established by the Chief Financial Officer.

employee shall prepare and submit to the Chief Financial Officer of
the City a statement, on a monthly basis, containing the same
information as required on a voucher.

statements submitted to the Chief Financial Officer of the City
simultaneously to the applicant. The Chief Financial Officer of the
City shall prepare and send the applicant a statement including an
accounting of funds listing all deposits, interest earnings,
disbursements, and the cumulative balance of the escrow accounts.
§ 17:13-20 § 17:13-20
1:1272
This information shall be provided to the applicant on a quarterly
basis if monthly charges are one thousand ($1,000.00) dollars or
less, or on a monthly basis if monthly charges exceed one thousand
($1,000.00) dollars.
7. If an escrow account or deposit contains insufficient funds to
enable the City or approving authority to perform required
application reviews or improvement inspections, the Chief
Financial Officer of the City shall provide the applicant with a
notice of the insufficient escrow or deposit balance. An applicant
should not be entitled to proceed with the application or any
development until such time as the necessary funds are posted to
ensure payment of professional fees.
8. In order for work to continue on the development or the
application, the applicant shall within a reasonable time period
post a deposit to the account in an amount to be agreed upon by the
City or approving authority and the applicant. In the interim, any
required health and safety inspections shall be made and charged
back against the replenished deposit.
9. Further additional escrow deposit fees may be required upon
determination by the administrative officer that additional deposits
as authorized under this chapter are reasonably required. All
approvals shall be conditioned upon receipt of such additional fees.
No building permit or certificate of occupancy shall be issued until
the Chief Financial Officer has received all required escrow
accounts funds.
H. The following closeout procedures shall apply to all deposits and
escrow accounts and shall commence after the approving authority has
granted final approval and signed the subdivision plat or site plan, in
the case of application review escrow's and deposits, or after the
improvements have been approved, in the case of improvement
inspection escrow and deposits:
1. The applicant shall send written notice by certified mail to the

a final bill to the Chief Financial Officer of the City within thirty (30)
days, and shall send a copy simultaneously to the applicant.

4. An applicant or his authorized agent shall submit the appeal in

receipt of the informational copy of the professional's voucher,
except that if the professional has not supplied the applicant with
an informational copy of the voucher, then the applicant shall file
his appeal within sixty (60) days from receipt of the municipal
statement of activity against the deposit or escrow account.
6. An applicant may file an appeal for an ongoing series of charges by
a professional during a period not exceeding six (6) months to
demonstrate that they represent a pattern of excessive or
inaccurate charges. An applicant making use of this provision need
not appeal each charge individually.
7. During the pendency of any appeal, the municipality or approving
authority shall continue to process, hear, and decide the application
for development, and to inspect the development in the normal
course, and shall not withhold, delay, or deny reviews, inspections,
signing of subdivision plats or site plans, the reduction or release of
performance or maintenance guarantees, the issuance of
construction permits or certificates of occupancy, or any other

of the appropriate escrow account or deposit for which an appeal
§ 17:13-20 § 17:13-20
1:1274
has been filed. If a charge is disallowed after payment, the Chief
Financial Officer shall reimburse the deposit or escrow account in
the amount of such disallowed charge or refund the amount to the
applicant. If a charge is disallowed after payment to a professional
or consultant who is not an employee of the municipality, the
professional or consultant shall reimburse the municipality in the
amount of any such disallowed charge.
J. General Provisions.
