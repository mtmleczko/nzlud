PREFACE 
    This Code constitutes a complete publication of the general and permanent ordinances of the City of Fargo, North Dakota. 
    Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the original Code prepared by the office of the city attorney, and ordinances subsequently adopted by the City of Fargo. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the original Code. By use of the comparative table appearing in the back of this Code, the reader can locate any section of the Fargo Municipal Code, as supplemented, and any subsequent ordinance included therein. 
Index 
    The index has been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the index itself which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which the user is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
    A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up to date. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited, and the affected page or pages will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
    Keeping this publication up to date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. As revised pages are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
Acknowledgments 
    This publication was under the direct supervision of Dennis Sinnett, Vice President, Stephanie Benesh, Editor, and April McDermid, Proofreader, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida. Credit is gratefully given to the other members of the publisher's staff for their sincere interest and able assistance throughout the project. 
    The publisher is most grateful to Mr. Erik R. Johnson, City Attorney, and Ms. Jackie Faith, Secretary to the City Attorney, for their cooperation and assistance during the progress of the work on this publication. It is hoped that their efforts and those of the publisher have resulted in a Code of Ordinances which will make the active law of the city readily accessible to all citizens and which will be a valuable tool in the day-to-day administration of the city's affairs.

Article 4 - Initiative and Referendum 
    The electors of the city of Fargo reserve to themselves the right to initiate ordinances that comply with the powers vested in the city. If the governing body refuses to enact an initiated ordinance, as provided in this charter, the proposal shall be submitted to the voters for approval or rejection. 
    The electors also reserve the right to refer an ordinance enacted by the governing body. If the governing body fails to repeal the referred ordinance, the ordinance will be suspended until the voters approve or reject the ordinance. 
    The rights of initiative and referendum are secured to the people of Fargo, no matter what form of government is provided by the Fargo home rule charter or state law. 
A.  Requirements for petitions for initiative, referendum and charter amendments are the same. The petitions must identify by name and voting address three members of the petitioners' committee responsible for circulating and filing the petitions. The petitions must include the full text of the ordinance or charter amendment being initiated, or the ordinance being referred. The number of valid petition signers must equal or exceed 15% of the number of voters who voted for mayor in the most recent city election at which that office was filled. The petitions must show the date of signing, signature of the elector, and his/her voting address. The circulator of each petition shall sign an affidavit on the petition affirming that he/she witnessed the signing of all names on the petition and believes that the signers are qualified electors. 
B.  The city auditor or city official designated by the governing body shall determine the validity and sufficiency of the signatures. If he finds irregularities, he shall notify the sponsor's committee and allow ten days for correction. The city official shall notify the governing body of his decision and certify the petitions as valid to the governing body when they meet the criteria set forth in this charter. 
C.  If the petitions for an initiated ordinance are sufficient and valid, the proposed ordinance shall be submitted to the governing body. The governing body may enact the ordinance without change or submit the initiated ordinance to the voters for approval or rejection. If the measure is not enacted within 21 days after the petitions are certified as valid and sufficient, the ordinance shall be put up for approval or disapproval by the voters. The election may be held no sooner than 60 days after the petitions are ruled valid. 
D.  Petitions to refer an ordinance must be filed within ten days of the effective date of the ordinance. If the designated city official finds the petitions valid and sufficient, the referred ordinance shall be suspended. The ten days allowed for correction of petition irregularities shall not be used to add names and signers to the petition. The annual city budget ordinance is exempt from the referendum process. The governing body may either repeal a referred ordinance or submit the ordinance to the voters at the next city-wide election occurring 60 days after the petitions are ruled valid. Referendum petitions may be filed against individual sections and subsections of an ordinance; if so, the remainder of the ordinance remains in effect. 
E.  The question for both initiated and referred ordinances on the election ballot shall be: "Shall this ordinance be approved?" If there is a majority of "Yes" votes, the ordinance is enacted and becomes effective ten days after the election results are certified. If the "No" votes are in majority, the ordinance is rejected. 
F.  Initiated or referred ordinances proposed by a Petition and adopted by a vote of the voters cannot be repealed or amended except by a vote of the voters so long as the City of Fargo remains under the commission system of government. This article is self-executing and all of its provisions are mandatory. Ordinances may be enacted to facilitate and safeguard, but not to hamper, restrict or impair these powers. 
Article 5 - Amendment or repeal of charter 
    This Fargo Home Rule Charter may be amended or repealed only by a majority of the electorate voting on charter proposals submitted to them.

The proposed amendment shall be published in the official newspaper of the city at least 60 days prior to the election at which the matter will be decided. 
B.  Fargo citizens also reserve to themselves the right to amend or repeal this home rule charter by the initiative process. Petitions for such purpose must conform to the rules prescribed in this charter on initiative and referendum of ordinances. 
C.  The complete amendment must be printed on the petitions. When petitions to amend or repeal are certified as valid, a proposal must be submitted to the voters at the next city-wide election occurring at least 60 days after publication of the petition in the official newspaper of the city. The ballot question shall be "Shall such amendment be approved?" If there is a majority of "Yes" votes of those voting on the matter, the charter amendment becomes effective ten days after the election results are certified. 
D.  If either the governing body or an initiative petition seeks to repeal the Fargo Home Rule Charter, the ballot proposal must establish the form of government which would replace the system established by this charter.

The city may defray the expense of improvements by special assessments for the promotion of business activity and new business development in The Area through any means not inconsistent with the purposes of this ordinance including, but not limited to, advertising, public information, marketing, decoration of public places, promotion of public events, furnishing of music in any public place, providing professional management, planning and promotion, and the general promotion of trade activities. In planning an improvement project under this ordinance, the board of city commissioners may include any work on materials which are deemed necessary or reasonably incidental to the project. Financing methods may include, but not be limited to, assessing the costs and expense of the projects upon benefited property owners within The Area consistent with the provisions of chapters 40-22, 40-22.1, or 40-23 of the North Dakota Century Code and subject to the provisions of this ordinance. Prior to proceeding with the initial assessment district to include the entire Area, there must be an affirmative vote of 60% of assessable property owners responding to a preliminary notice mailed by city to all assessable property owners in The Area. The purpose of the notice is to show a positive affirmation to city prior to establishing the district and not to replace the legal requirements for establishing a special assessment district, including publication of the resolution declaring improvements necessary. Calculation of the percentage of affirmative or negative responses to said notice shall be based on the same formula as will be utilized in assessing benefits. Any subsequent special assessment district established will be in accordance with chapters 40-22 and 40-22.1 N.D.C.C. Assessment of the costs of any district will be done under the methods currently permissible under North Dakota state law. Financing methods may also include, but not be limited to, voluntary assessments and tax increment financing. The initial special assessment district will be created to generate revenues sufficient to fund an annual budget of $300,000 for the years 1998 through 2000.

Upon receipt of a 60% affirmative response to the preliminary notice referred to in  3-1804 above, the city may proceed to establish the initial improvement district utilizing the powers and procedures set forth in chapters 40-22 and 40-22.1, N.D.C.C. Any subsequent project will require a request therefor and if satisfied with the percentage of owners, the city may proceed to establish such special assessment district. Any district created shall include only property devoted in whole or in part to commercial or business use and income-producing rental property, and shall not include owner-occupied dwelling units including owner-occupied residential condominium units. Assessment of benefits will be governed by all of the provisions of chapters 40-22 or 40-22.1, N.D.C.C. Protests against the resolution of necessity shall be governed by the provisions of chapter 40-22, N.D.C.C., except as otherwise provided herein. In addition to the required published notice, mailed notice will be given to all affected property owners as shown on the records of the city assessor's office. If the board of city commissioners finds the protest to contain the names of the owners of at least 40% of assessable property (as calculated hereinafter) within any separate property area included within the district, the protest bars proceeding with the applicable portion of the improvement project, but does not bar proceeding with the remainder of the improvement project or assessing the cost of the improvement project against other areas within the proposed district, unless the protest represents a majority of the entire district. Calculation of the percentage of protest shall be based on the same formula as will be utilized in assessing benefits. Termination of proceedings does not relieve the city of responsibility for payment of costs incurred. The city is not responsible for payment of costs incurred and may require a deposit for costs. Payment of the costs incurred for such a barred improvement project must be as provided in  3-1802. For payment of costs incurred for a barred improvement project proposed by the city of Fargo, the city may, if available funds are insufficient, issue its certificates of indebtedness or warrants, or levy a tax which shall be considered a tax for a portion of the costs of a special improvement project by general taxation within the meaning of  57-15-10 of the North Dakota Century Code. If the protests are found to be insufficient or invalid, the board of city commissioners may cause the improvement to be made, levy and collect necessary assessments, and contract for the improvement and acquisition of necessary property or services.

The examination shall be made upon the board's own motion following the application of said member, or a person acting on the member's behalf stating that said member is physically or mentally incapacitated for the performance of duty and ought to be retired and provided said member shall have been credited with ten or more years of continuous city service or shall have become physically or mentally incapacitated in the line of duty, provided, however, that the board of trustees, in its discretion, may accept, receive and consider any information pertaining to an employee's possible disability which may have been received under section 7-0305 of the Revised Ordinances of the city of Fargo.

6-0125. - Members entitled to pension-Conditions- Amount. 
  
A.  1.  Any member of the police pension fund who while a member of such fund, shall suffer permanent mental or physical disability as determined in accordance with section 6-0119 of this article, so that he or she is unable to discharge his or her duties shall be entitled to be retired and upon retirement shall be paid a monthly pension equal to 45% of the average monthly salary received during the highest paid consecutive 36-month period prior to such disability retirement. Any member who, at the time of being granted the disability retirement referred to herein, shall have served in the police department more than 20 years, shall upon attaining 88 points as defined in subsection (3) hereinafter, and if still on disability retirement, be entitled to an adjustment of their pension benefit and shall receive from that date a monthly pension benefit equal to 2% of the average monthly salary received during the highest paid consecutive 36-month period prior to the member's disability retirement multiplied by the years of service in the police department at the time said member actually retired on disability pension not to exceed 30 years. 
2.  For members retiring after the effective date of this ordinance (July 25, 1983), in addition to the pensions provided for in the foregoing subsections, each such retiree shall receive an additional $250 per month provided, however, that those retirees having less than 30 years of service shall receive such percentage of $250 per month as the years of their service bear to 30 years, and further provided that those members on disability retirement prior to the adoption of this ordinance shall not be entitled to any portion of such additional $250 per month. 
3.  After October 1, 1985, any member may retire at such time as he or she attains at least 78 points provided such member shall have attained at least 20 years of service. Points will be assigned as follows: One point will be assigned for each year of the member's age and one point will be assigned for each year of the member's service with the Fargo police department. Years of service and age will be calculated to the nearest six months (i.e. six months or more will constitute a completion of that year of service or that year of the member's age). If a member shall have attained 88 points, said member shall receive a full pension equal to 60% of the average monthly salary received during the highest paid consecutive 36-month period prior to retirement. In addition, said member shall receive the additional $250 per month provided for in the preceding subsection. For those members retiring with less than 88 points, the full pension will be reduced by 1/24th for each point less than 88. The additional $250 per month provided for in the preceding subsection shall be payable at the rate of $8.33 per month times each year of service but not to exceed a maximum of said $250. A table showing the various retirement benefits payable at points ranging from 78 to 88 will be maintained by the board of trustees and shall be open to inspection by members of the Fargo police fund. Any member terminating employment prior to attaining 78 points will be ineligible for retirement benefits unless said member has served at least 20 years. Such member's points would be determined by adding their years of service as of their termination date to their age when benefits commence. 
4.  Members reaching the age of 50 years may retire and shall receive a pension equal to 2.65 percent (effective January 1, 2004) of the member's average monthly salary received during the highest paid consecutive 36-month period prior to retirement times the years of said member's service. In addition, said member shall receive an additional sum per month equal to $8.33 per month times each year of service but not to exceed a maximum of $250 per month. Members joining the pension system prior to August 1, 1990, shall have the option of selecting the pension benefits provided under this subsection or the pension provided for in the preceding subsection, at the election of such member at the time of retirement. The retirement benefits provided for hereunder shall, however, be mandatory for persons joining the police pension system after August 1, 1990. Notwithstanding the actual date of adoption, the provisions of this subsection shall be effective for members retiring after July 1, 2000. 
5.  Members retiring after May 1, 1989, may request joint survivorship benefits for his or her designee. The amount of the survivor's monthly benefit and the diminution in the amount of the retiree's monthly benefit shall be determined by actuarial principals. Retiree may, at his or her option, elect to accept the reduced monthly benefit and the survivor benefit, as an alternative to the benefit otherwise determined in accordance with this article; provided, however, that should the retiree's designee die prior to the death of the retiree, the benefit shall revert back to the original amount of the benefit. Joint survivorship must be applied for at the time retirement benefits are requested. The member's designee will be required to sign an affidavit acknowledging the member's option regarding joint survivorship. 
B.  Any member who has reached retirement age and actually retires shall be entitled to be paid the amount of pension benefits in effect at the time such member actually leaves the employ of the police department. In addition, the board of trustees pursuant to section 6-0115 of this article may adopt rules and regulations providing for additional payments to retirees from any excess interest earnings as determined by the said board of trustees provided, however, that in any one year, such additional payments shall not exceed a sum equal to two month's pension received by the retiree, and further provided that retirees have been retired for one complete year before any such additional sums are paid out to said retirees. The foregoing monthly pension together with the additional payment referred to, if any, shall continue from the member's retirement date and shall end with the last monthly payment due prior to the member's death. In the event a member or their beneficiaries, if any, die before the aggregate amount of pension payments received equal the total amount of the member's contributions made to the retirement plan (with such interest as is provided for in section 6-0116 hereof), the difference between the total amount of the member's contributions and the aggregate amount of pension benefit received by the member and beneficiaries, if any, shall be paid in a single lump sum to the person or persons designated by the member. 
C.  Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions, members having at least ten years of service and leaving the employment of the Fargo police department prior to age 50, may retire and receive pension benefits upon reaching the age of 50 years as provided herein. Those members shall receive a pension presently equal to 2.65% (effective January 1, 2004) of the member's average monthly salary received during the highest paid consecutive 36-month period prior to leaving the employment of the Fargo police department times the years of said member's service. It is provided, however, that the percentage to be paid upon the member's reaching the age of 50 years shall be the percentage in effect at the time the said member actually left the employment of the Fargo Police Department. It is further provided, however, that no other benefits shall be payable hereunder.

After September 30, 1985, the amount of the payment shall be $65,000 for active members and $40,000 for members retiring after such date. After October 1, 2001, the beneficiary of an active member who has died may elect to choose to take the full $65,000 death benefit, plus the member's contributions (with interest as allowable under  6-0116), or to receive the $40,000 death benefit and a monthly pension based upon the regular retirement of the deceased employee and 100% survivorship option. This pension will begin at the time the deceased would have reached the age of 50 and would have been eligible to collect the pension. This election, however, is contingent upon the active member being vested at the time of death. Said payments shall be provided by the pension fund. The $2,500 death benefit provided for herein shall be payable upon the filing of written proof of eligibility to receive payment. Payment may be made in a lump sum or prorated over a 6-month period, at the election of the beneficiary.

Employees re-entering the plan as hereinabove provided shall be reinstated and given credit for longevity in the same manner as if said employee had never withdrawn from the plan. Any employee who was not a member of the plan on November 1, 1985, or did not re-enter the plan prior to November 1, 1986, as hereinabove provided, may enter the plan at any time and years of service for that employee for purposes of determining pension benefits shall be determined as of the date of entry into the plan. The board of trustees for the city employees' pension fund, with the consent of the board of city commissioners, have elected to permit existing city employees to choose whether to remain as a member of the city employees' pension plan, as governed by this article, or whether to join the North Dakota Public Employees Retirement System pension program, and to make contributions thereto. Further, individuals who become employed by the city on or after January 1, 2008, will be allowed only to join the North Dakota Public Employees Retirement System pension program. As to those city employees who have joined the North Dakota Public Employees Retirement System pension program, all benefits accruing as a result of contributions from and after an employee's entry in the North Dakota Public Employees Retirement System shall be subject to the bylaws, rules and regulations thereof.

From and after January 1, 2008, any member who has reached the age of 55 years or older may draw benefits from the pension plan at any time after termination of his employment with the city in the plan and become a retiree. After January 1, 2000, any member may also terminate his employment with the city and draw benefits from the pension plan as a retiree at such time as he or she attains at least 90 points while employed by the city in a regular full-time position. Any member attaining 90 points will be eligible to become a retiree with 100% benefits and not be affected by the factor for age as shown in 6-0218(C) of this chapter. Points will be assigned as follows: one point will be assigned for each year of the members age and one point will be assigned for each year of the members service based, however, on the hire date as a full-time employee. Years of service and age will be calculated to the nearest six months (i.e. six months or more will constitute a completion of that year of service or that year of the member's age). Actual benefits for those members attaining 90 points will be based on the number of years paid into the pension plan. Written application for benefits shall be made by the member and submitted to the board of trustees.

1.  The monthly benefit payable to a retiree who terminates his employment with the city or his membership in the plan on or after January 1, 2013, shall be determined at the time he or she makes application for benefits and shall be based upon the retiree's age, years of service with the city, subject to the application of section 6-0211, and highest average monthly salary and shall be determined as follows: 
a.  Determine the highest average monthly salary received by the member during any consecutive 60-month period during his employment with the city.

3.  Applicable early retirement factor. The applicable early retirement factor is determined by the age of the member on the date of the commencement of their benefit and is different for benefits earned due to service earned prior to January 1, 2013, and for benefits earned due to subsequent service. 
a.  Early retirement factor for service prior to January 1, 2013. 
The applicable early retirement factor under paragraph F.1.e, is determined as follows based on the age and service of the member on the date on commencement: 
i.  For members who have attained the age of 62, the early retirement factor is 100% (1.0000). 
ii.  For members who have not yet attained age 62 but who have attained 90 points as provided in section 6-0217, the early retirement factor is 100% (1.0000).

(1)  The number of full months prior to age 62, up to 24 months, divided by 180 and rounded to three decimals. 
(2)  The number of full months prior to age 62 exceeding 24 months divided by 360 and rounded to three decimals.

ii.  For members who have not yet attained age 65 but who have attained 90 points as provided in section 6-0217, the early retirement factor is 100% (1.0000). 
iii.  For members who meet either criteria a. nor b. above, the early retirement factor is 1.0000 less the number of full months prior to age 65 divided by 180 and rounded to three decimals.

G.  In addition to the retirement benefit determined as hereinabove provided, a retiree whose combined age and years of plan participation equal or exceed 87, shall be entitled to an additional benefit of $200 per month, payable for a maximum of three years, or until the retiree is eligible for Medicare benefits, whichever occurs first, provided that upon the death of said retiree, the balance of said additional benefit then remaining unpaid shall be paid in a lump sum to the retiree's beneficiary, spouse, or estate, as the case may be.

As of January 1, 2008, with some city employees having elected to join and contribute to the North Dakota Public Employees Retirement System pension plan, those benefits for city employees who are, or have been, contributing members of the city employee pension plan set forth in this article shall not be based upon an employee's years of service with the city while the employee was a contributing member of North Dakota Public Employees Retirement System. An employee's years of service prior to January 1, 2008, will remain eligible for benefits under the terms and conditions of this article. 
    The normal benefit form for retiring city members shall be a life only annuity with monthly benefit to be determined as hereinabove provided.

6-0218.1. - Distribution Requirements. 
  
A.  General Rules. 
1.  The requirements of this article shall apply to any distribution of a member's interest and will take precedence over any inconsistent provisions of this plan. Unless otherwise specified, the provisions of this article apply to calendar years beginning after December 31, 1984. 
2.  All distributions required under this article shall be determined and made in accordance with the Proposed Income Tax Regulations under section 401(a)(9) of the Code, including the minimum distribution incidental benefit requirement of section 1.401(a)(9)-2 of the Proposed Income Tax Regulations. 
B.  Required Beginning Date. The entire interest of a member must be distributed or begin to be distributed no later than the participant's required beginning date. 
C.  Limits on Distribution Periods. As of the first distribution calendar year, distributions, if not made in a single-sum may only be made over one of the following periods (or a combination thereof): 
1.  the life of the member, or 
2.  the life of the member and a designated beneficiary, 
D.  Determination of amount to be distributed each year. 
1.  If the member's interest is to be paid in the form of annuity distributions under the plan, payments under the annuity shall satisfy the following requirements: 
a.  the annuity distributions must be paid in periodic payments made at intervals not longer than one year; 
b.  the distribution period must be over a life (or lives) or over a period certain not longer than a life expectancy (or joint life and last survivor expectancy) described in section 401(a)(9)(A)(iii) or section 401(a)(9)(13)(iii) of the Code, whichever is applicable; 
c.  the life expectancy (or joint life and last survivor expectancy) for purposes of determining the period certain shall be determined without recalculation of life expectancy; 
d.  once payments have begun over a period certain, the period certain may not be lengthened even if the period certain is shorter than the maximum permitted; 
e.  payments must either be nonincreasing or increase only as follows: 
i.  with any percentage increase in a specified and generally recognized cost-of-living index; 
ii.  to the extent of the reduction to the amount of the member's payments to provide for a survivor benefit upon death, but only if the beneficiary whose life was being used to determine the distribution period described in section (C) above dies and the payments continue otherwise in accordance with that section over the life of the member; 
iii.  to provide cash refunds of member contributions upon the member's death; or 
iv.  because of an increase in benefits under the plan. 
f.  If the annuity is a life annuity (or a life annuity with a period certain not exceeding 20 years), the amount which must be distributed on or before the member's required beginning date (or, in the case of distributions after the death of the member, the date distributions are required to begin pursuant to section (E) below) shall be the payment which is required for one payment interval. The second payment need not be made until the end of the next payment interval even if that payment interval ends in the next calendar year. Payment intervals are the periods for which payments are received, e.g., bimonthly, monthly, semi-annually, or annually. 
If the annuity is a period certain annuity without a life contingency (or is a life annuity with a period certain exceeding 20 years) periodic payments for each distribution calendar year shall be combined and treated as an annual amount. The amount which must be distributed by the member's required beginning date (or, in the case of distributions after the death of the member, the date distributions are required to begin pursuant to section (e) above) is the annual amount for the first distribution calendar year. The annual amount for other distribution calendar years, including the annual amount for the calendar year in which the member's required beginning date (or the date distributions are required to begin pursuant to section (E) below) occurs, must be distributed on or before December 31 of the calendar year for which the distribution is required. 
2.  Annuities purchased after December 31, 1988, are subject to the following additional conditions: 
a.  Unless the member's spouse is the designated beneficiary, if the member's interest is being distributed in the form of a period certain annuity without a life contingency, the period certain as of the beginning of the first distribution calendar year may not exceed the applicable period determined using the table set forth in Q&A A-5 of section 1.401 (a)(9)-2 of the Proposed Income Tax Regulations. 
b.  If the member's interest is being distributed in the form of a joint and survivor annuity for the joint lives of the member and a nonspouse beneficiary, annuity payments to be made on or after the member's required beginning date to the designated beneficiary after the member's death must not at any time exceed the applicable percentage of the annuity payment for such period that would have been payable to the member using the table set forth in Q&A A-6 of section 1.401(a)(9)-2 of the Proposed Income Tax Regulations. 
3.  Transitional rule. If payments under an annuity which complies with section (A) above begin prior to January 1, 1989, the minimum distribution requirements in effect as of July 27, 1987, shall apply to distributions from this plan, regardless of whether the annuity form of payment is irrevocable. This transitional rule also applies to deferred annuity contracts distributed to or owned by the employee prior to January 1, 1989, unless additional contributions are made under the Plan by the employer with respect to such contract. 
4.  If the form of distribution is an annuity made in accordance with this section (D), any additional benefits accruing to the member after his or her required beginning date shall be distributed as a separate and identifiable component of the annuity beginning with the first payment interval ending in the calendar year immediately following the calendar year in which such amount accrues. 
5.  Any part of the member's interest which is in the form of an individual account shall be distributed in a manner satisfying the requirements of section 401(a)(9) of the Internal Revenue Code and the proposed regulations thereunder. 
E.  Death Distribution Provisions. 
1.  Distribution beginning before death. If the member dies after distribution of his or her interest has begun, the remaining portion of such interest will continue to be distributed at least as rapidly as under the method of distribution being used prior to the member's death. 
2.  Distribution beginning after death. If the member dies before distribution of his or her interest begins, distribution of the member's entire interest shall be completed by December 31 of the calendar year containing the fifth anniversary of the member's death except to the extent that an election is made to receive distributions in accordance with (a) or (b) below: 
a.  if any portion of the member's interest is payable to a designated beneficiary distributions may be made over the life or over a period certain not greater than the life expectancy of the designated beneficiary commencing on or before December 31 of the calendar year immediately following the calendar year in which the member died. 
b.  if the designated beneficiary is the member's surviving spouse, the date distributions are required to begin in accordance with (a) above shall not be earlier than the later of (1) December 31 of the calendar year immediately following the calendar year in which the member died and (2) December 31 of the calendar-year in which the member would have attained age 701/2. 
If the member has not made an election pursuant to this section (E)(2) by the time of his or her death, the member's designated beneficiary must elect the method of distribution no later than the earlier of (1) December 31 of the calendar year in which distributions would be required to begin under this section, or (2) December 31 of the calendar year which contains the fifth anniversary of the date of death of the member. If the member has no designated beneficiary, or if the designated beneficiary does not elect a method of distribution, distribution of the member's entire interest must be completed by December 31 of the calendar year containing the fifth anniversary of the member's death. 
3.  For purposes of section (E)(2) above, if the surviving spouse dies after the member, but before payments to such spouse begin, the provisions of section (E)(2), with the exception of paragraph (b) therein, shall be applied as if the surviving spouse were the member. 
4.  For purposes of this section (E), any amount paid to a child of the member will be treated as if it had been paid to the surviving spouse if the amount becomes payable to the surviving spouse when the child reaches the age of majority. 
5.  For the purposes of this section (E), distribution of a member's interest is considered to begin on the member's required beginning date (or, if section (E)(3) above is applicable, the date distribution is required to begin to the surviving spouse pursuant to section (E)(2) above). If distribution in the form of an annuity described in section (D)(1)(b) above irrevocably commences to the member before the required beginning date, the date distribution is considered to begin is the date distribution actually commences. 
F.  Definitions 
1.  "Designated beneficiary". The individual who is designated as the beneficiary under the plan in accordance with section 401(a)(9) of the Internal Revenue Code and the proposed regulations thereunder. 
2.  "Distribution calendar year". A calendar year for which a minimum distribution is required. For distributions beginning before the member's death, the first distribution calendar year is the calendar year immediately preceding the calendar year which contains the member's required beginning date. For distributions beginning after the member's death, the first distribution calendar year is the calendar year in which distributions are required to begin pursuant to section (E) above. 
3.  "Life expectancy". The life expectancy (or joint and last survivor expectancy) calculated using the attained age of the member (or designated beneficiary) as of the member's (or designated beneficiary's) birthday in the applicable calendar year. The applicable calendar year shall be the first distribution calendar year. If annuity payments commence before the required beginning date, the applicable calendar year is the year such payments commence. Life expectancy and joint and last survivor expectancy are computed by use of the expected return multiples in Tables V and VI of section 1.72-9 of the Income Tax Regulations. 
4.  "Required beginning date". 
a.  General rule. The required beginning date of a member is the first day of April of the calendar year following the later of the calendar year in which the member attains age 701/2 or the date of actual retirement. 
b.  Transitional rule. The required beginning date of a member who attains age 701/2 before January 1, 1988, shall be the first day of April of the calendar year following the calendar year in which the later of retirement or attainment of age 701/2 occurs. The required beginning date of a member who attains age 701/2 during 1988 and who has not retired as of January 1, 1989, is April 1, 1990. 
G.  "Transitional Rule". 
1.  Notwithstanding the other requirements of this Article, distribution on behalf of any member, may be made in accordance with all of the following requirements (regardless of when such distribution commences): 
a.  The distribution by the Plan is one which would not have disqualified such Plan under section 401(a)(9) of the Internal Revenue Code as in effect prior to amendment by the Deficit Reduction Act of 1984. 
b.  The distribution is in accordance with a method of distribution designated by the member whose interest in the Plan is being distributed or, if the member is deceased, by a beneficiary of such member. 
c.  Such designation was in writing, was signed by the member or the beneficiary, and was made before January 1, 1984. 
d.  The member had accrued a benefit under the plan as of December 31, 1983. 
e.  The method of distribution designated by the member or the beneficiary specifies the time at which distribution will commence, the period over which distributions will be made, and in the case of any distribution upon the member's death, the beneficiaries of the member listed in order of priority. 
2.  A distribution upon death will not be covered by this transitional rule unless the information in the designation contains the required information described above with respect to the distributions to be made upon the death of the employee. 
3.  For any distribution which commences before January 1, 1984, but continues after December 31, 1983, the member, or the beneficiary to whom such distribution is being made will be presumed to have designated the method of distribution under which the distribution is being made if the method of distribution was specified in writing and the distribution satisfies the requirements in subsections 6.0218.1(G)(1)(a)-(e). 
4.  If a designation is revoked any subsequent distribution must satisfy the requirements of section 401(a)(9) of the Internal Revenue Code and the proposed regulations thereunder. If a designation is revoked subsequent to the date distributions are required to begin, the plan must distribute by the end of the calendar year following the calendar year in which the revocation occurs the total amount not yet distributed which would have been required to have been distributed to satisfy section 401(a)(9) of the Internal Revenue Code and the proposed regulations thereunder, but for the section 242(b)(2) election. For calendar years beginning after December 31, 1988, such distributions must meet the minimum distribution incidental benefit requirements in section 1.401(a)(9)-2 of the Proposed Income Tax Regulations. Any changes in the designation will be considered to be a revocation of the designation. However, the mere substitution or addition of another beneficiary (one not named in the designation) under the designation will not be considered to be a revocation of the designation, so long as such substitution or addition does not alter the period over which distributions are to be made under the designation, directly or indirectly (for example, by altering the relevant measuring life). In the case in which an amount is transferred or rolled over from one plan to another plan, the rules in O&A J-2 and Q&A J-3 of section 1.40 1(a)(9)-I of the Proposed Income Tax Regulations shall apply.

    In addition to other limitations set forth in the plan, and notwithstanding any other provisions of the plan, the accrued benefit, including the right to any optional benefits provided in the plan and all other defined benefit plans required to be aggregated with this plan under the provisions of section 415 of the Internal Revenue Code, shall not increase to an amount in excess of the amount permitted under Internal Revenue Code section 415 at any time. Notwithstanding any provision of this plan to the contrary, for purposes of the preceding sentence and for purposes of determining whether the benefits of this Plan exceed the limitations of Internal Revenue Code section 415 with respect to limitation years beginning after December 31, 1986, the term "annual addition" shall include all member contributions to the plan, other than member contributions "picked-up" by the City.

    For the purposes of this paragraph and determining compliance with Internal Revenue Code section 415, for limitation years beginning before January 1, 1995, compensation shall mean compensation as defined in Internal Revenue Code section 415(b)(3), and the regulations thereunder. If the defined benefit of a member of this plan exceeds for any year the limitation imposed by rules under section 415 of the Internal Revenue Code, the defined benefit of the member under this plan shall automatically is reduced to the extent of the excess, and any other remedial action that may be necessary to correct this excess shall be made in this plan. If total benefits under this plan and the benefits and contributions to which any member is entitled under any other qualified plans maintained by the employer that employs the member would otherwise exceed the applicable limits under section 415 of the Internal Revenue Code, the benefits the member would otherwise receive from this plan shall be reduced to the extent necessary to enable the benefits to comply with section 415 of the Internal Revenue Code, unless the employer has provided other rules that satisfy those requirements. The provisions of Internal Revenue Code section 415, and the regulations thereunder, including the special rules under section 415(b) applicable to governmental plans and qualified participants in police and fire department plans, are hereby incorporated by reference as part of the terms and conditions of this plan.

A.  Compensation. For the purposes of this section, "compensation" is defined as wages, salaries and fees for professional services and other amounts received (without regard to whether or not an amount is paid in cash) for personal services actually rendered in the course of employment with the employer maintaining the plan to the extent that the amounts are includable in gross income (including, but not limited to, commissions paid salesmen, compensation for services on the basis of a percentage of profits, commissions on insurance premiums, tips, bonuses, fringe benefits, and reimbursements, or other expense allowances under a nonaccountable plan (as described in 1.62-2(c)), and excluding the following:

Employer contributions to a plan of deferred compensation which are not includable in the employee's gross income for the taxable year in which contributed, or employer contributions under a simplified employee pension to the extent such contributions are deductible by the member, or any distributions from a plan of deferred compensation; 
2.  Other amounts which received special tax benefits, or contributions made by the employer (whether or not under a salary reduction agreement) towards the purchase of an annuity contract described in section 403(b) of the Internal Revenue Code (whether or not the contributions are actually excludable from the gross income of the employee). 
Notwithstanding the above, if the member was a participant as of the first day of the first limitation year beginning after December 31, 1986, compensation shall include any amount which is contributed by the employer pursuant to a salary reduction agreement and which is not includable in the gross income of the employee under sections 125, 402(e)(3), 402(h), or 403(b) of the Internal Revenue Code. 
B.  For fiscal years beginning on or after January 1, 1989 and before January 1, 1994, the annual compensation of each member taken into account for determining all benefits provided under the plan for any fiscal year shall not exceed $200,000. This limitation shall be adjusted by the Secretary at the same time and in the same manner as under section 415(d) of the Internal Revenue Code, except that the dollar increase in effect on January 1 of any calendar year is effective for fiscal years beginning in such calendar year the first adjustment to the $200,000 limitation is effective on January 1, 1990. 
C.  For fiscal years beginning on or after January 1, 1994, the annual compensation limit of each member taken into account for determining all benefits provided under the plan for any determination period shall not exceed $150,000, as adjusted for the cost-of-living in accordance with section 401(a)(17)(B) of the Internal Revenue Code. The cost-of-living adjustment in effect for a calendar year applies to any determination period beginning in such calendar year. 
D.  If a determination period consists of fewer than 12 months, the annual compensation limit is an amount equal to the otherwise applicable annual compensation limit multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of months in the determination period, and the denominator of which is 12. 
E.  Effective for fiscal years beginning before January 1, 1997, in determining the compensation of a member for purposes of this limitation, the rules of section 414(q)(6) of the Internal Revenue Code shall apply, except in applying such rules, the term "family" shall include only the spouse of the spouse and any lineal descendants of the member who have not attained age 19 before the close of the year. If, as a result of application of such rules, the adjusted annual compensation limitation is exceeded, then (except for purposes of determining the portion of compensation up to the integration level if this plan provides for permitted disparity), the limitation shall be prorated among the affected individuals in proportion to each such individual's compensation as determined under this section prior to the application of this limitation. 
F.  If compensation for any prior determination period is taken into account in determining a member's benefits for the current fiscal year, the compensation for such prior determination period is subject to the applicable annual compensation limit in effect for that prior period. For this purpose, in determining benefits in fiscal years beginning on or after January 1, 1989, the annual compensation limit in effect for determination periods beginning before that date is $200,000. In addition, in determining benefits in fiscal years beginning on or after January 1, 1994, the annual compensation limit in effect for determination period beginning before that date is $150,000.

The clerk may also require a report as to the applicant's health from one or more physicians who have examined the applicant. The clerk shall establish the procedure for notifying applicants of their rejection for employment or their acceptance for participation in further tests of fitness, and, prior to the date of the tests for which they have filed, may reject for cause any application. The clerk, subject to review by the commission, may refuse to examine an applicant or, after examination, may remove his name from any employment list, or refuse to certify for appointment any eligible whom he finds lacks any of the preliminary requirements established for the class of position or whom he deems, for reasons of physical health or personal character, unfit to assume the duties and responsibilities of the position to which he seeks appointment. 
C.  Application and promotion-Competitive examination: factors considered. 
  The relative fitness of applicants for appointment to or promotion within the police and fire departments shall be determined by competitive examination. Such examination may consist of written or oral tests, or any combination thereof, and may include consideration and grading of any or all of the qualification factors; education, training, experience, general adaptability, special aptitudes, physical fitness as determined by physical tests and medical examination, knowledge, skill, behavior characteristics, character and such other qualifications as may be deemed necessary as determined by the appointing authority. All applicants will be required to undergo a drug screening and provide sufficient information for completion of a background investigation. The clerk shall ensure that competitive examinations are administered in a manner to give applicants equal opportunity to demonstrate their fitness. The commission, in its discretion, may also order competitive examinations for positions in other departments. 
D.  Establishment of eligible entrance and promotional employment lists-police and fire departments. 
  With respect to initial application to the police department, applicants receiving a passing score on competitive examinations and having satisfactorily completed all other requirements shall be placed on a list of eligible applicants for a period of two years provided, however, that the appointing authority may establish the maximum number of eligible applicants as deemed necessary and appropriate. 
  With respect to initial application to the fire department, applicants receiving a passing score on competitive examinations and having satisfactorily completed all other requirements shall be placed on a list of eligible applicants for a period of one year provided, however, that such list shall not exceed fifteen (15) candidates. 
  The appointing authority may request a new competitive examination for initial application to the police and fire departments as deemed necessary and appropriate. In such cases, the list of additional applicants will be consolidated into the existing eligibility list provided, however, that the maximum period of eligibility shall not exceed the maximum eligibility at the time of examination. All candidates undergoing examination shall be bound by the eligibility period at the time of testing and shall forfeit previous list standing. 
  With respect to promotions within the police and fire departments, applicants receiving a passing score on competitive examinations shall be placed on a list of eligible applicants for promotion for a period of two (2) years or until a new test is required by the appointing authority. The appointing authority may request a new competitive examination as deemed necessary and appropriate. The period of eligibility on a promotional list shall not exceed two years. 
E.  Establishment of re-employment lists. 
  Any person who has held a permanent position in the civil service from which he has been laid off for reasons not discreditable to him shall be entitled to have his name placed on the re-employment list for that position; provided, that he notifies the clerk, in writing, within five days from the date that his lay-off became effective. Any person who has resigned in good standing from a permanent civil service position may, at the discretion of the department head, be placed on the re-employment list, if it is determined that the employee's work record and contribution to the department is such that it would merit consideration for re-hire. Each name placed on the re-employment list shall be stricken therefrom at the expiration of two years from the date of resignation or lay-off. 
  Any person returning to his former position while his name is on the re-employment list shall begin at his former step on the pay scale and shall be given credit for longevity time accrued to the date of the lay-off. Any person returning to his former position after his name has been stricken from the re-employment list shall be treated as a new employee and begin at the beginning step on the pay scale. 
F.  Removal of names from lists. 
  The name of any person appearing on an original entrance, promotional or re-employment list shall be removed by the clerk if he or she fails to respond to a notice of certification or to give an acceptable reason for not appearing before the appointing authority as requested. 
G.  Appointments to positions in the Civil Service. 
  Whenever an appointing authority desires to fill a vacancy in any position in the civil service, he shall notify the clerk giving pertinent facts relative to the duties, responsibilities, and qualification requirements of the position which is to be filled. 
  All vacancies in the civil service shall be filled by original appointment, promotion, re-employment, transfer or demotion. All such vacancies for positions having a salary band of "C" or higher shall be advertised by public announcement as is set forth in subsection (A) of this section. 
  Formal eligibility lists and certification procedure shall not be required for positions which the commission has not designated to be filled by competitive examinations. The clerk shall, however, review all applications and forward his recommendations to the appointing authority. Such recommendations shall not be binding. 
  If the position is to be filled by competitive examination, the clerk shall certify to the appointing authority the names of all eligible candidates from the original entrance, promotional, or re-employment lists for the position to be filled. The appointing authority shall appoint one of the persons certified by the clerk. 
H.  Probationary period.

After the first six months, the appointing authority shall submit a rating of the employee's performance on a report form prepared by the clerk. Additional appraisals may be prepared and filed as the appointing authority may deem necessary. During the probationary period, an employee may be summarily dismissed by the appointing authority. Written notice of such dismissal, with the reasons therefor, shall be delivered to the clerk who may cause the name of such employee to be reinstated to its former position on the appropriate list. 
  No salary or other wage payment shall be made to any employee after his probationary appointment is completed unless the appointing authority has first certified to the clerk, five days preceding the end of the probationary period, that the employee is to be continued in service. 
  Promotions shall be made for a probationary period of one year. During the probationary period for promotion, an employee may be summarily reinstated to his former position by the appointing authority. Written notice of such reinstatement, with the reasons therefor, shall be delivered to the clerk. 
  For demotions and lateral transfers, the appointing authority, in consultation with the human resource department, shall determine whether a probationary period is required, depending on the circumstances of the demotion or lateral transfer. The presence or absence of a probationary period would be determined prior to the effective date of the demotion or lateral transfer. 
  Probationary periods in individual cases may be extended by the appointing authority, in his or her discretion, for a period not to exceed six months. 
I.  Transfer and re-employment of employees and former employees. 
  Any person who is unable to perform his or her duties as a result of job-related disability may be transferred to any other position for which he or she is qualified, without the necessity for compliance with subsections (A), (B) and (C) of this section. 
  Any person who has been retired from service with the city of Fargo as a result of job-related disability and who is being paid worker's compensation benefits, may be re-employed by the city for any position for which he or she is qualified, without the necessity for compliance with subsections (A), (B) and (C) of this section.

  Upon receipt of the fingerprints, the Fargo Fire Department will transmit both sets of fingerprints and the appropriate fees to the North Dakota Bureau of Criminal Investigation. The North Dakota Bureau of Criminal Investigation will compare the subject's fingerprints against its criminal file and submit the fingerprints to the Federal Bureau of Investigation for a comparison with nationwide records. The results of the Federal Bureau of Investigation check will be returned to the North Dakota Bureau of Criminal Investigation, which will disseminate the state and national results to the Fargo Fire Department. 
  The Fargo Fire Department shall render a fitness determination based upon the results of the criminal background check. 
  In rendering a fitness determination, the Fargo Fire Department will decide whether the record subject has been convicted of, or is under pending indictment for, (a) a crime which bears upon his/her ability or fitness to serve in the capacity; (b) any felony; or (c) a misdemeanor which involved force or threat of force, controlled substances, or was a sex-regulated offense. 
  A record subject may request and receive a copy of his/her criminal history record information from the Fargo Fire Department. Should the record subject seek to amend or correct his/her record, he/she must contact the Bureau of Criminal Investigation for a North Dakota state record or the Federal Bureau of Investigation for records from other jurisdictions maintained in its file.

A.  Green indication: 
1.  Vehicular traffic facing a circular green signal may proceed straight through or turn right or left unless a sign at such place prohibits either such turn. But vehicular traffic, including vehicles turning right or left, shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles and to pedestrians lawfully within the intersection or an adjacent crosswalk at the time such signal is exhibited. 
2.  Vehicular traffic facing a green arrow signal, shown alone or in combination with another indication, may cautiously enter the intersection only to make the movement indicated by such arrow or such other movement as is permitted by other indications shown at the same time. Such vehicular traffic shall yield the right-of-way to pedestrians lawfully within an adjacent crosswalk and to other traffic lawfully using the intersection. 
3.  Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian-control signal as provided for in N.D.C.C.  39-10-06, pedestrians facing any green signal, except when the sole green signal is a turn arrow, may proceed across the roadway within any marked or unmarked crosswalk.

1.  Vehicular traffic facing a steady yellow signal is thereby warned that the related green movement is being terminated or that a red indication will be exhibited immediately thereafter when vehicular traffic may not enter the intersection. 
2.  Pedestrians facing a steady yellow signal, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian-control signal as provided for in N.D.C.C.  39-10-06, are thereby advised that there is insufficient time to cross the roadway before a red indication is shown and no pedestrian may then start to cross the roadway. 
C.  Steady red indication: 
1.  Vehicular traffic facing a steady red signal alone shall stop at a clearly marked stop line, but if none, before entering the crosswalk on the near side of the intersection, or if none, then before entering the intersection and shall remain standing until an indication to proceed is shown, except as provided for in subdivision 2. 
2.  Except when a sign is in a place prohibiting a turn, vehicular traffic facing a steady red signal may cautiously enter the intersection to turn right, or to turn left from a one-way street into a one-way street, after stopping as required by subdivision 1. Such vehicular traffic shall yield the right-of-way to pedestrians lawfully within adjacent crosswalk and to other traffic lawfully using the intersection. 
3.  Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian-control signal as provided for in N.D.C.C.  39-10-06, pedestrians facing a steady red signal alone may not enter the roadway. 
D.  In the event an official traffic-control signal is erected and maintained at a place other than an intersection, the provisions of this section are applicable, except as to those provisions which by their nature can have no application. Any stop required must be made at a sign or marking on the pavement indicating where the stop must be made, but in the absence of any such sign or marking the stop must be made at the signal.

A.  Right turns. Both the approach for a right turn and a right turn shall be made as close as practicable to the right-hand curb or edge of the roadway. 
B.  Left turns on two-way roadways. At any intersection where traffic is permitted to move in both directions on each roadway entering the intersection, an approach for a left turn shall be made in that portion of the right half of the roadway nearest the center line thereof and by passing to the right of such center line where it enters the intersection, and after entering the intersection the left turn shall be made so as to leave the intersection to the right of the center line of the roadway being entered. Whenever practicable the left turn shall be made in that portion of the intersection to the left of the center of the intersection. 
C.  Left turns on other than two-way roadways. At any intersection where traffic is restricted to one direction on one or more of the roadways, the driver of a vehicle intending to turn left at any such intersection shall approach the intersection in the extreme left-hand lane lawfully available to traffic moving in the direction of travel of such vehicle and after entering the intersection shall make the left turn so as to leave the intersection, as nearly as practicable, in the left-hand lane lawfully available to traffic moving in such direction upon the roadway being entered.

If a child, under seven years of age, is present in any motor vehicle, that motor vehicle must be equipped with at least one child restraint system for each such child. However, a child under the age of seven who is at least fifty-seven inches [1.45 meters] tall and who weighs at least eighty pounds [36.28 kilograms] is not required to use a child restraint system. The child restraint system must at least meet the standards adopted by the United States Department of Transportation for those systems (49 CFR 571.213). While the motor vehicle is in motion, each such child must be properly secured in the child restraint system in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions. A child weighing more than forty pounds [18.14 kilograms] may be restrained by a lap belt if the vehicle is not equipped with lap and shoulder belts or if all lap and shoulder belts are in use by other occupants. While the motor vehicle is moving, each child of seven through seventeen years of age who is in the motor vehicle must be in an approved child restraint system or buckled in a seat belt. Use of child restraint systems and seat belts is not required in motor vehicles that were not equipped with seat belts when manufactured. If a child is being transported in an emergency situation, this section does not apply. Violation of this section is not, in itself, evidence of negligence. The fact of a violation of this section is not admissible in any proceeding other than one charging the violation.

Notwithstanding the provisions of  8-1004, whenever off-street parking is not available or practicable, parking of construction vehicles as herein defined is permitted for the term and under the conditions set forth hereinafter. "Construction vehicles" are defined as vehicles or trailers being used in performing construction, remodeling, siding or the like. Such vehicles may include pickups, trucks, trailers detached from the towing vehicle provided the trailers do not exceed 30 feet in length, and vans. Such vehicles do not include, however, truck tractor or semi-trailers, but may include bumper-hitched or smaller fifth-wheel construction-type trailers not exceeding 30 feet in length. The following conditions apply to any parking under this section: 
A.  Parking is not allowed in "no parking" zones or any other prohibited area as set forth in city ordinance.

D.  Street parking will be allowed only if appropriate measures are taken to insure public safety including, but not limited to, diamond grade "conspicuity tape" around the entire perimeter of the trailer and/or equipment. Cones shall be used in advance of any trailer or equipment when work is in progress.

The police department of the city or any of the members thereof may impound any truck, trailer, semi-trailer, delivery car, service car, or other commercial vehicle parked in violation of this ordinance and may retain possession of the same until all fines and fees have been paid and until any sentence or order of the court has been completed and/or obeyed. 
Source: 2823 (1997). 
8-1005. - Loading and unloading regulations for trucks. 
A vehicle may be allowed to double-park for the purpose of loading or discharging passengers or for unloading freight when there is no alley for such purpose and no other parking space available and the freight to be unloaded is of a heavy or bulky nature, but only for such length of time as is absolutely necessary for such loading and unloading, except that no merchandise or freight pickups or deliveries whatsoever shall be made from double-parked vehicles between the hours of 4:00 p.m. and 6:00 p.m. on any day except Sundays and legal holidays and no vehicle shall double-park for such purposes between such hours. 
    It shall be unlawful for any person, firm or corporation to load or unload freight or merchandise from a semi-trailer between the hours of 7:00 a.m. and 9:00 a.m., or between the hours of 4:00 p.m. or 6:00 p.m. All loading or unloading of freight or merchandise from a semi-trailer shall be prohibited on all principal and minor arterial roadways. 
    Any person owning, driving, operating, or having under his control any vehicle shall not permit the same to stand or be parked in any alley except while loading or unloading freight or merchandise. If any vehicle is left parked or standing in any alley during such loading or unloading operations, it shall be located so that it does not block the alley and as close to the edge of the alley as possible. If the alley is so narrow that it will be blocked even though the vehicle engaged in the loading or unloading operation is parked as close to the edge of the alley as possible, then and in that event, such vehicle shall not be left unattended at any time. 
    It shall be unlawful to load or unload automobile transport trailers or vehicles on any street, alley, boulevard, or public property of the city, except as herein provided and subject to all of the other terms of this section. An automobile transport vehicle, when parked in the immediate vicinity of the automobile dealership where the vehicles are to be loaded or unloaded, is permissible provided the said automobile transport vehicle must stand parallel and adjacent to the curb and be headed in the direction of the traffic, and further provided that a "flag person" is required to direct or slow traffic should the automobile transport vehicle impede traffic in any manner while loading and unloading. If the automobile transport vehicle is to utilize a no-parking zone, it will be necessary to notify the Fargo police department of the location and provide the duty officer with an estimate of the time required to load and unload vehicles from the transport trailer. It is further provided that in no event shall the parking of an automobile transport trailer leave available less than 20 feet of the width of the roadway for free movement of vehicular traffic. 
    It shall be unlawful to park or permit any vehicle to stand so that it is backed against the curb except when actually loading or unloading freight or merchandise, and if the vehicle is a semi-trailer or trailer combination, the motor vehicle or tractor unit thereof must stand parallel to the curb and be headed in the direction of the traffic. No vehicle shall stand so backed up that it interferes with or interrupts the passage of traffic. 
    In any case it shall be unlawful to load or unload freight or merchandise from a semi-trailer backed into the curb unless the owner or operator of the unit involved shall have first secured a written permit from the chief of police; such a written permit must also be secured before any semi-trailer unit may be driven across the center line of the street in order to back the same into a loading stall. Such permit may be issued for reasonable periods of time, not to exceed one year. 
    It shall be unlawful for any person, firm or corporation to drive or permit to be driven any semi-trailer or truck of more than one-ton capacity by backing the same into a curb unless such person, firm or corporation shall provide a person or arrange with some person, in addition to the driver, to act as flagman during all operations, and said flagman shall station himself in such a position so that he can warn both pedestrians and moving traffic and so that the driver can back the vehicle in a safe manner. It shall be lawful for a police officer to act as such flagman if it does not interfere with his duties as a police officer.

    For purposes of determining a violation of this ordinance, a vehicle shall be considered to have remained parked or to have been re-parked within the same block, lot, or ramp when it is established by a preponderance of the evidence that the same vehicle has been found parked along either side of the same street or road between two intersecting roads, or has been parked within the same lot or ramp at any time within a four hour period, regardless of any evidence that the vehicle was moved between the time it was initially parked and later re-parked. Each 10-, 15-, 30-, 60-, 90-, 120-minute or other time-limited period during which a vehicle is parked shall constitute a separate and additional violation of this section. 
    The Parking Commission shall post the time-limited parking zones on city streets, except for time-zones located on the campus of North Dakota State University in which case the University shall post the time-limited parking zones. The Parking Commission is hereby authorized to establish and post time-limited parking zones in publicly owned or operated parking lots or ramps. Time-limited parking zones in publicly operated lots and ramps shall be approved by resolution by the board of commissioners. The police department or its designee shall enforce such time zone restrictions in areas which are so posted. 
    The Parking Commission if in its judgment traffic conditions so warrant it, may extend, change, or adjust the parking zones designated herein, provided said extension, changes, or adjustments are posted or marked. 
    The Department of Planning and Development or designee shall be authorized to issue a permit to residents of the Downtown Residential Parking Zone in accordance with an approved program as adopted by resolution of the board of city commissioners. 
    Decisions of the Parking Commission are subject to review and confirmation or approval by the board of city commissioners by request of any interested person submitted in writing to the director of planning and development within ten days of such decision.

ARTICLE 8-21 - RESIDENTIAL PARKING PERMIT PROGRAMS 

8-2101 - Declaration of public policy and purpose. 
The board of city commissioners finds that there are residential areas within the city of Fargo that are adjacent to or very near intense nonresidential uses that generate a significant demand for parking. The city commission finds that persons employed by or who are using those nonresidential facilities frequently park their vehicles on nearby residential streets and that, in addition, there are residential areas within the city that are negatively affected by the inappropriate conversion of single-detached owner-occupied housing to rental housing. The commission finds that excess parking demand is generated by these converted rental units because off-street parking for said units is often inadequate to address the needs of the number of residents living in the rental units. The commission finds that parking congestion threatens the general well-being of impacted neighborhoods. This parking ordinance regulating parking in designated residential areas is hereby established in order to protect the residents of such areas and neighborhoods from unreasonable burdens in obtaining parking near their residences and in gaining access to their residences, to preserve the character of such areas and neighborhoods as residential, to promote the efficiency of street maintenance in these areas, resulting in streets that are clean and in safe condition, to promote traffic safety and the peace, order, comfort, convenience and general welfare of the inhabitants of the affected neighborhoods and areas, to preserve the general health, safety and welfare of these residential areas and to encourage large employers, public and private institutions to make better use of public transportation to meet the peak hour commuting needs of their clients, employees, and or students. This ordinance is further established to address the parking congestion on residential streets caused by nonresident parkers and to address excess parking demand caused by the concentrated conversion of single family residential property to multiple occupancy rental property. 
Source: 4538 (2006). 
8-2102. - Residential parking permit districts authorized. 
The board of city commissioners may by resolution establish and designate residential areas or parts thereof as residential permit parking districts. On-street parking may be limited or restricted in such areas to certain locations, hours, times and/or types of motor vehicles as may be further provided in this article. The board of city commissioners may designate such area for a specified period of time, after which time the district shall lapse and be of no further force or effect.

The designation of a residential permit parking district shall be initiated by a petition filed with the city engineer. The petition must specify the problems being caused by nonresidential parking including identification of the times when parking demand is at its peak, the probable cause of the problems and the specific area being proposed to be restricted. The petition may identify a primary district where the parking problems predominate in addition to a buffer district. A filing fee of $50 shall accompany every petition. The petition shall be signed by the owners of property representing more than fifty percent (50%) of the total properties within the proposed district. The petition shall contain the name and address of the signer, and the address of the property owned by the signer. By placing his signature on such a petition, a person is affirming that he is, in fact, the owner of the property in question or is the authorized representative of the owner. Each separate page of the petition shall have appended thereto a certificate, verified by oath, that each signature was signed by the person purporting to have signed the petition. The petition shall identify a resident within the proposed area who shall have the responsibility of verifying each separate page of signatures, as well as having the responsibility of assisting the city engineer in the investigation of the petition to implement a residential permit parking program in the proposed district. A petition may also be submitted by the city director of planning and development or the city engineer, which petition may be based upon documented problems or complaints in the area. 
Source: 4538 (2006). 
8-2105. - Traffic engineer investigation of petition. 
Upon receipt of a valid petition, the city engineer shall conduct an investigation to determine the feasibility of a residential permit parking program for the proposed area or alternatives to the proposed area. This investigation may include, but shall not be limited to observations, surveys, studies or any other data-gathering method which will assist the city traffic engineer in making a recommendation regarding the designation of a residential permit parking district. The city engineer shall hold at least one neighborhood meeting to guide the development of the proposed district, or an alternative district being considered by the city engineer, which outlines zone boundaries and recommended parking restrictions, as determined by the city engineer. 
Source: 4538 (2006). 
8-2106. - Recommendation and review by committee. 
After completing the investigation, the city engineer shall submit the results of the investigation to a committee established or designated by resolution of the board of city commissioners and shall submit a recommendation for the designation or rejection of a specific residential permit parking district. If the city engineer recommends elements of a residential parking permit program or an area of such program that is different than the petition, the engineer shall submit a written proposal to the committee. The recommendation of the city engineer shall be considered at a public hearing before the committee, after public notice is given and an opportunity for written protest is given to owners in the proposed district. If there is filed with the city engineer written protest by owners of at least one-half of all the properties within the area proposed to be included in the district, the proposal shall be denied by the committee. If the written protest is less than one-half, then the committee shall make a recommendation to the board of city commissioners. The committee shall use the same factors to be used by the board of city commissioners in their decision and recommendation.

16-0803. - Water utility fund. 
So long as the principal of or interest on any of the bonds authorized by this article to be issued shall be outstanding and unpaid, the city irrevocably covenants with the holders from time to time of each said bonds that it will maintain, within the municipal utilities fund established by  16-0703 of this chapter, a special subfund which is hereby created and designated as the "water utility fund." The monies from time to time held in said water utility fund shall be accounted for on the books and records of the city, separate from all other funds and separate from any other monies of the municipal utilities fund pertaining to any public utility other than the water utility now or hereafter operated by the city. Into the water utility fund there shall be credited and paid, as received, the entire gross revenues derived from the operation of the water utility, and from any future additions thereto and betterments thereof, including all income and receipts derived from rates, fees and charges for services, facilities, products, and by-products of the utility furnished or sold to the city and its inhabitants and all other customers, and for the availability thereof, and from sale of any of the properties of the utility not necessary to be retained, and from the investment of any of the monies so collected; but such gross revenues shall not be deemed to include any sums realized from special assessments or taxes which may be levied or bonds or other obligations which may be issued for the financing of improvements to said utility. All such gross revenues shall be deposited as received in a duly qualified depository bank and secured as required by law. On the books and records of the water utility fund there shall be established and maintained four separate accounts, to be designated as the "operation and maintenance account," "revenue bond account," "reserve account," and "surplus account," respectively. The revenues on hand in the water utility fund from time to time shall be apportioned among the said accounts at least once in each calendar month and shall thereafter be held and administered in and disbursed from the several accounts as follows: 
A.  To the operation and maintenance account there shall be credited upon each such monthly apportionment, as a first lien and charge on the gross revenue, such sum as shall be needed, over and above any credit balance then held therein, to pay all claims then due and allowed which by accepted accounting practices constitute normal, reasonable, and current expenses of operation and maintenance of the utility, and to pay such expenses estimated to accrue for a period of one month, and to maintain a reasonable reserve for contingencies. Monies in said account shall be used only to pay expenses of the foregoing type, and not for major repairs, replacements, or capital improvements which are properly chargeable to replacement and depreciation reserves or surplus funds. The net revenues of the utility, which are herein pledged and appropriated to the extent required for the payment of the bonds herein authorized and interest thereon, are hereby defined as the aggregate of all sums on hand in the water utility fund from time to time in excess of the current requirements of the operation and maintenance account as herein set forth. 
B.  To the revenue bond account there shall be credited, out of the net revenues on hand at the time of each such distribution, an amount equal to not less than one-twelfth of the sum of the principal and interest payments to become due upon all outstanding bonds which are payable from said account within the next succeeding period of 12 months. If the net revenues on hand at any time are insufficient to permit the transfer to said account of the full amount so required, such deficiency shall be restored out of the next net revenues thereafter received. There shall also be credited to said account the premium and accrued interest, if any, paid on each such issue of revenue bonds payable from said account. The monies in said account shall be used only for the purpose of paying the principal and interest, as such principal and interest respectively become due, on revenue bonds which are issued and made payable therefrom, as a first lien and charge on the net revenues, in accordance with the provisions of  16-0804. All monies pertaining to said revenue bond shall be deposited as received in a special bank deposit account, separate from all other funds of the city. 
C.  To the reserve account there shall be credited out of the net revenues on hand each month, commencing July 1, 1954, in excess of the current requirements of the revenue bond account, such sum as will be sufficient to accumulate therein a balance of $120,000 on or before July 1, 1957, and thereafter to maintain the same in said amount; provided, that it is the intention hereof to establish and maintain in said account a reserve at all times at least equal to the average of the annual principal and interest payments thereafter required to be made from the revenue bond account, and in the event that such average annual principal and interest requirements shall exceed $120,000 by reason of the authorization of any issue of bonds payable from the revenue bond account, additional net revenues shall be transferred to the reserve account monthly in amounts sufficient to increase the balance therein to the amount so required within three years from and after the issuance of such bonds. Monies in the reserve account shall be used only for the payment of maturing principal and interest on bonds primarily payable from the revenue bond account, when and as the monies in the revenue bond account are insufficient therefor, and whenever so used shall be restored out of the next net revenues thereafter received. All monies pertaining to the reserve account shall be deposited as received in a special bank deposit account, separate from all other funds of the city; provided, that such monies may be invested in the discretion of the board of city commissioners but only in general obligations of the United States government maturing within one year from and after the date of purchase thereof. 
D.  All surplus net revenues from time to time received, in excess of the current requirements of the revenue bond account and reserve account, shall be credited on the books of the city to the surplus account of the water utility fund; provided, that the city reserves the right to create additional accounts within said fund for the purpose of segregating any of such surplus net revenues which may be pledged and appropriated to the payment of any obligations hereafter issued to finance improvements, replacements, or repairs of said utility, other than bonds made payable from the revenue bond account, and subject to the prior lien on the net revenues of the bonds payable from that account. Surplus net revenues on hand from time to time shall be available and shall be used to the full extent necessary to restore any deficiency in the operation and maintenance account and the revenue bond account and reserve account, but when not so needed may be used to pay for capital improvements, replacements, or repairs of the water utility, or to pay principal and interest on obligations hereafter issued for such purposes, other than bonds payable from the revenue bond account, or may be used to redeem and pay, prior to maturity, bonds payable from the revenue bond account, when and as such bonds become redeemable according to their terms. Monies in the surplus account determined by the board of city commissioners to be in excess of the immediate requirements of said account for the repair, enlargement, alteration, improvement, or extension of the utility may be invested in accordance with the provisions of  16-0704 of this chapter and  40-33-12 of the North Dakota Century Code. The board shall maintain in said account such a balance of cash and investments as it shall from time to time determine to constitute an adequate reserve for operation and maintenance emergencies and for depreciation and contemplated improvements or replacements; but monies in excess of such reserve may be transferred to other funds of the city in accordance with the subject to the limitations contained in said  16-0704 and in  40-33-12 of the Century Code.

16-0804. - Priorities among issues of revenue bonds. 
The total principal amount of revenue bonds which may be issued and made payable from said revenue bond account, as a first and prior lien and charge on the net revenues of the utility, as herein defined, is limited to $1,575,000, and after the initial issuance of revenue bonds in this amount, no additional obligations of any kind shall be issued or incurred and made payable from said net revenues unless the lien thereof upon said net revenues is expressly made junior and subordinate to that in favor of the bonds issued hereunder; save and except that: 
A.  If monies on hand in the water utility fund should at any time be insufficient for the payment of the principal and interest then due on all bonds payable from the revenue bond account, any matured bonds which cannot be paid from said monies may be refunded by the issuance of refunding revenue bonds, which refunding bonds may be made payable from the revenue bond account on a parity as to interest with all then outstanding bonds payable from said account, but shall mature not earlier than one year after the latest maturity date of such outstanding bonds. 
B.  In the event that the board of city commissioners shall at any time determine it to be necessary and expedient to issue additional bonds to finance capital improvements of said utility, or to refund outstanding bonds payable from the revenue bond account, which are then prepayable according to their terms for the purpose of reducing the interest rate or interest cost or extending the maturities thereof, such additional or refunding revenue bonds may be made payable from the revenue bond account on a parity as to both principal and interest with the then outstanding bonds payable from said account, if the annual net revenues received during the fiscal years next preceding such issuance shall have equaled or exceeded 125% of the average of all principal and interest to become due and payable from said account in each subsequent complete fiscal year of the then remaining term of said outstanding bonds, on such outstanding bonds and the additional or refunding bonds to be issued. 
C.  If any of the rates and charges for water service shall have been increased or reduced at any time subsequent to the commencement of the fiscal year immediately preceding the issuance of additional bonds as contemplated in part (B) above, the net revenues for the period prior to such change shall be deemed, for the purpose of the computation required in said part (B), to be those which would have been received by applying the revised rates and charges to the quantities of water actually consumed and municipal hydrants actually maintained during such period, less the estimated amount of decrease in consumption due to an increase in said rates and charges, and by deducting from the gross revenues so determined the actual operating expenses of the utility for said period. The computation of the net revenues in the event of any such change in rates shall be made by a qualified and disinterested engineer and approved by the board of city commissioners.

16-0805. - Covenants for the security of revenue bonds. 
The city hereby further covenants and agrees with the original purchaser and each holder from time to time of each bond issued hereunder, as follows: 
A.  It will complete all improvements financed by the issuance of such bonds in substantial accordance with the approved plans and specifications therefor and with due diligence and with the greatest economy consistent with good workmanship and efficient results, and will do so without creating or permitting the creation of any liens and encumbrances on said utility or on the revenues thereof other than the liens and charges on said revenues expressly authorized in this ordinance. 
B.  As long as any of such bonds are outstanding, it will continue to own and operate said utility as a municipal utility, free from all competition as to the services thereby provided and in good and efficient operating condition. 
C.  It will at all times maintain and collect reasonable rates, charges, and rentals for all services, facilities, commodities, and benefits furnished and made available by said utility according to schedules such that the net revenues derived therefrom will be at least sufficient to pay into said revenue bond account and reserve account the amounts required in  16-0803 hereof at the times therein provided, and to provide surplus net revenues adequate for payment of principal and interest on any obligations hereafter issued as a lien on the net revenues junior to the lien of bonds payable from the revenue bond account, and will revise such schedules in such manner and whenever and as often as needed to perform this covenant.

J.  The holders of 25% or more in principal amount of each issue of bonds payable from the net water utility revenues which are at any time outstanding shall be privileged and are hereby empowered to institute and maintain, in behalf of the holders of all outstanding bonds of such issue, any suit, action, proceeding at law or in equity for the protection and enforcement of any covenant, agreement, or stipulation herein provided to be performed or observed by the city or its governing body or any of its officers, whether or not any of such bonds are then in default as to the principal and interest, and each and all of the rights and remedies specified and mentioned in  40-35-15 to 40-35-19, inclusive, of the North Dakota Century Code, are hereby acknowledged to be available to the holders of such bonds.

In the resolution authorizing the issuance of revenue bonds in anticipation of the collection of the revenues of the utility, the city commission shall establish a reserve for the security of the bonds and may provide that such reserve shall be set aside from the proceeds of the bonds or from any revenues on hand and properly available therefor. The resolution shall also provide that rates, fees and charges for the services, facilities or commodities provided by the utility shall be established, and revised from time to time when necessary, so that the revenues derived from the utility will at all times be sufficient to pay all normal, reasonable and current costs of the operation and maintenance thereof, and (together with any other monies appropriated therefor) to pay when due the principal of and the interest on the bonds, and to maintain the reserve in the amount required by such resolution. In the event that there shall be at any time a deficiency in said reserve, the city commission shall cause all necessary taxes to be levied, including a tax upon all taxable property in the city for the payment of such deficiency, and such tax shall be subject to no limitation of rate or amount, other than the limits imposed by the Home Rule Charter. 
B.  Prior to adoption of the resolution authorizing the issuance of bonds under this ordinance, the city commission shall cause to be published at least once in the official newspaper of the city a notice describing the general nature of the addition or improvement and the estimated cost thereof, and stating that it is proposed to issue bonds to defray such estimated cost and that the resolution authorizing the issuance of such bonds will include a provision for a reserve to be established and maintained from bond proceeds or revenues on hand and available therefor, and that if at any time a deficiency exists in the reserve, the city commission will levy all necessary taxes, including a tax upon all taxable property in the city for payment of such deficiency, and stating that written protests against the issuance of such bonds must be filed in the office of the city auditor within 20 days after the publication of the notice. 
C.  If, within 20 days after the publication of the notice required in paragraph (B) hereof, written protests against the issuance of bonds, signed by electors of the city equal in number to at least 20% of the number of voters participating at the last preceding general election held in the city, are filed in the office of the city auditor, the bonds described in the notice shall not be issued. Such protests shall not, however, be a bar to proceeding with the undertaking under the provisions of article 16-08, and article 17-01 of N.D.C.C. If the protests are found to be insufficient or invalid by the city commission at a regular or special meeting occurring within 30 days after the expiration of the time for filing such protests, the city commission may proceed to issue the bonds in accordance with paragraph (A) of this ordinance. 
D.  Protests described in paragraph (C) shall contain the date of signature, the signature of the elector, the address of the elector, the age of the elector, and the length of residency within the city of Fargo of the elector. If any of these protest signature requirements are missing from the petition, the protest shall not be counted by the city auditor. 
E.  If a tax is ever levied for any deficiency in the bond reserve, the amount thereof shall be restored to the general fund of the city from the net revenues of the utility received in excess of current expenses of operation and maintenance, and current payments of principal and interest on any outstanding revenue bonds for that utility. 
F.  The city commission also reserves the right to levy assessments with respect to any improvement, or to establish connection charges and to appropriate part or all of the collections thereof to the sinking fund, established for any bonds issued pursuant to this ordinance.

Such bonds are hereby authorized to be issued and sold in such amounts and at such times and subject to such terms with reference to time and manner of payment of principal and interest as the board of city commissioners shall determine, by resolution duly adopted at a regular meeting thereof, to be necessary and expedient for the purpose of keeping the utility in a state of efficiency corresponding to the progress of sewerage utilities generally; provided, that all such bonds shall be issued subject to the further terms and provisions of this article.

17-0103. - Sewerage utility fund. 
So long as the principal of or interest on any of the bonds authorized by this article to be issued shall be outstanding and unpaid, the city irrevocably covenants with the holders from time to time of each of said bonds that it will maintain within the municipal utilities fund established by  16-0703 of chapter 16, a special subfund which is hereby created and designated as the "sewerage utility fund." The monies from time to time held in said sewerage utility fund shall be accounted for on the books and records of the city, separate from all other funds and separate from any other monies of the municipal utilities fund pertaining to any public utility other than the sewerage utility now or hereafter operated by the city. Into the sewerage utility fund there shall be credited and paid as received the entire gross revenues derived from the operation of the sewerage utility and from any future additions thereto and betterments thereof, including all income and receipts derived from rates, fees and charges for services, facilities, products and by-products of the utility furnished or sold to the city and its inhabitants and all other customers, and for the availability thereof, and from sale of any of the properties of the utility not necessary to be retained, and from the investment of any of the monies so collected; but such gross revenues shall not be deemed to include any sums realized from special assessments or taxes which may be levied or bonds or other obligations which may be issued for the financing of improvements to said utility. All such gross revenues shall be deposited as received in a duly qualified depository bank and secured as required by law. On the books and records of the sewerage utility fund there shall be established and maintained four separate accounts, to be designated as the "operation and maintenance account," "revenue bond account," "reserve account," and "surplus account," respectively. The revenues on hand, in the sewerage utility fund from time to time shall be apportioned among the said accounts at least once in each calendar month and shall thereafter be held and administered in and disbursed from the several accounts as follows: 
A.  To the operation and maintenance account there shall be credited upon each such monthly apportionment, as a first lien and charge on the gross revenues, such sum as shall be needed, over and above any credit balance then held therein, to pay all claims then due and allowed which by accepted accounting practices constitute normal, reasonable, and current expenses of operation and maintenance of the utility, and to pay such expenses estimated to accrue for a period of one month, and to maintain a reasonable reserve for contingencies. Monies in said account shall be used only to pay expenses of the foregoing type, and not for major repairs, replacements, or capital improvements which are properly chargeable to replacement and depreciation reserves or surplus funds. The net revenues of the utility, which are herein pledged and appropriated to the extent required for the payment of the bonds herein authorized and interest thereon, are hereby defined as the aggregate of all sums on hand in the sewerage utility fund from time to time in excess of the current requirements of the operation and maintenance account as herein set forth. 
B.  To the revenue bond account there shall be credited out of the net revenues on hand at the time of each such distribution, an amount equal to not less than one-twelfth of the sum of the principal and interest payments to become due upon all outstanding bonds which are payable from said account within the next succeeding period of 12 months. If the net revenues on hand at any time are insufficient to permit the transfer to said account of the full amount so required, such deficiency shall be restored out of the next net revenues thereafter received. There shall also be credited to said account the premium and accrued interest, if any, paid on each issue of revenue bonds payable from said account. The monies in said account shall be used only for the purpose of paying the principal and interest, as such principal and interest respectively become due, on revenue bonds which are issued and made payable therefrom, as a first lien and charge on the net revenues, in accordance with the provisions of  17-0104. All monies pertaining to said revenue bond account shall be deposited as received in a special bank deposit account, separate from all other funds of the city. 
C.  To the reserve account there is hereby credited the sum of $66,000, from net revenues of the sewerage system which are now on hand and available for such purpose. It is the intention hereof to establish and maintain in said account a reserve at all times at least equal to the average of the annual principal and interest payments thereafter required to be made from the revenue bond account, and in the event that such average annual principal and interest requirements shall exceed $66,000 by reason of the authorization of any issue of bonds payable from the revenue bond account, additional net revenues shall be transferred to the reserve account monthly in amounts sufficient to increase the balance therein to the amount so required within three years from and after the issuance of such bonds. Monies in the reserve account shall be used only for the payment of maturing principal and interest on bonds primarily payable from the revenue bond account, when and as the monies in the revenue bond account are insufficient therefor, and whenever so used shall be restored out of the next net revenues thereafter received. All monies pertaining to the reserve account shall be deposited as received in a special bank deposit account, separate from all other funds of the city; provided, that such monies may be invested in the discretion of the board of city commissioners but only in general obligations of the United States government maturing within one year from and after the date of purchase thereof. 
D.  All surplus net revenues from time to time received, in excess of the current requirements of the revenue bond account and reserve account, shall be credited on the books of the city of the surplus account of the sewerage utility fund; provided, that the city reserves the right to create additional accounts within said fund for the purpose of segregating any of such surplus net revenues which may be pledged and appropriated to the payment of any obligations hereafter issued to finance improvements, replacements, or repairs of said utility, other than bonds made payable from the revenue bond account, and subject to the prior lien on the net revenues of the bonds payable from that account. Surplus net revenues on hand from time to time shall be available and shall be used to the full extent necessary to restore any deficiency in the operation and maintenance account and the revenue bond account and reserve account, but when not so needed may be used to pay for capital improvements, replacements, or repairs of the sewerage utility, or to pay principal and interest on obligations hereafter issued for such purposes, other than bonds payable from the revenue bond account, or may be used to redeem and pay prior to maturity bonds payable from the revenue bond account, when and as such bonds become redeemable according to their terms. Monies in the surplus account determined by the board of city commissioners to be in excess of the immediate requirements of said account for the repair, enlargement, alteration, improvement, or extension of the utility may be invested in accordance with the provisions of  16-0704 of chapter 16 of the Revised Ordinances of 1965 and  40-33-12 of the North Dakota Century Code, as amended. The board shall maintain in said account such a balance of cash and investments as it shall from time to time determine to constitute an adequate reserve for operation and maintenance emergencies and for depreciation and contemplated improvements or replacements; but monies in excess of such reserve may be transferred to other funds of the city in accordance with and subject to the limitations contained in said  16-0704 and in  40-33-12 of the North Dakota Century Code.

17-0104. - Priorities among issues of revenue bonds. 
The total principal amount of revenue bonds which may be issued and made payable from said revenue bond account, as a first and prior lien and charge on the net revenues of the utility, as herein defined, is limited to the amount required to pay the cost of the enlargement of the sewage disposal plant in accordance with plans and specifications approved by the board of city commissioners on and prior to May 1, 1961, less the amount of such cost to be paid from federal grants made for that purpose, which net cost is presently estimated to be approximately $1,000,000; and after the initial issuance of revenue bonds in this amount, no additional obligations of any kind shall be issued or incurred and made payable from said net revenues unless the lien thereof upon said net revenues is expressly made junior and subordinate to that in favor of the bonds issued hereunder; save and except that: 
A.  If monies on hand in the sewerage utility fund should at any time be insufficient for the payment of the principal and interest then due on all bonds payable from the revenue bond account, any matured bonds which cannot be paid from said monies may be refunded by the issuance of refunding revenue bonds, which refunding bonds may be made payable from the revenue bond account on a parity as to interest with all then outstanding bonds payable from said account, but shall mature not earlier than one year after the latest maturity date of such outstanding bonds. 
B.  In the event that the board of city commissioners shall at any time determine it to be necessary and expedient to issue additional bonds to finance capital improvements of said utility, or to refund outstanding bonds payable from the revenue bond account which are then prepayable according to their terms for the purpose of reducing the interest rate or interest cost or extending the maturities thereof, such additional or refunding revenue bonds may be made payable from the revenue bond account on a parity as to both principal and interest with the then outstanding bonds payable from said account, if the average of the annual net revenues received during the three fiscal years next preceding such issuance shall have equaled or exceeded 125% of the maximum sum of principal and interest to become due and payable from said account on all then outstanding bonds and on all additional bonds so issued, in any subsequent fiscal year of the then remaining term of said outstanding bonds. 
C.  If any of the rates and charges for sewerage service shall have been increased or reduced at the date of issuance of such additional bonds from those in effect during any portion of said three fiscal years, the net revenues for such period shall be deemed, for the purpose of the computation required in part (B), to be those which would have been received by applying the revised rates and charges to the quantities of sewerage service actually rendered and made available during such period, and by deducting from the gross revenues so determined the actual operating expenses of the utility for said period; provided, that where sewerage rates are based on water consumption, the quantities consumed shall be reduced by the estimated decrease in actual consumption due to any increase in such rates. The computation of the net revenues in the event of any change in rates shall be made by a qualified and disinterested engineer and approved by the board of city commissioners. In no event shall the net revenues for any period under a revised schedule of rates and charges be deemed to be more than 150% of the net revenues actually received during such period. 
D.  Upon the issuance of any additional revenue bonds pursuant to this article after the payment and discharge of all such bonds issued prior to January 1, 1972, only the net revenues received in the fiscal year immediately preceding such issuance shall be considered in applying the provisions of subsection (B) above, and no limitation shall be placed on the upward adjustment of such net revenues by the application of revised rates and charges pursuant to subsection (C) above, and the computation of such adjusted net revenues shall be made by the city auditor.

17-0105. - Covenants for the security of revenue bonds. 
The city hereby further covenants and agrees with the original purchaser and each holder from time to time of each bond issued hereunder, as follows: 
A.  It will complete all improvements financed by the issuance of such bonds in substantial accordance with the approved plans and specifications therefor and with due diligence and with the greatest economy consistent with good workmanship and efficient results and will do so without creating or permitting the creation of any liens and encumbrances on said utility or on the revenues thereof other than the liens and charges on said revenues expressly authorized in this ordinance. 
B.  As long as any of such bonds are outstanding, it will continue to own and operate said utility as a municipal utility, free from all competition as to the services thereby provided and in good and efficient operating condition. 
C.  It will at all times maintain and collect reasonable rates, charges, and rentals for all services, facilities, commodities, and benefits furnished and made available by said utility according to schedules such that the net revenues derived therefrom will be at least sufficient to pay into said revenue bond account and reserve account the amounts required in  17-0103 hereof at the times therein provided and to provide surplus net revenues adequate for payment of principal and interest on any obligations hereafter issued as a lien on the net revenues junior to the lien of bonds payable from the revenue bond account, and will revise such schedules in such manner and whenever and as often as needed to perform this covenant. 
D.  Under each such schedule the city shall be obligated to pay and will pay from its other funds to the sewerage utility fund a fair and equitable amount for any and all services, facilities, commodities, and benefits furnished to the city or any of its departments by the utility. 
E.  It will at all times maintain books of account adequate to show all receipts and disbursements of the city respecting the utility, and the application of such receipts to the purposes of the several accounts of the sewerage utility fund as provided in  17-0103 hereof, which books of account shall be open to inspection at any reasonable time by the holder of any revenue bond, and it will furnish a certified transcript therefrom of any information which any such bondholder may request, upon payment of a reasonable fee therefor. 
F.  At the close of each fiscal year, being the 12-month period ending on June 30 of each year as provided in the statutes of the state of North Dakota, it will cause an operating statement to be prepared and included in the annual financial statement of the city required by the provisions of  40-16-05 of the North Dakota Century Code, showing the financial condition of the receipts and disbursements of the sewerage utility fund and of its several accounts during such fiscal year, and a copy of each statement will be furnished to the original purchaser of each issue of revenue bonds, and also to any holder of such bonds upon request. The city will also cause the books of account of the utility to be audited by a certified public accountant as soon as may be after the close of each fiscal year, and will furnish a copy of the report of each such audit to the original purchaser of each issue of revenue bonds, and will make the same available upon request to any holder of such bonds. The cost of all such accounting and audits shall be paid as an operating expense of the utility. 
G.  It will at all times keep the properties of said utility insured in reasonable amounts against loss or damage by all causes against which similar properties are customarily insured by prudent owners thereof, and will carry adequate public liability insurance against any claim of personal injury or property damage which is or may become a charge against the revenues of the utility, and will cause all persons handling funds of the utility to be bonded in suitable amounts for the protection of the city and the holders of said revenue bonds, and such insurance and fidelity bonds will be carried with the state fire and tornado fund or such other reputable and responsible insurers as shall be selected by the board of city commissioners, and the expense of all such insurance and bonds shall be paid as an operating cost of the utility, and the city will use the proceeds thereof, immediately upon the occurrence of any loss or damage covered thereby, to restore such loss or damage. 
H.  The city will use due diligence in the selection and supervision of employees charged with the operation of said utility and the handling of the funds thereof and in the operation and maintenance and the collection of the revenues of said utility, to the end that the properties thereof shall be kept in good and efficient operating condition and the revenues shall not be lost or mishandled. Bills for sewerage service will be presented to all customers not less often than quarterly, and if any bill is not paid within 15 days from the due date thereof, the supply of water to the premises involved shall be discontinued, and such premises shall not be reconnected until full payment of all charges due for sewerage service together with penalties. 
I.  The city and its governing body and each and all of its officers will punctually perform all duties with reference to said utility and the revenues thereof and the bonds herein authorized which are imposed by law and the ordinances and resolutions of the city, including this ordinance, in force upon the date upon which any of such bonds are issued, and all conditions of the constitution and laws of the state and of such ordinances and resolutions as will provide security for the holders of the bonds issued hereunder are acknowledged to be a part of the city's contract with the holders from time to time of such bonds; provided, that nothing herein shall be deemed to preclude the city from modifying the rates and charges and billing procedures now in effect to any extent which will not impair the sufficiency of the revenues of said utility to comply with the remaining provisions of this ordinance. 
J.  The holders of 25% or more in principal amount of each issue of bonds payable from the net sewerage utility revenues which are at any time outstanding shall be privileged and are hereby empowered to institute and maintain, in behalf of the holders of all outstanding bonds of such issue, any suit or proceedings at law or in equity for the protection and the enforcement of any covenant, agreement, or stipulation herein provided to be performed or observed by the city or its governing body or any of its officers, whether or not any of such bonds are then in default as to the principal and interest, and each and all of the rights and remedies specified and mentioned in  40-35-15 to 40-35-19, inclusive, of the North Dakota Century Code, as amended, are hereby acknowledged to be available to the holders of such bonds. 
K.  In the event that monies on hand in the revenue bond account and reserve account should be insufficient at any time to pay all principal and interest then due on bonds payable from said accounts, and cannot be made sufficient by transfers of monies from other accounts of the sewerage utility fund, such monies shall be first used to pay the interest then due or to become due on the next succeeding interest payment date on all such then outstanding bonds, and any monies on hand in excess of amounts required for the payment of all such interest shall be applied to the payment of maturing principal on such bonds in order of their maturity dates, earliest maturing bonds first, and prorata to the payment of the principal of bonds maturing on the same date.

17-0211. - Prohibited connections to sewer system.-Inspection and surcharge authority.-Waiver provisions. 
A.  Section 22-0432 of the 1971 revised City Ordinances prohibits surface or ground water drains, including roof drains and foundation drain tiles, from being connected to the sanitary sewer. Said ordinance requires that surface or ground water drains shall be connected directly to the city storm sewer or discharged into a sump and thereafter pumped into the city storm sewer system or onto a yard in such a manner so as to drain into the city storm sewer system. The following subsections further expand on such prohibited connections and provide for inspections, surcharges, waivers and penalties. 
B.  All dwellings, buildings and structures constructed after September 21, 1971, which require, because of infiltration of water into basements, crawl spaces and the like, a foundation drainage system shall have a permanently installed discharge line which, shall not at any time, discharge water into the sanitary sewer system except as hereinafter provided in 17-0211(F). A permanent installation shall be one in which the direction of flow cannot be altered and provides for year-round discharge to either the outside of the dwelling, building or structure, or is connected directly to the city storm sewer, or discharges to the curb and gutter. 
C.  Prior to June 1, 2001, all dwellings, buildings or structures constructed after September 21, 1971, having surface or ground water drains, including sump pumps, now connected and/or discharging into the sanitary sewer system shall disconnect and/or remove the same. Any disconnects or openings in the sanitary sewer shall be closed or repaired in an effective, workmanlike manner, as approved by the city engineer for utilities. 
D.  Authorized city personnel, or its designated representatives bearing proper credentials and identification, shall be permitted to enter all properties constructed after September 21, 1971, for the purposes of inspection and observation to identify prohibited discharges to the sanitary sewer system. Any person may furnish a certificate from a licensed plumber certifying that their property is in compliance with 22-0432 and this section, in lieu of having the city inspect their property. Any person refusing to allow their property to be inspected (or failing to furnish a plumber's certificate in lieu thereof) within fourteen (14) days of the date city employees or their designated representatives are denied admittance to the property, shall immediately become subject to the surcharge penalty as required under 17-0211(E). Any person found to have violated this provision shall make the necessary changes to eliminate the discharge of surface or ground water into the sanitary sewer system and furnish proof of the changes to the city within ninety (90) days. Each prohibited connection identified may be re-inspected by the city, its designated representative or a licensed plumber, to confirm compliance. 
E.  A monthly surcharge penalty, established by resolution of the board of city commissioners, shall be imposed and added to the regular sewer billing on and after June 1, 2001, to property owners who are not in compliance with this section. The surcharge shall be added every month through December 2001 until the property is in compliance. The surcharge shall continue to be levied monthly, every year on properties not complying with this section. It is provided, however, that the surcharge shall not be charged unless and until a property has been inspected and found to be not in compliance, or if the property owner refuses to allow an inspection and fails to provide a plumber's certificate in lieu thereof as set forth in this section. 
F.  The city engineer for utilities shall have the authority to grant exemptions from strict compliance with this section. 
  Exemptions may be granted in the form of seasonal waivers which would allow the property owner to temporarily discharge directly into the sanitary sewer system between the date of October 1 and March 31. The holder of a seasonal waiver shall allow a city employee or designated representative to certify that, prior to April 1 of each subsequent year, their discharge water connection has been removed from the sanitary sewer. Failure to provide such certification shall place the seasonal waiver holder in violation and subject to the surcharge penalty as required under 17-0211(E). Seasonal waiver requests shall be submitted on the official form provided by the city engineer for utilities. 
  Exemptions may be granted in the form of non-seasonal waivers for a particular property owner who can demonstrate undo hardship because of unique or extenuating circumstances, including physical or handicap limitations. A non-seasonal waiver would allow the property owner to discharge directly into the sanitary sewer system without seasonal restrictions. The non-seasonal waiver request shall be submitted to the city engineer for utilities in writing and, at a minimum, identify the property for which the waiver is being requested, the name of the property owner/applicant, and a detailed description of the circumstances justifying the request. 
G.  Any person granted a seasonal waiver shall be charged an additional monthly fee on their utility bill to cover the cost of compliance inspections and the cost for treating the extra discharge water during the waiver period. The seasonal waiver amount shall be set by resolution of the board of city commissioners. 
  Any person granted a non-seasonal waiver shall be charged an additional monthly fee on their utility bill to cover the cost for treating the extra discharge water on a year-round basis. The non-seasonal waiver amount shall be set by resolution of the board of city commissioners. 
H.  If a seasonal waiver is granted, the owner of the property may place a pipe connecting the sump pump to the sanitary sewer, which must have a shut-off valve. City staff or its designated representative, on or around April 1 of each year, will inspect the system to verify that the valve is closed so no prohibited water is discharged into the sanitary sewer. By applying for the waiver, the owner has granted permission to the city staff or its representatives to inspect the connection at any time between April 1 and October 31 to verify compliance with this section. Such inspections must be made between 8:00 a.m. and 5:00 p.m., Monday through Friday, and only when a resident of the premises is on site. Failure to allow such an inspection or to allow city staff or its designated representatives entry for verification of compliance shall result in automatic revocation of the seasonal waiver and imposition of the surcharge penalty pursuant to 17-0211(E). 
I.  When a new structure is being constructed in the city of Fargo, if, at or prior to final inspection, city staff determines that the sump pump connection has been illegally connected to the sanitary sewer system, or that there is another connection or device or lack of a plug which allows surface run-off or ground water to enter into the sanitary sewer system, either permanently or temporarily, there shall be levied an administrative fine against the general contractor for the structure thus found in violation. If, 24 hours after receiving written notice from the city, the general contractor has not remedied the situation so that no surface run-off or ground water can enter into the sanitary sewer system, there shall be an additional administrative penalty for each month such a violation exists. In addition, the building inspector shall not issue another building permit within the jurisdiction of the city of Fargo for that contractor until the violation has been remedied and any administrative penalty has been fully paid to the city. The administrative penalty shall be set by resolution of the board of city commissioners.

The following separate bookkeeping accounts shall be maintained at all times on the official books and records of the authority, subject to inspection and auditing by the city auditor, for the purpose of showing all receipts of money from the following sources and all disbursements of money for the following purposes: 
A.  An operation and maintenance account, to which there shall be credited as received all revenues derived in any manner whatsoever from the operation of the municipal parking system (excluding the parking facilities at the Hector Municipal Airport), and to which there shall be charged all items which under accepted accounting practice constitute normal, reasonable and current costs of the operation and maintenance of said parking system.

In accordance with the foregoing principles, said net revenues shall be applied for the following purposes in the following order of priority: 
A.  To provide monies needed in the operation and maintenance account to pay valid claims due and payable with respect to current, reasonable and necessary operation and maintenance expenses of the parking system.

C.  To credit and pay to the city of Fargo such amount as shall be determined by the board of city commissioners to be reasonably equivalent to the amount of taxes otherwise leviable upon properties of the municipal parking system if privately owned; which amount so credited shall be subject to appropriation by said board for any proper corporate purpose consistent with the provisions of its resolutions authorizing warrants or bonds referred to in paragraph (B) of this section. 
D.  To provide monies in any reserve account established for the security of warrants or bonds referred to in paragraph (B) of this section at the time or times and in the amounts required in the resolution authorizing the issuance of such warrants or bonds.

18-0907. - Excavation-Protection. 
The permittee shall be responsible for barricading the excavation in conformance with the "Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices". 
A.  Protective measures and routing of traffic-It shall be the duty of every person cutting or making an excavation in or upon any public place, to place and maintain barriers and warning devices necessary for the safety of the general public. Warning signs shall be placed far enough in advance of the construction operation to alert traffic within a public street, and cones or other approved devices shall be placed to channel traffic, in accordance with the instructions of the administrative authority. All safety precautions and traffic control measures shall conform to current requirements as specified in the latest edition of the "Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices". If, in the opinion of the city engineer or his designee, the protective measures are not in accordance with the "Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices", additional signing will be required. 
  The permittee shall take appropriate measures to assure that during the performance of the excavation work, traffic conditions, as near normal as possible, shall be maintained at all times so as to minimize inconvenience to the occupants of the adjoining property and to the general public. Adequate pedestrian passageways shall be maintained. 
  The permittee shall maintain safe crossings for two lanes of vehicle traffic at all street intersections, where possible. If any excavation is made across any public street, alley, sidewalk, or established crosswalk, adequate crossings shall be maintained for vehicles and for pedestrians. 
  The city engineer may, by written approval, permit the closing of streets and alleys for a prescribed period of time. The city engineer may require that the permittee give notification to various public agencies and to the general public before approval becomes valid. In specific instances, even though the street may not be closed, the permittee may also be required to give such notice. 
B.  Protection of adjoining property-The permittee shall at all times preserve and protect from injury any adjoining property by providing adequate support and taking other necessary measures. The permittee shall, at its own expense, shore up and protect all buildings, walls, fences or other property likely to be damaged during the progress of the work and shall be responsible for all damage to public or private property resulting from its failure to properly protect and carry out said work. 
C.  Maintenance of roadway drainage-The permittee shall maintain all gutters free and unobstructed for the full depth of the adjacent curb and for at least one foot in width from the face of such curb at the gutter line.

18-0908. - Excavation. 
A.  Care of excavated material-All excavated material piled adjacent to the trench or in any street shall be maintained in such a manner as not to endanger those working in the trench, pedestrians or users of the streets, and so that as little inconvenience as possible is caused to those using the streets and adjoining property. The city engineer may require the permittee to remove the excavation material from the worksite. It shall be the permittee's responsibility to secure the necessary permission and make all necessary arrangements (permits, plans, etc.) for all required storage and disposal sites. 
B.  Noise, dust and debris-Each permittee shall conduct and carry out excavation work in such manner as to avoid unnecessary inconvenience and annoyance to the general public and occupants of neighboring property. In the performance of the excavation work, the permittee shall take appropriate measures to reduce, to the fullest extent practicable, noise, dust and unsightly debris. Between the hours of 10:00 p.m. and 7:00 a.m., the permittee shall not use, except with the express written permission of the administrative authority, or in case of an emergency as herein otherwise provided, any tool, appliance or equipment producing noise of sufficient volume to disturb the sleep or repose of occupants of the neighboring property.

6.  Boring or other methods to prevent cutting of pavement may be required. 
D.  Clearance for emergency facilities-The excavation work shall be performed and conducted so as not to interfere with access to fire hydrants, fire stations, fire escapes and any other emergency facilities designated by the city engineer. 
E.  Relocation and protection of utilities-The permittee shall notify the owners of all facilities in the excavation area a minimum of 24 hours prior to excavating. The permittee shall not interfere with any existing facility without the written consent of the city engineer and the owner of the facility. If it becomes necessary to relocate an existing facility, this shall be done by its owner. No facility owned by the city shall be moved to accommodate the permittee unless the cost of such work be borne by the permittee. The cost of moving privately owned facilities shall be similarly borne by the permittee unless it makes other arrangements with the person owning the facility. The permittee shall support and protect all pipes, conduits, poles, wires or other apparatus which may be in any way affected by the excavation work, and do everything necessary to support, sustain and protect them under, over, along or across said work until final backfill consolidation is obtained. The permittee shall secure approval of the method of support and protection from the owner of the facility. In case any of said pipes, conduits, poles, wires or apparatus should be damaged, and for this purpose pipe coating or other encasement or devices are to be considered as part of a substructure, the permittee shall promptly notify the owner thereof. All damaged facilities shall be repaired by the agency or person owning them and the expense of such repairs shall be charged to the permittee. It is the intent of this paragraph that the permittee shall assume all liability for damage to facilities and any resulting damage or injury to anyone because of such facility damage and such assumption of liability is a contractual obligation of the permittee. The only exception will be such instances where damage is exclusively due to the negligence of the owning utility. The city shall not be a party to any action because of this paragraph. The permittee shall inform itself as to the existence and vertical as well as horizontal location of all underground facilities within the excavation area by exposing prior to machine digging and protect the same against damage. 
F.  Abandonment of substructures-Whenever the use of a substructure is abandoned, except the abandonment of service lines three inches or less in diameter designed to serve single properties, the person owning, using, controlling or having an interest therein shall, within 30 days after such abandonment, file with the city engineer a statement in writing giving, in detail, the location of the substructure so abandoned. If such abandoned substructure is in the way or subsequently becomes in the way of an installation of the city or any other public body, which installation is pursuant to a governmental function, the owner shall remove such abandoned substructure or interfering portions thereof, or pay the cost of its removal during the course of excavation for construction of the facility by the city or any other public body.

18-0909. - Backfilling. 
The placement and compaction of the backfill shall be done as directed by the city engineer. Well-graded granular material meeting North Dakota class 21 specifications or CDF shall be used within all traveled ways. 
A.  When granular material is used for backfill, it will be either mechanically tamped in six inch lifts or thoroughly flushed with water using a "jetting" nozzle, to obtain 95% of proctor density at optimum moisture. 
  When required soil tests are to be furnished by an approved testing agency, the permittee shall be required to bear the expense of such tests.

18-0910. - Restoration. 
Any surface disturbed by excavation shall be restored to as good a condition as it was prior to excavation. Such restoration shall be made within 72 hours of the completion of backfilling if such excavation is within a berm area or an unsurfaced street unless a time extension is granted by the city engineer. Except by special permission of the city engineer, excavations within paved streets shall be temporarily patched with cold-mix asphalt and maintained for a minimum of 30 days, at which time the cold-mix asphalt shall be removed and the permanent restoration done. 
A.  Site restoration and cleanup-As the excavation work progresses, all streets shall be thoroughly cleaned of all rubbish, excess earth, rock and other debris resulting from such work. All cleanup operations at the location of such excavation shall be accomplished at the expense of the permittee. From time to time, as may be ordered by the city engineer, and in any event immediately after completion of said work, the permittee shall, at its own expense, clean up and remove all refuse and unused materials of any kind resulting from said work. Upon failure to do so, within 24 hours after having been notified, said work may be done by the city and the cost thereof charged to the permittee. Whenever it may be necessary for the permittee to excavate through any landscaped area, said area shall be re-established in a like manner after the excavation has been backfilled as required. All construction and maintenance work shall be done in a manner designed to leave the area clean of earth and debris and in a condition as nearly as possible to that which existed before such work began. The permittee shall not remove, even temporarily, any existing trees or shrubs without first obtaining the consent of the city engineer. 
B.  Winter construction-Between November 1st and April 1st all trenches must be backfilled with gravel and tamped in six inch lifts or layers from main or sewer to at least one foot back of curb line. The upper 1.0 feet of the trench shall be composed of asphaltic cold materials to be kept at grade at all times between November 1st and April 1st and then restored to permanent resurfacing after April 1st. 
C.  Restoration of paved surfaces- 
1.  Asphaltic concrete-Asphalt shall be trimmed with asphalt spade or concrete saw, the asphalt edges painted with asphaltic cement and hot-mix asphaltic cement concrete placed and compacted to a depth of nine inches. 
2.  P.C. Concrete w/Asphalt Overlay-Asphalt shall be trimmed with asphalt spade or concrete saw. P.C. concrete shall be placed to a depth of six inches, the top of which shall be one inch below street surface and rake-finished. After a curing time as approved by the city engineer, the patch shall be painted with asphaltic cement and filled with asphaltic cement concrete. 
3.  P.C. Concrete-Concrete shall be trimmed with a concrete saw and existing steel straightened. Steel shall be placed both ways as directed by the city engineer. P.C. concrete shall be replaced to the original depth and given a wood float finish. 
4.  Dowels-Three-quarter inch by 18-inch drilled-in dowels 18 inch on center will be used where full depth sawing is utilized for concrete removal. 
5.  Graveled surfaces shall be bladed, shaped and resurfaced with two inches of gravel. 
6.  Berms are to be restored as nearly as possible to their original condition. Grass berms are to be re-seeded or re-sodded as necessary to fulfill this requirement. The berm restoration requirement will be waived when the abutting property owner requests such a waiver. 
7.  In the event the permittee lacks the proper equipment or ability to restore an asphalt, Portland cement concrete or graveled surface, the permittee may request the city to perform the work. If the city agrees to do the work, the permittee will be responsible for paying the city for all costs incurred in restoring the surface. Such a request must be made in writing within 24 hours after the backfilling is completed.

No building or structure may be erected, converted, enlarged, reconstructed or altered and no land use may occur except in accordance with all of the regulations established by this Land Development Code for the zoning district in which the building, structure or land use is located. 
20-0106 - Conflicting Provisions 
A.  Conflict with State or Federal Regulations 
If the provisions of this Land Development Code are inconsistent with those of the state or federal government, the more restrictive provision will control, to the extent permitted by law.

C.  Conflict with Private Restrictions 
It is not the intent of this Land Development Code to interfere with, abrogate or annul any easement, covenant, deed restriction or other agreement between private parties. If the provisions of this Land Development Code impose a greater restriction than imposed by a private agreement, the provisions of this Land Development Code will control. If the provisions of a valid, enforceable private agreement impose a greater restriction than this Land Development Code, the provisions of the private agreement will control. The City does not enforce private agreements or maintain a record of such agreements. 
20-0107 - Zoning Map 
The boundaries of the zoning districts established by this Land Development Code are shown on a map or series of maps designated the "Zoning District Map," which is adopted and made a part of this Land Development Code as fully as if it were set out in this Chapter in detail. Original copies of the zoning district map are maintained in the office of the Zoning Administrator. In case of any dispute regarding the zoning classification of property subject to this Land Development Code, the original maps maintained by the Zoning Administrator will control. The Zoning Administrator shall be responsible for producing all updates of the zoning map. 
A.  Omitted Land 
The zoning classification of any land that does not appear to be classified within any of the districts shown on the zoning map shall be AG. 
B.  District Boundaries 
The following rules will govern interpretations regarding the location of zoning district boundaries shown on the zoning map. 
1.  Streets, Waterways and Railroads 
Zoning district boundaries follow the centerlines of streets, alleys, waterways, railroad rights-of-way and other similar features, unless otherwise clearly indicated. When a boundary line shown on the zoning map appears to coincide with a street, alley, waterway or railroad right-of-way, the centerline of that street, alley, waterway or railroad right-of-way will be construed to be the zoning district boundary line. 
2.  Street Vacations 
Whenever any street, alley or public way is vacated by official action of the Board of City Commissioners, the zoning districts adjoining each side of such street, alley, or public way will be automatically extended to the center of such vacation and all area included in the vacation will be subject to all regulations of the extended district. 
3.  Lot Lines 
A zoning district boundary shown as approximately following the boundary line of a lot or separate parcel of land will be construed to be the boundary of the lot or parcel of land. If a lot line cannot be used to determine the boundary, its location will be determined by use of the scale shown on the zoning map. 
4.  Uncertainties 
Where actual on-the-ground conditions contradict those shown on the zoning map, or in cases of any other uncertainties regarding, the location of zoning district boundaries will be determined by the Zoning Administrator. 
20-0108 - Zoning of Extra-Territorial Areas 
When the City Commission elects to exercise its zoning authority within its Extra-Territorial Zoning Jurisdiction, it shall have the following three options: 
To classify such land in the AG zoning district; 
To classify such land in a zoning district that reflects the existing use of the property; or 
To classify such land in any other zoning district included in this Land Development Code, in accordance with the procedures of Sec. 20-0906. 
20-0109 - Transitional Provisions 
A.  Violations Continue 
Any violation of the previous zoning or subdivision regulations of the City will continue to be a violation under this Land Development Code and be subject to penalties and enforcement under Article 20-011, unless the use, development, construction or other activity complies with the provisions of this Land Development Code. 
B.  Nonconformities Under Previous Code 
Any nonconformity under the previous zoning regulations of the City will also be a legal nonconformity under this Land Development Code, as long as the situation that resulted in the nonconforming status under the previous regulation continues to exist. If, however, a nonconforming situation under a previous regulation becomes conforming because of the adoption of this Land Development Code, or any subsequent amendment to it, then the situation will no longer be a nonconformity. 
C.  Completion of Development 
1.  Permit Issued Before February 17, 1998 
Any building or development for which a permit was issued before February 17, 1998, may be completed in conformance with the issued permit and other applicable permits and conditions, even if such building or development does not fully comply with provisions of this Land Development Code. If construction is not commenced or completed according to the applicable permit terms, the Board of City Commissioners may, for good cause shown, grant an extension of up to 6 months for such construction. If the building is not completed within the time allowed under the original permit or any extension granted, then the building may be constructed, completed or occupied only in compliance with this Land Development Code. 
2.  Subdivision Plats Approved Before February 17, 1998 
Any subdivision for which a preliminary or final plat was approved before February 17, 1998, may be completed according to the approved plat and other applicable permits and conditions, even if the subdivision does not fully comply with the provisions of this Land Development Code. If the subdivision is not completed within the time requirements established by prior code or within any schedule included in the approval of the plat, the Board of City Commissioners may grant one extension of time for the completion of the subdivision. If the subdivision is not completed within the time required under the original approval or any extension granted, then the subdivision may be completed only in compliance with this Land Development Code.

20-0304 - P/I, Public and Institutional District 

A.  Description 
The P/I, Public and Institutional district is intended to accommodate uses of a governmental, civic, public service or quasi-public nature, including major public facilities. It offers an alternative (versus residential) zoning classification for public and institutional uses, thereby increasing development predictability within residential neighborhoods. Plan review is required for many uses within the P/I district. (See also the Institutional Master Plan review and approval procedures of Sec. 20-0911). The P/I zoning classification is not intended for commercial or industrial developments. 
B.  Uses 
Uses are allowed in the P/I district in accordance with the Use Table of Sec. 20-0401. 
C.  Dimensional Standards 
1.  The dimensional standards of the adjacent zoning district (See Article 20-05) shall apply to all areas of the P/I zoned site located within 150 feet of the adjacent district except as otherwise allowed by the Residential Protection standards. 
2.  Areas of the P/I zoned site located more than 150 feet from adjacent zoning districts shall be governed by the approved Site Plan or Institutional Master Plan, whichever, if any, is applicable. 
3.  If no Site Plan or Institutional Master Plan is required, no dimensional standards shall apply to that portion of a P/I zoned site located more than 150 feet from adjacent districts. 
4.  Residential Protection standards shall apply to development in the P/I district when such development occurs on a site located within 150 feet of any SR or MR zoning districts. When the Residential Protection standards are less restrictive than the adjacent zoning district standards within 150 feet of the SR or MR district, the Residential Protection standards shall apply. 
D.  Project Review 
1.  Project review shall be required for all development within the P/I district if located within 300 feet of any residential zoning district, provided that the following shall be exempt from Project Review: 
a.  Interior alterations; 
b.  Development that in cumulative total (existing development + proposed): 
(1)  Will not result in the creation of more than 50 parking spaces; 
(2)  Will not result in the addition of more than 25,000 square feet of gross floor area; 
(3)  Will not result in building coverage of more than 25,000 square feet. 
2.  If Project Review is required, the applicant shall have the option of: 
a.  Submitting and securing approval of individual Site Plan Review applications for each phase of the project, in accordance with the procedures of Sec. 20-0910; or 
b.  Submitting and securing approval of an Institutional Master Plan in accordance with the procedures of Sec. 20-0910.

20-0305 - H-O, Historic Overlay District 
A.  Applicability 
1.  The H-O district may be applied in areas of historic or cultural significance that have been designated by the U.S. Department of the Interior, the North Dakota State Historical Society or the Board of City Commissioners. 
2.  The H-O district may also be extended to include area that is near such areas of historic or cultural significance that is deemed appropriate and necessary to protect the larger area against the intrusion of land uses and development incompatible with the specific area of historic or cultural significance. 
3.  An area that conforms to the description of subparagraphs 1 or 2, above, shall be deemed to be an "historic resource". Such historic resources deserve special consideration for preservation and enhancement due to the contribution they make to our collective understanding of the historic development and cultural heritage of the city. They enhance the quality of life and the sense of place as amenities for residents and visitors through their craftsmanship, scale, and irreplaceable historic character. 
B.  Effect of District Designation 
Lands classified in the H-O district shall be subject to the standards of the H-O district and the underlying zoning district. In the event of conflict between the standards of the H-O district and the underlying zoning district, the standards of the H-O district shall control. 
C.  Adoption of special regulations and standards 
Upon the adoption of an H-O district, the City Commission may define special development standards or regulations which are to apply to all properties (new and existing) within the H-O District, consistent with the intent, goals, objectives and policies established for each district. If adopted, such standards shall be based on evidence of the historical and architectural aspects of the district which are typical or characteristic of that district, and shall be included within the zoning regulations of the Historic Overlay ordinance. 
D.  Purposes 
The H-O, Historic Overlay district regulations are intended to: 

1.  Protect and conserve the heritage of the City;

20-0306 - HIA-O, Hector International Airport Overlay 
A.  Description and Purpose 
The HIA-O, Hector International Airport Overlay district is intended to reduce airport hazards that endanger the lives and property of users of the Hector International Airport and of occupants of land in its vicinity. Lands classified in the HIA-O district will be subject to the standards of the HIA-O district and the underlying zoning district. In the event of conflict between the standards of the HIA-O district and the underlying zoning district, the standards of the HIA-O district will control. 
B.  Airport Zoning Map 
The Fargo Municipal (Hector) Airport Zoning Map" is a part of this Land Development Code as fully as if it were set out in this Chapter in detail. Original copies of the airport zoning map are on file with in Municipal Airport Executive Director's office at Hector International Airport. 
C.  HIA-O District Surfaces 
The HIA-O district consists of the following surfaces, which are hereby established and defined as follows: 
1.  Precision Instrument Approach Surfaces 
A precision instrument approach surface is established at each end of the instrument runway for instrument landings and takeoffs. The instrument approach surface shall have a width of 1,000 feet at a distance of 200 feet beyond each end of the runway, widening thereafter uniformly to a width of 16,000 feet at a distance of 50,200 feet beyond each end of the runway, its center line being the continuation of the center line of the runway. 
2.  Nonprecision Instrument Approach Surfaces 
A surface longitudinally centered on the extended runway center line and extending outward and upward from each end of the primary surface. This approach surface has a width of 500 feet at a distance of 200 feet beyond each end of the runway, widening thereafter uniformly to a width of 3,500 feet at a distance of 10,200 feet beyond each end of the runway. 
3.  Primary Surfaces 
A surface longitudinally centered on a runway and extending 200 feet beyond the end of each hard surface runway. The elevation of any point on the primary surface is the same as the elevation of the nearest point on the runway center line. The width of the primary is 500 feet for nonprecision instrument runways having visibility minimums greater than 0.75 statute miles and 1,000 feet for precision instrument runways. 
4.  Transitional Surfaces 
These surfaces extend outward and upward at right angles to the runway center line and the runway center line extended at a slope of 7 to 1 from the sides of the primary surface and from the sides of the approach surfaces. Transitional surfaces for those portions of the precision approach surface which project through and beyond the limits of the conical surface, extended a distance of 5,000 feet measured horizontally from the edge of the approach surface and at right angles to the runway center line. 
5.  Horizontal Surfaces 
A horizontal plan 150 feet above the established airport elevation, the perimeter of which is constructed by swinging arcs of specified radii from the center of each end of the primary surface of each runway and connecting the adjacent arcs by lines tangent to those arcs. 
6.  Conical Surfaces 
A surface extending outward and upward from the periphery of the horizontal surface at a slope of 20 to 1 for a horizontal distance of 4,000 feet. 
D.  Height Limits 
Unless otherwise specifically provided in this section, no structure or tree may be erected, altered, allowed to grow, or maintained, in any HIA-O zone to a height in excess of the maximum height limit established for such zone. These provisions shall not be construed as prohibiting the growth, construction or maintenance of any tree or structure to a height of up to 35 feet above the surface of the land. 
1.  Precision Instrument Approach Surfaces 
One foot in height for each 50 feet in horizontal distance beginning at a point 200 feet from and at the center line elevation of the end of the instrument runway and extending to a distance of 10,200 feet from the end of the runway; thence 1 foot in height for each 40 feet in horizontal distance to a point 50,200 feet from the end of the runway. 
2.  Nonprecision Instrument Approach Surfaces 
One foot in height for each 34 feet in horizontal distance beginning at the end of the primary surface of the nonprecision instrument runway and extending to a point 10,200 feet from the end of the runway. 
3.  Transitional Surfaces 
One foot in height for each 7 feet in horizontal distance beginning at the edge and normal to the primary surface, extending to a height of 150 feet above the airport elevation which is 900 feet above mean sea level. In addition, there are established height limits of 1 foot vertical height for each 7 feet of horizontal distance measured from the edges of all approach surfaces for the entire length of the approach surface and extending upward and outward to the points where they intersect the horizontal or conical surfaces. Further, where the precision instrument approach surface projects through and beyond the conical surface, a height limit of 1 foot for each 7 feet of horizontal distance shall be maintained beginning at the edge of the instrument approach surface and extending a distance of 5,000 feet from the edge of the instrument approach surface measured normal to the center line of the runway extended. 
4.  Horizontal Surfaces 
150 feet above the airport elevation or a height of 1,050 feet above mean seal level. A 10,000 foot horizontal arc swung from the center of each end of each primary surface and connecting, the adjacent arcs by lines tangent to these arcs make up the perimeter of the horizontal surface. 
5.  Conical Surfaces 
One foot in height for each 20 feet of horizontal distance beginning at the periphery of the horizontal surface, extending to a height of 350 feet above the airport elevation. 
E.  Uses 
Notwithstanding any other provisions of this section, no use may be made of land within the HIA-O district in such a manner as to create electrical interference with radio communication between the airport and aircraft, make it difficult for flyers to distinguish between airport lights and others, result in glare in the eyes of flyers using the airport, impair visibility in the vicinity of the airport or otherwise endanger the landing, taking off or maneuvering of aircraft. 
F.  Nonconforming Uses 
1.  Regulations Not Retroactive 
The regulations of this section shall not be construed to require the removal, lowering, or other changes or alterations of any structure or tree not conforming to the regulations of this section or otherwise interfere with the continuance of any nonconforming use. Nothing herein shall require any change in the construction, alteration or intended use of any structure, the construction or alteration of which was begun prior to the effective date of the City's original Airport Zoning Ordinance and is diligently pursued. 
2.  Marking and Lighting 
Notwithstanding the regulations of the preceding paragraph, the owner of any nonconforming structure or tree is hereby required to permit the installation, operation and maintenance thereon of such markers and lights as shall be deemed necessary by the Municipal Airport Authority of the City of Fargo, North Dakota, to indicate to the operators of aircraft in the vicinity of the airport the presence of such airport hazards. Such markers and lights shall be installed, operated and maintained at the expense of the Municipal Airport Authority of the City of Fargo, North Dakota. 
G.  Permits 
1.  Future Uses 
Except as specifically provided in paragraphs a, b and c hereunder, no material change shall be made in the use of land and no structure or tree shall be erected, altered, planted or otherwise established in the HIA-O district unless a permit therefor shall have been applied for and granted. Each application for a permit shall indicate the purpose for which the permit is desired, with sufficient particularity to permit it to be determined whether the resulting use, structure or tree would conform to the regulations herein prescribed. If such determination is in the affirmative, the permit shall be granted. 
a.  In the area lying within the limits of the horizontal surface and the conical surface, no permit shall be required for any tree or structure less than 75 feet of vertical height above ground, except when, because of terrain, land contour or topographic features, such tree or structure would extend above the height limits prescribed for such surface. 
b.  In the areas lying within the limits of the precision instrument and nonprecision instrument approach surfaces, but at a horizontal distance of not less that 4,200 feet from each end of the runways, no permit shall be required for any tree or structure less than 75 feet of vertical height above the ground, except when such tree or structure would extend above the height limit prescribed for such precision instrument or nonprecision instrument approach surfaces. 
c.  In the areas lying within the limits of the transition surfaces beyond the perimeter of the horizontal surface, no permit shall be required for any tree or structure less than 75 feet of vertical height above the ground, except when such tree or structure, because of terrain, land contour or topographic features, would extend above the height limit prescribed for such transition surfaces. 
Nothing contained in any of the foregoing exceptions shall be construed as permitting or intending to permit any construction, alteration, or growth of any structure or tree in excess of any of the height limits established by this section. 
2.  Existing Uses 
No permit shall be granted that would allow the establishment or creation of an airport hazard or permit a nonconforming use, structure or tree to be made or become higher, or become a greater hazard to air navigation than it was on the effective date of the City's Airport Zoning Ordinance or any amendments thereto or than it is when the application for a permit is made. Except as indicated, all applications for such a permit shall be granted. 
3.  Nonconforming Uses Abandoned or Destroyed 
Whenever the Joint Airport Zoning Board determines that a nonconforming structure or tree has been abandoned or more than 80 percent demolished, physically deteriorated or decayed, no permit shall be granted that would allow such structure or tree to exceed the applicable height limit or otherwise deviate from the zoning regulations. 
4.  Variances 
Any person desiring to erect or increase the height of any structure, or permit the growth of any tree, or use his or her property not in accordance with the regulations prescribed in this section, may apply to the Board of Adjustments for a variance from such regulations. Such variances shall be allowed where it is duly found that a literal application or enforcement of the regulations would result in practical difficulty or unnecessary hardship and the relief granted would not be contrary to the public interest but will do substantial justice and be in accordance with the spirit of this section. 
5.  Hazard Marking and Lighting 
Any permit or variance granted may, if such action is deemed advisable to effectuate the purpose of this section and be reasonable in the circumstances, be so conditioned as to require the owner of the structure or tree in question to permit the Municipal Airport Authority of the City of Fargo, North Dakota, at its own expense, to install, operate, and maintain thereon such markers and lights as may be necessary to indicate to flyers the presence of an airport hazard. 
H.  Administration and Enforcement 
It shall be the duty of the Municipal Airport Executive Director to administer and enforce the HIA-O regulations of this section and any applicable regulations promulgated by the Federal Aviation Administration. Applications for permits and variances shall be made to the Federal Aviation Administration and/or the Municipal Airport Executive Director in a form established by the City. Applications shall be promptly considered and granted or denied. The HIA-O regulations of this section may be subject to the regulations promulgated by the Federal Aviation Administration.

Any proposed attached telecommunications facility which does not comply with the foregoing requirements will only be permitted if approved in accordance with the Conditional Use review procedures of Sec. 20-0909. 
3.  Telecommunications Support Structures 
Telecommunications support structures (also referred to herein as "TSS") must comply with the following requirements as approved by the Zoning Administrator, unless otherwise stated. TSSs located within the City of Fargo public right-of-way are exempt from the following use standards of this section, but shall comply with Article 24-04 of the Fargo Municipal Code and all other applicable requirements of the Land Development Code. 
a.  As provided by Sec. 20-0402, TSSs of no more than 125 feet in height are permitted in GC, LI and GI zoning districts subject to use-specific standards, including: 
(1)  No TSS may be located closer than 200 feet or two times the height of the TSS, whichever is greater, from the base of the TSS to any residentially zoned property, as measured from the base of the TSS to the nearest such residentially zoned property line; 
(2)  The TSS must have co-location capability of at least one other telecommunications provider, unless stealth design considerations make co-location unfeasible as determined by the City Planner; and 
(3)  TSSs shall be either clustered together or spread apart an adequate distance so as to reduce their impact on the overall appearance of the area and the view of the horizon. Therefore, TSSs shall be placed either: 
(a)  No farther than 300 feet from an existing and approved telecommunications TSS, or 
(b)  A minimum distance of 1/4 mile between existing and approved TSSs of 125 feet in height or less, and a minimum distance of 1/2 mile from telecommunications TSSs of over 125 feet in height, as measured from the base of one TSS to the base of another. 
b.  As provided by Sec. 20-0401, TSSs of more than 125 feet in height are Conditional Uses in GC, LI and GI zoning districts and are therefore subject to the Conditional Use review process of Sec. 20-0909: 
(1)  No TSS may be located closer than 500 feet or three times the height of the TSS, whichever is greater, from any residentially zoned property, as measured from the base of the TSS to the nearest such residentially zoned property line; 
(2)  The TSS must have co-location capability of at least two other telecommunications providers, unless stealth design considerations make co-location unfeasible as determined by the City Planner; and 
(3)  TSSs shall be either clustered together or spread apart an adequate distance so as to reduce their impact on the overall appearance of the area and the view of the horizon. Therefore, TSSs shall be placed either no farther than 300 feet from an existing and approved telecommunications TSS, or a minimum distance of 1/4 mile between existing and approved telecommunications TSSs of 125 feet in height or less, and a minimum distance of 1/2 mile from telecommunications TSSs of over 125 feet in height, as measured from the base of one TSS to the base of another TSS. 
c.  As provided by Sec. 20-0401, TSSs of no more than 50 feet in height are permitted by right in MR-3, UMU, NO, NC, GO, LC and P/I zoning districts subject to use-specific standards, including: 
(1)  No TSS located in any non-residential zoning district may be located closer than 200 feet from any residentially zoned property, as measured from the base of the TSS to the nearest such residentially zoned property line: and 
(2)  No TSSs may be located closer than 200 feet from any SR zoning districts, as measured from the base of the TSS to the nearest point of such SR zoning district. 
d.  As provided by Sec. 20-0401, TSSs of no more than 35 feet in height are permitted by right in AG, SR-0-SR-5, MR-1-MR-2, MHP, and DMU zoning districts subject to the applicable use-specific standards of this section. 
e.  As provided by Sec. 20-0401, in AG, SR through SR-5, MR-1 through MR-3, UMU, MHP, NO, NC, GO, LC, DMU, and P/I zoning districts, TSSs which exceed the maximum height for TSSs permitted by-right for the applicable zoning district, but are not more than 125 feet in height are Conditional Uses and are therefore subject to the Conditional Use review process of Sec. 20-0909: 
(1)  No TSS may be located closer than 1/2 mile from any existing and/or approved TSSs of over 125 feet in height, and 1/4 mile from any existing and/or approved TSSs of 125 feet or less, as measured from the base of one TSS to the base of another; 
(2)  The TSS must have co-location capability of at least one other telecommunications provider, unless stealth design considerations make co-location unfeasible as determined by the City Planner; 
(3)  TSSs shall comply with such other conditions as determined by the Planning Commission; 
(4)  No TSS located in any non-residential zoning district may be located closer than 200 feet or two times the height of the TSS, whichever is greater, from any residentially zoned property, as measured from the base of the TSS to the nearest such residentially zone property line; and 
(5)  No TSSs located in any MR zoning district may be located closer than 200 feet or two times the height of the TSS, whichever is greater, from any SR zoning districts, as measured from the base of the TSS to the nearest point of such SR zoning district. 
f.  TSSs supported by Guy Wires - As provided by Sec. 20-0401, TSSs in AG zoning districts of any height are Conditional Uses and are therefore subject to the Conditional Use review process of Sec. 20-0909. Guy TSSs of any height are prohibited in all other zoning districts. 
g.  In addition to any of the foregoing requirements, all TSSs must comply with the following requirements, unless approval is otherwise obtained through the Conditional Use review process of Sec. 20-0909. 
(1)  The use of any portion of a TSS for signs other than warning or equipment information signs is prohibited. 
(2)  TSSs must be set back from public street, park, or bikeway right-of-way a minimum distance equal to one half of the height of the TSS, including all antennas and attachments. 
(3)  Unless the City Planner determines that stealth design considerations suggest otherwise, TSSs may not be located between a primary building structure and a public street within a front or side yard, except in LI and GI zoning districts, where TSSs may be placed within a side yard abutting an internal/local street. If a site in a GI or LI zoning district is surrounded by public streets, a TSS may be placed within a side yard abutting a local street. 
(4)  Except as otherwise approved as provided in this section, TSSs must not be illuminated by artificial means and not display strobe lights unless such lighting is specifically required by the Federal Aviation Administration or other federal or state authority for a particular TSS. 
h.  Before a building permit may be issued for a TSS, the City Planner must provide approval of the standards as follows. In such cases when the Conditional Use review process of Sec. 20-0909 is required for a TSS, the Planning Commission shall be the decision maker and must provide approval of the standards as follows: 
(1)  The design and construction of the TSS, antenna support structures, equipment buildings, fences, and other structures must be compatible with the architectural style of the surrounding built environment, considering colors, exterior building materials, roof form, scale, mass, color, and character. 
(2)  The base of the TSS must be enclosed by an opaque fence or wall of at least 6 feet in height and of a character necessary to provide adequate visual screening and to limit access to the TSS. Such requirements may be waived by the City Planner if the TSS is of a stealth design. 
(3)  The City Planner may require, as a condition of approval of a TSS, that the lot upon which the TSS is located be brought into conformance with the residential protection standards and/or landscaping requirements set forth in Sections 20-0704 and 20-0705. 
(4)  Commercial wireless TSSs must be a monopole design unless stealth design considerations are made and the City Planner determines that the stealth design would be more fitting with the surrounding environment. 
(5)  When incorporated into the approved design of the TSS, light fixtures used to illuminate ball fields, parking lots or similar areas may be attached to the TSS. 
i.  The applicant shall submit such information as required by the Zoning Administrator including the following: 
(1)  Description of the TSS height and design including a cross section (site plan) showing the proposed location of the TSS and the equipment building and an elevation showing the proposed height of the TSS including the maximum tip-height (maximum height of any attached antennas), 
(2)  Documentation of the proposed height above grade for all potential mounting positions for co-located antennas and the minimum separation distances between antennas, and 
(3)  Descriptions of the TSS's capacity for both the primary user and co-location users, including the number and type of antennas or other equipment that can be accommodated. 
(4)  Applicant shall be responsible for changing frequencies of the installed equipment if it interferes with any then-existing police, fire or other public or private emergency service system or public signal system. 
(5)  Other information necessary to evaluate the application as determined during the review process. 
j.  The following definitions and general provisions shall apply to this Land Development Code: 
(1)  All TSSs shall be dismantled and removed by the owner when they are no longer in use or upon abandonment. Abandonment shall be deemed to have occurred when a TSS has not been continuously in use by a telecommunications user for a period of at least 12 consecutive months. An abandoned TSS shall be considered a nuisance. Upon abandonment of a TSS, upon 30 days' notice to the record owner of the property upon which the TSS is constructed, exists or rests, if the TSS is not removed within a period of 60 days from said notice, the TSS and associated facilities may be removed by the City and the costs of removal assessed against the property, in accordance with the provisions of Sec. 11-0103 of the Fargo Municipal Code. 
(2)  The height of TSSs shall be measured from the TSS's center point of contact with the ground to the highest point of the TSS, including all antennas or other attachments. 
(3)  The term "Co-Location" shall mean the location of more than one antenna or transmitter on a single TSS. 
(4)  The term "stealth" as used in this section shall mean, in referring to freestanding telecommunications TSSs, the ability to blend into the context of the surrounding environment at a given location or to use a TSS design that is as inconspicuous as possible under the existing or planned circumstances by screening, disguising, concealing, or otherwise camouflaging the TSS as a natural feature, as part of the structure, or as an accessory structure consistent with the overall function of the property on which the TSS is located. For antenna support structures, stealth is the ability to camouflage, conceal, or reduce the conspicuousness of the presence of wireless communication facilities. 
k.  Through a Conditional Use Permit, the Planning Commission may reduce the TSS spacing and setback requirements of this section (20-0402.N) by up to 50 percent. Spacing requirements that are eligible for reduction include: 1) spacing distances between existing and proposed TSSs and 2) setback distances from SR and other residential zoning districts. Any such request for reduction of these spacing and/or setback requirements shall be considered in accordance with the Conditional Use Permit review procedures of Section 20-0909, and shall comply with the following standards: 
(1)  The TSS shall be of a stealth design; 
(2)  If applicable, the applicant already has telecommunication facilities on the existing TSS from which separation would otherwise be required; and

In a subdivision of at least 10 lots in number, one residential dwelling may be used on a temporary basis as a sales office and/or construction office for other lots and/or new homes within the subdivision. A permit for such temporary use must be obtained from the Zoning Administrator. The temporary use as such sales office and/or construction office shall be permitted until such time as ninety percent (90%) of the lots in the subdivision have been sold to persons, firms or entities other than the permittee, upon which event said temporary use must be terminated within ninety (90) days of such event. In no event, however, shall such temporary use be allowed for more than three (3) years from the date of approval of the subdivision unless an extension of the permit is granted as a Conditional Use, in accordance with the Conditional Use review procedures of Sec. 20-0909.

U.  Group Living 
1.  Purpose and Intent 
The city finds and declares that group living of convicted felons is a serious threat to public safety. The city finds that measures should be taken to reduce temptation and opportunity to better protect its citizens; especially children, the elderly and other "at risk" populations. The city contends that without the benefit of a behavioral program intended to reduce the rate of recidivism, the tendency of a convicted felon to relapse into a previous mode of behavior, especially criminal behavior, is amplified by cohabitation with groups of other convicted felons. This regulation is aimed at protecting the health and safety of citizens in the City of Fargo from the risk of convicted felons by establishing a minimum distance at which a group living facility housing convicted felons can be established where children, the elderly, at other at risk populations tend to congregate or be regularly present. It is not the intent of this article to impose a criminal penalty but rather to serve the city's compelling interest to promote, protect and improve the health, safety, and welfare of the citizens of the city by maintaining safety zones around locations where "at risk" populations regularly congregate in concentrated numbers wherein convicted felons are prohibited from establishing a permanent group living situation. 
2.  Characteristics 
Group Living Restricted Residency is characterized by the residential occupancy of a structure by a group of people, who have been individually convicted of a felony, that do not meet the definition of Household. The size of the group may be larger than the average size of a household. Tenancy is arranged on a monthly or longer basis. Uses where tenancy may be arranged for a shorter period are not considered residential. They are considered to be a form of transient lodging (see the Retail Sales and Service and Community Service categories). Generally, group living structures have a common eating area for residents. 
3.  Accessory Uses 
Accessory uses commonly associated with Group Living Restricted Residency are group treatment and/or training, offices, recreational activities, and parking of vehicles for occupants and staff. 
4.  Examples 
Examples of Group Living Restricted Residency include residential programs for drug and alcohol treatment, treatment of sex offenders; and alternative or post incarceration facilities. 
5.  Exceptions 
a.  Lodging where tenancy may be arranged for periods of less than 30 days is to be considered a hotel or motel use and classified in the Retail Sales and Service category. 
b.  Lodging where the residents meet the definition of Household and where tenancy is arranged on a month-to-month basis or for a longer period is classified as Household Living. 
c.  Facilities for people who are under judicial detainment and under the supervision of sworn officers are included in the Detention Facilities category. 
d.  The person was a minor when he/she committed the offense and was not convicted as an adult. 
e.  The person is a minor or ward under guardianship. 
6.  Applicability 
Group Living Restricted Residency uses subject to a conditional use permit as determined in Table 20-0401 of Article 20-04 of this code, are allowed, if reviewed and approved as a Conditional Use, in accordance with the Conditional Use review procedures of Sec. 20-0909. 
7.  Conditions of Approval 
In acting upon Conditional Use Permit requests for Group Living-Restricted Residency uses in any conditionally permitted zoning district, the Planning Commission shall also consider the following factors: 
a.  Whether or not the dwelling unit meets all building, housing, and fire codes of the City; 
b.  Whether or not the property has off-street parking space for every vehicle which is owned, possessed or utilized by occupants of the building. Such parking spaces must meet all applicable standards of the City; 
c.  The general condition of the building and whether or not it is in need of substantial repairs or renovation; and 
d.  Whether or not the requested occupancy is compatible with the neighborhood and will not create undue density and/or congestion. 
The establishment of a Group Living Restricted Residency Behavioral Program. The program must include a list of the facility's goals and objectives intended to prevent recidivism along with procedures to ensure its successful implementation.

20-0403 - Accessory Uses 
A.  General 
Permitted uses and approved conditional uses shall be deemed to include accessory uses and accessory structures. Accessory uses and structures will be subject to the same regulations as apply to principal uses and structures in each district, unless otherwise stated in this Land Development Code. Examples of customary accessory uses can be found in use category descriptions of Sec. 20-1203. Interpretations regarding allowed accessory uses shall be made by the Zoning Administrator. 
B.  Development Standards 
The following standards apply to all accessory uses and structures unless otherwise expressly provided. 
1.  Timing of Construction

3.  Rear Setback 
a.  In all zoning districts, except the UMU zoning district, accessory structures, when located within the rear yard area, are exempt from the rear and interior-side setback requirements of the underlying zoning district and shall be set back at least 3 feet from rear and interior-side lot lines. This 3-foot setback shall not apply to fences or walls.

4.  Interior Side Setback 
a.  In zoning districts other than UMU, no accessory structure, other than a fence or wall, may be located within a required interior side setback, except that garages and parking structures accessory to multi-dwelling development in all MR districts shall only require a 3-foot minimum setback on lots platted after February 17, 1998. On MR lots that share a common interior side-yard, no setback is required to accessory structures provided there is a recorded cross-access agreement between the record owners of the respective properties, and provided the structures meet all applicable building codes for such a structure. 
b.  In a UMU zoning district, accessory structures, other than fences or walls, shall meet the interior side setback requirements of Sec. 20-0501. 
5.  Setbacks from Public Easements 
No accessory structure, other than a fence or wall, may be located within any recorded public easement or over any known public utility. 
6.  Height of accessory structures/fences, walls, hedges. 
a.  Residential Districts 
In SR-1 through SR-5 and MR and UMU zoning districts accessory structures shall not exceed 15 feet in height.

c.  Fences, Walls and Closely Grown Hedges. 
(1)  Within SR, MR, UMU, NC and NO zoning districts, restrictions on the height of fences, walls and closely grown hedges shall be as follows: 
(a)  in any front yard no fence, wall or hedge shall exceed 3 feet in height, provided however, that fences that are at least 75% light-permeable may exceed 3 feet, but may not exceed 4 feet in height; 
(b)  in any street side yard or interior sideyard from the front property line extending the length of the front-yard setback distance or to the front of any existing house or other principal building, whichever length is greater, no fence, wall or hedge shall exceed 3 feet in height, provided however, that fences that are at least 75% light-permeable may exceed 3 feet, but may not exceed 4 feet in height; 
(c)  in any street side yard or interior side yard from the point identified in subparagraph (b) hereof to the rear property boundary or in any rear yard no fence, wall or hedge shall exceed 6.5 feet in height; and, 
(d)  in any rear yard, any fence, wall, or hedge located at least three feet from the property line may exceed 6.5 feet, but may not exceed 8.5 feet.

(4)  Notwithstanding any other provisions of this section, any fence located completely within the required building setback for the zoning district is subject only to the height limitations as are buildings within that zoning district. 
7.  Building Coverage 
Building coverage of detached accessory structures may not exceed that of the principal building or 700 square feet, whichever is greater; provided, however, that in MR zoning districts, garages accessory to multi-dwelling structures may not exceed 130 percent of the building coverage of the principal building, and in a UMU zoning district building coverage of detached accessory structures may not exceed 50 percent of the building coverage of the principal building, and in the SR-0 district, building coverage of detached accessory structures may not exceed 150 percent of the building coverage of the principal building and in SR-0, SR-1 and SR-2 districts when lot sizes are equal to or greater than 40,000 square feet in size, building coverage of detached accessory structures may not exceed the size as shown on Table 20-0403 below. Accessory buildings and structures shall be included in the calculation of total building coverage. In MR zoning districts, as to multi-dwelling structures with garages as accessory buildings, building coverage may be allowed up to 37.5 percent, provided there is a significant shared site amenity to be shared among the tenants included on the landscaping plan submitted during the building permit process.

C.  Home Occupations 
Many types of work can be conducted at home with little or no effect on the surrounding neighborhood. The home occupation regulations of this section are intended to permit residents to engage in home occupations, while ensuring that home occupations will not be a detriment to the character and livability of the surrounding neighborhood. The regulations require that home occupations (an accessory use) remain subordinate to the allowed principal use (household living) and that the residential viability of the dwelling unit is maintained. 
1.  Types of Home Occupations 
There are two types of home occupations - Major Home Occupations and Minor Home Occupations. Both types are considered an accessory use to an allowed household living use. Unless otherwise expressly stated, the regulations of this Land Development Code apply to both types of home occupations. 
2.  Minor Home Occupations - Defined 
A Minor Home Occupation is one in which residents use up to 25 percent of the floor area of their home as a place of work, but in which no employees come to the site. Minor Home Occupations allow up to four customers per day, with a maximum of 12 customers per week, only between the hours of 7:00 a.m. and 9:00 p.m. No more than one customer is permitted on the site at any given time. Examples include, but are not limited to, artists, crafts people, writers, professional consultants personal care and grooming services, and employees of off-site businesses who work from their home. In addition, tutors, such as piano or other music teachers, who provide lessons to no more than 60 students per week and do not have non-resident employees coming to the site, shall be deemed minor home occupations. In addition, dog grooming services that would qualify as a Minor Home Occupation as a result of percentage of floor area of the home, customer activity and hours of operation may be allowed after it has been reviewed and approved in accordance with Conditional Use Review procedures of Sec. 20-0909. Unless otherwise expressly stated, any Conditional Use Permit for such dog grooming service granted pursuant to Section 20-0909 shall automatically terminate upon sale or transfer of the property. For purposes of calculating floor area of a minor or major home occupation in which the home occupation occupies a garage that is attached or detached from the primary home structure, the sum of the home and garage square footage shall be included in the total square footage from which the 25 percent maximum floor area is computed. 
3.  Major Home Occupations - Defined 
A Major Home Occupation is one in which residents use up to 25 percent of the floor area of their home as a place of work and that has a nonresident employee and/or customers coming to the site. Examples are counseling, tutoring, and hair cutting and styling. 
4.  Allowed Uses 
The home occupation regulations of this Land Development Code establish performance standards for accessory home occupations rather than defining a list of allowed home occupations. Uses that comply with all of the standards of this section will be allowed as home occupations unless they are specifically prohibited. 
5.  Prohibited Uses 
a.  Vehicle and Large Equipment Repair 
Any type of repair or assembly of vehicles or equipment with internal combustion engines (such as autos, motorcycles, scooters, snowmobiles, outboard marine engines, lawn mowers, chain saws, and other small engines) or of large appliances (such as washing machines, dryers, and refrigerators) or any other work related to automobiles and their parts is prohibited. 
b.  Dispatch Centers 
Dispatch centers, where employees come to the site to be dispatched to other locations, are not allowed as home occupations. 
c.  Mortuaries 
Mortuaries are not allowed as home occupations. 
d.  Animal Care, Grooming, or Boarding Facilities 
Animal care or boarding facilities are not allowed as home occupations. This includes animal hospitals, kennels, stables and all other types of animal boarding and care facilities. Dog grooming services are also included as prohibited animal care or boarding facilities; however, to the extent such services would otherwise qualify as a Minor Home Occupation, dog grooming services may be allowed upon application as provided in paragraph 2, regarding Minor Home Occupations, above. In no event may dog grooming be allowed as a Major Home Occupation. 
e.  Firearms and Ammunition Sales 
The sale of firearms and/or ammunition, and the production of ammunition for sale or resale are prohibited as home occupations. 
f.  Adult Entertainment Center Uses 
Entertainment or sale of goods defined as adult bookstore, adult cinema, adult entertainment facility, or adult entertainment center as defined in Sec. 20-1202 are not allowed as a home occupation. 
6.  Signs 
No more than one sign shall be allowed on the site of a home occupation. The maximum size of the sign shall be one square foot. It may not be illuminated, and it must be attached to the dwelling unit. 
7.  Outdoor Activities 
All activities and storage areas must be conducted in completely enclosed structures. 
8.  Exterior Appearance 
There may be no change in the exterior appearance of the dwelling unit that houses the home occupation or the site upon which it is conducted that will make the dwelling appear less residential in nature or function. Examples of such prohibited alterations include construction of parking lots, paving of required setbacks, or adding commercial-like exterior lighting. There may be no visible evidence of the conduct of a home occupation when viewed from the street right-of-way or from an adjacent lot. 
9.  Operational Impacts 
No home occupation or equipment used in conjunction with a home occupation may cause odor, vibration, noise, electrical interference or fluctuation in voltage that is perceptible beyond the lot line of the lot upon which the home occupation is conducted. No hazardous substances may be used or stored in conjunction with a home occupation. 
10.  Trucks and Vehicles 
No truck or van with a payload rating of more than 1 ton may be parked at the site of a home occupation, and no more than one truck or van with a payload rating of less than 1 ton is allowed at the site of a home occupation. 
11.  Deliveries 
Deliveries or pick-ups of supplies or products associated with business activities are allowed only between 8 a.m. and 6 p.m. Vehicles used for delivery and pick-up are limited to those normally servicing residential neighborhoods. 
12.  Major Home Occupations 
The following regulations apply only to Major Home Occupations. 
a.  Conditional Use Permits 
No Major Home Occupation is allowed unless it has been reviewed and approved in accordance with Conditional Use Review procedures of Sec. 20-0909. Unless otherwise expressly stated, any Conditional Use Permit for such Major Home Occupation granted pursuant to Section 20-0909 shall automatically terminate upon sale or transfer of the property. 
b.  Employees 
A maximum of one nonresident employee is allowed with a Major Home Occupation provided no customers come to the site. Major Home Occupations that have customers coming to the site are not allowed to have nonresident employees. For the purpose of this provision, the term "nonresident employee" includes an employee, business partner, co-owner, or other person affiliated with the home occupation, who does not live at the site, but who visits the site as part of the home occupation. 
c.  Customers 
Customers may visit the site only during the hours of 7 a.m. to 9 p.m., and no more than 12 customers or clients may visit the site in any single day. 
d.  Number 
No more than one Major Home Occupation may be conducted on a single site. A Minor Home Occupation may be conducted on the site of a Major Home Occupation. 
D.  Freestanding Non-Commercial Telecommunications Support Structures 
Telecommunications Support Structures ("TSS") for the purpose of elevating non-commercial antennas are permitted as accessory uses in AG, SR, MR, UMU, NC, and NO zoning districts, pursuant to the requirements listed below. 
1.  The maximum permitted height of a TSS for non-commercial antennas in an AG, SR, MR, UMU, NC, or NO zoning district or on a site with residential land use is a total of 50 feet, as measured from the ground to the top of the TSS. The maximum height of masts and/or antennas mounted on the TSS is 30 feet, for a total maximum height of 80 feet. 
2.  In an AG, SR, MR, UMU, NC, or NO zoning district, or on a site with residential land use, a TSS of greater than 50 feet, up to a maximum of 70 feet, as measured from the ground to the top of the TSS is a conditional use. The maximum height of masts and/or antennas mounted on the TSS is 30 feet, for a total maximum height of 100 feet. Factors for considering approval of a conditional use for TSSs exceeding 50 feet in height include: 
a.  Existence of a structure within 300 feet of the TSS, which will create interference with antenna operations. 
b.  Tree heights in the yard where the TSS is to be located or in immediately adjacent yards are such that they will interfere with ham radio operations. 
c.  The orientation of the trees, yard, TSS, and neighboring homes is such that the increased height will not make the TSS more noticeable or more intrusive to properties within 300 feet. 
3.  In all other zoning districts, the provisions of Section 20-0402.N. shall apply. 
4.  Non-commercial antenna TSS shall be permitted only in the rear yard of the property. If the yard is configured in a manner such that there is essentially no rear yard available for the TSS, the Zoning Administrator may approve placement of the TSS within the sideyard. In addition, if the Zoning Administrator determines that locating the TSS in the sideyard would result in reduced visibility of the TSS by neighboring properties, a sideyard location may be approved. 
5.  Setbacks of the TSS shall meet the dimensional standards of the zoning district in which they are located. Antennas mounted upon such TSS shall not project beyond the property lines. 
6.  Guy wires, if used, may be anchored within the side or rear yard setbacks of the property. They shall not project into or be anchored into the front yard. 
7.  The application for a Building Permit and/or Conditional Use Permit for a freestanding non-commercial antenna TSS shall include: 
a.  A site plan showing the exact proposed location of the TSS, 
b.  Installation plans demonstrating the adequacy of the structural design, 
c.  Documentation showing the proposed height of the TSS and the materials from which it will be constructed, and 
d.  Any other information as deemed necessary by the Inspections Administrator or the Zoning Administrator. 
8.  One freestanding non-commercial antenna TSS shall be permitted per residential unit. Additional TSSs, up to a maximum of three, require approval of a Conditional Use Permit, subject to the review criteria stated above and the criteria listed in Section 20-0909. 
E.  Keeping of Chickens 
The keeping of chickens authorized by a city permit in accordance with Article 12-03 shall not be considered an agricultural use but, rather, shall be considered an accessory use to household living. [See also  20-1203.G, Agricultural use category.]

20-0504 - Measurements and Exemptions 
A.  Density 
Density refers to the number of dwelling units for each acre of land. Density is calculated by dividing the number of dwelling units on a lot by the area (in acres) of the lot on which the dwelling unit is located. The number of dwelling units allowed on a site is based on the presumption that all other applicable standards will be met. The maximum density established for a district is not a guarantee that such densities may be obtained, nor a justification for adjusting other dimensional or development standards. 
B.  Lot Area 
Lot area refers to the horizontal land area within lot lines. No building permit or development approval may be issued for a lot that does not meet the minimum lot area requirements of this Land Development Code except in the following cases. 
1.  Reduction of Public Purpose 
When an existing lot is reduced because of conveyance to a federal, state or local government for a public purpose and the remaining area is at least 75 percent of the required minimum lot size for the district in which it is located, then that remaining lot will be deemed to comply with the minimum lot area standards of this Land Development Code. 
2.  Utilities 
Utilities using land or an unoccupied building covering less than 1,000 square feet of site area are exempt from the minimum lot area standards. 
3.  Detached House Exemption 
The minimum lot area standards of this Land Development Code shall not be interpreted as prohibiting the construction of a detached house on a Legal Lot, provided that the house is constructed in compliance with all applicable setback standards. 

C.  Lot Width 
Lot width is measured between side lot lines along a line that is parallel to the front lot line or its chord and located the minimum front setback distance from the front lot line. 
D.  Setbacks 
Setbacks refer to the unobstructed, unoccupied open area between the furthermost projection of a structure and the property line of the lot on which the structure is located, except as modified by the standards of this section. Setbacks must be unobstructed from the ground to the sky except as specified in this section. 
1.  Exceptions to Setbacks 
Every part of a required setback must be open and unobstructed from the ground to the sky except as set out in this subsection: 
a.  Trees, shrubbery or other landscape features may be located within any required setback; 
b.  Fences and walls may be located within any required setback, subject to Sec. 20-0403-B.2; 
c.  Driveways and sidewalks may be located within any required setback; 
d.  Utility lines, wires and associated structures, such as power poles, may be located within any required setback; 
e.  Signs, where permitted, may be located within any required setback; 
f.  Uncovered porches, uncovered steps to building entrances, uncovered patio decks and uncovered balconies may extend up to 10 feet into any required front, rear or street side setback and up to 3 feet into any required interior side setback; 
g.  Openwork fire balconies and fire escapes may extend up to 3 1/2 feet into any required setback; 
h.  Sills, belt courses, cornices, buttresses, eaves and other architectural features may extend up to 3 feet into any required setback; 
i.  Off-street parking and loading areas, subject to Sec. 20-0704, may be located within any required setback; 
j.  Chimneys and flues may extend up to 2 feet into any required setback; 
k.  Accessory structures may be located within rear setbacks in accordance with Sec. 0403-B.3. (See also Sec. 0403-B.4); 
l.  Solar panels and other apparatus needed for the operation of active and passive solar energy systems and all other forms of renewable passive energy, including but not limited to, overhangs, movable insulating walls and roofs, detached solar collectors, reflectors, and piping may project into a required rear setback by up to 10 feet and into a side setback by up to 3 feet. In all cases, however, they must be located at least 3 feet from all lot lines; and 
m.  Satellite dish antennas may be placed in required rear setbacks and on roofs. 
2.  Setback Averaging 
In a block where the average front setback of existing buildings within 100 feet of the subject lot is not more than 6 feet greater or 6 feet less than the front setback requirement for the zoning district in which such block is located, the front setback for the proposed building shall be set at such average depth. Where such average depth is more than 6 feet greater or 6 feet less than the front setback required for such district, this average setback requirement may be waived by the Board of Adjustment and a different requirement established by the Board of Adjustment. When a block is zoned in different zoning districts, the front setback requirements of the district that requires the greater front setback shall apply along its entire length. Setback averaging is not required in a UMU, University Mixed-Use District. 
3.  Reverse Corner Lots 
The minimum street side setback on a reverse corner lot shall equal at least 50 percent of the required front setback of the lots located to the rear of the reverse corner lot. No principal or accessory building on the reverse corner lot shall project beyond this minimum street side setback line. This provision shall not be construed to reduce the buildable lot width of a corner lot to less than 25 feet. 
4.  Reduction for Public Purpose 
When an existing setback is reduced because of conveyance to a federal, state or local government for a public purpose and the remaining setback is at least 75 percent of the required minimum setback for the district in which it is located, then that remaining setback will be deemed to satisfy the minimum setback standards of this Land Development Code. 
E.  Building Coverage 
Building coverage refers to the area of a lot covered by buildings (principal and accessory) or roofed areas, as measured along the outside wall at ground level, and including all projections, other than open porches, fire escapes, canopies and the first three feet of a roof overhang. 
F.  Open Space 
Open Space refers to outdoor, unenclosed areas, located on the ground or on a roof, balcony, deck, porch or terrace designed and accessible for outdoor living, recreation, pedestrian access or landscaping, but not including roads, parking areas, driveways, or other areas intended for vehicular travel. If approved by the Planning Commission, the open space standards of this Article may be satisfied by funding or otherwise providing an equivalent amount of off-site open space within a 1-mile radius of the proposed development site. 

G.  Height 
Building height refers to the vertical distance between the average finished grade at the base of the building along the side of the building being measured and: 1) the average height level between the eaves and ridge line of a gable, hip, gambrel or mono-pitch roof; 2) the highest point of a mansard roof; or 3) the highest point of the coping of a flat roof. 
1.  Fences or Walls 
In the case of fences or walls, height shall be measured from ground level on the higher side of the fence or wall. 
2.  Exceptions to Height Limits 
Zoning district height limits do not apply to belfries, cupolas, spires, domes, monuments, airway beacons, radio/communication towers, structures for essential services, windmills, flagpoles, chimneys, radio/television receiving antennas or chimney flues. Height limits also do not apply to any dormer, bulkhead, elevator, water tank, or to any similar structure or necessary mechanical appurtenance extending above the roof of any building if such structure does not occupy more than 33? percent of the area of the roof. No dormer may exceed the highest point or peak of the structure to which the dormer is attached even when the structure is exempt from a height limitation.

20-0505 - Bonus Density 
A.  A maximum density of 30 dwelling units per acre shall be allowed for projects that comply with the following 3 standards, provided that: 
1.  Parking area constructed within the building structure ( i.e. underground or "tuck under" parking) shall be provided, with an area equal to at least 70 percent of the principal building footprint; 
2.  Minimum Open Space shall be 40 percent; and 
3.  Building height shall comply with maximum height described in Sec. 20-0501. 
B.  A maximum density of up to 30 dwelling units per acre in MR-3 district may be granted for projects located within 600 feet of the DMU zoning district if, after review under the Conditional Use review procedures of Sec. 20-0909, the Planning Commission determines that one or more of the following conditions have been met: 
1.  The proposed project will allow for the development of underground parking and substantially more open space and landscaping than otherwise would be achieved; 
2.  The proposed project is to be designed, constructed and managed for persons with special needs (e.g. physically disabled or older persons), with van service, on-site meals, care-givers and other services available to residents; or 
3.  The proposal will ensure the preservation of a designated local, state or federally designated historic landmark.

20-0506 - Alternative Residential Development Options 
A.  General 
1.  Purpose 
The alternative development options of this section allow for variety in development standards while maintaining the overall character of a single-dwelling neighborhood. These options have several public benefits: 
a.  They allow for development which is more sensitive to the environment, especially in hilly areas and areas with water features and natural drainageways; 
b.  They allow for the preservation of open and natural areas; 
c.  They promote better site layout and opportunities for private recreational areas; 
d.  They promote opportunities for affordable housing; and 
e.  They promote energy-efficient development. 
2.  General 
The alternative development options listed in this section are allowed by-right unless otherwise expressly stated. The project must comply with all of the applicable development standards of this section. The project must also comply with all other development standards of the base zoning district unless those standards are superceded by the standards in this section. The alternative development options listed in this section are not applicable to SR-0 zoning districts. 
B.  Attached Housing 
1.  Lot Width, Lot Area, Building Coverage and Density 
Attached housing is exempt from the lot width, lot area and building coverage standards of the underlying zoning district, but shall not be exempt from the maximum density standards. 
2.  Setbacks 
No interior side setback is required on the "attached" side of a lot containing an attached house. The front, side, and rear setback standards shall apply around the perimeter of an attached housing development. 
3.  Number of Attached Units 
In the SR-3 district, no single structure may contain more than 8 units. 
C.  Zero Lot Line 
1.  Description 
A zero lot line development is where houses in a development on a common street frontage are shifted to one side of their lot. This provides for greater usable yard space on each lot. These developments require that planning for all of the house locations be done at the same time. Because the exact location of each house is predetermined, greater flexibility in site development standards are possible while assuring that single-dwelling character is maintained. 
2.  Applicability 
Zero lot line developments are allowed for houses in the SR-1 through MR-3 zoning districts. 
3.  Procedure 
Zero lot line developments are allowed by-right. Review for compliance with the standards of this section shall occur during the subdivision platting process. Restrictions that assure the minimum distance between houses and any required easements must be recorded on the plats of the applicable lots. Proof of such recordation must be submitted as part of the building permit application. 
4.  Setbacks 
The side building setback on one side of the house may be reduced to zero. This reduction does not apply to the street side setback or to the interior side setback adjacent to lots that are not part of the zero lot line project. 
5.  Additional Standards 
a.  Distance Between Houses 
The minimum distance between all buildings in the development must be equal to twice the required side setback required by the underlying zoning district. A deed restriction must be recorded on the deed of each applicable lot to ensure continued compliance with this setback. 
b.  Eaves 
The eaves on the side of a house with a reduced setback may project a maximum of 18 inches over the adjacent property line. In this case, an easement for the eave projection must be recorded on the deed for the lot where the projection occurs. 
c.  Maintenance Easement 
An easement between the two property owners to allow for maintenance or repair of the house is required when the eaves or side wall of the house are within 4 feet of the adjacent property line. The easement on the adjacent property must provide at least 5 feet of unobstructed space between the furthermost project of the structure and the edge of the easement. 
d.  Privacy 
If the side wall of the house is on the property line, or within 3 feet of the property line, windows or other openings that allow for visibility into the side yard of the adjacent lot are not allowed. Windows that do not allow visibility into the side yard of the adjacent lot, such as a clerestory window or a translucent window, are allowed. 
D.  Cluster Development 
A cluster development is a residential subdivision in which the lots are allowed to be smaller (in area and width) than otherwise required for the underlying, base zoning district, but in which the overall density cannot exceed the maximum density limit for the underlying zoning district. Under the cluster development option, a subdivision can contain no more lots than would otherwise be allowed for a conventional subdivision in the same zoning district, but the individual lots within the development could be smaller than required in a conventional subdivision. Smaller lot sizes within a cluster development are required to be offset by a corresponding increase in open space. 
1.  Conflict with Other Regulations 
If there is a conflict between the cluster development standards of this chapter and any other requirement of this Land Development Code, the standards of this chapter control. Otherwise, a cluster development is subject to all other applicable requirements of this Land Development Code. 
2.  Where Allowed 
Cluster developments are allowed in all SR zoning districts. 
3.  Approval Procedure 
Cluster Developments are subject to the Subdivision procedures of Sec. 20-0907. 
4.  Density 
A cluster development is subject to the maximum density requirements of the base zoning district. 
5.  Lot Size 
There is no set minimum lot size (area or width) requirement within a cluster development. Individual lot sizes must be adequate to meet all required density and development standards. Minimum lot sizes may be established by the Planning Commission or Board of City Commissioners during the Subdivision process. 
6.  Setbacks and Building Separations 
The minimum setback standards of the base zoning district apply along the perimeter of a cluster development. All detached structures within a cluster development must be separated by a minimum distance of 10 feet. 
7.  Open Space 
a.  On-Site Open Space 
Cluster developments shall be subject to the minimum on-site open space standards of the base zoning district, if applicable. 
b.  Common Open Space 
(1)  Minimum Requirement 
Common open space is required within a cluster development to ensure that the overall density within the development does not exceed the maximum density allowed by the underlying zoning district. Common open space must be provided in an amount at least equal to the difference between (1) the actual, average lot area per dwelling unit within the cluster development and (2) the required lot area per dwelling unit for conventional development within the underlying base zoning district. 
(2)  Use of Common Open Space 
Common open space must be set aside and designated as an area where no development will occur, other than project-related recreational amenities or passive open space areas. The Planning Commission may require that up to 50 percent of required common open space be useable open space, if deemed necessary by the Planning Commission or Board of City Commissioners to ensure adequate recreational amenities for residents of the development.

20-0507 - Attached Development. 
The alternative development options of this section allow for variety in development standards while maintaining the overall character of a commercial or industrial area. These options have several public benefits including the potential preservation of open land areas and more efficient use of commercial and industrial space. 
a. In a PI (Public and Institutional), LC (Limited Commercial), GC (General Commercial), LI (Limited Industrial), GI (General Industrial), GO (General Office), NC (Neighborhood Commercial) and NO (Neighborhood Office) zoning district, attached structures and buildings shall be exempt from the interior side yard setback requirement of Section 20-0502; provided that owners of all property in the attached development shall have delivered to the zoning administrator written approval of the proposed attached structures or buildings and provided the zoning administrator consents to the proposed attached development. Written approval must be on a form acceptable for recording with the office of the recorder for the county. 
(1)  Lot Width 
In any attached structure, allowed under the foregoing sentence, must comply with minimum building coverage requirements, parking requirements and landscaping requirements as provided in the LDC. 
(2)  Setbacks 
No interior side setback is required on the (attached( side of a lot containing an attached building. The front, side, and rear setback standards shall apply around the perimeter of an attached development.

20-0508 - Watercourse Setbacks - Restrictions and Exceptions. 
A. No building or structure may be erected, constructed, enlarged or altered within the Minimal Disturbance Zone Setback or within the Limited Disturbance Zone Setback unless such building or structure conforms to the regulations in this section. 
1.  a.  MDZS-Red River and Wild Rice Rivers. 
The Minimal Disturbance Zone Setback ("MDZS") for properties near the Red River of the North or the Wild Rice River shall be the greater distance of (a) 350 feet from the center line of the river and (b) the floodway whichever distance creates the greater amount of setback from the center line of the river. 
b.  MDZS-Sheyenne River. 
For parcels that are near the Sheyenne River, the Minimal Disturbance Zone Setback ("MDZS") shall be the greater distance of (a) 175 feet from the center line of the river and (b) the floodway whichever distance creates the greater amount of setback from the center line of the river. 
2.  LDZS. 
The Limited Disturbance Zone Setback ("LDZS") shall begin at the outer edge of the Minimal Disturbance Zone Setback and extend an additional one hundred (100) feet on the same line as for the MDZS. 
For purposes of determining of the disturbance zone setbacks, distances shall be measured horizontally and perpendicular from the tangent of the center line of the applicable water course. For purposes of this ordinance, "floodway" means the channel of a river or other watercourse and the adjacent land areas that must be reserved in order to discharge the base flood without cumulatively increasing the water surface elevation more than a stated amount, as the same has been formally adopted either by the board of city commissioners, by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) on a Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM), or by both the board of city commissioners and FEMA. To the extent the board of city commissioners and FEMA have adopted different floodways, the floodway most recently adopted shall be deemed to be the floodway for purposes of this ordinance. 
B.  Disturbing Land Prohibited. 
No person, firm, corporation or other entity shall engage in any man-made change to improved or unimproved real estate, including but not limited to, buildings or other structures, mining, dredging, filling, grading, paving excavation or drilling operations within the MDZS or the LDZS unless such development conforms to the regulations in this section. Such man-made changes shall include, without limitation, any development as the same is described in Fargo Municipal Code Article 21-06. 
C.  Minimal Disturbance Zone Setback. 
All property within the MDZS calculated in accordance with this section shall conform to the following regulations: 
1.  No permanent structures shall be allowed except the following: 
(a)  Stairways, Lifts and Landings - Stairways and lifts are the preferred alternative to major topographic alterations for achieving access up and down steep slopes to watercourses. Stairways and lifts must meet the following design requirements: 
(i)  Stairways and lifts shall not exceed four (4) feet in width on residential lots and eight (8) feet in width for commercial properties or public open-space recreational properties. Residential lots are permitted one stairway or lift and one facility to provide watercourse access for the physically challenged. The number of accesses for commercial or public open-space shall be determined on a case-by-case basis by the board of city commissioners. 
(ii)  Landings for stairways and lifts on residential lots shall not exceed thirty-six (36) square feet in area. Landings no larger than sixty-four (64) square feet shall be used for commercial properties, public open-space recreational properties. 
(iii)  Canopies or roofs shall not be allowed on stairways, lifts, or landings. 
(iv)  Where reasonably possible, stairways, lifts and landings shall be constructed above the ground on posts or pilings. Stairways, lifts and landing may be placed into the ground, provided they are designed and built in a manner that ensures control of soil erosion. 
(v)  Facilities such as ramps, lifts or mobility paths for the physically challenged to achieve watercourse access shall not exceed four (4) feet in width for residential lots and eight (8) feet in width for commercial properties or public open-space recreational properties. 
(vi)  Stairways, lifts and landings shall not prevent or limit the use of public paths or public or private non-motorized vehicle lanes or any other easements. 
(b)  Roads, bridges, trails, storm drainage, stormwater management facilities and utilities are permitted within the minimal disturbance zone provided that an alternatives analysis has clearly demonstrated that no other feasible alternative exists and that minimal disturbance will take place. These structures shall be located, designed, constructed and maintained to provide maximum erosion protection, to have the least adverse effects on wildlife, aquatic life and their habitats and to maintain hydrologic processes and water quality. Following any disturbance, the impacted area shall be restored. 
(c)  Bike paths, walking trails, or other multi-use paths. 
(d)  A public rest room or a public facility that is open on all sides and functionally related to a designated open space or recreational use. 
2.  No additional fill shall be allowed. 
3.  No grading shall be allowed, except grading for bank restoration in areas experiencing bank slumping. 
4.  No excavating shall be allowed. 
5.  On-site septic systems and drain fields shall not be permitted. 
6.  Irrigation systems shall not be permitted. 
7.  Notwithstanding the foregoing restrictions or prohibitions, permanent flood protection levees or walls may be constructed within the MDZS or LDZS provided the soil is determined, in the opinion of the city engineer, to be sufficiently stable to support the proposed flood protection structure without slumping or shifting. 
D.  Limited Disturbance Zone Setback. 
With respect to all property within the LDZS calculated in accordance with this section, the regulations with respect to the said 100-foot setback of the LDZS shall be the same as the regulations for the MDZS (Subsection C), except as follows: 
1.  In the Limited Disturbance Zone Setback, one accessory building not to exceed One Hundred Twenty (120) square feet shall be allowed. 
E.  Transitional Provisions to Watercourse Setback Restrictions. 
To the extent that land within either the MDZS or LDZS was platted prior to the effective date of this ordinance, the following additional regulations shall apply: 
1.  Exemptions-existing parks and golf courses; lots across street from river. Golf courses that exist as of the effective date of this ordinance and park land of the city or of the Park District of the City of Fargo shall be exempt from the provisions of this ordinance except with respect to permits that would otherwise be required by law other than this ordinance and that are related to buildings or structures within the MDZS or the LDZS. With respect to parcels that have been platted prior to the effective date of this ordinance that are within the MDZS or LDZS, to the extent that a permanent flood protection structure is able to be constructed on the side of the street nearest the river to the elevation established by city policy by motion, resolution or ordinance of the board of city commissioners said parcels shall be exempt from the provisions of this section and building permits may be issued for said parcels. 
2.  Previously Platted Lands (and not built upon). 
Building permits may not be issued for new buildings or structures within either the MDZS or LDZS for parcels that have been platted prior to the effective date of this ordinance and have not been previously built upon unless a waiver is obtained from the board of city commissioners. A parcel shall be considered built upon if a valid building permit has been issued prior to the effective date of this ordinance or if a bona fide application for a building permit has been received by the Building Official prior to the effective date of this ordinance. An applicant shall only be eligible to receive such a waiver if the requested building permit is for a proposed building or structure that will be located no nearer than 100 feet from the nearest floodway. In reviewing an application for a waiver of this prohibition, the board of city commission shall consider the following factors: 
(a)  The extent to which the subject property is already protected from the risk of flooding. 
(b)  The extent to which the soil is sufficiently stable to support the proposed building or structure without slumping or shifting of soil. 
(c)  The extent to which the proposed building or structure may be elevated to such a level as to mitigate against the risk of flooding. 
(d)  The adequacy of area available to install emergency flood protection if the proposed building or structure were in place. 
(e)  If the proposed building or structure is accessory to a principal building or structure, the extent to which the accessory building or structure to either be constructed to an elevation to appropriately minimize risks of flooding or, in the alternative, or be designed and constructed so as to tolerate being flooded. 
3.  Previously Platted Lands (and built upon). With respect to applications in which a permit is requested related to a parcel within either the MDZS or LDZS that has been platted prior to the effective date of this ordinance but has already been built upon, such building permit may be issued for a building or structure as follows: 
(a)  Enlargement or alteration of existing principal buildings or structures shall be allowed so long as the proposed enlargement or alteration does not extend the building or structure closer to the river; and, 
(b)  Interior remodeling of an existing building or structure is allowed. 
(c)  To the extent said parcel contains one or more principal buildings or structures lying, in whole or in part, within the MDZS, the LDZS, or both, and in the event any of such buildings or structures is damaged or destroyed by any means, to the extent of more than 50 percent of its structural value prior to the damage, that building or structure may be restored, repaired or rebuilt in its entirety in accordance with the provisions in the Land Development Code regarding non-conforming structures (See generally LDC 20-1004). 
F. Conflict with Other Regulations. 
1.  Where the standards and management requirements of this setback are in conflict with other laws, regulations, ordinances or policies regarding streams, steep slopes, erodible soils, wetlands, floodplains, timber harvesting, land disturbance activities or other environmental protective measures, the more restrictive requirements shall apply. 
2.  Nothing herein shall be interpreted to abrogate or limit the applicability of any other local, state or federal law, including without limitation the floodplain management regulations of the Federal Emergency Management Agency of the United States of America. 
3.  Nothing herein shall be interpreted to abrogate or limit the applicability of any substantial improvement provisions of the floodplain management regulations as identified in article 21-06 of the Fargo Municipal Code, as the same may be amended from time to time.

20-0602 - Land Unsuitable for Development 
The Planning Commission shall not allow the subdivision of land that is unsuitable for development due to flooding, improper drainage, steep slopes, soil types, adverse earth formations or topography, utility easements or other features that will be harmful to the safety, health, and general welfare of the present or future inhabitants of the subdivision or its surrounding area. If adequate methods to overcome this unsuitability are formulated by the developer and approved by the Planning Commission, the Planning Commission may approve the development on the condition that these measures are carried out. 
20-0603 - Subdivision Names 
Subdivision names may not duplicate or be phonetically similar to the names of other subdivisions or developments except in cases of additions to existing subdivisions. The Planning Commission shall have final authority over subdivision names. 
20-0604 - Street Names and Numbering 
Street names may not duplicate names of any existing street in the City or in adjacent communities except where the street is a continuation of an existing street. Streets must be numbered in accordance with the City of Fargo street and property numbering system approved by the Board of City Commissioners. 
20-0605 - Monuments 
A.  Location 
Developers shall place permanent reference monuments at block corners, control points, and lot corners. 
B.  Material Specifications 
1.  Corner and control point monuments must be iron pins set in concrete. 
2.  Lot corner monuments must be iron pins set in the ground. 
20-0606 - Lots 
A.  Arrangement 
The lot arrangement must be such that there will be no foreseeable difficulties, for reasons of topography or other conditions, in securing building permits to build on all lots in compliance with this Land Development Code and all other applicable ordinances and standards. 
B.  Dimensions 
Lots must comply with the minimum lot size, lot width and other dimensional standards of this Land Development Code. 
C.  Double-Frontage and Reverse Frontage Lots 
Double frontage and reverse frontage lots shall be avoided except where necessary to provide separation of residential development from arterials streets or to overcome specific disadvantages of topography and orientation. 
20-0607 - Blocks 
A.  Width 
Blocks must have sufficient width to provide for two tiers of lots, except where single tier lots are required to separate residential development from through vehicular traffic, to separate the lots from another type of use, to allow for unusual topographic conditions or when adjacent to the outer perimeter of the subdivision 
B.  Length 
Block lengths may not exceed 1,320 feet, and when blocks longer than 800 feet are proposed, pedestrian crossings may be required to be provided near the center of the block. 
20-0608 - Utilities

20-0609 - Sidewalks 
Sidewalks must be installed in accordance with this section and the standards of Article 18-02, unless an Alternative Sidewalk Plan is approved by the City Commission after recommendation of the Planning Commission, at the time of approval of a subdivision approval as provided in 20-0907. All sidewalks shall be located at least 6 feet from the street edge along which such sidewalk is parallel. 
A.  Planning Commission Policy 
The Planning Commission shall make its recommendation on a sidewalk waiver request based on the guidelines of this subsection and the facts surrounding the waiver request. Based on such factors, the Planning Commission may recommend denial of a sidewalk waiver request even though the request may be technically eligible for such a waiver. The Planning Commission has established the following statement of principles as a foundation for reviewing requests for sidewalk waivers: 
(1)  Sidewalks are a shared amenity and asset of the community. As such, the public interest in sidewalks transcend specific individuals, lots, subdivisions, or periods of time. 
(2)  Sidewalks represent an important element of the transportation system, and as such, they provide an element of safety for both the automobile user and the pedestrian, including children on bikes. 
(3)  Sidewalks are an important element in the inventory of recreational assets of the community. 
(4)  To meet their potential as elements of the transportation and recreational components of the community, accessibility and convenience are factors of real importance. 
(5)  Sidewalks, both as a transportation facility and as a recreational asset, must also consider and assume that vulnerable populations should be and will be found in most areas of the City. Availability and functionality are particularly important to children under 14, persons with disabilities and senior citizens. 
(6)  Sidewalks that are not built can create an uneven or unfair burden of cost, maintenance, and use. 
(7)  Sidewalk plans that offer creative solutions but that are substantially equal substitutes to the traditional sidewalk should be encouraged. 
B.  Industrial 
No maximum sidewalk waiver will apply to industrial subdivisions. 
C.  Alternative Sidewalk Plan 
Sidewalk waivers may be granted at the time of approval of a subdivision if a substitute pedestrian way or trail is incorporated that provides substantially equal service to a sidewalk on a block face (even when there are more than 12 dwelling units per block). An example would be a mid-block trail, pedestrian way or bike path. Pedestrian ways or trails that tend to force mid-block pedestrian crossings should be avoided or be given special design consideration. 
Figure 20-0609-5 
Sidewalk Alternative 

D.  Rural Subdivisions and City Consolidations 
If the City annexes a rural subdivision or consolidates with an incorporated community a temporary waiver for the entire subdivision may be granted for up to 10 years, after which the subdivision will be subject to the same regulations that apply in the rest of the City. This guideline may be superceded by the applicable annexation or consolidation agreement. 
E.  Timing of Sidewalk Construction 
Sidewalk installation will not be ordered in until street improvements such as paving, curb and gutter are constructed. 
F.  Missing or Conflicting Guidelines 
When conditions arise that are not covered by the Sidewalk Waiver Guidelines of this section, or where guidelines suggest contradictory solutions, the Planning Commission will make a determination that best reflects the general intent of the guidelines. Such determination will be kept on file and used in similar cases. 
G.  Effect of Existing Sidewalks 
The construction and existence of sidewalks that would have been eligible for consideration for a waiver do not create by their existence the automatic requirement for a sidewalk that would also be eligible for a waiver. The City may evaluate such requests as though all the eligible sidewalks had been waived on the condition that reasonable continuity and consistency of pedestrian service is provided.

20-0610 - River Easements and Watercourse Setbacks 
A. Maintenance easements shall be established on all land within 40 feet of the Mean High Water Line of all rivers and legal drains. Improvements shall be allowed within such maintenance easements, provided that the City shall be granted authority to temporarily occupy such easements when necessary to conduct maintenance work on the adjacent river or drain. 
B. All Final Plats prepared for recording shall: 
1.  Show the extent of any minimal or limited disturbance zone setbacks on the subject property by metes and bounds and be labeled as "Minimal Disturbance Zone Setback" or "Limited Disturbance Zone Setback" 
2.  Provide a note to reference the minimal or limited disturbance zone setbacks stating, "There shall be no clearing, grading, construction or disturbance of soil and/or native vegetation except as permitted by the ordinances of the city of Fargo" 
3.  Provide a note to reference any protective covenants governing all minimal or limited disturbance zone setbacks, "Any minimum or limited disturbance zone setbacks shown hereon are subject to protective covenants which may be recorded in the Office of the Recorder for Cass County and which restrict disturbance and use of these areas." 
C. All minimal or limited disturbance zone setbacks must be protected during development activities. Prior to the initiation of development activities, the minimal and limited disturbance zone setbacks shall be surveyed and iron pins set in the ground on side lot lines and adequate visibility of the minimal or limited disturbance zone setbacks shall be provided by staking and flagging. 
D. Minimal or limited disturbance zone setbacks shall be established and maintained through a declaration of protective or restrictive covenant, which must be submitted for approval by the board of city commissioners. The covenant shall be recorded in the Office of the Recorder for Cass County and shall run with the land and continue in perpetuity and may not be amended or terminated without approval of the city. 
E. All lease agreements pertaining to parcels with MDZS areas, LDZS areas, or both areas, must contain a notation regarding the presence and location of protective covenants for minimal or limited disturbance zone setbacks, and must contain information on the management and maintenance requirements for the minimal or limited disturbance zone setbacks for the tenant. 
F. No subdivision may be approved without a notation and delineation of an area One Hundred Seventy-Five (175) feet from the centerline of any legal drain and the applicant for subdivision approval will be required to dedicate such areas to the public for purposes of such drain.

20-0611 - Streets 
A.  General 
Streets must be graded and improved in accordance with the standards of this section and the design and construction standards of the City Engineer. 
1.  All streets must be properly integrated with the existing and proposed system of thoroughfares and dedicated right-of-ways as established on the Official Map, Comprehensive Plan, or as determined by the Board of City Commissioners. 
2  All thoroughfare capacity must be properly related to special traffic generators such as industries, business districts, schools, churches, shopping centers, population densities, and to the pattern of existing and proposed land uses. 
3.  Local streets must be laid out to conform as much as possible to the topography, to discourage use by through traffic, to permit efficient drainage and utility systems, and to require the minimum number of streets necessary to provide convenient, safe access to property. 
4.  Streets must be extended to the boundary lines of the subdivision, unless prevented by topography or other physical conditions. 
5.  In business and industrial developments, the streets and other access ways must be planned in connection with the grouping of buildings, location of rail facilities, and the provision of alleys, truck loading and maneuvering areas, and walks and parking areas so as to minimize conflict of movement between the various types of traffic, including pedestrians. 
B.  Rural and Urban Standards 
The City Engineer will provide separate street standards for rural and urban subdivisions. 
C.  Frontage on and Access to Streets 
No subdivision may be approved unless the area to be subdivided has frontage on and access to a street shown on the Official Map, or unless such street is: 
1.  An existing state, county, or township highway; or 
2.  A street designed and constructed in accordance with the standards of this Article and shown on a plat approved and recorded in accordance with the procedures of Sec. 20-0907. 
D.  Access to Arterials 
Where a subdivision borders on or contains an existing or proposed arterial, the Board of City Commissioners may require that access to such streets be limited by one of the following means (See also Sec. 20-0702): 
1.  The subdivision of lots so as to back onto the arterial and front onto a parallel street of a lower functional classification. In such cases, direct access to the arterial may be prohibited, and screening must be provided in a strip of land along the real property line of such lots. 
2.  A series of cul-de-sacs, U-shaped streets, or short loops entered from and designed generally at right angles to such a parallel street, with the rear lines of their terminal lots backing onto the arterial. 
3.  A marginal access or service road that is separated from the arterial by a planting or grass strip and having access thereto at suitable points. 
E.  Reserve Strips 
Reserve strips are not permitted adjacent to a proposed street in such a manner as to deny access from adjacent property to such street. 
F.  Construction of Streets and Dead-End Streets 
1.  Streets must be arranged to provide for the continuation of principal streets between adjacent properties. If the adjacent property is undeveloped and the street must be a dead-end street temporarily, the right-of-way shall be extended to the property line. A temporary circular turnabout must be provided on all temporary dead-end streets, with the notation on the subdivision plat that land outside the normal street right-of-way shall revert to abutting property owners whenever the street is continued. The Board of City Commissioners may limit the length of temporary dead-end streets in accordance with the design and construction standards of the City Engineer. 
2.  Where a street does not extend to the boundary of the subdivision and its continuation is not required by the City Engineer for access to adjoining property, its terminus shall not be nearer to such boundary than 50 feet. However, the Board of City Commissioners may require the reservation of an appropriate easement to accommodate drainage facilities, pedestrian traffic, or utilities. A cul-de-sac turnaround shall be provided at the end of a permanent dead-end street in accordance with the City Engineer's construction standards. For greater convenience to traffic and more effective police and fire protection, permanent dead-end streets shall be limited in length in accordance with the design standards of the City Engineer. 
G.  Geometric Standards 
The geometric design standards of this section apply to all streets. 
1.  Right-of-Way and Pavement Widths 
The right-of-way and pavement width standards of Table 20-0611-1 apply to all streets.

A double entry cul-de-sac may exceed the stated maximum, if approved by the City Engineer.  
___________ 
The Planning Commission may approve waivers from the cul-de-sac length standards with it finds (1) that extraordinary hardships or practical difficulties will result from strict compliance with the cul-de-sac length standards and (2) that the purposes of these regulations will be served to a greater extent by an alternative proposal. Waiver requests shall be considered during the Subdivision Plat review process. 
H.  Surfacing. 
Curbs, gutters and streets must be installed as prescribed by the regulations of this Article. The surfacing shall be of such character as is suitable for the expected traffic and in harmony with similar improvements in the surrounding areas. Types of pavement shall be as determined by the City Engineer. Adequate provision shall be made for culverts, drains, and bridges. The cost and benefit allocation to be determined by Special Assessment Commission. 
I.  Curbs 
The curb standards of Table 20-0611-3 apply to all streets.

J.  Railroads and Limited Access Highways 
Subdivisions adjacent to railroad rights-of-way or limited access highways shall be treated as follows: 
1.  Residential Districts 
In UMU, MR-3 and more restrictive districts a buffer strip at least fifteen (15) feet in depth in addition to the normal depth of the lot required in the district must be provided adjacent to the railroad right-of-way or limited access highway. This buffer must be included in the lot area owned and maintained by the owner. 
2.  Nonresidential Districts 
In NO and less restrictive districts, the nearest street extending parallel or approximately parallel to the right-of-way shall be located a sufficient distance therefrom to ensure suitable lot depth. 
3.  Parallel Streets 
Streets parallel to the right-of-way, when intersecting a street that crosses the railroad or limited access highway, shall be located a sufficient distance from the right-of-way to provide for adequate future grade separation from the right-of-way. The minimum distance shall be established by the Traffic Engineer. 
K.  Intersections 
1.  Streets must be laid out so as to intersect as nearly as possible at right angles. A proposed intersection of two new streets at an angle of less than seventy-five (75) degrees is not acceptable. An oblique street should be curved approaching an intersection and should be approximately at right angles for at least 100 feet therefrom. No more than two (2) streets may intersect at any one point unless specifically approved by the City Engineer. 
2.  Proposed new intersections along one side of an existing street must coincide with existing intersections on the opposite side of such street. Street jogs with center-line offsets of less than three hundred (300) feet will not be permitted, except where the intersected street has separated dual drives without median breaks at either intersection. Where streets intersect major streets, their alignment must be continuous. Intersections of major streets must be at least six hundred sixty (660) feet apart. 
3.  The minimum curb radius at the intersection of two (2) local streets shall be at least twenty-five (25) feet and minimum curb radius at an intersection involving a collector street shall be at least thirty-five (35) feet. Alley intersections and abrupt changes in alignment within a block shall have the corners cut off in accordance with standard engineering practice to permit safe vehicular movement. 
4.  Intersections must be designed with a flat grade consistent with good engineering practice. In hilly or rolling areas, at the approach to an intersection, a level area must be provided having not greater than a two percent (2%) grade at a distance of sixty (60) feet, measured from the nearest curb line of the intersecting street. 
5.  Where any street intersection will involve earth banks or existing vegetation inside any lot corner that would create a traffic hazard by limiting visibility, the developer must cut such ground or vegetation (including trees) in connection with the grading of the public right-of-way to the extent deemed necessary by the City Engineer to provide an adequate sight distance. 
6.  The cross-slopes on all streets, including intersections, shall be three percent (3%) or less. 
7.  These standards shall not be construed so as to require a street design inconsistent with good engineering practice as determined by the City Engineer. 
L.  Street Dedications and Reservations 
1.  New Perimeter Streets 
Street systems in new subdivisions must be laid out so as to eliminate or avoid new perimeter half streets. Where an existing half-street is adjacent to a new subdivision, the other half of the street must be dedicated by the subdivider. The Board of City Commissioners may authorize a new perimeter street if the subdivider dedicates the entire required street right-of-way within the subdivision boundaries. 
2.  Widening and Realignment of Existing Streets

ARTICLE 20-07 - GENERAL DEVELOPMENT STANDARDS 

20-0701 - Parking and Loading 
A.  General 
1.  Applicability 
a.  New Development 
The off-street parking and loading standards of this section apply to any new building constructed and to any new use established. 
b.  Expansions and Alterations 
The off-street parking and loading standards of this section apply when an existing structure or use is expanded or enlarged. Additional off-street parking and loading spaces will be required only to serve the enlarged or expanded area, not the entire building or use, provided that in all cases the number of off-street parking and loading spaces provided for the entire use (preexisting + expansion) must equal at least 75 percent of minimum ratio established in Off-Street Parking Schedule "A" of this section. 
c.  Change of Use 
Off-street parking and loading must be provided for any change of use or manner of operation that would, based on the Off-Street Parking Schedule "A" or the Off-street Loading Schedule of this section, result in a requirement for more parking or loading spaces than the existing use. Additional parking or loading spaces will be required only in proportion to the extent of the change, not for the entire building or use. 
2.  DMU Exemption 
All residential and nonresidential development in the DMU district shall be exempt from the off-street parking and loading standards of this section. 
3.  No Reduction Below Minimums 
Existing parking and loading spaces may not be reduced below the minimum requirements established in this section. Any change in use that increases applicable off-street parking or loading requirements will be deemed a violation of the Land Development Code unless parking and loading spaces are provided in accordance with the provisions of this section. 
4.  UMU Exemption for Nonresidential and UMU Reduction for Residential 
While no regulatory intent is implied herein, the responsibility clearly falls upon the applicant to review and understand, using professional consultation as appropriate, the parking needs of the development and to provide for the availability of sufficient parking, either onsite or offsite, which meets the minimum demands of the intended use. However, the minimum parking standards for properties in a UMU zoning district are indicated below. 
a.  All nonresidential uses in a UMU zoning district shall be exempt from the off-street parking and loading standards of this section. 
b.  All residential development within a UMU zoning district, shall be required 1.25 parking stalls per dwelling unit. One stall per dwelling unit shall be reserved full time.

B.  Off-Street Parkin g Schedules 
1.  Off-Street Parking Schedule "A" 
Off-Street Parking Schedule "A" lists the minimum off-street parking requirement for each use category defined in this Land Development Code. These requirements apply unless an Alternative Access Plan is reviewed and approved in accordance with the procedures of this section. For some uses, the schedule of requirements contains a reference to off-street parking schedules "B" or "C." Those schedules can be found following Schedule "A."

2.  Off-Street Parking Schedule "B" Off-street parking spaces for Schedule "B" uses must be provided for all components of the use, as follows: 
Activity Number of Spaces Required Office or administrative area 1 per 300 square feet Indoor sales, service or display area 1 per 500 square feet Outdoor sales, service or display area 1 per 750 square feet Indoor storage, warehousing, equipment service, or manufacturing area 1 per 2,500 square feet  
  
3.  Off-Street Parking Schedule "C" 
Schedule "C" uses have widely varying parking demand characteristics, making it impossible to specify a single off-street parking standard. 
a.  Parking Study 
A developer proposing to develop or expand a Schedule "C" use must submit a parking study that provides justification for the number of off-street parking spaces proposed. A parking study must include estimates of parking demand based on recommendations of the Institute of Traffic Engineers (ITE), or other acceptable estimates as approved by the City Engineer and should include other reliable data collected from uses or combinations of uses that are the same as or comparable with the proposed use. Comparability will be determined by density, scale, bulk, area, type of activity, and location. The study must document the source of data used to develop the recommendations. 
b.  Review by City Engineer 
The City Engineer shall review the parking study and any other traffic engineering and planning data relevant to the establishment of an appropriate off-street parking standard for the proposed use. After reviewing the parking study, the City Engineer shall establish a minimum off-street parking standard for the proposed use. 
c.  Appeals 
Appeals of the City Engineer's decision may be taken to the Board of Adjustment in accordance with the procedures of Sec. 20-0916. 
C.  Rules for Computing Requirements 
The following rules apply when computing off-street parking and loading requirements. 
1.  Multiple Uses 
Lots containing more than one use must provide parking and loading in an amount equal to the total of the requirements for all uses. 
2.  Fractions 
When measurements of the number of required spaces result in a fractional number, any fraction of ( or less will be rounded down to the next lower whole number and any fraction of more than ( will be rounded up to the next higher whole number. 
3.  Area Measurements 
Unless otherwise expressly stated, all square-footage-based parking and loading standards must be computed on the basis of gross floor area. 
4.  Occupancy-Based Standards 
For the purpose of computing parking requirements based on employees, students, residents or occupants, calculations shall be based on the largest number of persons working on any single shift, the maximum enrollment or the maximum fire-rated capacity, whichever is applicable and whichever results in the greater number of spaces. 
5.  Unlisted Uses 
Upon receiving a development application for a use not specifically listed in an off-street parking schedule, the Zoning Administrator shall apply the off-street parking standard specified for the listed use that is deemed most similar to the proposed use or require a parking study in accordance with Off-Street Parking Schedule "C." 
D.  Location of Required Parking 
1.  General 
Except as expressly stated in this section, all required off-street parking spaces must be located on the same lot as the principal use. 
2.  Single-Family Districts 
a.  Within single-family (SR) zoning districts, a maximum of one off-street parking space shall be permitted on a front yard residential driveway. Within single-family (SR) zoning districts, front yard residential driveways shall not exceed 24 feet in width or the width of the driveway approach, whichever is greater, provided that in no event shall any such driveway allow less than 8 feet of non-paved surface to exist alongside one or both sides of such driveway [1] . [] All other off-street parking spaces must be located in a covered garage or in side or rear yards. 
b.  All off-street parking spaces in front or side yard areas shall have an all-weather surface. Rear yard parking spaces may be surfaced with gravel. 
E.  Alternative Access Plans 
An Alternative Access Plan represents a proposal to meet vehicle parking and transportation access needs by means other than providing parking spaces on-site in accordance with the Off-Street Parking Schedule of Sec. 20-0701-B. Applicants who wish to provide fewer off-street parking spaces than required pursuant to Sec. 20-0701-B must secure approval of an Alternative Access Plan, in accordance with the standards and procedures of this section. 
1.  Procedures 
a.  Plan Contents 
Alternative Access Plans must be submitted in a form established by the Zoning Administrator and made available to the public. At a minimum, such plans must detail the type of alternative proposed and the rationale for such a proposal. 
b.  Review and Approval Authority 
(1)  Small Facilities 
The Zoning Administrator is authorized to review and act on Alternative Access Plans if the plan proposes a reduction of no more than 25 percent or 25 parking spaces. The Zoning Administrator shall mail written notice of the request to all property owners within 150 feet of the subject property at least 10 days before the Zoning Administrator takes action on the plan. 
(2)  Large Facilities 
Alternative Access Plans that propose a reduction of more than 25 percent or more than 25 off-street parking spaces require review and action by the Planning Commission, in accordance with the Conditional Use Permit Review procedures of Sec. 20-0909. 
c.  Recordation of Approved Plans 
An attested copy of an approved Alternative Access Plan must be recorded with the County Register of Deeds on forms made available in the Planning Department. An Alternative Access Plan may be amended by following the same procedure required for the original approval. 
d.  Violations 
Violations of an approved Alternative Access Plan constitute a violation of the Land Development Code and will be subject to the enforcement and penalty provisions of Article 20-011. 
2.  Eligible Alternatives 
A number of specific access alternatives are described in this subsection. Decision-makers are, however, authorized to consider and approve any alternative to providing off-street parking spaces on the site of the subject development if the applicant demonstrates to the satisfaction of the decision-making body that the proposed plan will do at least as good of a job protecting surrounding neighborhoods, maintaining traffic circulation patterns and promoting quality urban design than would strict compliance with otherwise applicable off-street parking standards. 
a.  Bicycle Parking 
Decision-makers may authorize a reduction in the number of required off-street parking spaces for developments or uses that provide bicycle parking or that make special provisions to accommodate bicyclists. Examples of accommodations include bicycle lockers, employee shower facilities and dressing areas for employees. 
b.  Valet Parking 
Decision-makers may authorize valet parking as a means of satisfying otherwise applicable off-street parking standards, provided that the following conditions are met: 
(1)  An automobile shall be retrievable from its parking space with the movement of a maximum of two additional vehicles; and 
(2)  The decision-maker determines that the valet parking will not cause interference with the public use of streets or ways or imperil the public safety. 
3.  Transportation Demand Management 
Decision-makers may authorize a reduction in the number of required off-street parking spaces for developments or uses that institute and commit to maintain a transportation management program, in accordance with the standards of this section. 
a.  Required Study 
The applicant must submit a study that clearly indicates the types of transportation management activities and measures proposed. 
b.  Transportation Management Activities 
The following measures serve as a guide to eligible transportation management activities. There is, however, no limitation on the types of transportation management activities for which reductions may be granted from otherwise required off-street parking ratios. 
(1)  Posting and Distribution of Information 
The distribution and posting of information from transit agencies and other sources of alternative transportation may be cause for a reduction in otherwise applicable off-street parking requirements. 
(2)  Transportation Coordinator 
The appointment of a Transportation Coordinator with responsibility for disseminating information on ride-sharing and other transportation options may be cause for a reduction in otherwise applicable off-street parking requirements. In addition to acting as liaisons, Transportation Coordinators shall be available to attend meetings and training sessions with the City or transit providers. 
(3)  Off-Peak Work Hours 
Employers that institute off-peak work schedules, allowing employees to arrive at times other than the peak morning commute period, may be eligible for a reduction in otherwise applicable off-street parking requirements. The peak morning commute period is defined as 7:30-9:00 a.m. 
(4)  Preferential Parking 
The provision of specially marked spaces for each registered car pool and van pool may be cause for a reduction in otherwise applicable off-street parking requirements. 
(5)  Financial Incentives 
The provision of cash or in-kind financial incentives for employees commuting by car pool, van pool and transit may be cause for a reduction in otherwise applicable parking requirements. 
4.  Off-Site Parking 
Off-street parking spaces may be located on a separate lot from the lot on which the principal use is located if approved as part of an Alternative Access Plan and if the off-site parking complies with the all of following standards. 
a.  Ineligible Activities 
Off-site parking may not be used to satisfy the off-street parking standards for residential uses (except for guest parking), restaurants, convenience stores or other convenience-oriented uses. Required parking spaces reserved for persons with disabilities may not be located off-site. 
b.  Location 
No off-site parking space may be located more than 600 feet from the primary entrance of the use served unless shuttle bus service is provided to the remote parking area. Off-site parking spaces may not be separated from the use served by a street right-of-way with a width of more than 80 feet, unless a grade-separated pedestrian walkway is provided, or other traffic control or shuttle bus service is provided to the remote parking area. 
c.  Zoning Classification 
Off-site parking areas serving uses located in nonresidential zoning districts must be located in nonresidential zoning districts. Off-site parking areas serving uses located in residential zoning districts may be located in residential or nonresidential zoning districts. 
d.  Agreement for Off-Site Parking 
In the event that an off-site parking area is not under the same ownership as the principal use served, a written agreement will be required. An attested copy of the agreement between the owners of record must be submitted to the Zoning Administrator for recordation on forms made available in the Planning Department. Recordation of the agreement with the Register of Deeds must take place before issuance of a building permit for any use to be served by the off-site parking area. An off-site parking agreement may be revoked only if all required off-street parking spaces will be provided, in accordance with Sec. 20-0701-B. 
5.  Shared Parking

c.  Shared Parking Study 
Those wishing to use shared parking as a means of satisfying off-street parking requirements must submit a shared parking analysis to the Zoning Administrator that clearly demonstrates the feasibility of shared parking. The study must be provided in a form established by the Zoning Administrator and made available to the public. It must address, at a minimum, the size and type of the proposed development, the composition of tenants, the anticipated rate of parking turnover and the anticipated peak parking and traffic loads for all uses that will be sharing off-street parking spaces. 
d.  Agreement for Shared Parking 
A shared parking plan will be enforced through written agreement among all owners of record. An attested copy of the agreement between the owners of record must be submitted to the Zoning Administrator for recordation on forms made available in the Planning Department. Recordation of the agreement with the Register of Deeds must take place before issuance of a building permit for any use to be served by the off-site parking area. A shared parking agreement may be revoked only if all required off-street parking spaces will be provided, in accordance with Sec. 20-0701-B. 
F.  Parking for Persons with Disabilities 
Off-street parking for persons with disabilities must be provided in accordance with the International Building Code. 
G.  Parking and Loading Area Design 
Off-street parking and loading areas must be designed and constructed to accepted construction standards in the industry. Unless otherwise expressly stated in this Land Development Code, including paragraph D.2. of this section pertaining to gravel surfaces in rear yards within single-family (SR) zoning districts, or approved by the City, all off-street parking spaces shall have an all-weather surface. In LI or GI zoning districts only, rear yard vehicular circulation area, not including parking spaces, may be crushed concrete or similar material as approved by the Zoning Administrator. 
H.  Use of Required Parking Spaces 
Required off-street parking areas are to be used solely for the parking of licensed, motor vehicles in operating condition.

    The requirements of this section apply to all applications under this Land Development Code. 
A.  Authority to File Applications 
An application for development review or approval under this Land Development Code must be filed by the person having legal authority to take action in accordance with the approval sought. Unless otherwise expressly stated, that person is presumed to be the record owner, purchaser under a sale from the record owner, or the duly authorized agent of the record owner in the absence of satisfactory proof to the contrary. City officials are authorized to require proof of legal authority to take the action sought. The Board of City Commissioners, Planning Commission, Board of Adjustment and City department heads may initiate any action under this Land Development Code with or without an application from the property owner. 
B.  Form of Application 
Applications required under this Article must be submitted on forms and in such numbers as required by the official responsible for accepting the application. 
C.  Filing Fees 
Applications must be accompanied by the non-refundable fee established by Board of City Commissioners. Fees shall not be required with applications initiated by the Board of City Commissioners, Planning Commission, Board of Adjustment or City department heads. 
D.  Complete Applications 
Applications that do not include required information or that are not accompanied by required fees will be returned to the applicant as incomplete, and no further processing of the application will occur until the deficiencies are corrected. Applications will be reviewed for completeness within five (5) days of filing. If the official determines that the application is complete, the application will be processed. If the official determines that the application is incomplete, the application will be returned to the applicant along with an explanation of the application's deficiencies. 
E.  Establishment of Processing Cycles 
Officials responsible for accepting applications, after consulting with review and decision-making bodies, may promulgate processing cycles for applications. Processing cycles may establish: 
1.  Deadlines for receipt of complete applications; 
2.  Dates of regular meetings; 
3.  The scheduling of staff reviews and staff reports on complete applications; 
4.  All required steps in the application process (including public hearings, and reviews by other agencies); and 
5.  Required time-frames for action by review and decision-making bodies. 
F.  Notices 
All notices required under this Land Development Code must:

Unless otherwise expressly stated, when the provisions of this Land Development Code require that written notice be provided, the official responsible for accepting the application shall provide written notice by first class mail to all owners of the subject property and all property owners within three hundred (300) feet of the subject property. The notice shall be deposited in the U.S. mail at least fifteen (15) days before the first scheduled public hearing. Ownership information shall be obtained from the Cass County Assessor's Office.

3.  Constructive Notice 
Minor technical deviations from specified notice requirements shall not be deemed to impair notice where there is actual notice. When required written notices have been properly addressed and deposited in the mail, failure of a party to receive such notice shall not invalidate any subsequent action. In all cases, however, the requirements for the timing of the notice and for specifying the time, date and place of a hearing and the general location of the subject property shall be strictly construed. If questions arise at the hearing regarding the adequacy of notice, the body hearing the matter shall make a finding regarding whether there was compliance with the notice requirements of this article. 
G.  Neighborhood Associations 
Established neighborhood associations may request that written notice be mailed to a designated representative and city planning staff shall send to said designated representative a copy of any legally required written notice; however, failure on the part of said planning staff or the city to send such notice shall not invalidate any proceedings nor shall it constitute grounds for delay of any proceedings, said notification to the representative of the neighborhood association being a courtesy and not a legal requirement. 
H.  Action by Review and Decision-Making Bodies 

Review and decision-making bodies may take any action on an application that is consistent with the notice given, including, but not limited to, approving the application, approving the application with conditions or denying the application. Review bodies may recommend and decision-making bodies may impose conditions on the application or allow amendments to the application if the effect of the conditions or amendments is to allow a less intensive use or zoning district than indicated in the application, to reduce the impact of the development or to reduce the amount of land area included in the application.

1.  Review Bodies 
When a review body fails to take action on an application, the application will be forwarded to the decision-making body with no recommendation.

20-0908. - Planned Unit Developments 
A.  Description and Overview 
1.  General Description 
A "planned unit development" (PUD) is a type of overlay zoning district and a type of development plan. PUD zoning districts are inextricably linked to PUD plans in that no rights of development apply to a PUD zoning designation other than those of the approved PUD plan. 
2.  Overview of Procedure 
PUDs shall be processed in three stages: Master Land Use Plan; Rezoning to PUD district and Final Plan. Master Land Use Plans and Rezonings may be processed concurrently, provided that no rezoning to the PUD district may occur until approval of a PUD Master Land Use Plan. 
a.  The PUD Master Land Use Plan application is reviewed with respect to such issues as density, including the number, type, and location of dwelling units and other uses; impacts on surrounding areas; and the adequacy of facilities and services. The result of this review is the establishment of the basic parameters for development of the PUD. PUD Master Land Use Plan approval establishes the maximum development "envelope" with regard to density, lot sizes, overall scale, open space, environmental protection, and other land development and service provision issues. 
b.  After approval of a PUD Master Land Use Plan, a PUD zoning map amendment may be approved, or a PUD zoning map amendment may be processed concurrently with the PUD Master Land Use Plan. 
c.  The PUD Final Plan is the document upon which building permits and other applicable approvals are issued. The PUD Final Plan review stage is the point at which developers bring forward detailed plans for carrying out the type of project conceptually approved during PUD Concept Plan review. The applicant must submit the detailed and technical information necessary to demonstrate that all applicable standards, requirements, and conditions have been met. 
B.  PUD Master Land Use Plan 
A PUD Master Land Use Plan is a generalized land use plan for the entire area proposed to be included within a PUD. The purpose of a PUD Master Land Use Plan is to allow early review of a proposed PUD before substantial technical planning work has been undertaken. 
1.  Preapplication Conference 
Before submitting a PUD Master Land Use Plan, the applicant shall confer with the City Planner and other officials designated by the City Planner. The purpose of this preapplication conference is to discuss the proposal and the applicable development review and approval procedures. 
2.  Application 
A complete application for PUD Master Land Use Plan approval shall be submitted to the City Planner in a form established by the City Planner along with a nonrefundable fee that has been established by the Board of City Commissioners. No application shall be processed until the application is complete and the required fee has been paid. 

3.  Review and Report-City Planner 
The City Planner shall prepare a staff report that reviews the PUD Master Land Use Plan application in light of the PUD zoning standards of Sec. 20-0302 and all other applicable development standards and planning policies. The City Planner shall provide a copy of the report to the Planning Commission and the applicant. 
4.  Review and Recommendation-Planning Commission 
The Planning Commission shall hold a public hearing on the PUD Master Land Use. At the close of the public hearing, the Planning Commission shall recommend approval or denial of the PUD Master Land Use Plan application and transmit a written summary of its action and proceedings to the Board of City Commissioners. 
5.  Review and Action-Board of City Commissioners 
After the close of the Planning Commission public hearing, the Board of City Commissioners shall hold a public hearing on the PUD Master Land Use Plan application. After the close of the hearing, the Board of City Commissioners shall act to approve, approve with conditions or deny the proposed PUD Master Land Use Plan. If the Board of City Commissioners acts to approve the PUD Master Land Use Plan, it shall establish required time-frames for development of the entire PUD and its individual phases, if any.

a.  Written Notice 
The City Planner shall provide written notice of the Planning Commission public hearing in accordance with Sec. 20-0901-F. 
b.  Newspaper Notice 
Notice of the Planning Commission and Board of City Commissioners' public hearing on PUD Master Land Use Plans shall be published in accordance with Sec. 20-0901-F. 
7.  PUD Master Land Use Plan Review Criteria 
Applications for PUD Master Land Use Plan approval shall be approved if the following criteria are met: 
a.  The plan represents an improvement over what could have been accomplished through strict application of otherwise applicable base zoning district standards, based on the purpose and intent of this Land Development Code; 
b.  The PUD Master Land Use Plan complies with the PUD standards of Sec. 20-0302; 
c.  The City and other agencies will be able to provide necessary public services, facilities, and programs to serve the development proposed, at the time the property is developed; 
d.  The development is consistent with and implements the planning goals and objectives contained in the Area Plan, the Comprehensive Plan and other adopted policy documents; and 
e.  The PUD Master Land Use Plan is consistent with sound planning practice and the development will promote the general welfare of the community. 
8.  Effect of PUD Master Land Use Plan Approval 
Approval of a PUD Master Land Use Plan shall constitute acceptance of the overall general planning concepts for the proposed PUD development and is a prerequisite for the filing of a PUD Final Plan and approval of a PUD zoning classification. 
9.  Lapse of PUD Master Land Use Plan Approval 
An approved PUD Master Land Use Plan shall lapse and be of no further force and effect if a PUD Final Plan for the PUD (or a phase of the PUD) has not been approved within 2 years of the date of approval of the PUD Master Land Use Plan. In the event of such lapse, the PUD zoning classification shall be of no effect, and the property shall be developed solely in accordance with the underlying zoning classification. In the event of lapse of approval pursuant to this section, the Planning Commission shall initiate action to remove the land from the PUD overlay zoning district and may initiate action to rezone the property to its former base zoning district classification. 
C.  PUD Zoning Map Amendment

ARTICLE 20-10 - NONCONFORMITIES 

20-1001. - General 
A.  Overview 
The regulations of this article establish regulations that govern uses, structures, lots and other current circumstances that came into being lawfully but that do not conform to one or more requirements of this Land Development Code. The regulations address the following types of nonconformities: 
1.  Nonconforming Uses 
Nonconforming uses are uses that were established in accordance with zoning regulations in effect at the time of their establishment, but which, because of amendments to the zoning regulations, no longer comply with the use regulations of the underlying zoning district. A use that was legally established without a Conditional Use Permit shall be deemed to have a Conditional Use Permit and shall not be deemed nonconforming solely because a Conditional Use Permit is now required for the use. 
2.  Nonconforming Structures 
Nonconforming structures are buildings or structures that were established in accordance with all zoning regulations in effect at the time of their establishment, but which, because of amendments to the zoning regulations, no longer comply with the dimensional standards of the underlying zoning district. 
3.  Nonconforming Lots 
Nonconforming lots are lots that were legally created in accordance with zoning district minimum lot size and dimensional standards in effect at the time of their creation, but which, because of amendments to the zoning regulations, no longer comply with the minimum lot size or other dimensional standards of the zoning district. 
B.  Policy 
It is the general policy of the City to allow uses, structures or lots that came into existence legally and in conformance with then-applicable requirements but that do not conform to all of the applicable requirements of this Land Development Code to continue to exist and be put to productive use, but to bring as many aspects of such use into conformance with current Land Development Code as is reasonably practicable, all subject to the limitations of this Article. The limitations of this Article are intended to recognize the interests of the property owner in continuing to use the property but to control the expansion of the nonconformity and to control re-establishment of abandoned uses and limit re-establishment of buildings and structures that have been substantially destroyed. 
C.  Authority to Continue 
Nonconformities shall be allowed to continue in accordance with the regulations of this Article. 
D.  Determination of Nonconformity Status 
The burden of establishing that a nonconformity lawfully exists is the owner's burden, not the City's. 
E.  Repairs and Maintenance 
Repairs and normal maintenance required to keep nonconforming uses, structures and lots in a safe condition are permitted, provided that no alterations may be made except those allowed by this Article or required by law or ordinance. 
F.  Change of Tenancy or Ownership 
Changes of tenancy, ownership or management of an existing nonconformity are permitted, provided that no changes in the nature or character, extent or intensity of such nonconformity may occur except those allowed by this Article. 
Source: 4558 (2006). 
20-1002. - Nonconforming Uses 
    Nonconforming uses shall be subject to the following standards. 
A.  Enlargement 
No nonconforming use may be enlarged, expanded or extended to occupy a greater area of land or floor area than was occupied on February 17, 1998, and no additional accessory use, building or structure may be established on the site of a nonconforming use. This provision notwithstanding, uses may be extended throughout any part of a building or other structure that was lawfully and manifestly designed or arranged for such use on February 17, 1998. 
B.  Relocation 
No nonconforming use may be moved in whole or in part to any other portion of such parcel nor to another lot unless the use will be in conformance with the use regulations of the district into which it is moved. 
C.  Discontinuance and Abandonment 
If a nonconforming use ceases for any reason for a period of more than twelve (12) consecutive months (except where Government action causes such cessation), the subsequent use of such parcel or lot must conform to the regulations and provisions set by this Land Development Code for the district in which such parcel or lot is located. 
D.  Damage or Destruction 
If a structure devoted in whole or in part to a nonconforming use is damaged or destroyed by any means, to the extent of more than fifty percent (50%) of its structural value prior to the damage, that structure may not be restored unless the structure and the use thereof thereafter complies with all regulations of the zoning district in which it is located. The determination of reduced structural valuation shall be made by the City. If the damage or destruction represents fifty percent (50%) or less of the structure's value prior to the damage, repair and restoration is allowed, provided that a building permit must be obtained within six (6) months of the damage and restoration must begin within one year of the date of damage. 
1.  Existing, off-premises advertising signs located along interstate highways that become legal, nonconforming signs with the adoption of this Land Development Code may be replaced or repaired even though damaged beyond fifty percent (50%) of their value, and such signs may also be relocated, even if not damaged or destroyed, so long as they remain on the same property; provided, that any such replacement sign shall be limited to a sign of no greater size than the original. 
2.  Existing off-premises advertising signs located within the DMU zoning district, but outside of the downtown historic district, that become legal, nonconforming signs with the adoption of this Land Development Code may be replaced or repaired even though damaged beyond fifty percent (50%) of their value, and such signs may also be relocated, even if not damaged or destroyed, so long as they remain on the same property, provided that any such replacement sign shall be limited to a sign of no greater size than the original. 
3.  Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this section, if a structure devoted in whole or in part to a nonconforming use that is residential in nature is damaged or destroyed by any means, to the extent of more than fifty percent (50%) of its structural value prior to the damage, that structure may be restored, repaired or rebuilt in its entirety if all of the following conditions are met: 
a.  The building or structure will not occupy any portion of the lot that was not occupied by the destroyed structure 
b.  The building or structure will not have a greater floor area than the destroyed structure, 
c.  The building or structure will not exceed the height or number of stories contained in the destroyed structure 
d.  The number of off-street parking spaces located on the property will not be reduced from the number available before the damage; and, 
e.  The building permit for the repair or restoration must be obtained within six (6) months of the damage and restoration must begin within one (1) year of the date of the damage. 
E.  Change in Use 
A nonconforming use may be changed to a new use, provided that the new use must be of the same general character or of a less intensive character (and thus more closely conforming) than the existing, nonconforming use. The determination of whether a proposed use is a conforming use or is less intensive shall be made by the Zoning Administrator. A nonconforming use, if changed to a conforming use or less intensive nonconforming use, may not thereafter be changed back to a less conforming use. 
F.  Residential Uses in Nonresidential Districts 
The other provisions of this section notwithstanding, any structure that is devoted to a nonconforming residential use and located in an NO or more intensive zoning district may be remodeled, extended, expanded, and enlarged, provided that after the remodeling, extension, expansion or enlargement, the structure may not be used to accommodate a greater number of dwelling units than the structure accommodated prior to the work. 
G.  Accessory Uses 
No use that is accessory to a principal nonconforming use may continue after the principal use ceases or terminates.

20-1003. - Nonconforming Lots 
A lot shown on an approved and recorded subdivision plat on February 17, 1998, or a parcel shown on the assessor's records as a separate parcel on February 17, 1998, may be occupied and used although it may not conform in every respect with the lot size and width standards of this Land Development Code, subject to the provisions of this section. 
A.  Vacant Lot 
If the lot or parcel was vacant on February 17, 1998, then the owner may use the property for any uses allowed in the underlying zoning district, provided that the use must comply with applicable dimensional requirements to the maximum extent practicable. If the applicable zoning district permits a variety of uses or a variety of intensities of uses and one or more uses or intensities would comply with applicable dimensional requirements while others would not, then only the uses or intensities that would comply with the applicable dimensional standards shall be permitted. 
B.  Lot with Building or Structure 
If the lot or parcel contains a building or structure on February 17, 1998, then the owner may continue the use of that building or structure and may expand the structure provided that the expansion is in compliance with all applicable Land Development Code standards. The determination of whether a proposed expansion is in compliance with all applicable Land Development Code standards shall be made by the Zoning Administrator. If the structure is removed or destroyed, any structure that is reconstructed must comply with all applicable land use and dimensional requirements. 
C.  Lot Merger 
If the lot or parcel is smaller than would otherwise be required by this Land Development Code and such lot or parcel is at any time on or after February 17, 1998, under common control with an adjacent lot or parcel, then the two lots shall be considered merged for purposes of this Land Development Code and shall in the future be considered together for purposes of determining compliance with the Land Development Code. If the merged lots or parcels contain sufficient area for the actual or proposed use, then they shall be deemed fully conforming. If the merged lots or parcels together do not contain sufficient area for the actual or proposed use, they shall nonetheless be considered together for purposes of reducing the degree of nonconformity.

20-1004. - Nonconforming Structures 
Nonconforming structures shall be subject to the following standards. 
A.  Enlargement and Expansion 
Any expansion of a nonconforming structure shall be prohibited unless such expansion is in compliance with all applicable Land Development Code standards. The determination of whether a proposed expansion is in compliance with all applicable Land Development Code standards shall be made by the Zoning Administrator. 
B.  Damage or Destruction 
In the event that any nonconforming structure is damaged or destroyed, by any means, to the extent of more than fifty percent (50%) of its structural value prior to such destruction, such structure may not be restored except in conformance with the regulations of the zoning district in which it is located. When a structure is damaged to the extent of fifty percent (50%) or less of its pre-destruction value, repairs or restoration may be made, provided that a building permit is obtained within six (6) months and restoration begins within one year after the date of destruction. The determination of reduced structural valuation shall be made by the Zoning Administrator. 
1.  Notwithstanding the foregoing paragraph, any existing structure that is devoted to a legal nonconforming residential use may be repaired or rebuilt even though damaged beyond 50 percent of its value, provided that the structure may be repaired or rebuilt in its entirety so long as the new structure will not: occupy any portion of the lot that a was not occupied by the destroyed structure, have a greater floor area than the destroyed structure, exceed the height or number of stories contained in the destroyed structure, or diminish the number of off-street parking spaces located on the property from the number existing before the damage; and so long as a building permit is obtained within six (6) months of the date the damage occurs and so long as restoration begins within one year of the date the damage occurs. 
C.  Relocation 
Nonconforming structures may not be moved unless the movement or relocation will bring the structure into compliance with all applicable zoning district regulations. 
Source: 4039 (2000), 4658 (2008), 4697 (2009). 
20-1005. - Nonconformities Created by Public Action 
    When a conveyance of land to a federal, state, or local government for a public purpose results in the creation of nonconformity to Article 20-04, Article 20-05, or Article 20-07 of the Land Development Code, such nonconformity shall not be deemed to be a violation of the Land Development Code. Such nonconformity shall be deemed to be in compliance with the Land Development Code until such time that subsequent development activity will trigger Land Development Code provisions as applicable at the time of such activity.

20-1203 - Use Categories 
A.  Basis for Classifications 
Use categories classify land uses and activities into use categories based on common functional, product, or physical characteristics. Characteristics include the type and amount of activity, the type of customers or residents, how goods or services are sold or delivered and site conditions. The use categories provide a systematic basis for assigning present and future land uses into appropriate zoning districts. 
1.  Principal Uses 
Principal uses are assigned to the category that most closely describes the nature of the principal use. The "Characteristics" subsection of each use category describes the common characteristics of each principal use. 
a.  Developments with Multiple Principal Uses 
When all principal uses of a development fall within one use category, the entire development is assigned to that use category. A development that contains a coffee shop, bookstore and bakery, for example, would be classified in the Retail Sales and Service category because all of the development's principal uses are in that category. When the principal uses of a development fall within different use categories, each principal use is classified in the applicable category and each use is subject to all applicable regulations for that category. 
b.  Accessory Uses 
Accessory uses are allowed by-right in conjunction with a principal use unless otherwise stated in the regulations. Also, unless otherwise stated, accessory uses are subject to the same regulations as the principal use. Common accessory uses are listed as examples in the use category descriptions. 
c.  Use of Examples 
The "Examples" subsection of each use category lists common examples of uses included in the respective use category. The names of these sample uses are generic. They are based on common meanings and not on what a specific use may call itself. For example, a use that calls itself "Wholesale Warehouse" but that sells mostly to consumers, is included in the Retail Sales and Service category rather than the Wholesale Sales category. This is because the actual activity on the site matches the description of the Retail Sales and Service category. 
B.  Similar Use Interpretation Criteria 
The following considerations shall be used in making similar use interpretations (See also Sec. 20-0401-F): 
1.  The actual or projected characteristics of the activity in relationship to the stated characteristics of each use category; 
2.  The relative amount of site area or floor space and equipment devoted to the activity; 
3.  Relative amounts of sales from each activity; 
4.  The customer type for each activity (retail or wholesale); 
5.  The relative number of employees in each activity; 
6.  Hours of operation; 
7.  Building and site arrangement; 
8.  Vehicles used with the activity; 
9.  The relative number of vehicle trips generated by the use; and 
10.  How the use advertises itself. 
C.  Residential Use Categories 
1.  Group Living 
a.  Characteristics 
Group Living is characterized by the residential occupancy of a structure by a group of people who do not meet the definition of Household Living. The size of the group may be larger than the average size of a household. Tenancy is arranged on a monthly or longer basis. Uses where tenancy may be arranged for a shorter period are not considered residential. They are considered to be a form of transient lodging (see the Retail Sales and Service and Community Service categories). Generally, Group Living structures have a common eating area for residents. The residents may receive care, training, or treatment, as long as the care givers also reside at the site. 
b.  Accessory Uses 
Accessory uses commonly associated with Group Living are recreational facilities and parking of vehicles for occupants and staff. 
c.  Examples 
Examples of Group Living include dormitories; fraternities and sororities; monasteries and convents; nursing and convalescent homes; some group homes for the physically disabled, mentally retarded, or emotionally disturbed; some residential programs for drug and alcohol treatment; and alternative or post incarceration facilities. 
d.  Exceptions 
(1)  Lodging where tenancy may be arranged for periods of less than 30 days is to be considered a hotel or motel use and classified in the Retail Sales and Service category. 
(2)  Lodging where the residents meet the definition of Household and where tenancy is arranged on a month-to-month basis, or for a longer period is classified as Household Living. 
(3)  Facilities for people who are under judicial detainment and under the supervision of sworn officers are included in the Detention Facilities category. 
2.  Household Living 
a.  Characteristics 
Household Living is characterized by the residential occupancy of a dwelling unit by a household. Tenancy is arranged on a month-to-month or longer basis. Uses where tenancy may be arranged for a shorter period are not considered residential. They are considered to be a form of transient lodging (see the Retail Sales and Service and Community Service categories). 
b.  Accessory Uses 
Accessory uses commonly associated with Household Living are recreational activities, raising of pets, hobbies and parking of the occupants' vehicles. Home occupations are accessory uses that are subject to additional regulations (See Sec. 20-0403). The keeping of chickens authorized by a city permit under Article 12-02 shall be considered an accessory use to household living. In SR-0 districts, the keeping of one or more horses shall be an acceptable use provided it is accessory to household living and provided that the following criteria are met: 
(1)  There shall be a minimum of two (2) acres for one horse, and an additional acre for every additional horse kept on the property; 
(2)  The number of horses permitted shall be based on the size of the portion of the lot to be used as an animal enclosure; 
(3)  In subdivisions created prior to January 1, 2000, no structure intended for housing said animals shall be closer than 100 feet from any lot line; otherwise, no structure intended for housing said animals shall be closer than 200 feet from any lot line; 
(4)  All manure and other animal wastes shall be removed and disposed of properly on a regular basis; and 
(5)  The residential use area shall be separated from the area to be used as an animal enclosure by a fence, and the entire animal enclosure area shall be fenced to prevent escape and subsequent damage to adjacent property. 
Furthermore, in SR-0 districts, the keeping of one or more animals other than horses shall be a Conditional Use, subject to the procedures of Sec. 20-0909.

ARTICLE 20-13 - FARGO SIGN CODE 

20-1301 - General Provisions 
A.  Authority 
This article shall be part of the Land Development Code (Chapter 20 of the Fargo Municipal Code) in all respects including the interpretation, enforcement and remedies for violation hereof. This article may be referred to as the "sign code". This article is also enacted as provided in article 25-03 of the Fargo Municipal Code and references therein to the "Fargo Sign Code" shall be to this article, as the same may be amended from time to time. 
B.  Findings 
The board of city commissioners hereby finds as follows: 
1.  Exterior signs have a substantial impact on the character and quality of the environment. 
2.  Signs provide an important medium through which individuals may convey a variety of messages. 
3.  Signs can create safety hazards that threaten the public health, safety or welfare. Such a safety threat is particularly great for signs that are structurally inadequate, or that may confuse or distract drivers or pedestrians, or that may interfere with official directional or warning signs. 
4.  Signs can also threaten the public welfare by creating aesthetic concerns and detriments to property values. Such aesthetic concerns and detriments to property values are particularly great when an accumulation or proliferation of signs results in visual clutter, or when one or more signs spoil vistas or views, or when one or more signs add or increase commercialism in noncommercial areas. 
5.  The ability to erect signs serving certain functions, such as an address sign or a sign announcing that the property on which it sits is for sale or for lease is an integral part of nearly every property owner's ability to realize the fundamental attributes of property ownership. The same cannot be said for signs serving other functions, such as billboards erected so as to be visible from public rights-of-way. Such signs are primarily designed to take advantage of an audience drawn to that location by the public's substantial investment in rights-of-way and other public property. 
6.  Signs serving certain other functions, such as small signs that serve a purely directional function, are necessary to enable visitors or residents to efficiently reach their intended destinations. Experience teaches that citizens often plan as if such signs will be present in those settings, so in the absence of such signs, frustration and disorientation will result, and time and fuel will be wasted. Such signs also prevent traffic hazards by easing the task of the motorist looking for a property open house or other events. 
7.  No signs that exceed the size or spacing limitations of this ordinance constitute a customary use of signage in the city. 
8.  The city has prohibited obscene or indecent signs to protect the health, safety, general welfare and morals of the residents of the city, to preserve the quality of family life, to preserve the characteristics of its neighborhoods and to prevent adverse and deleterious effects contributing to the flight and downgrading of neighborhoods. The city is mindful of the negative effects of obscene and indecent material upon minors and the criminal activity and disruption of the public peace associated with such establishments. 
9.  With respect to lost animal signs, notices in newspapers or other means of communicating this information are inadequate. Notice of the animal's loss near the site of the loss is necessary to increase the likelihood and timeliness of the animal's return to its owner, and promotes the government's interest in avoiding euthanasia and the other costs attendant upon stray animals. 
10.  The city recognizes businesses are committed to responding to community needs and are willing to use their advertising dollars to alert civic minded individuals of community issues of common importance. Ancillary off-premise advertising signs and community wide event signs provide businesses the opportunity to support schools, promote service clubs, raise money for charities, sponsor a community event or other activities that otherwise may be considered off-premise advertising. 
11.  In narrowly drawing and tailoring provisions for regulating signage, the city finds and determines that the exercise of its police power for such regulation should not extend to objects that are not typically associated with or considered signage, such as artwork, decorations, or cemetery markers. However, to prevent the purposes of these regulations from being circumvented, such regulations should apply where objects such as vehicles are used for the primary purpose of signage or as a functional equivalent of signage. 
12.  Non-conforming signs may adversely affect the public health, safety, and welfare. Such signs may adversely affect the aesthetic characteristics of the city and may adversely affect public safety due to the visual impact of said signs on motorists and the structural characteristics of said signs. In addition, overprotection of prior nonconforming uses and structures can unjustifiably delay the point at which nonconforming uses and structures are gradually eliminated due to obsolescence and similar causes, and can unfairly provide existing businesses with an unfair competitive advantage over new competitors because those new competitors are uniformly required to comply with existing standards. 
13.  The city's land-use regulations have included the regulation of signs in an effort to foster adequate information and means of expression and to promote the economic viability of the community, while protecting the city and its citizens from a proliferation of signs of a type, size, number, location and character that would adversely impact upon the aesthetics of the community or threaten health, safety or the welfare of the community. The appropriate regulation of the physical characteristics of signs in the city and other communities has had a positive impact on the safety and the appearance of the community. 
14.  Prior to the adoption of this ordinance, the city has from time to time utilized conditional overlays as a tool to limit the overall area or height of signage, or both the area and height of signage, on particular parcels deemed to be design sensitive. The intent of this ordinance is, in part, to serve as the definitive guidance for signage issues and thereby not rely upon conditional overlays as a matter of course. 
C.  Interpretation 
The following shall be used as methods of interpreting this ordinance:

20-1304 - Sign Dimensional Calculation Standards 
A.  Sign Face Area 
1.  For a sign which is framed, outlined, painted or otherwise prepared and intended to provide a background for a sign display, the sign face area and dimensions shall include the entire portion within such background or frame. 
2.  For a sign comprised of individual letters, figures or elements on a wall or similar surface of the building or structure, the area and dimensions of the sign face shall encompass a regular geometric shape (rectangle, circle, trapezoid, triangle, etc. ), or a combination of regular geometric shapes, which form, or approximate, the perimeter of all elements in the display, the frame, and any applied background that is not part of the architecture of the building. When separate elements are organized to form a single sign, but are separated by open space, the sign face area and dimensions shall be calculated by determining the geometric form, or combination of forms, which comprises all of the display areas, including the space between different elements. Minor appendages to a particular regular shape, as determined by the Building Official, shall not be included in the total area of a sign. 
3.  For a freestanding sign, the sign face area shall include the frame, if any, but shall not include: 
a.  A pole or other structural support unless such pole or structural support is internally illuminated or otherwise so designed to constitute a display device, or a part of a display device. 
b.  Architectural features that are either part of the building or part of a freestanding structure, and not an integral part of the sign, and which may consist of landscaping, building or structural forms complementing the site in general. 
4.  The sign face area for a sign with more than one face shall be computed by adding together the area of all sign faces. On all signs other than wall signs, which shall only be allowed one face, signs with identical sign faces placed in such a manner to ensure that the angle at which the two sign faces are placed does not exceed 60 degrees shall be considered as a single face. If the two faces of such a double-faced sign are of unequal area, the larger sign face shall be considered the sign face area of the sign. 

5.  Other multi-faced signs. For all other multi-faced signs, the area of each sign face shall be added together to calculate total sign face area. 
6.  Three-dimensional signs. Where a sign consists of one or more three-dimensional objects (i. e., balls, cubes, clusters of objects, sculpture or statue-like trademarks), the sign face area shall be measured as their maximum projection upon a vertical plane. Signs with three-dimensional objects that exceed a projection of 12 inches from the sign face may be approved through the iconic sign permit process. 
B.  Aggregate Sign Area 
The aggregate sign area is equal to the sum of all sign face areas located on a parcel subject to the provisions of the sign code. At no time shall the aggregate sign area exceed the limits set forth in the sign code. 
C.  Sign Height and Clearance 
1.  The height of a sign shall be determined by computing the vertical distance from the base of the sign at normal grade to the top of the highest attached component of the sign. Normal grade shall be construed to be the lower of: 
a.  Existing grade before construction, or 
b.  The newly established grade after construction, exclusive of any filling, mounding or excavating solely for the purpose of placing the sign. 
c.  In cases where the normal grade cannot reasonably be determined, sign height shall be computed on the assumption that elevation of the normal grade at the base of the sign is equal to the elevation of the nearest point of the crown of a public street, or the grade of the land at the principal entrance to the principal structure on the parcel, whichever is lower. 
2.  Clearance for freestanding and projecting signs shall be measured as the smallest vertical distance between the finished grade and the lowest point of the sign, including any architectural supports, framework or other embellishments.

On-premise signs shall be allowed in all zoning districts, subject to the following conditions: 
A.  Size Limitations 
The total amount of signage allowed on any parcel shall not exceed the sign allowance standards of this article. 
1.  In the SR, MR-1 and MR-2 and AG zoning districts, the total sign face area of on-premise signage shall not exceed 64 square feet. No single sign shall exceed eight square feet in area. 
2.  In the MR-3 zoning district, the total sign face area of on-premise signage shall not exceed 64 square feet; however, a parcel containing an apartment building or multiple apartment buildings totaling 50 or more dwelling units shall be allowed an additional 64 square feet of sign face area for each 50-dwelling-unit increment provided that no single sign shall exceed 64 square feet in area. 
3.  In the NC and NO zoning districts, no on-premise sign shall exceed one square foot of total aggregate sign face area per 100 square feet of building coverage. All signage other than wall signs shall be limited in height to no greater than four feet above the ground level. 
4.  In the UMU zoning district, the aggregate sign face area allowed per parcel shall not exceed two square feet of signage per linear foot of street frontage, or 15% of the faade of the primary structure, whichever is less. The area of the faade is determined by multiplying (a) the lesser of the height of the front elevation of the principle structure's first floor or twenty feet by (b) the width of the faade. 
5.  In all zoning districts other than the foregoing, the aggregate sign face area allowed per parcel shall not exceed 2. 5 square feet of signage per one linear foot of street frontage or 30 % of the faade of the primary structure, whichever is greater. The area of the faade is determined by multiplying (a) the lesser of the height of the front elevation of the principle structure's first floor or twenty feet by (b) the width of the faade. 
6.  Off-premise signage and billboards are not subject to this section. 
B.  Determining Allowable Sign Face Area 
The total sign face area allowed per parcel is based on the greater of either the primary street frontage length or the primary faade area of the principal building and, as applicable, the secondary street frontage or secondary faade area of the principal building. Street frontage calculations may not be used to determine the total allowable signage per parcel on parcels without street frontage. On such parcels, the building faade area shall be used to determine the total amount of signage allowed per parcel. 
1.  Single-Tenant. The following description shall apply to single-tenant buildings. 
a.  Primary Street Frontage. Primary street frontage is the linear distance along which a lot line adjoins a public street right-of-way. The primary street frontage of a corner lot or multi-corner lot is the street with the highest functional street classification or longest street frontage if functional street classification is the same. If the street is a frontage road, the functional classification of the road which the frontage road affronts shall be used to determine maximum sign face area. 
b.  Secondary Street Frontage. The secondary street frontage is the linear distance along which a lot line adjoins additional public street right-of-way, generally perpendicular to, the primary street frontage. For a lot with more than one street frontage, such as a corner lot, signage calculations for the secondary street frontage may be added to those for the primary street frontage at one-half the signage allotment rate. However, if secondary street signage is used, this signage must be located and oriented toward the secondary frontage. 
c.  Building Faade Area. The building faade area shall be the area of the first floor elevation of the primary structure or building unit, as determined by multiplying the lesser of the height of the front elevation of the first floor or twenty feet. 
1.  Building Unit. A building unit is equivalent to the tenant space. 
2.  Primary and Secondary Frontage. The frontage of any building unit shall include the elevation facing a public street, facing a primary parking area for the building or tenants, or containing the public entrance to the building or building units. 
a.  The primary frontage shall be considered the portion of any frontage containing the primary public entrance to the building or building units. 
b.  The secondary frontage shall include those frontages containing secondary public entrances to the building or building units, and all building walls facing a public street or primary parking area that are not designated as the primary building frontage by subsection "a" above. 
3.  Bonus Secondary Signage Calculations. A principal building with more than one frontage, such as a building located on a corner lot, shall be allowed to add to its signage calculations the secondary frontage at one-half the signage allotment rate of the primary frontage. However, if secondary signage is used, this signage must be located and oriented toward the secondary frontage. 
2.  Multi-Tenant. The following descriptions shall apply to multi-tenant buildings. 
a.  Primary Street Frontage. Primary street frontage is the linear distance along which a lot line adjoins a public street right-of-way. The primary street frontage of a corner lot or multi-corner lot is the street with the highest functional street classification or longest street frontage if functional street classification is the same. If the street is a frontage road, the functional classification of the road which the frontage road affronts shall be used to determine maximum sign face area. 
b.  Secondary Street Frontage. Secondary street frontage is the linear distance along which a lot line adjoins a public street right-of-way, generally perpendicular to, the primary frontage. For a lot with more than one street frontage, such as a corner lot, signage calculations for the secondary street frontage may be added to those for the primary street frontage at one-half the signage allotment rate; however, if secondary street signage is used, this signage must be located and oriented toward the secondary frontage. 

c.  Building Faade Area. The building faade area is the area of the first floor elevation of the primary structure or building unit, as determined by multiplying (a) the lesser of the height of the front elevation of the first floor or 20 feet by (b) the width of the faade. 
1.  Building Unit. A building unit is equivalent to the tenant space. For a principal building with two or more building units, the allowable sign face area for each building unit shall be calculated separately and in no case shall the allowable sign face area for one building unit be transferred to another building unit. 
2.  Primary and Secondary Frontage. The frontage of any building unit shall include the elevation facing a public street, facing a primary parking area for the building or tenants, or containing the public entrance to the building or building units. 
a.  The primary frontage shall be considered the portion of any frontage containing the primary public entrance to the building or building units. 
b.  The secondary frontage shall include those frontages containing secondary public entrances to the building or building units, and all building walls facing a public street or primary parking area that are not designated as the primary building frontage by subsection "a" above. 
3.  Bonus Secondary Signage Calculations. A principal building with more than one frontage, such as a building located on a corner lot, shall be allowed to add to its signage calculations the secondary frontage at one-half the signage allotment rate of the primary frontage. However, if secondary signage is used, this signage must be located and oriented toward the secondary frontage. 

3.  Multiple Story Buildings. Additional signage is permitted in all zoning districts except UMU, SR, MR, and AG according to the following: 
a.  For a building with two floors, the additional sign area shall not exceed 30% of the area of the second floor elevation of the primary facade, as determined by multiplying (a) the lesser of the height of the front elevation of the second floor or twenty feet by (b) the width of the faade. 
b.  For buildings with more than two floors, the additional sign area shall not exceed 30% of the area, beyond the second floor, of any additional building floor elevations of the primary faade, as determined by multiplying (a) the lesser of the height of the front elevation of each floor or twenty feet for each floor by (b) the width of the faade.

5.  Iconic Signs. An iconic sign shall be reviewed and approved in accordance with the conditional use review procedures of Section 20-0909, except that the substantive criteria for approval or denial shall be limited to those set forth in this section. Unless otherwise expressly stated, any conditional use permit for an iconic sign granted pursuant to Section 20-0909 shall run with the land and shall not automatically terminate upon sale or transfer of the property. 
a.  Intent. The iconic sign provision is intended to create a process whereby a proposed sign that does not meet the dimensional or other standards of the sign code, but, through design and artistic expression unrelated to its message, is culturally significant to our community, and is expected to serve a placemaking function either upon completion or with the passage of time. Examples of such signs include the "Hollywood" sign on the hills of Hollywood, California; the cowboy with lariat sign for the Frontier Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas, Nevada or the sign for the Radio City Music Hall in New York, New York. This provision is not intended to be a tool to vary one or more of the standards of this ordinance simply to allow for a larger sign than otherwise could be obtained. 
b.  Approval Criteria. Applications for an iconic sign approval shall be approved if the following criteria are also met. 
1.  The proposed iconic sign represents an improvement over what could have been accomplished through the strict application of this ordinance for reasons unrelated to any message of the sign. 
2.  The proposed iconic sign is consistent with sound planning practice. A sign is consistent with sound planning practice when it is in furtherance with the city's comprehensive policy plan for the location of the sign. 
3.  The proposed iconic sign, through design and artistic expression unrelated to its message, is culturally significant to the community. 
4.  The proposed iconic sign is expected to serve a placemaking function either upon completion or with the passage of time. A sign serves a placemaking function when it attracts people to the immediate area of the sign for purposes of social interaction. 
5.  Approval of the proposed iconic sign will not arbitrarily or unreasonably result in favoritism of the proposed sign over another sign that is similarly situated in all relevant respects but for which a sign permit has been denied by the city in the previous two years.

    (Exhibit "A" referred to in (5), first paragraph) 
    "Agreement, made this _____ day of _______, 1906, between the city of Fargo, North Dakota, hereinafter called the city, and the Northern Pacific Railway Company, hereinafter called the railway company, 
Witnesseth: 
    "The main line of the railway company built under the Act of Congress of July 2nd, 1884, was constructed through what is at present the city of Fargo, in about the year 1871. At that time there was substantially no population, where the city now is, but at the present time the city has grown up on each side of the right-of-way and tracks of the railway company and comprises a population of about thirteen thousand. Various controversies exist and have for a long time existed between the city and the railway company as to the existence across and upon property of the railway company of various streets in the city, a controversy as to the existence across and upon the railway company's property of First Street, Fourth Street, Thirteenth Street, and Front Street, and a controversy as to the width of Broadway between Northern Pacific Avenue and Front Street, and one concerning the extent of Northern Pacific Avenue West of Eighth Street. 
    "The city lately brought suit against the railway company to compel the opening across the right-of-way of the railway company of Thirteenth Street, and the railway company defended the suit, claiming that the street did not exist across its right-of-way and that the public had no right to open a street at that location, and that there was no necessity for opening it, which controversy is still pending. 
    "Fargo is an important division terminal and important point for the gathering up and distribution of traffic for main and branch lines. The railway company has extensive yards in the city which it needs for the accommodation of its business greatly to enlarge. It is essential before the railway company make this expenditure to so locate its yard extension that it will be forever free of grade street crossings, as railroad yards of this character cannot be safely or economically operated across the streets. 
    "The parties have reached an understanding that all their differences before stated shall be compromised and settled by this agreement. 
    "Now, therefore, in consideration of the facts and premises before stated and in consideration of the compromise and settlement between the parties of each and every of the controversies aforesaid, and to enable the railway company to so locate and construct its yard extensions and its operations in the city may be safe and economical, the said city of Fargo, and the Northern Pacific Railway Company hereby agree as follows: 
    "1. The railway company will grant to the city by good and sufficient deed an easement for street purposes in all the tracts of land colored red on the map hereto attached, the railway company reserving the right to maintain and operate the tracks now existing on said lands colored red, also the right to construct additional tracks and operate and maintain the same across said lands at First Street, Fourth Street, Broadway, and Eighth Street. This deed will be made promptly and as soon as the engineers of the respective parties are able to survey the said lands so as to make a correct description thereof. 
    "2. The railway company will not hereafter, while a grade crossing is maintained at Eighth Street, erect any buildings upon its property or allow any to be erected within ten feet of the West line of Eighth Street. 
    "3. The said suit involving the opening of Thirteenth Street across the railway company's right-of-way will be dismissed. The railway company will construct at its own expense a viaduct across its right-of-way at Thirteenth Street, including the approaches thereto, and the city will indemnify the railway company against all claims for damages to property resulting from its construction. Said viaduct shall have roadway twenty (20) feet in width with a sidewalk on one side six (6) feet in width. The sidewalk however shall extend only from about the north line of Northern Pacific Avenue to about the south line of Front Street, terminating at a stairway on either end leading down to the street underneath. The viaduct will be a steel and concrete structure with wooden floor. The grade of the approaches will not exceed seven percent. Detail plans will be submitted to the city engineer for his approval before construction is commenced. When the viaduct has been completed by the railway company as above, it will be turned over to the city and the city will thereafter maintain it at its own expense, as a part of its street system. 
    "4. The railway company will have the right to construct, maintain and operate a track across Northern Pacific Avenue under the west approach to the city's bridge on the street across the Red River; and the city will maintain the approach at its present height so as to permit the operation of said track. The city agrees that upon the execution of said conveyance by the railway company and the construction of said viaduct at Thirteenth Street, it will not at any time thereafter open or maintain, or operate, or seek to open or maintain or operate any street crossing at grade across the right-of-way of the railway company west of the grade crossing at Eighth Street. 
    "In Witness Whereof, this agreement is executed by the city of Fargo under the hands of its mayor and city auditor by authority of an ordinance of the city council and the railway company has executed this agreement under its corporate seal and the hands of its president and assistant secretary by authority of its board of directors."

    This ordinance shall take effect and be in force from and after its passage, approval, and publication and the acceptance thereof by the Northern Pacific Railway Company, which acceptance shall be in writing and be filed in the office of the city auditor of the city of Fargo not later than 30 days from and after the publication of this ordinance. 
    Whereas, the city of Fargo has granted and given the Northern Pacific Railway Company the right to construct, maintain, and operate an additional spur railway track over and across Northern Pacific Avenue in the city of Fargo, running parallel with and not to exceed 25 feet from and on the easterly side of its spur railway track now constructed and operated over and across the said avenue, from point on the northern edge of the right-of-way of the said railway company, opposite Lot "J" in Block 7 of Robert's Addition to Fargo, to appoint on the south line of Lot "F" in said Block 7, about 25 feet east of the said spur track now constructed and in operation; such permissions being granted by ordinance approved September 12, 1907, and published September 13, 1907.

C.  Abandonment or removal of franchise property. 
1.  Abandonment. In the event that the use of any property of grantee within the franchise area or a portion thereof is discontinued for a continuous period of twelve (12) months, grantee will be deemed to have abandoned that franchise property. 
2.  Removal. The city, upon such terms as city may impose, may give grantee permission to abandon, without removing, any system facility or equipment laid, directly constructed, operated, or maintained under the franchise. Unless such permission is granted or unless otherwise provided in this ordinance, the grantee will remove all abandoned above-ground facilities and equipment upon receipt of written notice from city and will restore any affected street, alley, or public property to its former state at the time such facilities and equipment were installed, so as not to impair its usefulness. In removing its plant, structures, and equipment, grantee will refill, at its own expense, any excavation that will be made by it and will leave all rights-of-way in as good condition as that prevailing prior to such removal without materially interfering with any electrical or telephone cable or other utility wires, poles, or attachments. The city will have the right to inspect and approve the condition of the rights-of-way, cables, wires, attachments, and poles prior to and after removal. The liability, indemnity, insurance, and performance bond provisions of this ordinance and a franchise agreement as provided herein will continue in full force and effect during the period of removal and until full compliance by grantee with the terms and conditions of this section.

2.  The city will have the right to waive any grantee obligation of the franchise, except those required by federal or state regulation, if the city determines: 
(a)  That it is in the public interest to do so; and 
(b)  That the enforcement of such provision will impose an undue hardship on the grantee or subscribers. 
  To be effective, such waiver will be evidenced by a statement in writing signed by a duly authorized representative of the city. Waiver of any provision in one instance will not be deemed a waiver of such provision subsequent to such instance nor be deemed a waiver of any other provision of the franchise unless the statement so recites. 
E.  Violators. All persons including officers of any grantee, causing, participating in, or permitting any violation of any provision of this ordinance will be severally or jointly liable therefore. 
F.  Force majeure. Grantee's inability to perform. In the event grantee's performance of any of the terms, conditions, or obligations required by this ordinance or a franchise granted hereunder is prevented by a cause or event not within normal operating conditions or otherwise not within the grantee's control, such inability to perform will be deemed excused and no penalties or sanctions will be imposed as a result thereof. 
  For the purpose of this section, causes or events not within the control of grantee include but are not limited to: acts of God, strikes, sabotage, riots or civil disturbances, restraints imposed by order of a governmental agency or court, failure or loss of utilities, explosions, acts of public enemies, and natural disasters such as floods, earthquakes, landslides, inability to obtain equipment, and fires.

24-0311. - Right-of-way patching and restoration-Compliance with excavation code. 
A.  Timing-The work to be done under the permit and the patching and restoration of the right-of-way as required herein must be completed within the date specified in the permit, increased by as many days as work could not be done because of extraordinary circumstances beyond the control of the permitee or when work was prohibited as unseasonable or unreasonable. 
B.  Patch and restoration-Compliance with excavation code. Permitee shall patch and restore its own work in compliance with the excavation code, article 18-09 of the Fargo Municipal Code. 
C.  Standards-The permittee shall perform patching and restoration according to the standards and with the materials specified by the director and the excavation restoration requirements in Fargo Municipal Code Article 18-09. The director shall have the authority to prescribe the manner and extent of the restoration, and may do so in written procedures of general application or on a case-by-case basis. The director in exercising this authority shall comply with excavation code standards for right-of-way restoration and shall further be guided by the following considerations: 
1.  The number, size, depth and duration of the excavations, disruptions or damage to the right-of-way; 
2.  The traffic volume carried by the right-of-way; the character of the neighborhood surrounding the right-of-way; 
3.  The pre-excavation condition of the right-of-way; the remaining life-expectancy of the right-of-way affected by the excavation; 
4.  Whether the relative cost of the method of restoration to the permittee is in reasonable balance with the prevention of an accelerated depreciation of the right-of-way that would otherwise result from the excavation, disturbance or damage to the right-of-way; and 
5.  The likelihood that the particular method of restoration would be effective in slowing the depreciation of the right-of-way that would otherwise take place. 
D.  Guarantees-The permitee guarantees its work and shall maintain it for 36 months following its completion. During this 36-month period, it shall, upon notification from the director, correct all restoration work to the extent necessary, using the method required by the director. Said work shall be completed within five calendar days of the receipt of the notice from the director, not including days during which work cannot be done because of circumstances constituting force majeure or days when work is prohibited as unseasonal or unreasonable. 
E.  Failure to Restore.-If the permitee fails to restore the right-of-way in the manner and condition required by the director, or fails to satisfactorily and timely complete all restoration required by the director, the director at its option may do such work. In that event, the permitee shall pay to the city within 30 days of billing, the cost of restoring the right-of-way. If permitee fails to pay as required, the city may exercise its rights under the construction performance bond.

ARTICLE 24-04 - WIRELESS TELECOMMUNICATION FACILITIES IN THE PUBLIC RIGHT-OF-WAY-REQUIREMENTS AND PERMITS 

24-0401. - Purpose. 
    To ensure that residents, businesses and public safety operations in the city have reliable access to wireless telecommunications network technology and state of the art mobile broadband communications services, the city desires to accommodate the deployment of wireless communications facilities and services within the public right-of-way. The city also desires to minimize potential negative impacts of wireless facility placement within the public right-of-way. This article applies only to installation in the public right-of-way. All other installations are governed by Fargo Municipal Code Chapter 20, and all other applicable laws and regulations. The impact of wireless facilities can be reduced by maintaining standards and objectives for location, visual impact, structural integrity, compatibility, collocation, and the like, which do not unreasonably discriminate among similar users. 
    Nothing in this article affects the city's right to regulate users of the public right-of-way in a competitively neutral and nondiscriminatory manner. The city intends to exercise its authority with respect to the regulation, placement, construction and modification of wireless facilities in the public right-of-way to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law.

25-1508. - Issuance and transfer of licenses-Restrictions-Hearing required. 
A.  No license, other than a Class "E" license, shall be issued or transferred without approval of the commission. A Class "E" license may be issued by the city auditor, without notice or hearing, provided, however that, application must be made seven (7) days before the planned event unless such requirement is waived for good cause shown. 
B.  When an application for any license other than a Class "E" is filed with the commission pursuant to the provisions of  25-1504 of this article, the city auditor shall cause notice to be published in a newspaper of general circulation within the city of Fargo, that the applicant has applied for a license to sell alcoholic beverages at the place named in the application or for the transfer of an existing license, and that the application will be acted upon by the commission on a certain day and time. A hearing on the application shall be held not less than 10 days nor more than 30 days after the date of publication. The expense of the publication, in addition to the license fee, shall be paid by the applicant to the city auditor prior to publication. 
C.  At the time of the hearing on the application, the commission shall, in its discretion, determine if the issuance or transfer of the license is in the best interests of the public health, safety, morals and general welfare of the community. Among the factors to be considered by the commission in granting or denying a license or a transfer are the following: 
1.  Public health and sanitation and the convenience of police regulation and the recommendations and reports of city officials, such as the chief of police, chief of the fire department, building inspector, health officer, and any other official submitting a recommendation or report at the request of the board of city commissioners. 
2.  The proximity of other businesses licensed to sell alcoholic beverages. 
3.  The proximity of schools, churches, funeral homes, public buildings or buildings used by or for minors. 
4.  Protests of neighboring property owners or occupants.

6.  Interference with neighboring properties.

E.  No license issuance or transfer authorizing off-sale of any kind shall be approved by the commission for the sale of alcoholic beverages on premises, any part of which are closer than 100 feet to any grocery store, drug store or gasoline service station, or any portion thereof; provided, that this restriction shall not apply to a transfer which is an assignment, sale, exchange or other conveyance of a license. In the event the owner of the licensed premises for the sale of alcoholic beverages is also the owner of any such grocery store, drug store or gasoline service station, the board of city commissioners is authorized to determine whether the configuration of the licensed premises and such grocery, drug or gasoline station premises is such that the 100-foot separation has been satisfied.

1.  Class "AB" - 22

"Downtown area" shall mean that area included in the Downtown Area Plan as previously approved by the board of city commissioners and as it may hereafter be amended. At such time as the population of the city of Fargo shall exceed 100,000, one (1) additional "Z" shall become available for each 10,000 people in excess of 100,000 population.

26.  Class "Y" - no limit 
27.  Class RZ-V - no limit

For purposes of determining the population of the city of Fargo in this article, the board of city commissioners may recognize the most recent estimated population as determined by the Census Bureau of the United States Department of Commerce and, further, may establish a current population by extrapolation based upon a reasonable rate of population change since the most recent census estimate or by estimation considering recent annexations into the city, the number of housing starts within the city, other relevant activity that would typically coincide with increases or decreases of population or any combination of such data or activity to arrive at such estimate.

4.  When an individual holding a "W" license issued pursuant to the provisions of this article has become deceased, the license may be transferred to the heir or heirs of the individual, but may not be transferred to any other person, partnership, corporation, or other form of business entity. 
5.  Upon the death or withdrawal of any person holding more than a 5% ownership interest in the business entity holding a license issued pursuant to the provisions of this article, the remaining owner or owners may continue to hold the license, but no ownership interest may be issued to any new owner. It is the intent of this provision that the city of Fargo desires to control the transfer of the "W" license and restrict any artificial appreciation in value of said license. 
6.  When an individual, partnership, limited liability company or other business entity holding a "W" license issued pursuant to the provisions of this article sells the business as a going concern, whether by sale of the assets of the business entity holding the "W" license or by sale of the underlying ownership shares, member interests or other ownership interest, the purchaser of the business has the first preference to purchase the "W" license being returned to the city for such business. The purchaser must, however, meet all other relevant conditions of article 25-1508 including the factors contained in 25-1508(C) and must remit payment to the city a transfer fee equal to the total annual cost of the license being transferred as set forth in  25-1507.B. 
I.

4.  When an individual holding a "Z" license issued pursuant to the provisions of this article has become deceased, the license may be transferred to the heir or heirs of the individual, but may not be transferred to any other person, partnership, corporation, or other form of business entity. 
5.  Upon the death or withdrawal of any person holding more than a 5% ownership interest in the business entity holding a license issued pursuant to the provisions of this article, the remaining owner or owners may continue to hold the license, but no ownership interest may be issued to any new owner. It is the intent of this provision that the city of Fargo desires to control the transfer of the "Z" license and restrict any artificial appreciation in value of said license. 
6.  When an individual, partnership, limited liability company or other business entity holding a "Z" license issued pursuant to the provisions of this article sells the business as a going concern, whether by sale of the assets of the business entity holding the "Z" license or by sale of the underlying ownership shares, member interests or other ownership interest, the purchaser of the business has the first preference to purchase the "Z" license being returned to the city for such business. The purchaser must, however, meet all other relevant conditions of article 25-1508 including the factors contained in 25-1508(C) and must remit payment to the city a transfer fee equal to the total annual cost of the license being transferred as set forth in  25-1507.B.

1.  Should any "B-Limited" licensee voluntarily go out of business, the license shall revert to the city. 
2.  In the event the licensee shall file a petition in bankruptcy, become insolvent, or otherwise cease business, the license shall revert to the city. 
3.  There shall be no limitation on the transferability of a "B-Limited" license as regards a change in location of the licensed premises. In the event of change of location, the licensee may apply for transfer subject to all of the terms and conditions of this article. This will include, but not be limited to, the provisions of section 25-1508 regarding factors in considering the granting or denying of license, as well as proximity to other business establishments. 
4.  Upon the death or withdrawal of any person holding more than a 5% ownership interest in the business entity holding a license issued pursuant to the provisions of this article, the remaining owner or owners may continue to hold the license, but no ownership interest may be issued to any new owner. Nothing contained herein shall prevent the license holder (whether solely-owned, owned by partners or owned in another form of business entity) from incorporating or forming another form of business entity for liability purposes providing, however, that all ownership interest in the business entity must remain in the ownership of the initial license holder or holders, with the license to be returned to the city upon the conditions contained in this section. It is further provided that there may be one lifetime transfer to an heir of the original person holding more than a 5% ownership interest in the business entity holding a license issued pursuant to the provisions of this article. It is the intent of this provision that the city of Fargo desires to control the transfer of the "B-Limited" license and restrict any artificial appreciation in value of said license. 
5.  When an individual, partnership or other form of business entity holding a "B-Limited" license issued pursuant to the provisions of this article sells the business as a going concern, the purchaser of the business has the first preference to purchase the "B-Limited" license being returned to the city for such business. The purchaser must, however, meet all other relevant conditions of article 25-1508 including the factors contained in 25-1508(C) and must remit payment to the city a transfer fee equal to the total annual cost of the license being transferred as set forth in  25-1507.B.

With respect to the ownership interest of a person who has such ownership interest in a licensee business entity that his or her name and address is required to be included along with a license renewal application as set forth in 25-1504.1, above, an ownership transfer will be allowed upon the death of such person so long as (a) the transfer is made to a spouse or a descendant within three degrees of kinship and (b) the transferee is approved by the commission after an application for such ownership transfer is submitted and an investigation is submitted as provided in section 25-1505; or 
2.  An assignment, sale, exchange or other conveyance of said ownership interest (herein the "conveyance") during the life of a person who has the ownership interest is permitted so long as (a) the licensee business has not been automatically terminated by reasons set forth in section 25-1512 subd.

No licensee or partner, principal, agent or employee of any licensee shall sell, serve, or furnish alcoholic beverages to or allow possession and consumption of alcoholic beverages on the licensed premises by any person who is or has become intoxicated and/or incapacitated by the consumption of alcoholic beverages. A person may be considered to be obviously intoxicated when it can be plainly determined by appearance, conduct, and/or demeanor.

The city of Fargo police department, in conjunction with its designee, will make a reasonable effort to conduct up to four compliance checks a year at each licensed liquor serving establishment in the city. In the event a licensed establishment fails to pass compliance checks during such visits, the same may result in additional compliance checks being conducted at that establishment during the year.

The city of Fargo shall pay the cost of the audit if the business is in compliance with the required food-to-alcohol sales ratio (or in the case of an FA-ENTERTAINMENT or RZ-V licensee, a food and business income to alcohol sales ratio). The liquor licensee shall, however, pay for the cost of the audit of the business is not in compliance with the required food-to-alcohol sales ratio (or in the case of an FA-ENTERTAINMENT or RZ-V licensee, a food and business income to alcohol sales ratio).

25-2106. - Regulations. 
When dangerous gases, fumes, or vapors are used for exterminating purposes, the following procedure shall be followed: 
A.  Notification of occupants and vacating of premises. Before fumigation, the operator shall personally inspect the premises, and shall serve notice, over his signature, upon all responsible occupants of each room or apartment within the danger area, stating the danger of the process and the precautions to be observed, designating the rooms or apartments which must be vacated, and indicating the time when the gas is to be generated and liberated. The form of this notice shall be approved by the health officer. Every room in the danger area shall be vacated. In the case of a building in which there is an inner court, vent shaft, or light well, or a lot-line court with a partywall, or in the case of two buildings having adjacent lot-line courts, upon which any room being gassed opens, every room, with windows or other apertures opening to such inner or lot-line courts, vent shafts or light wells, shall be vacated or the windows remain closed until the fumigation room is thoroughly ventilated. Where the walls of any adjoining buildings are located within 10 feet of the rooms or apartments being gassed, the operator shall notify, over his signature, all responsible occupants of rooms or apartments with window openings in such wells that such windows are directly opposite or above the area of the adjoining building which is under gas and must remain closed, or the rooms vacated, during the time the building gassed is being flushed or aired. All rooms or apartments ordered vacated but not under gas shall be ventilated during the process by keeping the windows or rooms or apartment open. 
  The operator placing or liberating toxic gas during the process of fumigation and while he is entering and airing out the premises during said process and immediately thereafter shall be properly protected and safeguarded by being equipped with a mask approved by the health officer and suitable gloves. 
  Vacating of premises and notification of occupants shall not be necessary where the fumigation is done in special rooms or vaults in furniture stores, secondhand stores, or household goods warehouses, when such special rooms or vaults are approved as to their location, construction, and gas-tightness by the fire department and a provision is made for the airing of such vaults so as to allow the escape of gases, fumes, or vapors at such location where it is not dangerous, by a system of ducts and ventilation approved by the fire department. 
B.  The danger area. The danger area is those portions of any structure or dwelling which lie within the boundary of the outside of the building under gas, the roof, the basement or cellar floor, and such cutoff or firewalls as may exist in the structure in question. Such cutoff or fire walls shall be of solid masonry, gas tight, at least eight inches in thickness, extending from the basement through the attic, with all openings locked and guarded against entry and effectively sealed against gas leakage. 
C.  Sealing rooms. Before fumigation with dangerous gases, fumes, or vapors, it is required that the operator shall securely seal all cracks, holes, crevices, openings, and apertures in walls, ceilings, and floors in such a way as to confine the gas to the premises intended to be fumigated. 
D.  Locking rooms and adjoining rooms or apartments. Before fumigation, it is required that the operator shall personally inspect all rooms and apartments ordered vacated under subdivision (A) above, and be assured that they are unoccupied by persons or domestic animals, and that all fish and growing plants have been removed; afterward all doors to all apartments, excepting one exit door to the rooms or apartments to be gassed, shall be securely locked; in addition, such windows or other wall openings as might possibly be used to gain entrance shall be locked or barred in such a way as to prevent entrance while still permitting thorough airing of the room. Immediately upon generating or liberating the gas, the door through which the operator leaves shall be securely locked and sealed, and all keys obtainable to all rooms or apartments ordered vacated shall be retained by the operator until all danger is past. As an additional precaution, all rooms and apartments vacated shall be placarded. 
E.  Warning card. Prior to releasing the gas, suitable warning signs shall be posted on all entrances or doors to the premises to be fumigated: 
Skull

  Such signs shall be printed in red ink on white cardboard. The letters in the word "DANGER" shall be at least two inches high, all others except signature, at least three-fourths of an inch high. At night, whenever possible, such signs shall be illuminated so as to make the reading matter thereon plainly legible. 
F.  Guards. Whenever dangerous gases, fumes, or vapors are generated or liberated in any room or portion of a structure in the city, a sufficient number of capable, alert watchmen shall remain on duty at the entrance to the building, room, or other enclosed space to prevent people from entering or attempting to enter while gas is present and for two hours after the room or area gassed is open for aeration and ventilation. All guards or watchmen shall be reliable persons and must be acceptable as proper guards by the health officer. The licensee shall be held strictly responsible and accountable for the conduct of the guards or watchmen. In every case where the entire building is not vacated, the licensee or his approved representative shall remain on the job during the progress of fumigation and airing and shall constantly supervise the occupancy of the structure to ensure that no person will be endangered or inconvenienced by gas leakage. Guards are not compulsory when one- or two-family residences are fumigated. 
G.  Opening of rooms after gassing. At the conclusion of the gassing process, its hall be the duty of the operator to throw open doors and windows of the premises until all rooms have been opened for free access of air. No person other than the operator shall be permitted to enter the premises until all traces of the gas have disappeared. No room or space, except where the whole building is vacated, shall be left under gas after the time of sunset. Warnings posted where the natural light between sunrise and sunset is dim shall be artificially illuminated. 
H.  Disposal of chemical residue. The operator shall pour the residue left in the jars or containers which held the chemicals and the water used for cleaning such jars or containers down the toilet bowl, which shall then be flushed thoroughly with water to remove all traces of the chemicals. 
I.  Powers of health officer. The health officer is further authorized and directed to give 30 days' notice of his intention to add or change rules and regulations with reference to the fumigating industry to representatives of said industry.

    B-16. The burners shall be so installed as to be readily accessible for cleaning and inspection. The burner or burners shall be so installed that no part of the flames impinge on the heating surface so as to cause incomplete combustion. Air shutters shall be adjusted to produce a proper flame at the prevailing gas pressure. 
    On all installations where the combustion air pressure can exceed the house line pressure, an approved check valve or other approved device shall be installed in the gas supply line to prevent air from backing into the gas line. 
    B-17. Air intake. Where secondary air is necessary, secondary air opening or openings shall be provided of sufficient area to supply an adequate amount of air for complete combustion under the specified draft conditions and at the maximum rate of firing. 
    Where an automatic secondary air control is provided, the construction shall be such that, in case the control fails in any way, either the gas will be shut off or the secondary air door will remain open. 
    The air intake of power burners shall be so located as to prevent the possibility of accidental closure. The gas and air supply shall be equipped with controls coordinated to prevent opening of the gas supply until the air supply is adequate for proper combustion and to shut off the gas supply in the event of failure of the air supply. 
    B-18. Pilots. Each gas burner shall be equipped with a safety device arranged to prevent the flow of gas through the main burner unless the pilot flame is burning. The device shall consist of a thermostatic pilot or other approved type of safety device. The operation of this device shall not depend upon the closing of an electric circuit to shut off the main gas supply. Gas burners installed under subsection B-14 are exempt from this provision. 
    Pilot burners shall be rigidly supported in such a manner that their position relative to the main burner or burners will be fixed. 
    Pilot burner or burners shall be so placed that they can be safely lighted and they shall be readily accessible or removable for cleaning. 
    The gas supply line to the pilot or pilots shall be connected to vertical main gas supply lines or to the side or top of horizontal lines ahead of the main burner governor and appliance shutoff valve and shall be provided with a separate cock. Provided, however, that where complete shutoff-type automatic pilot is provided with approved flow interrupter, the pilot line shall be connected to this control and such control shall be located ahead of the main burner governor and after the appliance shutoff valve. 
    Room heaters, floor furnaces and recessed wall heaters shall be equipped with complete shutoff type of automatic pilot. 
    Thermostatic safety pilots shall be so adjusted that under continuous operating conditions the main gas supply will be shut off within three minutes after pilot flame has been extinguished. 
    Copper or iron tubing shall not be used for supply piping within the burner heat zone to pilot burners. 
    B-19. Main shutoff valve or cock. A manually operated, approved shutoff valve or cock shall be installed at each appliance to shut off the entire gas supply to appliance. 
    Such valve or cock shall be so located that it is readily accessible at about five feet above the floor, and shall clearly indicate the "on" and "off" positions, or direction of rotation to open or close. Where a cock is provided, the opening handle shall be securely attached to the plug in such manner that it may not be readily removed. 
    B-20. Automatic control. Electric control valves shall be installed according to the instructions furnished by the manufacturer. All heating equipment shall be automatically controlled by thermostat except heaters installed in fireplaces as provided in subsection B-14. 
    B-21. Electric wiring. All electrical connections shall be made in accordance with the provisions of all building and electrical codes relating to the installation of electric wiring in the city of Fargo. 
    B-22. Gas pressure regulators. An approved gas pressure regulator shall be installed on the downstream side of the pilot supply on all gas burners, and a pressure regulator and pilot filter shall be installed in all pilot lines, downstream from the pilot shutoff cock, on all burners. Pressure regulators and pilot filters shall be of a type listed for approval by the American Gas Association and shall be approved by the building inspector. 
    B-23. Limiting devices. The boiler or furnace shall be equipped with safety devices arranged to limit high steam pressures or water temperatures, as well as high air temperature in warm-air furnaces, and all such devices shall be subject to the approval of the building inspector. 
    Each gas-fired steam boiler shall be equipped with a low-water cutoff approved by the building inspector. 
    Safety devices operated electrically shall not depend upon the closing of a circuit to shut off the main gas supply. This requirement shall not be construed as prohibiting the use of electrical regulating devices, providing the required safety devices are also installed. Controls shall be so connected that maximum inherent safety provided by such controls will be attained. 
    Safety shutoff valves, if used, shall be tested to assure gas-tightness of the seat when in the closed position; the valve assembly shall be gas-tight in all positions. Packing glands shall be designed so that the valve will not be made inoperative by excessive tightening of the packing nut. 
    Either the valve shall incorporate means for requiring a manual operation for reopening of the valve after it has closed or the electrical circuit shall be so arranged as to require a manual operation to reopen the valve after it has been closed. In no case shall valves be able to be opened manually until safety pilots are lighted and circuit completed or low-water cutoff circuit has been completed. 
    B-24. Piping. Gas piping installed for serving conversion burners or gas-designed heater appliances shall be sized for a total pressure drop not exceeding 0.5 inches water gauge from the meter to the burner for the total connected load. A separate pipe from the meter is to be preferred and in no case shall the service pipe be smaller than the size of equipment connection. All gas piping shall be installed in conformance with the provisions of this chapter and in conformance with American Standard Association's requirements.
