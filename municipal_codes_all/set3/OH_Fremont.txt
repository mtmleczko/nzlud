HISTORICAL DATA
WHEN FREMONT BECAME A CITY
   EDITOR'S NOTE:  The following historical note was discovered in one of the
old city ordinance books.  Its author was Basil Meek, attorney, who acted at
various times in the past century as Clerk of Courts of Sandusky County and as
City Postmaster and as a member of the School Board.
   On July 16, 1866, at a meeting of the Village Council, a resolution offered
by Col. Haynes, then a member, was adopted providing for certification to the
Governor, the Auditor and Secretary of State of the fact that Fremont had a
population exceeding five thousand inhabitants, which fact had been established
by a recent enumeration.  The Resolution also provided that such State officers
were to be requested to declare the Village a City of the second class.
   On July 23, 1866, at a meeting of the Village Council, a document was
entered in the Journal of the Council in the following words:
   Whereas in accordance with the provisions of the Statutes in such cases made
and provided, satisfactory evidence has been furnished to the undersigned
authorities that the incorporated Village of Fremont, Sandusky County, Ohio,
has a population exceeding five thousand inhabitants, and has through its
trustees certified its desire to accept the advancement to the grade of the
City of the Second Class.
   Therefore by virtue of the power conferred upon us by said Statute, we do
declare the incorporated Village of Fremont to have become a city of the Second
Class.
   In testimony whereof we have hereunto affixed our official signatures, and
caused the Great Seal of the State of Ohio, to be affixed at Columbus, this
18th day of July A.D. 1866.
 
   J.D. Cox, Governor,
 
   J.H. Godman, Auditor of State,
 
   Wm. Henry Smith, Sec'y of State.
   On December 17, 1866, at a Council meeting, an ordinance to perfect the
organization of the City with respect to wards and election districts and
dividing the City into wards was introduced by Col. Haynes and passed.  The
following division was made:
   First Ward:   All west of the Sandusky River and south of the center line of
Croghan Street.
   Second Ward:   All west of the Sandusky River and north of the center line
of Croghan Street.
   Third Ward:   All east of the Sandusky River.
                                                                               
                               
   On April 8, 1867, the first meeting of the Council as the City Council of
Fremont was held.  The venerable John Bell was Mayor and it is an interesting
fact that he was the first Mayor of the Village of Lower Sandusky, which was
organized in 1829.
   The members of the First City Council were called Trustees; they were David
Belts and Plate Brush from the First Ward; Ambrose Ochs and T.M. Quilter from
the Second Ward; and J.D. Botefur and Thomas Kelley from the Third Ward.  The
Council was organized by the election of J.C. Botefur, President, and Dr. F.
Wilmer, Clerk.
   Thus it appears that Fremont became, in law, a City on April 8, 1867.

EDITOR'S NOTE
     The arrangement and numbering of the Codified Ordinances into component
codes, titles, chapters and sections are based on an adaptation of the decimal
numbering system which is similar to that used in the Ohio Revised Code, and in
accord with the best accepted practice in instituting a codification.  Each
section is self-identifying as to code, chapter and section number.  For
example, 305.06 indicates that the code number is 3, the chapter number is 305
(or the 5th chapter within code 3), and the section number is .06.  The code
and chapter numbers appear left of the decimal, with the code number preceding
the first two digits left of the decimal, and the chapter number being all
digits left of the decimal.  The section number appears right of the decimal. 
As another example, 113.10 indicates the code number is 1, the chapter number
is 113 (or the 13th chapter within code 1), and the section number is .10.
     This numbering system has the advantage of inherent flexibility in
allowing for an almost endless amount of expansion.  Codes, titles and chapters
initially are odd-numbered, thus reserving the use of even numbers for future
legislation.  Sections within chapters are consecutively numbered, except that
penalty provisions are usually assigned the number .99 as used in the Revised
Code.  Newly created sections subsequent to the original codification may be
indicated by three digits right of the decimal in the event the law properly
belongs between two consecutively numbered sections.  For example, newly
created 575.061, 575.062 and 575.063 follow 575.06 and precede 575.07 to be
placed in their logical position.
 
     Section histories enable a user to trace the origin of the law contained
in the section.  The history indicates the derivation by reference to either
its passage date and the ordinance number originally assigned to it at that
time, or to its inclusion in any prior code.  Sections without histories
indicate that the section contains new matter which was ordained by the
Adopting Ordinance which enacts the Codified Ordinances.
 
     The Comparative Section Table is included to show the disposition of every
ordinance included in the Codified Ordinances.  It indicates whether a given
ordinance was consolidated with another into one section or split into two or
more sections.  Cross references direct the user to subject matter reasonably
related to material contained within a given chapter.

originally repealed nor impair the effect of any saving clause therein.
(ORC 1.57)
   (b)   An ordinance which is re-enacted or amended is intended to be a
continuation of the prior ordinance and not a new enactment, so far as it is
the same as the prior ordinance.
(ORC 1.54)
   (c)   The re-enactment, amendment or repeal of an ordinance does not, except
as provided in subsection (d) hereof:
      (1)   Affect the prior operation of the ordinance or any prior action
taken thereunder;
      (2)   Affect any validation, cure, right, privilege, obligation or
liability previously acquired, accrued, accorded or incurred thereunder;
      (3)   Affect any violation thereof or penalty, forfeiture or punishment
incurred in respect thereto, prior to the amendment or repeal;
      (4)   Affect any investigation, proceeding or remedy in respect of any
such privilege, obligation, liability, penalty, forfeiture or punishment; and
the investigation, proceeding or remedy may be instituted, continued or
enforced, and the penalty, forfeiture or punishment imposed, as if the
ordinance had not been repealed or amended.
   (d)   If the penalty, forfeiture or punishment for any offense is reduced by
a re-enactment or amendment of an ordinance, the penalty, forfeiture, or
punishment, if not already imposed, shall be imposed according to the ordinance
as amended.
(ORC 1.58)
   101.05  CONSTRUCTION OF SECTION REFERENCES.
   (a)   A reference to any portion of the Codified Ordinances applies to all
re-enactments or amendments thereof.
(ORC 1.55)
   (b)   If a section refers to a series of numbers or letters, the first and
the last numbers or letters are included.
(ORC 1.56)
   (c)   Wherever in a penalty section reference is made to a violation of a
series of sections or of subsections of a section, such reference shall be
construed to mean a violation of any section or subsection included in such
reference.
   References in the Codified Ordinances to action taken or authorized under
designated sections of the Codified Ordinances include, in every case, action
taken or authorized under the applicable legislative provision which is
superseded by the Codified Ordinances.
(ORC 1.23)
   101.06  CONFLICTING PROVISIONS.
   (a)   If there is a conflict between figures and words in expressing a
number, the words govern.
(ORC 1.46)
   (b)   If a general provision conflicts with a special or local provision,
they shall be construed, if possible, so that effect is given to both.  If the
conflict between the provisions is irreconcilable, the special or local
provision prevails as an exception to the general provision, unless the general
provision is the later adoption and the manifest intent is that the general
provision prevail.
(ORC 1.51)
   (c)   (1)   If ordinances enacted at different meetings of Council are
irreconcilable, the ordinance latest in date of enactment prevails.
      (2)   If amendments to the same ordinance are enacted at different
meetings of Council, one amendment without reference to another, the amendments
are to be harmonized, if possible, so that effect may be given to each.  If the
amendments are substantively irreconcilable, the latest in date of enactment
prevails.  The fact that a later amendment restates language deleted by an
earlier amendment, or fails to include language inserted by an earlier
amendment, does not of itself make the amendments irreconcilable.  Amendments
are irreconcilable only when changes made by each cannot reasonably be put into
simultaneous operation.
         (ORC 1.52)
   101.07  DETERMINATION OF LEGISLATIVE INTENT.
   (a)   In enacting an ordinance, it is presumed that:
      (1)   Compliance with the constitutions of the State and of the United
States is intended;
      (2)   The entire ordinance is intended to be effective;
      (3)   A just and reasonable result is intended;
      (4)   A result feasible of execution is intended.
         (ORC 1.47)
   (b)   An ordinance is presumed to be prospective in its operation unless
expressly made retrospective.
(ORC 1.48)
   (c)   If an ordinance is ambiguous, the court, in determining the intention
of Council may consider among other matters:
      (1)   The object sought to be attained;
      (2)   The circumstances under which the ordinance was enacted;
      (3)   The legislative history;
      (4)   The common law or former legislative provisions, including laws
upon the same or similar subjects;
      (5)   The consequences of a particular construction;
      (6)   The administrative construction of the ordinance.
         (ORC 1.49)
   101.08  SEVERABILITY.
   If any provision of a section of the Codified Ordinances or the application
thereof to any person or circumstance is held invalid, the invalidity does not
affect the other provisions or applications of the section or related sections
which can be given effect without the invalid provision or application, and to
this end the provisions are severable.
(ORC 1.50)
   101.99  GENERAL PENALTY.
   Whenever, in the Codified Ordinances or in any ordinance of the
Municipality, any act is prohibited or is made or declared to be unlawful or an
offense or a misdemeanor, or whenever the doing of any act is required or the
failure to do any act is declared to be unlawful, where no specific penalty is
otherwise provided, whoever violates any such provision shall be punished by a
fine not exceeding one hundred dollars ($100.00).  A separate offense shall be
deemed committed each day during or on which a violation continues or occurs.

   137.01  ESTABLISHMENT OF THE PARKS AND RECREATION ADVISORY COMMISSION;
MEMBERSHIP; TERMS; DUTIES.
   (a)   There is hereby created a Parks and Recreation Advisory Commission. 
The Commission shall consist of six residents; two appointed by the Mayor for
an original term of three years, two appointed by Council for an original term
of two years, and two appointed by the Board of Education of the City of
Fremont for an original term of one year.  After the original term, all
appointments shall be for terms of three years.  Members of the Commission
shall serve without pay.  Vacancies in the Commission, occurring other than by
expiration of term, shall be for the unexpired term and shall be filled in the
same manner as original appointments.
   (b)   The Commission members shall elect a President, Vice-President, and a
Secretary who shall service without pay.  Election of officers shall be held
annually.
   (c)   The members of the Commission shall meet at least once a month.
   (d)   The purpose of the Commission shall be to gather input from the many
different areas of the community for the purpose of revitalization of our Park
System and on new Recreation Programming and Facilities.
      (1)   The Advisory Commission has no legal powers and can only
recommend.  Its function as its name implies, is simply advisory.  Its
recommendations may be accepted and implemented or they can be disregarded.  It
has no power to enforce its determinations.  The Advisory Committee provides
municipal authorities with a community sounding board through the participation
of representative local citizens.
      (2)   Policy developments and implementation in these municipalities
become the responsibility of the Recreation Director with the approval of the
municipal administration.  The Advisory Board is valued for its ability to
interpret community needs and desires as well as to interpret official
municipal actions to the various community constituencies represented by
advisory committee members.
      (3)   Citizen input is critical on the Park and Recreational Advisory
Committee, for example, some such citizens have specialized professional
knowledge that is very valuable; others provide general interpretation of
citizen needs and reactions, which is essential to sounding planning.  Manpower
for data collection and other elements of the planning process also frequently
depends on the cooperation and support of individual citizens and groups they
represent.
      (4)   Neighborhoods and community committees also form other leisure
services concerns; holiday and special events programs; studies of fees and
charges, concession policies, and related fiscal issues; and facility
development and design.  All these require effective citizen involvement in
support of board or commission policy determinations.
         (Ord. 95-2907.  Passed 5-18-95.)
   137.02  SPECIAL RECREATION TRUST FUND.
   There is hereby established a Special Recreation Trust Fund, and there shall
be paid into the Fund all donations received by the City of Fremont.  The Fund
shall be held in trust by the City and used for any lawful purpose.  The Fund
is created under the authority of Ohio R.C. 5705.09(H). 
(Ord. 95-2907.  Passed 5-18-95.)
   137.03  EXPENDITURE OF TRUST FUND MONIES.
   Funds in the Special Recreation Trust Fund are to be expended on
authorization of the Mayor and the City Auditor is authorized to draw his
warrants on the City Treasurer for payments therefrom upon receiving proper
certificates and vouchers therefor approved by the Mayor or officers authorized
by law to approve the same. (Ord. 95-2907.  Passed 5-18-95.)
   137.04  INSTRUCTIONAL CONTRACTS.
   The City may contract with independent contractors to provide self-
supporting instructional courses for members of the public on property under
the jurisdiction of the City.  Such contracts shall fix the fee to be paid by
participants, the fee of the instructor and may authorize the instructor to
receive the fees, retain his portion thereof and pay the balance into the
Public Recreation Fund together with an accounting, in a form approved by the
City Auditor.
(Ord. 95-2907.  Passed 5-18-95.)
   137.05  ESTABLISHMENT OF THE PARKS AND RECREATION FINANCIAL BOARD.
   (a)   There is hereby created a Parks and Recreation Financial Board, which
shall review and establish fees and charges for all Parks and Recreation
Department memberships, programs, rentals and services and report the same to
the City Council.
   (b)   The Parks and Recreation Financial Board shall consist of the
following members:  Mayor, Safety-Service Director, City Auditor, Parks and
Recreation Director, and the Parks and Recreation Advisory Commission
Chairperson.
   (c)   That the Mayor shall serve as the Chair of the Parks and Recreation
Financial Board, which shall meet at least once each year and as otherwise
determined by the Mayor.

Code;
         C.   Gross receipts of the business or profession from sales made and

subsections (b)(1)A., B. and C. hereof, or such of the aforesaid percentages as

apportionment.
   (c)   As used in subsection (b) hereof, “sales made in a municipal

within such municipal corporation and the sales result from such solicitation
or promotion;
      (3)   All sales of tangible personal property shipped from a place within
such municipal corporation to purchasers outside such municipal corporation
regardless of where title passes if the taxpayer is not, through its own
employees, regularly engaged in the solicitation or promotion of sales at the
place where delivery is made.
   (d)   Except as otherwise provided in subsection (e) hereof, net profit from
rental activity not constituting a business or profession shall be subject to
tax only by the municipal corporation in which the property generating the net
profit is located.   
   (e)   This section does not apply to individuals who are residents of the
Municipality and, except as otherwise provided in section 718.01 of the Ohio
Revised Code, the Municipality may impose a tax on all income earned by

Constitution.

include all companies that are so affiliated.
      (2)   Once a consolidated return has been filed for any taxable year,
consolidated returns shall continue to be filed in subsequent years unless the
applicable requirements of the Rules and Regulations for discontinuing the
filing of consolidated returns have been met.

      (9)   Income of any charitable, educational, fraternal or other type of

hereunder.
      (11)   In the event any association or organization receives taxable

such tax by reason of residence or domicile in the Municipality, or the
headquarters of the authority or commission is located within the Municipality.
      (16)   The Municipality shall not tax the compensation paid to a

(Ord. 2003-3303.  Passed 12-4-03.)
   171.05  RETURN AND PAYMENT OF TAX.
   (a)   On or before April 15th of each year, every resident subject to the
provisions of Section
171.03 shall, except as hereinafter provided, make and file with the Tax
Administrator, a Municipal tax return on a form prescribed by and acceptable to
the Tax Administrator, whether or not a tax is due.  When the return is made
for a fiscal year or other period different from the calendar year, the return
shall be filed on or before the fifteenth (15th) day of the fourth (4th) month
following the end of such fiscal year or period.  The Tax Administrator is
hereby authorized to provide by regulation that the return of an employer or
employers, showing the amount of Municipal tax deducted by said employer or
employers from the qualifying wages, commissions, other compensation, and other
taxable income of a nonresident employee, and paid by him or them to the Tax
Administrator may be accepted as the return of a nonresident employee whose
sold income, subject to tax under this Tax Code, is such qualifying wages,
commissions, other compensation, and other taxable income.
   (b)   Joint filing is permitted.
   (c)   The return shall be filed with the Tax Administrator on a form or
forms furnished by or obtainable upon request from the Tax Administrator; or on
a generic form, if the generic form, when completed and filed, contains all of
the information required to be submitted with the Municipality’s prescribed
return and, if the taxpayer or return preparer filing the generic form
otherwise complies with the Tax Code governing the filing of returns.
   (d)   The return shall set forth:
      (1)   The aggregate amounts of qualifying wages, commissions, other
compensation received, allocated, apportioned or set aside, other income
defined by statute as taxable, and gross income from any business, profession,
or other activity, less allowable expenses incurred in the acquisition of such
gross income earned during the preceding year and subject to said tax; and
      (2)   The amount of the tax imposed by this Tax Code on such earnings and
profits; and
      (3)   Such other pertinent statements, information returns, copies of
federal or state tax returns and/or schedules, or other information as the Tax
Administrator may require, including a statement that the figures used in the
return are the figures used for federal income tax adjusted to set forth only
such income as is taxable under the provisions of this chapter.
   (e)   (1)   Any taxpayer that has requested an extension for filing a
federal income tax return may request an extension for the filing of a
Municipal Income Tax Return by filing a copy of the taxpayer’s federal
extension request with the Municipal Tax Division.  Any taxpayer not required
to file a federal income tax return may request an extension for filing a
Municipal Income Tax Return in writing.  The request for extension must be
filed on or before the original due date for the annual return.  If the request
is granted, the extended due date of the municipal income tax return shall be
the last day of the month following the month to which the due date of the
federal income tax return has been extended.      
      (2)   The Tax Administrator may deny a taxpayer’s request for extension
if the taxpayer:
         A.   Fails to timely file the request; or
         B.   Fails to file a copy of the federal extension request, (if
applicable); or
         C.   Owes the Municipality any delinquent income tax, penalty,
interest or other charge for the late payment or nonpayment of income tax; or
         D.   Has failed to file any required income tax return, report, or
other related document for a prior tax period.
      (3)   The granting of an extension for filing a Municipal income tax
return does not extend the due date as provided in this section for payment of
the tax; hence, penalty and interest may apply to any unpaid tax during the
period of extension at the rate set out by Section
171.10.  No penalty shall be assessed in those cases in which the return is
filed and the final tax paid within the extension period provided all other
filing and payment requirements of the Tax Code have been met.  Any extension
by the Tax Administrator shall be granted upon the condition that declaration
filing and payment requirements have been fulfilled; however, if, upon further
examination it then becomes evident that declaration filing and payment
requirements have not been fulfilled, penalty and interest may be assessed in
full and in the same manner as though no extension had been granted.
   (f)   Payments with Returns.
      (1)   The taxpayer making a return shall, at the time of the filing
thereof, pay to the Tax Administrator the amount of taxes shown as due. 
However, credit shall be allowed for:
         A.   Any portion of the tax so due which shall have been deducted at
the source pursuant to the provisions of Section
171.06; and
         B.   Any portion of said tax which shall have been paid by the
taxpayer pursuant to the provisions of Section
171.07; and
         C.   Credit to the extent allowed by Section
171.15 for tax paid to another municipality.
      (2)   Subject to the limitations contained in Section
171.11 of this Tax Code, any taxpayer who has overpaid the amount of tax to
which the Municipality is entitled under the provisions of this Tax Code may
have such overpayment applied against any subsequent liability hereunder or, at
his election indicated on the return, such overpayment (or part thereof) shall
be refunded, provided that no additional taxes or refunds of less than one
dollar ($1.00) shall be collected or refunded.
   (g)   Amended Returns.
      (1)   Where necessary, an amended return shall be filed in order to
report additional income and pay any additional tax due, or claim a refund of
tax overpaid, subject to the requirements and/or limitations contained in
Section
171.11.  The Tax Administrator shall provide by regulation the format in which
such amended return shall be filed.  A taxpayer may not change the method of
accounting or apportionment of net profits after the due date for filing the
original return.
      (2)   Within three (3) months from the final determination of any federal
tax liability affecting the taxpayer’s Municipal tax liability, such taxpayer
shall make and file an amended Municipal return showing income subject to the
Municipal tax based upon such final determination of federal tax liability and
pay any additional tax shown due thereon or make claim for refund of any
overpayment.
   (h)   Information returns, schedules and statements required to support tax
returns which are incomplete without such information shall be filed within the
time limits set forth for the filing of the tax returns and the failure to file
such information returns, schedules and statements shall be a violation of this
Tax Code.  Provided, however, that the taxpayer shall have ten (10) days after
notification by the Tax Administrator, or his authorized representative, to
file the items required by this paragraph.
(Ord. 2004-3353.  Passed 11-18-04.)
   171.06  COLLECTION AT SOURCE.
   (a)   Withholding by Employer.  Each employer within, or doing business
within, the Municipality who employs one or more persons on a salary, wage,
commission or other compensation basis shall deduct, when such salary, wage,
commission or other compensation is paid, allocated, apportioned or set aside,
the tax at the rate provided in Section
171.03 hereof on the qualifying wages due by such employer to each such
employee and shall, on or before the last day of the month following such
withholding, make a return and pay to the Tax Administrator the amount of taxes
so deducted.  The return shall be on a form or forms prescribed by or
acceptable to the Tax Administrator and shall be subject to the Rules and
Regulations prescribed by the Tax Administrator.  Such employer shall be liable
for the payment of the tax required to be deducted and withheld, whether or not
such taxes have in fact been withheld.
   (b)   An employer is not required to make any withholding with respect to an
individual’s disqualifying disposition of an incentive stock option if, at the
time of the disqualifying disposition, the individual is not an employee of the
corporation with respect to whose stock the option has been issued.
   (c)   (1)   An employee is not relieved from liability for a tax by the
failure of the employer to withhold the tax as required by a municipal
corporation or by the employer’s exemption from the requirement to withhold the
tax.
      (2)   The failure of an employer to remit to the municipal corporation
the tax withheld relieves the employee from liability for that tax unless the
employee colluded with the employer in connection with the failure to remit the
tax withheld.
   (d)   Compensation deferred before the effective date of this amendment is
not subject to any municipal corporation income tax or municipal income tax
withholding requirement to the extent the deferred compensation does not
constitute qualifying wages at the time the deferred compensation is paid or
distributed.
   (e)   Payment of taxes withheld by an employer for the Municipality during
the measurement period are to be made quarterly on or before the last day of
the month following the end of each quarter, subject to the approval of the Tax
Administrator.  The Tax Administrator may require monthly filing and payments
whenever the Tax Administrator has reason to believe it is in the best interest
of the Municipality to do so.  Notice of a change in filing and payment
requirements shall be made in writing and, in such case, the employer must
begin to file in accordance with this section.
   (f)   Employer Considered as Trustee.  Each employer in collecting such tax
shall be deemed to hold the same, until payment is made by such employer to the
Municipality, as a trustee for the benefit of the Municipality, and any such
tax collected by such employer from his employees shall, until the same is paid
to the Municipality, be deemed a trust fund in the hands of such employer. 
Each employer shall be liable for the payment of the tax required to be
deducted and withheld, whether or not such tax, in fact, has been withheld.
   (g)   Any person who is required to withhold tax from qualifying wages shall
pay all such tax to the Municipality in accordance with the provisions of this
section.  In the event taxes withheld from the qualifying wages of employees
are not paid to the Municipality in accordance with the provisions of this
section, all officers, members, managers, employees, and trustees having
control or supervision of or charged with the responsibility of filing the
return and making payment are jointly and severally personally liable for the
tax not returned or paid to the Municipality as well as any related interest
and penalties, and are also liable under the provisions of Section
171.12 hereof.  The dissolution, termination, or bankruptcy of a corporation,
limited liability company, or business trust does not discharge an officer’s,
member’s, manager’s, employee’s, or trustee’s liability for a failure of the
corporation, limited liability company, or business trust to file returns or
pay said taxes.
   (h)   Withholding Return; List of Employees.  Each employer shall file a
withholding tax reconciliation showing the sum total of all compensation paid
all employees, the portion of which, (if any) was not subject to withholding
along with an explanation for same, and the portion of which was subject to
withholding, together with the amount of such withholdings remitted.  Such
return shall include information concerning each employee from whom the
Municipal tax was withheld, showing the name, address, zip code and social
security number of each such employee, the total amount of compensation paid
during the year and the amount of Municipal tax withheld.  If the total tax
withheld from any employee included tax withheld and remitted to another
municipality, the amount of same shall be separately shown on the return of
information to the Municipality concerning each employee.  The withholding tax
reconciliation shall be filed by each employer on or before  February 28
following the end of such calendar year.
   (i)   In addition to the wage reporting requirements of this section, any
person required by the Internal Revenue Service to report on Form 1099-Misc.
payments to individuals not treated as employees for services performed shall
also report such payments to the Municipality when the services were performed
in the Municipality.  The information may be submitted on a listing, and shall
include the name, address and social security number  (or federal
identification number), and the amount of the payments made.  Federal form(s)
1099 may be submitted in lieu of such listing.  The information shall be filed
annually on or before February 28 following the end of such calendar year.
   (j)   Domestic Servants.  No person shall be required to withhold the tax on
the qualifying wages, commissions, other compensation, and other taxable income
paid domestic servants employed exclusively in or about such person's
residence.  However, such domestic servants shall be responsible for filing and
paying their own returns and taxes.
(Ord. 2003-3303.  Passed 12-4-03.)

who resides in the municipal corporation but was not domiciled there on the
first day of January of the tax year to which the estimates would be applied.
   (c)   Exceptions.  A penalty shall not be assessed on an additional tax
assessment made by the Tax Administrator when a return has been filed in good
faith and the tax paid thereon within the time prescribed by the Tax
Administrator; and provided further that, in the absence of fraud, neither
penalty nor interest shall be assessed on any additional tax assessment
resulting from a federal audit, providing an amended return is filed and the

   171.11  COLLECTION OF UNPAID TAXES AND REFUNDS OF OVERPAYMENTS.
   (a)   All taxes imposed by this Chapter shall be collectible, together with
any interest and penalties thereon, by suit as other debts of like amount are
recoverable.  No additional assessment shall be made after three (3) years from
the time the tax was due or the return was filed, whichever is later; provided
however, there shall be no period of limitation on an additional assessment in
a case of filing a false or fraudulent return with intent to evade the tax, or
in the case of failure to file a return.  In those cases in which the

federal statute of limitations the period within which an additional assessment
may be made by the Tax Administrator shall be extended one (1) year from the
time of the final determination of the federal tax liability.
   (b)   Taxes erroneously paid shall not be refunded unless a claim for refund

refunded within ninety (90) days after the final filing date of the annual
return or ninety (90) days after the complete return is filed, whichever is
later.  For purposes of computing the payment of interest on overpayments, no
amount of tax for any taxable year shall be treated as having been paid before
the date on which the tax return for that year was due without regard to any
extension of time for filing that return.  The interest shall be paid at the
rate of interest prescribed by Ohio R.C. 5703.47.
   (d)   Amounts of less than one dollar ($1.00) shall not be collected or

chapter has the same meaning as when used in a comparable context in laws of
the United States relating to federal income taxation or in Title LVII of the
ORC, unless a different meaning is clearly required. If a term used in this
chapter that is not otherwise defined in this chapter is used in a comparable
context in both the laws of the United States relating to federal income tax
and in Title LVII of the ORC and the use is not consistent, then the use of the
term in the laws of the United States relating to federal income tax shall
control over the use of the term in Title LVII of the ORC.
   (B)    The singular shall include the plural, and the masculine shall
include the feminine and the gender-neutral.
   (C)    As used in this chapter:

taxable income before net operating losses and special deductions as determined
under the Internal Revenue Code, adjusted as follows:

deducted under division (C)(1)(a) of this section, but excluding that portion
of intangible income directly related to the sale, exchange, or other

Revenue Code;
         (d)   (i)    Except as provided in (C)(1)(d)(ii) of this section,

an asset described in Section 1221 or 1231 of the Internal Revenue Code;
            (ii)    Division (C)(1)(d)(i) of this section does not apply to the
extent the income or gain is income or gain described in Section 1245 or 1250
of the Internal Revenue Code.
         (e)    Add taxes on or measured by net income allowed as a deduction
in the computation of federal taxable income;
         (f)    In the case of a real estate investment trust or regulated

reduced by exempt income to the extent necessary to reduce municipal taxable
income to zero, with any remaining unused portion of the net operating loss
carried forward to not more than five consecutive taxable years following the
taxable year in which the loss was incurred, but in no case for more years than
necessary for the deduction to be fully utilized.

section. To the extent that an amount of net operating loss that was not fully
utilized in one or more taxable years by operation of division (C)(1)(h)(iii)
(a) of this section is carried forward for use with respect to a return filed
for a taxable year beginning in 2019, 2020, 2021, or 2022, the limitation
described in division (C)(1)(h)(iii)(a) of this section shall apply to the
amount carried forward.

percent (1-1/2%) is levied on the Municipal Taxable Income of every person
residing in and/or earning and/or receiving income in the Municipality. 
Individuals.
   (A)     For residents of the Municipality, the income tax levied herein
shall be on all income, salaries, qualifying wages, commissions, and other
compensation from whatever source earned or received by the resident, including
the resident's distributive share of the net profit of pass-through entities
owned directly or indirectly by the resident and any net profit of the
resident.  This is further detailed in the definition of income (Section
172.02 (C)(16)).
   (B)     For nonresidents, all income, salaries, qualifying wages,
commissions, and other compensation from whatever source earned or received by
the nonresident for work done, services performed or rendered, or activities
conducted in the municipal corporation, including any net profit of the
nonresident, but excluding the nonresident's distributive share of the net
profit or loss of only pass-through entities owned directly or indirectly by
the nonresident.
   (C)     For residents and nonresidents, income can be reduced to "Municipal
Taxable Income" as defined in Section
172.02 (C)(21).  Exemptions which may apply are specified in Section

         (a)    "Nonqualified deferred compensation plan" means a compensation
plan described in Section 3121(v)(2)(C) of the Internal Revenue Code.
         (b)    "Qualifying loss" means the amount of compensation attributable
to a taxpayer's nonqualified deferred compensation plan, less the receipt of
money and property attributable to distributions from the nonqualified deferred
compensation plan.  Full loss is sustained if no distribution of money and
property is made by the nonqualified deferred compensation plan. The taxpayer
sustains a qualifying loss only in the taxable year in which the taxpayer
receives the final distribution of money and property pursuant to that
nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
         (c)   (i)    "Qualifying tax rate" means the applicable tax rate for
the taxable year for the which the taxpayer paid income tax to the Municipality
with respect to any portion of the total amount of compensation the payment of
which is deferred pursuant to a nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
            (ii)    If different tax rates applied for different taxable years,
then the "qualifying tax rate" is a weighted average of those different tax
rates. The weighted average shall be based upon the tax paid to the
Municipality each year with respect to the nonqualified deferred compensation
plan.
         (d)    "Refundable credit" means the amount of the Municipality income
tax that was paid on the non-distributed portion, if any, of a nonqualified
deferred compensation plan.
      (2)    If, in addition to the Municipality, a taxpayer has paid tax to
other municipal corporations with respect to the nonqualified deferred
compensation plan, the amount of the credit that a taxpayer may claim from each
municipal corporation shall be calculated on the basis of each municipal
corporation's proportionate share of the total municipal corporation income tax
paid by the taxpayer to all municipal corporations with respect to the
nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
      (3)    In no case shall the amount of the credit allowed under this
section exceed the cumulative income tax that a taxpayer has paid to the
Municipality for all taxable years with respect to the nonqualified deferred
compensation plan.
      (4)    The credit allowed under this division is allowed only to the
extent the taxpayer's qualifying loss is attributable to:
         (a)    The insolvency or bankruptcy of the employer who had
established the nonqualified deferred compensation plan; or
         (b)    The employee's failure or inability to satisfy all of the
employer's terms and conditions necessary to receive the nonqualified deferred
compensation.
Domicile.
   (E)   (1)   (a)    An individual is presumed to be domiciled in the

         (b)    An individual may rebut the presumption of domicile described
in division (E)(1)(a) of this section if the individual establishes by a
preponderance of the evidence that the individual was not domiciled in the
Municipality for all or part of the taxable year.

in the Municipality for all or part of a taxable year, factors that may be
considered include, but are not limited to, the following:

property tax exemption or reduction allowed on the basis of the individual's
residence or domicile;

individual;
         (f)    Declarations, written or oral, made by the individual regarding
the individual's residency;
         (g)    The primary location at which the individual is employed.
         (h)    The location of educational institutions attended by the
individual's dependents as defined in Section 152 of the Internal Revenue Code,

residency of the individual or the individual's spouse in the municipal
corporation where the educational institution is located;
         (i)    The number of contact periods the individual has with the
Municipality. For the purposes of this division, an individual has one "contact
period" with the Municipality if the individual is away overnight from the
individual's abode located outside of the Municipality and while away overnight
from that abode spends at least some portion, however minimal, of each of two
consecutive days in the Municipality. 
      (3)     All additional applicable factors are provided in the Rules and
Regulations. 
Businesses.
   (F)    This division applies to any taxpayer engaged in a business or
profession in the Municipality, unless the taxpayer is an individual who
resides in the Municipality or the taxpayer is an electric company, combined
company, or telephone company that is subject to and required to file reports
under Chapter 5745 of the ORC.
      (1)    Except as otherwise provided in division (F)(2) of this section,
net profit from a business or profession conducted both within and without the
boundaries of the Municipality shall be considered as having a taxable situs in
the Municipality for purposes of municipal income taxation in the same
proportion as the average ratio of the following:
         (a)    The average original cost of the real property and tangible
personal property owned or used by the taxpayer in the business or profession
in the Municipality during the taxable period to the average original cost of
all of the real and tangible personal property owned or used by the taxpayer in
the business or profession during the same period, wherever situated.
As used in the preceding paragraph, tangible personal or real property shall
include property rented or leased by the taxpayer and the value of such
property shall be determined by multiplying the annual rental thereon by eight;
         (b)    Wages, salaries, and other compensation paid during the taxable
period to individuals employed in the business or profession for services
performed in the Municipality to wages, salaries, and other compensation paid
during the same period to individuals employed in the business or profession,
wherever the individual's services are performed, excluding compensation from
which taxes are not required to be withheld under Section
172.04 (C);
         (c)    Total gross receipts of the business or profession from sales
and rentals made and services performed during the taxable period in the
Municipality to total gross receipts of the business or profession during the
same period from sales, rentals, and services, wherever made or performed.
      (2)   (a)    If the apportionment factors described in division (F)(1) of
this section do not fairly represent the extent of a taxpayer's business
activity in the Municipality, the taxpayer may request, or the Tax
Administrator of the Municipality may require, that the taxpayer use, with
respect to all or any portion of the income of the taxpayer, an alternative
apportionment method involving one or more of the following:
            (i)    Separate accounting;
            (ii)    The exclusion of one or more of the factors;
            (iii)    The inclusion of one or more additional factors that would
provide for a more fair apportionment of the income of the taxpayer to the
municipal corporation;
            (iv)    A modification of one or more of the factors.
         (b)    A taxpayer request to use an alternative apportionment method
shall be in writing and shall accompany a tax return, timely filed appeal of an
assessment, or timely filed amended tax return. The taxpayer may use the
requested alternative method unless the Tax Administrator denies the request in
an assessment issued within the period prescribed by Section
172.12 (A).
         (c)    The Tax Administrator may require a taxpayer to use an
alternative apportionment method as described in division (F)(2)(a) of this
section, but only by issuing an assessment to the taxpayer within the period
prescribed by Section
172.12 (A).
         (d)    Nothing in division (F)(2) of this section nullifies or
otherwise affects any alternative apportionment arrangement approved by a the
Tax Administrator or otherwise agreed upon by both the Tax Administrator and
taxpayer before January 1, 2016.
      (3)    As used in division (F)(1)(b) of this section, "wages, salaries,
and other compensation" includes only wages, salaries, or other compensation
paid to an employee for services performed at any of the following locations:
         (a)    A location that is owned, controlled, or used by, rented to, or
under the possession of one of the following:
            (i)    The employer;
            (ii)    A vendor, customer, client, or patient of the employer, or
a related member of such a vendor, customer, client, or patient;
            (iii)    A vendor, customer, client, or patient of a person

vendor, customer, client, or patient.
         (b)    Any location at which a trial, appeal, hearing, investigation,
inquiry, review, court-martial, or similar administrative, judicial, or
legislative matter or proceeding is being conducted, provided that the
compensation is paid for services performed for, or on behalf of, the employer
or that the employee's presence at the location directly or indirectly benefits
the employer;
         (c)    Any other location, if the Tax Administrator determines that
the employer directed the employee to perform the services at the other
location in lieu of a location described in division (F) (3)(a) or (b) of this
section solely in order to avoid or reduce the employer's municipal income tax
liability. If the Tax Administrator makes such a determination, the employer
may dispute the determination by establishing, by a preponderance of the
evidence, that the Tax Administrator's determination was unreasonable.

owned by the individual, shall be subject to the Municipality's tax only if the
property generating the net profit is located in the Municipality or if the
individual taxpayer that receives the net profit is a resident of the
Municipality.  The Municipality shall allow such taxpayers to elect to use
separate accounting for the purpose of calculating net profit sitused under
this division to the municipal corporation in which the property is located.
      (6)   (a)    Commissions received by a real estate agent or broker
relating to the sale, purchase, or lease of real estate shall be sitused to the

real estate everywhere in the taxable year.
         (b)    An individual who is a resident of the Municipality shall

172.03 or division (B)(4) or (6) of this section, the tax shall be withheld at
the rate, specified in Section
172.01 of this chapter, of one and one-half percent (1-1/2%). An employer,
agent of an employer, or other payer shall deduct and withhold the tax from
qualifying wages on the date that the employer, agent, or other payer directly,
indirectly, or constructively pays the qualifying wages to, or credits the
qualifying wages to the benefit of, the employee.
(Ord. 2015-3785.  Passed 9-17-15.)
   
   (B)   (1)    Except as provided in division (B)(2) of this section, an
employer, agent of an employer, or other payer shall remit to the Tax
Administrator of the Municipality the greater of the income taxes deducted and
withheld or the income taxes required to be deducted and withheld by the
employer, agent, or other payer according to the following schedule:
         (a)    Taxes required to be deducted and withheld shall be remitted
monthly to the Tax Administrator if the total taxes deducted and withheld or
required to be deducted and withheld by the employer, agent, or other payer on
behalf of the Municipality in the preceding calendar year exceeded $2,399, or
if the total amount of taxes deducted and withheld or required to be deducted
and withheld on behalf of the Municipality in any month of the preceding
calendar quarter exceeded $200.
   Payment under division (B)(1)(a) of this section shall be made to the Tax
Administrator such that the payment is postmarked not later than 15 days after
the last day of each month for which the tax was withheld.
         (b)    Any employer, agent of an employer, or other payer not required
to make payments under division (B)(1)(a) of this section of taxes required to

following the last day of each calendar quarter.
         (c)     Intentionally left blank.

to make payments electronically for the purpose of paying federal taxes
withheld on payments to employees under Section 6302 of the Internal Revenue
Code, 26 C.F.R. 31.6302-1, or any other federal statute or regulation, the
payment shall be made by electronic funds transfer to the Tax Administrator of
all taxes deducted and withheld on behalf of the Municipality. The payment of
tax by electronic funds transfer under this division does not affect an
employer's, agent's, or other payer's obligation to file any return as required
under this section.
      (3)    An employer, agent of an employer, or other payer shall make and
file a return showing the amount of tax withheld by the employer, agent, or
other payer from the qualifying wages of each employee and remitted to the Tax
Administrator. A return filed by an employer, agent, or other payer under this
division shall be accepted by the Tax Administrator and the Municipality as the
return required of an non-resident employee whose sole income subject to the
tax under this chapter is the qualifying wages reported by the employee's
employer, agent of an employer, or other payer.
      (4)    An employer, agent of an employer, or other payer is not required
to withhold the Municipality income tax with respect to an individual's
disqualifying disposition of an incentive stock option if, at the time of the
disqualifying disposition, the individual is not an employee of either the
corporation with respect to whose stock the option has been issued or of such
corporation's successor entity.
      (5)   (a)    An employee is not relieved from liability for a tax by the
failure of the employer, agent of an employer, or other payer to withhold the
tax as required under this chapter or by the employer's, agent's, or other
payer's exemption from the requirement to withhold the tax.
         (b)    The failure of an employer, agent of an employer, or other
payer to remit to the Municipality the tax withheld relieves the employee from
liability for that tax unless the employee colluded with the employer, agent,
or other payer in connection with the failure to remit the tax withheld.
      (6)    Compensation deferred before June 26, 2003, is not subject to the
Municipality income tax or income tax withholding requirement to the extent the
deferred compensation does not constitute qualifying wages at the time the
deferred compensation is paid or distributed.
      (7)    Each employer, agent of an employer, or other payer required to
withhold taxes is liable for the payment of that amount required to be
withheld, whether or not such taxes have been withheld, and such amount shall
be deemed to be held in trust for the Municipality until such time as the
withheld amount is remitted to the Tax Administrator.
      (8)    On or before the last day of February of each year, an employer
shall file a withholding reconciliation return with the Tax Administrator
listing:
         (a)    The names, addresses, and social security numbers of all
employees from whose qualifying wages tax was withheld or should have been
withheld for the Municipality during the preceding calendar year;

the total amount of qualifying wages paid to such employee during the preceding
calendar year;
         (c)    The name of every other municipal corporation for which tax was
withheld or should have been withheld from such employee during the preceding
calendar year;
         (d)    Any other information required for federal income tax reporting

respect to such employee;
         (e)    Other information as may be required by the Tax Administrator.
      (9)    The officer or the employee of the employer, agent of an employer,
or other payer with control or direct supervision of or charged with the
responsibility for withholding the tax or filing the reports and making
payments as required by this section, shall be personally liable for a failure
to file a report or pay the tax due as required by this section. The
dissolution of an employer, agent of an employer, or other payer does not
discharge the officer's or employee's liability for a failure of the employer,
agent of an employer, or other payer to file returns or pay any tax due.
      (10)    An employer is required to deduct and withhold the Municipality
income tax on tips and gratuities received by the employer's employees and
constituting qualifying wages, but only to the extent that the tips and
gratuities are under the employer's control. For the purposes of this division,
a tip or gratuity is under the employer's control if the tip or gratuity is
paid by the customer to the employer for subsequent remittance to the employee,
or if the customer pays the tip or gratuity by credit card, debit card, or
other electronic means.
      (11)    The Tax Administrator shall consider any tax withheld by an
employer at the request of an employee, when such tax is not otherwise required
to be withheld by this chapter, to be tax required to be withheld and remitted
for the purposes of this section
Occasional Entrant - Withholding.

employee is required to report for employment duties on a regular and ordinary
basis. If the employee is not required to report for employment duties on a
regular and ordinary basis to a fixed location, "principal place of work" means
the worksite location in this state to which the employee is required to report

behalf of the employer, but instead there are two or more municipal
corporations in which the employee spent an identical number of days that is
greater than the number of days the employee spent in any other municipal
corporation, the employer shall allocate any of the employee's qualifying wages
subject to division (C)(2)(a)(i) of this section among those two or more
municipal corporations. The allocation shall be made using any fair and
reasonable method, including, but not limited to, an equal allocation among
such municipal corporations or an allocation based upon the time spent or sales
made by the employee in each such municipal corporation. A municipal
corporation to which qualifying wages are allocated under this division shall
be the employee's "principal place of work" with respect to those qualifying
wages for the purposes of this section.
For the purposes of this division, the location at which an employee spends a
particular day shall be determined in accordance with division (C)(2)(b) of
this section, except that "location" shall be substituted for "municipal

temporary worksite in this state at which the employer provides services for
more than 20 days during the calendar year. "Worksite location" does not

section, an employer is not required to withhold the Municipality income tax on
qualifying wages paid to an employee for the performance of personal services

on 20 or fewer days in a calendar year, unless one of the following conditions
applies:
            (i)    The employee's principal place of work is located in the
Municipality.
            (ii)    The employee performed services at one or more presumed
worksite locations in the Municipality. For the purposes of this division,
"presumed worksite location" means a construction site or other temporary
worksite in the Municipality at which the employer provides or provided
services that can reasonably be, or would have been, expected by the employer
to last more than 20 days in a calendar year. Services can "reasonably be
expected by the employer to last more than 20 days" if either of the following
applies at the time the services commence:
               (a)    The nature of the services are such that it will require
more than 20 days of the services to complete the services;
               (b)    The agreement between the employer and its customer to
perform services at a location requires the employer to perform the services at
the location for more than 20 days.
            (iii)    The employee is a resident of the Municipality and has
requested that the employer withhold tax from the employee's qualifying wages
as provided in Section
172.04.
            (iv)    The employee is a professional athlete, professional
entertainer, or public figure, and the qualifying wages are paid for the
performance of services in the employee's capacity as a professional athlete,
professional entertainer, or public figure.
         (b)    For the purposes of division (C)(2)(a) of this section, an
employee shall be considered to have spent a day performing services in the
Municipality only if the employee spent more time performing services for or on
behalf of the employer in the Municipality than in any other municipal
corporation on that day. For the purposes of determining the amount of time an
employee spent in a particular location, the time spent performing one or more
of the following activities shall be considered to have been spent at the
employee's principal place of work:
            (i)    Traveling to the location at which the employee will first
perform services for the employer for the day;
            (ii)    Traveling from a location at which the employee was
performing services for the employer to any other location;
            (iii)    Traveling from any location to another location in order
to pick up or load, for the purpose of transportation or delivery, property
that has been purchased, sold, assembled, fabricated, repaired, refurbished,
processed, remanufactured, or improved by the employee's employer;
            (iv)    Transporting or delivering property described in division
(C)(2)(b)(iii) of this section, provided that, upon delivery of the property,
the employee does not temporarily or permanently affix the property to real
estate owned, used, or controlled by a person other than the employee's
employer;
            (v)    Traveling from the location at which the employee makes the
employee's final delivery or pick-up for the day to either the employee's
principal place of work or a location at which the employee will not perform
services for the employer.
      (3)    If the principal place of work of an employee is located in
another Ohio municipal corporation that imposes an income tax, the exception
from withholding requirements described in division (C)(2)(a) of this section
shall apply only if, with respect to the employee's qualifying wages described
in that division, the employer withholds and remits tax on such qualifying
wages to that municipal corporation.
      (4)   (a)    Except as provided in division (C)(4)(b) of this section,
if, during a calendar year, the number of days an employee spends performing
personal services in the Municipality exceeds the 20-day threshold, the
employer shall withhold and remit tax to the Municipality for any subsequent
days in that calendar year on which the employer pays qualifying wages to the
employee for personal services performed in the Municipality.
         (b)    An employer required to begin withholding tax for the
Municipality under division (C)(4)(a) of this section may elect to withhold tax
for the Municipality for the first 20 days on which the employer paid
qualifying wages to the employee for personal services performed in the
Municipality.
      (5)    If an employer's fixed location is the Municipality and the
employer qualifies as a small employer as defined in Section
172.02, the employer shall withhold municipal income tax on all of the
employee's qualifying wages for a taxable year and remit that tax only to the
Municipality, regardless of the number of days which the employee worked
outside the corporate boundaries of the Municipality.
To determine whether an employer qualifies as a small employer for a taxable
year, the employer will be required to provide the Tax Administrator with the
employer's federal income tax return for the preceding taxable year.
      (6)    Divisions (C)(2)(a) and (4) of this section shall not apply to the
extent that a Tax Administrator and an employer enter into an agreement
regarding the manner in which the employer shall comply with the requirements
of Section
172.04. 
(Ord. 2015-3785.  Passed 9-17-15.)
   172.05  ANNUAL RETURN; FILING.
   (A)    An annual Municipal income tax return shall be completed and filed by
every individual taxpayer eighteen (18) years of age or older and any taxpayer
that is not an individual for each taxable year for which the taxpayer is
subject to the tax, whether or not a tax is due thereon.  Individual taxpayers
under eighteen (18) years of age are required to file a Municipal income tax
return only for years tax is due.
      (1)     The Tax Administrator may accept on behalf of all nonresident
individual taxpayers a return filed by an employer, agent of an employer, or
other payer under Section
172.05 of this chapter when the nonresident individual taxpayer's sole income
subject to the tax is the qualifying wages reported by the employer, agent of
an employer, or other payer, and no additional tax is due the Municipality.
      (2)     Retirees having no Municipal Taxable Income for the Municipality
income tax purposes may file with the Tax Administrator a written exemption
from these filing requirements on a form prescribed by the Tax Administrator. 
The written exemption shall indicate the date of retirement and the entity from
which retired.  The exemption shall be in effect until such time as the retiree
receives Municipal Taxable Income taxable to the Municipality, at which time
the retiree shall be required to comply with all applicable provisions of this
chapter.
   (B)    If an individual is deceased, any return or notice required of that
individual shall be completed and filed by that decedent's executor,
administrator, or other person charged with the property of that decedent.
   (C)    If an individual is unable to complete and file a return or notice
required by the Municipality, the return or notice required of that individual
shall be completed and filed by the individual's duly authorized agent,
guardian, conservator, fiduciary, or other person charged with the care of the
person or property of that individual.
   (D)    Returns or notices required of an estate or a trust shall be
completed and filed by the fiduciary of the estate or trust.
   (E)    The Municipality shall permit spouses to file a joint return.
   (F)   (1)    Each return required to be filed under this division shall
contain the signature of the taxpayer or the taxpayer's duly authorized agent
and of the person who prepared the return for the taxpayer.  The return shall
include the taxpayer's social security number or taxpayer identification
number. Each return shall be verified by a declaration under penalty of
perjury.
      (2)    The Tax Administrator shall require a taxpayer who is an
individual to include, with each annual return and amended return, copies of
the following documents: all of the taxpayer's Internal Revenue Service form W-
2, "Wage and Tax Statements," including all information reported on the
taxpayer's federal W-2, as well as taxable wages reported or withheld for any
municipal corporation; the taxpayer's Internal Revenue Service form 1040; and,
with respect to an amended tax return, any other documentation necessary to
support the adjustments made in the amended return. An individual taxpayer who
files the annual return required by this section electronically is not required
to provide paper copies of any of the foregoing to the Tax Administrator unless
the Tax Administrator requests such copies after the return has been filed.
      (3)    The Tax Administrator may require a taxpayer that is not an
individual to include, with each annual net profit return, amended net profit
return, or request for refund required under this section, copies of only the
following documents: the taxpayer's Internal Revenue Service form 1041, form
1065, form 1120, form 1120-REIT, form 1120F, or form 1120S, and, with respect
to an amended tax return or refund request, any other documentation necessary
to support the refund request or the adjustments made in the amended return.
A taxpayer that is not an individual and that files an annual net profit return
electronically through the Ohio Business Gateway or in some other manner shall
either mail the documents required under this division to the Tax Administrator
at the time of filing or, if electronic submission is available, submit the
documents electronically through the Ohio Business Gateway.
      (4)    After a taxpayer files a tax return, the Tax Administrator may
request, and the taxpayer shall provide, any information, statements, or
documents required by the Municipality to determine and verify the taxpayer's
municipal income tax liability. The requirements imposed under division (F) of
this section apply regardless of whether the taxpayer files on a generic form
or on a form prescribed by the Tax Administrator.
   (G)   (1)    Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, each return
required to be filed under this section shall be completed and filed as
required by the Tax Administrator on or before the date prescribed for the
filing of state individual income tax returns under division (G) of Section
5747.08 of the ORC. The taxpayer shall complete and file the return or notice
on forms prescribed by the Tax Administrator or on generic forms, together with
remittance made payable to the Municipality. No remittance is required if the
net amount is due is ten dollars or less.
      (2)    Any taxpayer that has duly requested an automatic six-month
extension for filing the taxpayer's federal income tax return shall
automatically receive an extension for the filing of the Municipality's income
tax return. The extended due date of the Municipality's income tax return shall
be the 15th day of the tenth month after the last day of the taxable year to
which the return relates. An extension of time to file under this division is
not an extension of the time to pay any tax due unless the Tax Administrator
grants an extension of that date.
         (a)    A copy of the federal extension request shall be included with
the filing of the Municipality's income tax return.
         (b)    A taxpayer that has not requested or received a six-month
extension for filing the taxpayer's federal income tax return may request that
the Tax Administrator grant the taxpayer a six-month extension of the date for
filing the taxpayer's the Municipality income tax return.  If the request is
received by the Tax Administrator on or before the date the Municipality income
tax return is due, the Tax Administrator shall grant the taxpayer's requested
extension.
      (3)    If the tax commissioner extends for all taxpayers the date for
filing state income tax returns under division (G) of Section 5747.08 of the
ORC, a taxpayer shall automatically receive an extension for the filing of the
Municipality's income tax return. The extended due date of the Municipality's
income tax return shall be the same as the extended due date of the state
income tax return.
      (4)    If the Tax Administrator considers it necessary in order to ensure
the payment of the tax imposed by the Municipality, the Tax Administrator may
require taxpayers to file returns and make payments otherwise than as provided
in this division, including taxpayers not otherwise required to file annual
returns.
      (5)    To the extent that any provision in this division (G) of this
section conflicts with any provision in divisions (N), (O), (P), or (Q) of this
section, the provisions in divisions (N), (O), (P), or (Q) prevail.
   (H)   (1)    For taxable years beginning after 2015, the Municipality shall
not require a taxpayer to remit tax with respect to net profits if the net
amount due is ten dollars or less.
      (2)    Any taxpayer not required to remit tax to the Municipality for a
taxable year pursuant to division (H)(1) of this section shall file with the
Municipality an annual net profit return under division (F)(3) of this section.
   (I)    If a payment is required to be made by electronic funds transfer, the
payment is considered to be made when the payment is credited to an account
designated by the Tax Administrator for the receipt of tax payments, except
that, when a payment made by electronic funds transfer is delayed due to
circumstances not under the control of the taxpayer, the payment is considered
to be made when the taxpayer submitted the payment. This division shall not
apply to payments required to be made under division (B)(1)(a) of Section
172.04 or provisions for semi-monthly withholding.
   (J)    Taxes withheld for the Municipality by an employer, the agent of an
employer, or other payer as described in Section
172.04 shall be allowed to the taxpayer as credits against payment of the tax
imposed on the taxpayer by the Municipality, unless the amounts withheld were
not remitted to the Municipality and the recipient colluded with the employer,
agent, or other payer in connection with the failure to remit the amounts
withheld.
   (K)    Each return required by the Municipality to be filed in accordance
with this division shall include a box that the taxpayer may check to authorize
another person, including a tax return preparer who prepared the return, to
communicate with the Tax Administrator about matters pertaining to the return.
   (L)    The Tax Administrator shall accept for filing a generic form of any
income tax return, report, or document required by the Municipality, provided
that the generic form, once completed and filed, contains all of the
information required by ordinance, resolution, or rules and regulations adopted
by the Municipality or the Tax Administrator, and provided that the taxpayer or
tax return preparer filing the generic form otherwise complies with the
provisions of this chapter and of the Municipality's ordinance, resolution, or
rules and regulations governing the filing of returns, reports, or documents.
   Filing via Ohio Business Gateway.
   (M)   (1)    Any taxpayer subject to municipal income taxation with respect
to the taxpayer's net profit from a business or profession may file the
Municipality's income tax return, estimated municipal income tax return, or
extension for filing a municipal income tax return, and may make payment of
amounts shown to be due on such returns, by using the Ohio Business Gateway.
      (2)    Any employer, agent of an employer, or other payer may report the
amount of municipal income tax withheld from qualifying wages, and may make
remittance of such amounts, by using the Ohio Business Gateway.
      (3)    Nothing in this section affects the due dates for filing employer
withholding tax returns.
Extension for service in or for the armed forces.
   (N)    Each member of the national guard of any state and each member of a
reserve component of the armed forces of the United States called to active
duty pursuant to an executive order issued by the president of the United
States or an act of the congress of the United States, and each civilian
serving as support personnel in a combat zone or contingency operation in
support of the armed forces, may apply to the Tax Administrator of the
Municipality for both an extension of time for filing of the return and an
extension of time for payment of taxes required by the Municipality during the
period of the member's or civilian's duty service, and for 180 days thereafter.
The application shall be filed on or before the one hundred eightieth day after
the member's or civilian's duty terminates. An applicant shall provide such
evidence as the Tax Administrator considers necessary to demonstrate
eligibility for the extension.
   (O)   (1)    If the Tax Administrator ascertains that an applicant is
qualified for an extension under this section, the Tax Administrator shall
enter into a contract with the applicant for the payment of the tax in
installments that begin on the 181st day after the applicant's active duty or
service terminates. The Tax Administrator may prescribe such contract terms as
the Tax Administrator considers appropriate.  However, taxes pursuant to a
contract entered into under this division are not delinquent, and the Tax
Administrator shall not require any payments of penalties or interest in
connection with those taxes for the extension period. 
      (2)    If the Tax Administrator determines that an applicant is qualified
for an extension under this section, the applicant shall neither be required to
file any return, report, or other tax document nor be required to pay any tax
otherwise due to the municipal corporation before the 181st day after the
applicant's active duty or service terminates.
      (3)     Taxes paid pursuant to a contract entered into under (O)(1) of
this division are not delinquent. The Tax Administrator shall not require any
payments of penalties or interest in connection with those taxes for the
extension period. 
   (P)   (1)    Nothing in this division denies to any person described in this
division the application of divisions (N) and (O) of this section.
      (2)   (a)    A qualifying taxpayer who is eligible for an extension under
the Internal Revenue Code shall receive both an extension of time in which to
file any return, report, or other tax document and an extension of time in
which to make any payment of taxes required by a municipal corporation in
accordance with this chapter. The length of any extension granted under
division (P)(2)(a) of this section shall be equal to the length of the
corresponding extension that the taxpayer receives under the Internal Revenue
Code. As used in this division, "qualifying taxpayer" means a member of the
national guard or a member of a reserve component of the armed forces of the
United States called to active duty pursuant to either an executive order
issued by the president of the United States or an act of the congress of the
United States, or a civilian serving as support personnel in a combat zone or
contingency operation in support of the armed forces.
         (b)    Taxes whose payment is extended in accordance with division (P)
(2)(a) of this section are not delinquent during the extension period. Such
taxes become delinquent on the first day after the expiration of the extension
period if the taxes are not paid prior to that date. The Tax Administrator
shall not require any payment of penalties or interest in connection with those
taxes for the extension period. The Tax Administrator shall not include any
period of extension granted under division (P)(2)(a) of this section in
calculating the penalty or interest due on any unpaid tax.
   (Q)    For each taxable year to which division (N), (O), or (P) of this
section applies to a taxpayer, the provisions of divisions (O)(2) and (3) of
this section, as applicable, apply to the spouse of that taxpayer if the filing
status of the spouse and the taxpayer is married filing jointly for that year.
Consolidated municipal income tax return.
   (R)    As used in this section:
      (1)    "Affiliated group of corporations" means an affiliated group as
defined in Section 1504 of the Internal Revenue Code, except that, if such a
group includes at least one incumbent local exchange carrier that is primarily
engaged in the business of providing local exchange telephone service in this
state, the affiliated group shall not include any incumbent local exchange
carrier that would otherwise be included in the group.
      (2)    "Consolidated federal income tax return" means a consolidated
return filed for federal income tax purposes pursuant to Section 1501 of the
Internal Revenue Code.
      (3)    "Consolidated federal taxable income" means the consolidated
taxable income of an affiliated group of corporations, as computed for the
purposes of filing a consolidated federal income tax return, before
consideration of net operating losses or special deductions. "Consolidated
federal taxable income" does not include income or loss of an incumbent local
exchange carrier that is excluded from the affiliated group under division (R)
(1) of this section.
      (4)    "Incumbent local exchange carrier" has the same meaning as in
Section 4927.01 of the ORC.
      (5)    "Local exchange telephone service" has the same meaning as in
Section 5727.01 of the ORC.
         (Ord. 2015-3785.  Passed 9-17-15.)
   (S)   (1)    For taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 2016, a
taxpayer that is a member of an affiliated group of corporations may elect to
file a consolidated municipal income tax return for a taxable year if at least
one member of the affiliated group of corporations is subject to the
Municipality's income tax in that taxable year, and if the affiliated group of
corporations filed a consolidated federal income tax return with respect to
that taxable year. The election is binding for a five-year period beginning
with the first taxable year of the initial election unless a change in the
reporting method is required under federal law. The election continues to be
binding for each subsequent five-year period unless the taxpayer elects to
discontinue filing consolidated municipal income tax returns under division (S)
(2) of this section or a taxpayer receives permission from the Tax
Administrator. The Tax Administrator shall approve such a request for good
cause shown. 
      (2)    An election to discontinue filing consolidated municipal income
tax returns under this section must be made in the first year following the
last year of a five-year consolidated municipal income tax return election
period in effect under division (S)(1) of this section. The election to
discontinue filing a consolidated municipal income tax return is binding for a
five-year period beginning with the first taxable year of the election.
      (3)    An election made under division (S)(1) or (2) of this section is
binding on all members of the affiliated group of corporations subject to a
municipal income tax.
      (4)   When a taxpayer makes the election allowed under section 718.80 of
the Revised Code, a valid election made by a taxpayer under division (S)(1) or
(2) of this section is binding upon the tax commissioner for the remainder of
the five-year period.
      (5)   When an election is made under section 718.80 of the Revised Code
is terminated, a valid election made under section 718.86 of the Revised Code
is binding upon the tax administrator for the remainder of the five-year
period.  (Ord. 2018-3888.  Passed 3-15-18.)
   (T)    A taxpayer that is a member of an affiliated group of corporations
that filed a consolidated federal income tax return for a taxable year shall
file a consolidated Municipality income tax return for that taxable year if the
Tax Administrator determines, by a preponderance of the evidence, that
intercompany transactions have not been conducted at arm's length and that
there has been a distortive shifting of income or expenses with regard to
allocation of net profits to the Municipality. A taxpayer that is required to
file a consolidated Municipality income tax return for a taxable year shall
file a consolidated Municipality income tax return for all subsequent taxable
years, unless the taxpayer requests and receives written permission from the
Tax Administrator to file a separate return or a taxpayer has experienced a
change in circumstances.
   (U)    A taxpayer shall prepare a consolidated Municipality income tax
return in the same manner as is required under the United States department of
treasury regulations that prescribe procedures for the preparation of the
consolidated federal income tax return required to be filed by the common
parent of the affiliated group of which the taxpayer is a member.
   (V)   (1)    Except as otherwise provided in divisions (V)(2), (3), and (4)
of this section, corporations that file a consolidated municipal income tax
return shall compute adjusted federal taxable income, as defined in Section
172.02, by substituting "consolidated federal taxable income" for "federal
taxable income" wherever "federal taxable income" appears in that division and
by substituting "an affiliated group of corporation's" for "a C corporation's"
wherever "a C corporation's" appears in that division.
      (2)    No corporation filing a consolidated Municipality income tax
return shall make any adjustment otherwise required under Section (2)(C)(1) to
the extent that the item of income or deduction otherwise subject to the
adjustment has been eliminated or consolidated in the computation of
consolidated federal taxable income.
      (3)    If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having at least
eighty percent (80%) of the value of its ownership interest owned or
controlled, directly or indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is
included in that affiliated group's consolidated federal taxable income for a
taxable year, the corporation filing a consolidated Municipality income tax
return shall do one of the following with respect to that pass-through entity's
net profit or loss for that taxable year:
         (a)    Exclude the pass-through entity's net profit or loss from the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purpose of making the computations required in divisions (R) through (Y) of
Section
172.05, exclude the property, payroll, and gross receipts of the pass-through
entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit sitused to a
municipal corporation. If the entity's net profit or loss is so excluded, the
entity shall be subject to taxation as a separate taxpayer on the basis of the
entity's net profits that would otherwise be included in the consolidated
federal taxable income of the affiliated group.
         (b)    Include the pass-through entity's net profit or loss in the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purpose of making the computations required in divisions (R) through (Y) of
Section
172.05, include the property, payroll, and gross receipts of the pass-through
entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit sitused to a
municipal corporation. If the entity's net profit or loss is so included, the
entity shall not be subject to taxation as a separate taxpayer on the basis of
the entity's net profits that are included in the consolidated federal taxable
income of the affiliated group.
      (4)    If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having less
than eighty percent (80%) of the value of its ownership interest owned or
controlled, directly or indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is
included in that affiliated group's consolidated federal taxable income for a
taxable year, all of the following shall apply:
         (a)    The corporation filing the consolidated municipal income tax
return shall exclude the pass-through entity's net profit or loss from the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purposes of making the computations required in divisions (R) through (Y) of
Section
172.05, exclude the property, payroll, and gross receipts of the pass-through
entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit sitused to the
Municipality;
         (b)    The pass-through entity shall be subject to the Municipality
income taxation as a separate taxpayer in accordance with this chapter on the
basis of the entity's net profits that would otherwise be included in the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group.
   (W)    Corporations filing a consolidated Municipality income tax return
shall make the computations required under divisions (R) through (Y) of Section
172.05 by substituting "consolidated federal taxable income attributable to"
for "net profit from" wherever "net profit from" appears in that section and by
substituting "affiliated group of corporations" for "taxpayer" wherever
"taxpayer" appears in that section.
   (X)    Each corporation filing a consolidated Municipality income tax return
is jointly and severally liable for any tax, interest, penalties, fines,
charges, or other amounts imposed by the Municipality in accordance with this
chapter on the corporation, an affiliated group of which the corporation is a
member for any portion of the taxable year, or any one or more members of such
an affiliated group.
   (Y)    Corporations and their affiliates that made an election or entered
into an agreement with the Municipality before January 1, 2016, to file a
consolidated or combined tax return with the Municipality may continue to file
consolidated or combined tax returns in accordance with such election or
agreement for taxable years beginning on and after January 1, 2016.
(Ord. 2015-3785.  Passed 9-17-15.)
   172.06  CREDIT FOR TAX PAID TO OTHER MUNICIPALITIES.
   (A)    Every individual taxpayer domiciled in the Municipality who is
required to and does pay, or has acknowledged liability for, a municipal tax to
another municipality on or measured by the same income, qualifying wages,
commissions, net profits or other compensation taxable under this chapter, may
claim a nonrefundable credit against the tax imposed by this chapter upon
satisfactory evidence that tax has been paid to another municipality.  Subject
to division (C) of this section, the credit shall not exceed one hundred
percent (100%) of the amount obtained by multiplying the income, qualifying
wages, commissions, net profits or other compensation subject to tax in the
other municipality by the lower of the tax rate in such other Municipality or
the tax rate imposed under this chapter. 
   (B)     The Municipality shall grant a credit against its tax on income to a
resident of the Municipality who works in a joint economic development zone
created under Section 715.691 or a joint economic development district created
under Section 715.70, 715.71, or 715.72 of the ORC to the same extent that it
grants a credit against its tax on income to its residents who are employed in
another municipal corporation.
   (C)     If the amount of tax withheld or paid to the other municipality is
less than the amount of tax required to be withheld or paid to the other
municipality, then for purposes of division (A) of this section, "the income,
qualifying wages, commissions, net profits or other compensation" subject to
tax in the other municipality shall be limited to the amount computed by
dividing the tax withheld or paid to the other municipality by the tax rate for
that municipality. 
   (D)     Intentionally left blank.
(Ord. 2015-3785.  Passed 9-17-15.)
   172.07  ESTIMATED TAXES.
   (A)    As used in this section:
      (1)    "Estimated taxes" means the amount that the taxpayer reasonably
estimates to be the taxpayer's tax liability for the Municipality's income tax
for the current taxable year.
      (2)    "Tax liability" means the total taxes due to the Municipality for
the taxable year, after allowing any credit to which the taxpayer is entitled,
and after applying any estimated tax payment, withholding payment, or credit
from another taxable year.
   (B)   (1)    Every taxpayer shall make a declaration of estimated taxes for
the current taxable year, on the form prescribed by the Tax Administrator, if
the amount payable as estimated taxes is at least $200. For the purposes of
this section:
         (a)    Taxes withheld for the Municipality from qualifying wages shall
be considered as paid to the  Municipality in equal amounts on each payment
date unless the taxpayer establishes the dates on which all amounts were
actually withheld, in which case they shall be considered as paid on the dates
on which the amounts were actually withheld.
         (b)    An overpayment of tax applied as a credit to a subsequent
taxable year is deemed to be paid on the date of the postmark stamped on the
cover in which the payment is mailed or, if the payment is made by electronic

      (3)    The declaration of estimated taxes shall be filed on or before the
date prescribed for the filing of municipal income tax returns under division

172.05 or on or before the fifteenth (15th) day of the fourth month after the
taxpayer becomes subject to tax for the first time.
      (4)    Taxpayers reporting on a fiscal year basis shall file a
declaration on or before the fifteenth (15th) day of the fourth month after the

   (C)   (1)    The required portion of the tax liability for the taxable year
that shall be paid through estimated taxes made payable to the Municipality,
including the application of tax refunds to estimated taxes and withholding on
or before the applicable payment date, shall be as follows:
         (a)    On or before the fifteenth (15th) day of the fourth month after
the beginning of the taxable year, twenty-two and one-half percent (22.5%) of
the tax liability for the taxable year;
         (b)    On or before the fifteenth (15th) day of the sixth month after
the beginning of the taxable year, forty-five percent (45%) of the tax
liability for the taxable year;
         (c)    On or before the fifteenth (15th) day of the ninth month after
the beginning of the taxable year, sixty-seven and one-half percent (67.5%) of
the tax liability for the taxable year;
         (d)    For an individual, on or before the fifteenth (15th) day of the
first month of the following taxable year, ninety percent (90%) of the tax
liability for the taxable year.  For a person other than an individual, on or
before the fifteenth (15th) day of the twelfth month of the taxable year,
ninety percent (90%) of the tax liability for the taxable year.  (Ord. 2017-
3874.  Passed 12-7-17.)
      (2)    When an amended declaration has been filed, the unpaid balance
shown due on the amended declaration shall be paid in equal installments on or
before the remaining payment dates.
      (3)    On or before the fifteenth (15th) day of the fourth month of the
year following that for which the declaration or amended declaration was filed,
an annual return shall be filed and any balance which may be due shall be paid
with the return in accordance with Section 718.05 of the ORC.
   (D)   (1)    In the case of any underpayment of any portion of a tax
liability, penalty and interest may be imposed pursuant to Section
172.18 upon the amount of underpayment for the period of underpayment, unless
the underpayment is due to reasonable cause as described in division (E) of
this section. The amount of the underpayment shall be determined as follows:
         (a)    For the first payment of estimated taxes each year, twenty-two
and one-half percent (22.5%) of the tax liability, less the amount of taxes
paid by the date prescribed for that payment;
         (b)    For the second payment of estimated taxes each year, forty-five
percent (45%) of the tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by the date

prescribed for that payment.
      (2)    The period of the underpayment shall run from the day the
estimated payment was required to be made to the date on which the payment is
made. For purposes of this section, a payment of estimated taxes on or before
any payment date shall be considered a payment of any previous underpayment
only to the extent the payment of estimated taxes exceeds the amount of the
payment presently required to be paid to avoid any penalty.
   (E)    An underpayment of any portion of tax liability determined under
division (D) of this section shall be due to reasonable cause and the penalty
imposed by this section shall not be added to the taxes for the taxable year if
any of the following apply:
      (1)    The amount of estimated taxes that were paid equals at least
ninety percent (90%) of the tax liability for the current taxable year,
determined by annualizing the income received during the year up to the end of
the month immediately preceding the month in which the payment is due.
      (2)    The amount of estimated taxes that were paid equals at least one
hundred percent (100%) of the tax liability shown on the return of the taxpayer
for the preceding taxable year, provided that the immediately preceding taxable
year reflected a period of twelve months and the taxpayer filed a return with
the Municipality under Section
172.05 for that year.
      (3)    The taxpayer is an individual who resides in the Municipality but
was not domiciled there on the first day of January of the calendar year that
includes the first day of the taxable year.
         (Ord. 2015-3785.  Passed 9-17-15.)
   172.08  ROUNDING OF AMOUNTS.
   A person may round to the nearest whole dollar all amounts the person is
required to enter on any return, report, voucher, or other document required
under this chapter. Any fractional part of a dollar that equals or exceeds
fifty cents shall be rounded to the next whole dollar, and any fractional part
of a dollar that is less than fifty cents shall be dropped. If a person chooses
to round amounts entered on a document, the person shall round all amounts
entered on the document.
(Ord. 2015-3785.  Passed 9-17-15.)
   172.09  REQUESTS FOR REFUNDS.
   (A)    As used in this section, "withholding tax" has the same meaning as in
Section
172.18.
   (B)    Upon receipt of a request for a refund, the Tax Administrator, in
accordance with this section, shall refund to employers, agents of employers,
other payers, or taxpayers, with respect to any income or withholding tax
levied by the municipal corporation:
      (1)    Overpayments of more than ten dollars or more;
      (2)    Amounts paid erroneously if the refund requested exceeds ten
dollars or more.
   (C)   (1)    Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, requests for
refund shall be filed with the Tax Administrator, on the form prescribed by the
Tax Administrator within three years after the tax was due or paid, whichever
is later. The Tax Administrator may require the requestor to file with the
request any documentation that substantiates the requestor's claim for a
refund.
      (2)    On filing of the refund request, the Tax Administrator shall
determine the amount of refund due and certify such amount to the appropriate
municipal corporation official for payment. Except as provided in division (C)
(3) of this section, the Tax Administrator shall issue an assessment to any
taxpayer whose request for refund is fully or partially denied. The assessment
shall state the amount of the refund that was denied, the reasons for the
denial, and instructions for appealing the assessment.
      (3)    If a Tax Administrator denies in whole or in part a refund request
included within the taxpayer's originally filed annual income tax return, the
Tax Administrator shall notify the taxpayer, in writing, of the amount of the
refund that was denied, the reasons for the denial, and instructions for
requesting an assessment that may be appealed under Section
172.21.
   (D)    A request for a refund that is received after the last day for filing
specified in division (C) of this section shall be considered to have been
filed in a timely manner if any of the following situations exist:
      (1)    The request is delivered by the postal service, and the earliest
postal service postmark on the cover in which the request is enclosed is not
later than the last day for filing the request.
      (2)    The request is delivered by the postal service, the only postmark
on the cover in which the request is enclosed was affixed by a private postal
meter, the date of that postmark is not later than the last day for filing the
request, and the request is received within seven days of such last day.
      (3)    The request is delivered by the postal service, no postmark date
was affixed to the cover in which the request is enclosed or the date of the
postmark so affixed is not legible, and the request is received within seven
days of the last day for making the request.
   (E)    Interest shall be allowed and paid on any overpayment by a taxpayer
of any municipal income tax obligation from the date of the overpayment until
the date of the refund of the overpayment, except that if any overpayment is
refunded within 90 days after the final filing date of the annual return or 90
days after the completed return is filed, whichever is later, no interest shall
be allowed on the refund. For the purpose of computing the payment of interest
on amounts overpaid, no amount of tax for any taxable year shall be considered
to have been paid before the date on which the return on which the tax is
reported is due, without regard to any extension of time for filing that
return. Interest shall be paid at the interest rate described in Section
172.18 (A)(4). 
(Ord. 2015-3785.  Passed 9-17-15.)
   172.10  SECOND MUNICIPALITY IMPOSING TAX AFTER TIME PERIOD ALLOWED FOR
REFUND.
   (A)    Income tax that has been deposited with the Municipality, but should
have been deposited with another municipality, is allowable by the Municipality
as a refund but is subject to the three-year limitation on refunds.
   (B)    Income tax that was deposited with another municipality but should
have been deposited with the Municipality is subject to recovery by the
Municipality.  If the Municipality's tax on that income is imposed after the
time period allowed for a refund of the tax or withholding paid to the other
municipality, the Municipality shall allow a nonrefundable credit against the
tax or withholding the Municipality claims is due with respect to such income
or wages, equal to the tax or withholding paid to the first municipality with
respect to such income or wages. 
   (C)    If the Municipality's tax rate is less than the tax rate in the other
municipality, then the nonrefundable credit shall be calculated using the
Municipality's tax rate.  However, if the Municipality's tax rate is greater
than the tax rate in the other municipality, the tax due in excess of the
nonrefundable credit is to be paid to the Municipality, along with any penalty
and interest that accrued during the period of nonpayment.
   (D)    Nothing in this section permits any credit carryforward.
(Ord. 2015-3785.  Passed 9-17-15.)
   172.11  AMENDED RETURNS.
   (A)   (1)    If a taxpayer's tax liability shown on the annual tax return
for the Municipality changes as a result of an adjustment to the taxpayer's
federal or state income tax return, the taxpayer shall file an amended return
with the Municipality. The amended return shall be filed on a form required by
the Tax Administrator.
      (2)    If a taxpayer intends to file an amended consolidated municipal
income tax return, or to amend its type of return from a separate return to a
consolidated return, based on the taxpayer's consolidated federal income tax
return, the taxpayer shall notify the Tax Administrator before filing the
amended return.
   (B)   (1)    In the case of an underpayment, the amended return shall be
accompanied by payment of any combined additional tax due, together with any
penalty and interest thereon. If the combined tax shown to be due is ten
dollars or less, no payment need be made. The amended return shall reopen those
facts, figures, computations, or attachments from a previously filed return
that are not affected, either directly or indirectly, by the adjustment to the
taxpayer's federal or state income tax return only:
         (i)    To determine the amount of tax that would be due if all facts,
figures, computations, and attachments were reopened; or,
         (ii)    If the applicable statute of limitations for civil actions or
prosecutions under Section
172.12 has not expired for a previously filed return.
      (2)    The additional tax to be paid shall not exceed the amount of tax
that would be due if all facts, figures, computations, and attachments were
reopened; i.e., the payment shall be the lesser of the two amounts.
   (C)   (1)    In the case of an overpayment, a request for refund may be
filed under this division within the period prescribed by division (E) of
Section
172.12 for filing the amended return, even if it is filed beyond the period
prescribed in that division if it otherwise conforms to the requirements of
that division. If the amount of the refund is less than ten dollars, no refund
need be paid by the Municipality. A request filed under this division shall
claim refund of overpayments resulting from alterations only to those facts,
figures, computations, or attachments required in the taxpayer's annual return
that are affected, either directly or indirectly, by the adjustment to the
taxpayer's federal or state income tax return, unless it is also filed within
the time prescribed in Section
172.09.
      (2)    The amount to be refunded shall not exceed the amount of refund
that would be due if all facts, figures, computations, and attachments were
reopened.  All facts, figures, computations, and attachments may be reopened to
determine the refund amount due by inclusion of all facts, figures,
computations, and attachments.
   (D)    Within 60 days after the final determination of any federal or state
tax liability affecting the taxpayer's the Municipality's tax liability, that
taxpayer shall make and file an amended the Municipality return showing income
subject to the Municipality income tax based upon such final determination of
federal or state tax liability. The taxpayer shall pay any additional the
Municipality income tax shown due thereon or make a claim for refund of any
overpayment, unless the tax or overpayment is less than ten dollars.
(Ord. 2015-3785.  Passed 9-17-15.)
   172.12  LIMITATIONS.
   (A)   (1)   (a)   Civil actions to recover municipal income taxes and
penalties and interest on municipal income taxes shall be brought within the
later of:
            (i)    Three years after the tax was due or the return was filed,
whichever is later; or
            (ii)    One year after the conclusion of the qualifying deferral
period, if any.
         (b)    The time limit described in division (A)(1)(a) of this section
may be extended at any time if both the Tax Administrator and the employer,
agent of the employer, other payer, or taxpayer consent in writing to the
extension. Any extension shall also extend for the same period of time the time
limit described in division (C) of this section.
      (2)    As used in this section, "qualifying deferral period" means a
period of time beginning and ending as follows:
         (a)    Beginning on the date a person who is aggrieved by an
assessment files with the Board of Tax Review the request described in Section
172.21. That date shall not be affected by any subsequent decision, finding, or
holding by any administrative body or court that the Board of Tax Review did
not have jurisdiction to affirm, reverse, or modify the assessment or any part
of that assessment.
         (b)    Ending the later of the sixtieth day after the date on which
the final determination of the Board of Tax Review becomes final or, if any
party appeals from the determination of the Board of Tax Review, the sixtieth
day after the date on which the final determination of the Board of Tax Review
is either ultimately affirmed in whole or in part or ultimately reversed and no
further appeal of either that affirmation, in whole or in part, or that
reversal is available or taken.
   (B)    Prosecutions for an offense made punishable under a resolution or
ordinance imposing an income tax shall be commenced within three years after
the commission of the offense, provided that in the case of fraud, failure to
file a return, or the omission of twenty-five percent (25%) or more of income
required to be reported, prosecutions may be commenced within six years after
the commission of the offense.
   (C)    A claim for a refund of municipal income taxes shall be brought
within the time limitation provided in Section
172.09.
   (D)   (1)    Notwithstanding the fact that an appeal is pending, the
petitioner may pay all or a portion of the assessment that is the subject of
the appeal. The acceptance of a payment by the Municipality does not prejudice
any claim for refund upon final determination of the appeal.
      (2)    If upon final determination of the appeal an error in the
assessment is corrected by the Tax Administrator, upon an appeal so filed or
pursuant to a final determination of the Board of Tax Review, of the Ohio board
of tax appeals, or any court to which the decision of the Ohio board of tax
appeals has been appealed, so that the resultant amount due is less than the
amount paid, a refund will be paid in the amount of the overpayment as provided
by Section
172.09, with interest on that amount as provided by division (E) of Section
172.09.
   (E)    No civil action to recover the Municipality income tax or related
penalties or interest shall be brought during either of the following time
periods:
      (1)    The period during which a taxpayer has a right to appeal the
imposition of that tax or interest or those penalties;
      (2)    The period during which an appeal related to the imposition of
that tax or interest or those penalties is pending.
         (Ord. 2015-3785.  Passed 9-17-15.)
   172.13  AUDITS.
   (A)    At or before the commencement of an audit, the Tax Administrator
shall provide to the taxpayer a written description of the roles of the Tax
Administrator and of the taxpayer during the audit and a statement of the
taxpayer's rights, including any right to obtain a refund of an overpayment of
a tax. At or before the commencement of an audit, the Tax Administrator shall
inform the taxpayer when the audit is considered to have commenced.
   (B)    Except in cases involving suspected criminal activity, the Tax
Administrator shall conduct an audit of a taxpayer during regular business
hours and after providing reasonable notice to the taxpayer. A taxpayer who is
unable to comply with a proposed time for an audit on the grounds that the
proposed time would cause inconvenience or hardship must offer reasonable
alternative dates for the audit.
   (C)    At all stages of an audit by the Tax Administrator, a taxpayer is
entitled to be assisted or represented by an attorney, accountant, bookkeeper,
or other tax practitioner. The Tax Administrator shall prescribe a form by
which a taxpayer may designate such a person to assist or represent the
taxpayer in the conduct of any proceedings resulting from actions by the Tax
Administrator. If a taxpayer has not submitted such a form, the Tax
Administrator may accept other evidence, as the Tax Administrator considers
appropriate, that a person is the authorized representative of a taxpayer.
   A taxpayer may refuse to answer any questions asked by the person conducting
an audit until the taxpayer has an opportunity to consult with the taxpayer's
attorney, accountant, bookkeeper, or other tax practitioner.
   This division does not authorize the practice of law by a person who is not
an attorney.
   (D)    A taxpayer may record, electronically or otherwise, the audit
examination.
   (E)    The failure of the Tax Administrator to comply with a provision of
this section shall neither excuse a taxpayer from payment of any taxes owed by
the taxpayer nor cure any procedural defect in a taxpayer's case.
   (F)    If the Tax Administrator fails to substantially comply with the
provisions of this section, the Tax Administrator, upon application by the
taxpayer, shall excuse the taxpayer from penalties and interest. 
(Ord. 2015-3785.  Passed 9-17-15.)
   172.14  SERVICE OF ASSESSMENT.
   (A)    As used in this section:
      (1)    "Last known address" means the address the Tax Administrator has
at the time a document is originally sent by certified mail, or any address the
Tax Administrator can ascertain using reasonable means such as the use of a
change of address service offered by the postal service or an authorized
delivery service under Section 5703.056 of the ORC.
      (2)    "Undeliverable address" means an address to which the postal
service or an authorized delivery service under Section 5703.056 of the ORC is
not able to deliver an assessment of the Tax Administrator, except when the
reason for non-delivery is because the addressee fails to acknowledge or accept
the assessment.
   (B)    Subject to division (C) of this section, a copy of each assessment
shall be served upon the person affected thereby either by personal service, by
certified mail, or by a delivery service authorized under Section 5703.056 of
the ORC.  With the permission of the person affected by an assessment, the Tax
Administrator may deliver the assessment through alternative means as provided
in this section, including, but not limited to, delivery by secure electronic
mail.
   (C)   (1)   (a)    If certified mail is returned because of an undeliverable
address, a Tax Administrator shall utilize reasonable means to ascertain a new
last known address, including the use of a change of address service offered by
the postal service or an authorized delivery service under Section 5703.056 of
the ORC. If the Tax Administrator is unable to ascertain a new last known
address, the assessment shall be sent by ordinary mail and considered served.
If the ordinary mail is subsequently returned because of an undeliverable
address, the assessment remains appealable within 60 days after the
assessment's postmark.
         (b)    Once the Tax Administrator or other Municipality official, or
the designee of either, serves an assessment on the person to whom the
assessment is directed, the person may protest the ruling of that assessment by
filing an appeal with the local board of tax review within 60 days after the
receipt of service. The delivery of an assessment of the Tax Administrator
under division (C)(1)(a) of this section is prima facie evidence that delivery
is complete and that the assessment is served.
      (2)    If mailing of an assessment by a Tax Administrator by certified
mail is returned for some cause other than an undeliverable address, the Tax
Administrator shall resend the assessment by ordinary mail. The assessment
shall show the date the Tax Administrator sends the assessment and include the
following statement:
"This assessment is deemed to be served on the addressee under applicable law
ten days from the date this assessment was mailed by the Tax Administrator as
shown on the assessment, and all periods within which an appeal may be filed
apply from and after that date."
Unless the mailing is returned because of an undeliverable address, the mailing
of that information is prima facie evidence that delivery of the assessment was
completed ten days after the Tax Administrator sent the assessment by ordinary
mail and that the assessment was served.
If the ordinary mail is subsequently returned because of an undeliverable
address, the Tax Administrator shall proceed under division (C)(1)(a) of this
section. A person may challenge the presumption of delivery and service under
this division in accordance with division (D) of this section.
   (D)   (1)    A person disputing the presumption of delivery and service
under division (C) of this section bears the burden of proving by a
preponderance of the evidence that the address to which the assessment was sent
by certified mail was not an address with which the person was associated at
the time the Tax Administrator originally mailed the assessment. For the
purposes of this section, a person is associated with an address at the time
the Tax Administrator originally mailed the assessment if, at that time, the
person was residing, receiving legal documents, or conducting business at the
address; or if, before that time, the person had conducted business at the
address and, when the assessment was mailed, the person's agent or the person's
affiliate was conducting business at the address. For the purposes of this
section, a person's affiliate is any other person that, at the time the
assessment was mailed, owned or controlled at least 20 percent, as determined
by voting rights, of the addressee's business.
      (2)    If a person elects to appeal an assessment on the basis described
in division (D)(1) of this section, and if that assessment is subject to
collection and is not otherwise appealable, the person must do so within 60
days after the initial contact by the Tax Administrator or other Municipality
official, or the designee of either, with the person. Nothing in this division
prevents the Tax Administrator or other official from entering into a
compromise with the person if the person does not actually file such an appeal
with the local board of tax review.
   (E)    Nothing in this section prohibits the Tax Administrator or the Tax
Administrator's designee from delivering an assessment by a Tax Administrator
by personal service.
   (F)    Collection actions taken upon any assessment being appealed under
division (C)(1)(b) of this section, including those on which a claim has been
delivered for collection, shall be stayed upon the pendency of an appeal under
this section.
   (G)    Additional regulations as detailed in the Rules and Regulations shall
apply.
(Ord. 2015-3785.  Passed 9-17-15.)
   172.15  ADMINISTRATION OF CLAIMS.
   (A)    As used in this section, "claim" means a claim for an amount payable
to the Municipality that arises pursuant to the Municipality's income tax
imposed in accordance with this chapter.
   (B)    Nothing in this chapter prohibits a Tax Administrator from doing
either of the following if such action is in the best interests of the
municipal corporation:
      (1)    Compromise a claim;
      (2)    Extend for a reasonable period the time for payment of a claim by
agreeing to accept monthly or other periodic payments.
   (C)    The Tax Administrator's rejection of a compromise or payment-over-
time agreement proposed by a person with respect to a claim shall not be
appealable.
   (D)    A compromise or payment-over-time agreement with respect to a claim
shall be binding upon and shall be to the benefit of only the parties to the
compromise or agreement, and shall not eliminate or otherwise affect the
liability of any other person.
   (E)    A compromise or payment-over-time agreement with respect to a claim
shall be void if the taxpayer defaults under the compromise or agreement or if
the compromise or agreement was obtained by fraud or by misrepresentation of a
material fact. Any amount that was due before the compromise or agreement and
that is unpaid shall remain due, and any penalties or interest that would have
accrued in the absence of the compromise or agreement shall continue to accrue
and be due. 
(Ord. 2015-3785.  Passed 9-17-15.)
   172.16  TAX INFORMATION CONFIDENTIAL.
   (A)    Any information gained as a result of returns, investigations,
hearings, or verifications required or authorized by this chapter is
confidential, and no person shall access or disclose such information except in
accordance with a proper judicial order or in connection with the performance
of that person's official duties or the official business of the Municipality
as authorized by this chapter. The Tax Administrator or a designee thereof may
furnish copies of returns filed or otherwise received under this chapter and
other related tax information to the internal revenue service, the tax
commissioner, and tax administrators of other municipal corporations.
   (B)    This section does not prohibit the Municipality from publishing or
disclosing statistics in a form that does not disclose information with respect
to particular taxpayers.
(Ord. 2015-3785.  Passed 9-17-15.)
   172.17  FRAUD.
   No person shall knowingly make, present, aid, or assist in the preparation
or presentation of a false or fraudulent report, return, schedule, statement,
claim, or document authorized or required by the Municipality ordinance or
state law to be filed with a the Tax Administrator, or knowingly procure,
counsel, or advise the preparation or presentation of such report, return,
schedule, statement, claim, or document, or knowingly change, alter, or amend,
or knowingly procure, counsel or advise such change, alteration, or amendment
of the records upon which such report, return, schedule, statement, claim, or
document is based with intent to defraud the Municipality or the Tax
Administrator.

agent, or other payer is required to withhold from an employee's qualifying
wages.

         (a)    Any return required to be filed under applicable law for

      (2)    This section does not apply to returns required to be filed or

the ordinances or rules and regulations, as adopted before January 1, 2016, of
the Municipality to which the return is to be filed or the payment is to be
made.  (Ord. 2017-3785.  Passed 9-17-15.)
   (C)    Should any taxpayer, employer, agent of the employer, or other payer
for any reason fails, in whole or in part, to make timely and full payment or

the Municipality may impose a penalty of $25 for each failure to timely file

   172.19  AUTHORITY OF TAX ADMINISTRATOR; VERIFICATION OF INFORMATION.
Authority.
   (A)    Nothing in this chapter shall limit the authority of the Tax
Administrator to perform any of the following duties or functions, unless the
performance of such duties or functions is expressly limited by a provision of
the ORC:
      (1)   (a)    Exercise all powers whatsoever of an query nature as
provided by law, including, the right to inspect books, accounts, records,
memorandums, and federal and state income tax returns, to examine persons under
oath, to issue orders or subpoenas for the production of books, accounts,
papers, records, documents, and testimony, to take depositions, to apply to a
court for attachment proceedings as for contempt, to approve vouchers for the
fees of officers and witnesses, and to administer oaths.
         (b)    The powers referred to in this division of this section shall
be exercised by the Tax Administrator only in connection with the performance
of the duties respectively assigned to the Tax Administrator under the
Municipality's income tax ordinance;
      (2)    Appoint agents and prescribe their powers and duties;
      (3)    Confer and meet with officers of other municipal corporations and
states and officers of the United States on any matters pertaining to their
respective official duties as provided by law;
      (4)    Exercise the authority provided by law, including orders from
bankruptcy courts, relative to remitting or refunding taxes, including
penalties and interest thereon, for any reason overpaid. In addition, the Tax
Administrator may investigate any claim of overpayment and, if the Tax
Administrator finds that there has been an overpayment, make a written
statement of the Tax Administrator's findings, and approve and issue a refund
payable to the taxpayer, the taxpayer's assigns, or legal representative as
provided in this chapter;
      (5)    Exercise the authority provided by law relative to consenting to

      (6)    Exercise the authority provided by law relative to the use of

172.03;
      (7)   (a)    Make all tax findings, determinations, computations, and

computations, or orders the Tax Administrator has made;
         (b)    If an appeal has been filed with the Board of Tax Review or
other appropriate tribunal, the Tax Administrator shall not review, re-
determine, or correct any tax finding, determination, computation, or order
which the Tax Administrator has made, unless such appeal or application is
withdrawn by the appellant or applicant, is dismissed, or is otherwise final;
      (8)    Destroy any or all returns or other tax documents in the manner
authorized by law;
      (9)    Enter into an agreement with a taxpayer to simplify the
withholding obligations described in Section
172.04.
Verification of accuracy of returns and determination of liability.
 
   (B)   (1)    A Tax Administrator, or any authorized agent or employee
thereof may examine the books, papers, records, and federal and state income
tax returns of any employer, taxpayer, or other person that is subject to, or
that the Tax Administrator believes is subject to, the provisions of this
chapter for the purpose of verifying the accuracy of any return made or, if no
return was filed, to ascertain the tax due under this chapter. Upon written
request by the Tax Administrator or a duly authorized agent or employee
thereof, every employer, taxpayer, or other person subject to this section is
required to furnish the opportunity for the Tax Administrator, authorized
agent, or employee to investigate and examine such books, papers, records, and
federal and state income tax returns at a reasonable time and place designated
in the request.
      (2)    The records and other documents of any taxpayer, employer, or
other person that is subject to, or that a Tax Administrator believes is
subject to, the provisions of this chapter shall be open to the Tax
Administrator's inspection during business hours and shall be preserved for a
period of six years following the end of the taxable year to which the records
or documents relate, unless the Tax Administrator, in writing, consents to
their destruction within that period, or by order requires that they be kept
longer. The Tax Administrator may require any person, by notice served on that
person, to keep such records as the Tax Administrator determines necessary to
show whether or not that person is liable, and the extent of such liability,
for the income tax levied by the Municipality or for the withholding of such
tax.
      (3)    The Tax Administrator may examine under oath any person that the
Tax Administrator reasonably believes has knowledge concerning any income that
was or would have been returned for taxation or any transaction tending to
affect such income. The Tax Administrator may, for this purpose, compel any
such person to attend a hearing or examination and to produce any books,
papers, records, and federal and state income tax returns in such person's
possession or control. The person may be assisted or represented by an
attorney, accountant, bookkeeper, or other tax practitioner at any such hearing
or examination. This division does not authorize the practice of law by a
person who is not an attorney.
      (4)    No person issued written notice by the Tax Administrator
compelling attendance at a hearing or examination or the production of books,
papers, records, or federal or state income tax returns under this section
shall fail to comply.
Identification information.
   (C)   (1)    Nothing in this chapter prohibits the Tax Administrator from
requiring any person filing a tax document with the Tax Administrator to
provide identifying information, which may include the person's social security
number, federal employer identification number, or other identification number
requested by the Tax Administrator. A person required by the Tax Administrator
to provide identifying information that has experienced any change with respect
to that information shall notify the Tax Administrator of the change before, or
upon, filing the next tax document requiring the identifying information.
      (2)   (a)   If the Tax Administrator makes a request for identifying
information and the Tax Administrator does not receive valid identifying
information within 30 days of making the request, nothing in this chapter
prohibits the Tax Administrator from imposing a penalty upon the person to whom
the request was directed pursuant to Section
172.18, in addition to any applicable penalty described in Section
172.99.
         (b)    If a person required by the Tax Administrator to provide
identifying information does not notify the Tax Administrator of a change with
respect to that information as required under division (C) of Section
172.19 within 30 days after filing the next tax document requiring such
identifying information, nothing in this chapter prohibits the Tax
Administrator from imposing a penalty pursuant to Section
172.18.
         (c)    The penalties provided for under divisions (C)(2)(a) and (b) of
this section may be billed and imposed in the same manner as the tax or fee
with respect to which the identifying information is sought and are in addition
to any applicable criminal penalties described in Section
172.99 for a violation of Section
172.17 and any other penalties that may be imposed by the Tax Administrator by
law.
            (Ord. 2015-3785.  Passed 9-17-15.)
   172.20  REQUEST FOR OPINION OF THE TAX ADMINISTRATOR.

this section with respect to prospective municipal income tax liability. It
does not include ordinary correspondence of the Tax Administrator.
   (B)    A taxpayer may submit a written request for an opinion of the Tax
Administrator in accordance with the Rules and Regulations.
   (C)    A taxpayer is not relieved of tax liability for any activity or
transaction related to a request for an opinion that contained any
misrepresentation or omission of one or more material facts.
   (D)    A Tax Administrator may refuse to offer an opinion on any request
received under this section.  Such refusal is not subject to appeal.   
   (E)    An opinion of the Tax Administrator binds the Tax Administrator only
with respect to the taxpayer for whom the opinion was prepared and does not
bind the Tax Administrator of any other municipal corporation.
   (F)    An opinion of the Tax Administrator issued under this section is not
subject to appeal. 
(Ord. 2015-3785.  Passed 9-17-15.)
   172.21  BOARD OF TAX REVIEW.
   (A)   (1)    The Board of Tax Review shall consist of three members. Two
members shall be appointed by the legislative authority of the Municipality,
but such appointees may not be employees, elected officials, or contractors
with the Municipality at any time during their term or in the five years
immediately preceding the date of appointment. One member shall be appointed by
the top administrative official of the Municipality. This member may be an
employee of the Municipality, but may not be the director of finance or
equivalent officer, or the Tax Administrator or other similar official or an
employee directly involved in municipal tax matters, or any direct subordinate
thereof.
      (2)    The term for members of the Board of Tax Review of the
Municipality shall be two years. There is no limit on the number of terms that
a member may serve if the member is reappointed by the legislative authority.
The board member appointed by the administrative official of the Municipality
shall serve at the discretion of the administrative official.
      (3)    Members of the Board of Tax Review appointed by the legislative
authority may be removed by the legislative authority by majority vote for
malfeasance, misfeasance, or nonfeasance in office. To remove such a member,
the legislative authority must give the member a copy of the charges against
the member and afford the member an opportunity to be publicly heard in person
or by counsel in the member's own defense upon not less than ten days' notice.
The decision by the legislative authority on the charges is final and not
appealable.
      (4)    A member of the Board of Tax Review who, for any reason, ceases to
meet the qualifications for the position prescribed by this section shall
resign immediately by operation of law.
      (5)    A vacancy in an unexpired term shall be filled in the same manner
as the original appointment within 60 days of when the vacancy was created. Any
member appointed to fill a vacancy occurring prior to the expiration of the
term for which the member's predecessor was appointed shall hold office for the
remainder of such term. No vacancy on the Board of Tax Review shall impair the
power and authority of the remaining members to exercise all the powers of the
Board of Tax Review.
      (6)    If a member is temporarily unable to serve on the Board of Tax
Review due to a conflict of interest, illness, absence, or similar reason, the
legislative authority or top administrative official that appointed the member
shall appoint another individual to temporarily serve on the Board of Tax
Review in the member's place. The appointment of such an individual shall be
subject to the same requirements and limitations as are applicable to the
appointment of the member temporarily unable to serve.
   (B)    Whenever a Tax Administrator issues an assessment, the Tax
Administrator shall notify the taxpayer in writing at the same time of the
taxpayer's right to appeal the assessment, the manner in which the taxpayer may
appeal the assessment, and the address to which the appeal should be directed.
   (C)    Any person who has been issued an assessment may appeal the
assessment to the Board of Tax Review by filing a request with the Board of Tax
Review. The request shall be in writing, shall specify the reason or reasons
why the assessment should be deemed incorrect or unlawful, and shall be filed
within 60 days after the taxpayer receives the assessment.
   (D)    The Board of Tax Review shall schedule a hearing to be held within 60
days after receiving an appeal of an assessment under division (C) of this
section, unless the taxpayer requests additional time to prepare or waives a
hearing. If the taxpayer does not waive the hearing, the taxpayer may appear
before the Board of Tax Review and may be represented by an attorney at law,
certified public accountant, or other representative. The Board of Tax Review
may allow a hearing to be continued as jointly agreed to by the parties. In
such a case, the hearing must be completed within 120 days after the first day
of the hearing unless the parties agree otherwise.
   (E)    The Board of Tax Review may affirm, reverse, or modify the Tax
Administrator's assessment or any part of that assessment. The Board of Tax
Review shall issue a final determination on the appeal within 90 days after the
Board of Tax Review's final hearing on the appeal, and send a copy of its final
determination by ordinary mail to all of the parties to the appeal within 15
days after issuing the final determination. The taxpayer or the Tax
Administrator may appeal the Board of Tax Review's final determination as
provided in Section 5717.011 of the ORC.
   (F)    The Board of Tax Review created pursuant to this section shall adopt
rules governing its procedures and shall keep a record of its transactions.
Such records are not public records available for inspection under Section
149.43 of the ORC. Hearings requested by a taxpayer before a Board of Tax
Review created pursuant to this section are not meetings of a public body
subject to Section 121.22 of the ORC.

   172.22  AUTHORITY TO CREATE RULES AND REGULATIONS.

residential real property in the Municipality.

if the vehicle is within a municipal corporation and the municipal corporation
has established a vehicle removal fee, the towing service shall give  the owner

owner written notice that if the owner disputes that the motor vehicle was
lawfully towed, the owner may be able to file a civil action under Ohio R.C.

subsection (d)(1)B. of this section, the owner of a motor vehicle that is
ordered into storage under subsection (a)(1) of this section may retrieve any
personal items from the motor vehicle without retrieving the vehicle and
without paying any fee.  However, a towing service or storage facility may
charge an after-hours retrieval fee established by the Public Utilities
Commission in rules adopted under Ohio R.C. 4921.25 if the owner retrieves the
personal items after hours, unless the towing service or storage facility fails
to provide the notice required under division (B)(3) of Ohio R.C. 4513.69, if
applicable.  The owner of a motor vehicle shall not do either of the following:
         A.   Retrieve any personal item that has been determined by the
sheriff or chief of police, as applicable, to be necessary to a criminal
investigation;
         B.   Retrieve any personal item from a vehicle if it would endanger
the safety of the owner unless the owner agrees to sign a waiver of liability.
For purposes of subsection (d)(2) of this section, “personal items” do not
include any items that are attached to the motor vehicle.
      (3)   If a motor vehicle that is ordered into storage pursuant to
subsection (a)(1) of this section remains unclaimed by the owner for thirty
days, the procedures established by Ohio R.C. 4513.61 and 4513.62 apply.

private tow-away zone, subject to the terms of the property owner.  If the
property is a commercial property, the owner of the private property may
include on the sign a statement that only customers may park in the private
tow-away zone.  In all cases, if it is not apparent which persons may park in
the private tow-away zone, the owner of the private property shall include on
the sign the address of the property on which the private tow-away zone is
located, or the name of the business that is located on the property designated

the owner of a private property may modify an existing sign by affixing to the
existing sign stickers or an addendum in lieu of replacing the sign.
      (2)   A towing service ensures that a vehicle towed under this section is
taken to a location from which it may be recovered that complies with all of
the following:

posted parking condition or regulation, the owner of the private property may
cause the removal of the vehicle by a towing service.  The towing service shall
remove the vehicle in accordance with this section.  The vehicle owner and the
operator of the vehicle are considered to have consented to the removal and
storage of the vehicle, to the payment of the applicable fees established by
the Public Service Commission in rules adopted under Ohio R.C. 4921.25, and to
the right of a towing service to obtain title to the vehicle if it remains

operators to be  licensed, no owner of a private property located within the
municipal corporation shall cause the removal and storage of any vehicle
pursuant to subsection (b) of this section by an unlicensed tow truck or
unlicensed tow truck operator.
      (3)   No towing service shall remove a vehicle from a private tow-away
zone except pursuant to a written contract for the removal of vehicles entered
into with the owner of the private property on which the private tow-away zone
is located.
   (c)   If the owner or operator of a vehicle that is being removed under
authority of subsection (b) of this section, arrives after the vehicle has been
prepared for removal, but prior to the actual removal from the property, the
towing service shall give the vehicle owner or operator oral or written
notification at the time of such arrival that the vehicle owner or operator may
pay a fee of not more than one-half of the fee for the removal of the vehicle
established by the Public Service Commission in rules adopted under Ohio R.C.
4921.25, in order to obtain release of the vehicle.  That fee may be paid by
use of a major credit card unless the towing service uses a mobile credit card
processor and mobile service is not available at the time of the  transaction. 
Upon payment of that fee, the towing service shall give the vehicle owner or
operator a receipt showing both the full amount normally assessed and the
actual amount received and shall release the vehicle to the owner or operator.

that the vehicle is not parked on the private property established as a private
tow-away zone without the consent of the owner of the private property or in
violation of any posted parking condition or regulation.
   (d)   (1)   Prior to towing a vehicle under subsection (b) of this section,

record of the time and date, in electronic or printed form, for at least thirty
days after the date on which the vehicle is recovered by the owner or
lienholder or at least two years after the date on which the vehicle was towed,
whichever is earlier.
      (2)   A towing service shall deliver a vehicle towed under subsection (b)
of this section to the location from which it may be recovered not more than
two hours after the time it was removed from the private tow-away zone, unless
the towing service is unable to deliver the motor vehicle within two hours due
to an uncontrollable force, natural disaster, or other event that is not within
the power of the towing service.
   (e)   (1)   If an owner of a private property that is established as a
private tow-away zone in accordance with subsection (a) of this section causes
the removal of a vehicle from that property by a towing service under
subsection (b) of this section, the towing service, within two hours of
removing the vehicle, shall provide notice to the Police Department concerning
all of the following:
         A.   The vehicle’s license number, make, model and color;
         B.   The location from which the vehicle was removed;
         C.   The date and time the vehicle was removed;
         D.   The telephone number of the person from whom the vehicle may be
recovered;
         E.   The address of the place from which the vehicle may be recovered.
      (2)   The Chief of Police shall maintain a record of any vehicle removed
from private property in the Chief’s jurisdiction that is established as a
private tow-away zone of which the Chief has received notice under this
section.  The record shall include all information submitted by the towing
service.  The Chief shall provide any information in the record that pertains

of Motor Vehicles shall insure that such information is provided in a timely
manner.  Subject to subsection (f)(4) of this section, the towing service or
storage facility shall send notice to the vehicle owner and any known
lienholder as follows:
         A.   Within five business days after the Registrar of Motor Vehicles
provides the identity of the owner and any lienholder of the motor vehicle, if
the vehicle remains unclaimed, to the owner’s and lienholder’s last known
address by certified or express mail with return receipt requested or by a
commercial carrier service utilizing any form of delivery requiring a signed
receipt;

section, “personal items” do not include any items that are attached to the
vehicle.
   (h)   No person shall remove, or cause the removal of any vehicle from

course, the duration and contents of which shall be established by the Ohio
Director of Public Safety.  If the offender attends and successfully completes
the course, the offender shall be issued written evidence that the offender
successfully completed the course.  The offender shall be required to pay the

Engineer and upon consideration of all other information, determines that the
particular conditions of a public alley result in the likelihood that motorists
will frequently violate the normal speed limit and are not likely to be readily
apprehended, and provided that he further finds that it is necessary in the
interest of safety to reduce the speed limit to ten miles per hour and to erect
pavement rises to discourage speeding, he shall have the authority to construct
pavement rises in such alley at such location or locations to effectively
discourage excessive speeding, provided the pavement rises are identified with
yellow markings and are constructed to permit the safe passage of a motor
vehicle at the speed of ten miles per hour, and provided suitable signs are
posted to indicate the existence of the pavement rises and the speed limit of
ten miles per hour.  It shall thereafter be prima-facie unlawful to operate a
motor vehicle at a speed exceeding ten miles per hour in such alley, and such
reduced limit shall supersede that of alleys generally.

   313.02  THROUGH STREETS; STOP AND YIELD RIGHT-OF-WAY SIGNS.
   (a)   All State routes are hereby designated as through streets or highways,
provided that stop signs, yield signs or traffic control signals shall be
erected at all intersections with such through streets or highways, except as
otherwise provided in this section.  Where two or more State routes that are
through streets or highways intersect and no traffic control signal is in
operation, stop signs or yield signs shall be erected at one or more entrances
thereto by the Ohio Department of Transportation, except as otherwise provided
in this section.
   Whenever the Ohio Director of Transportation determines on the basis of an
engineering and traffic investigation that stop signs are necessary to stop
traffic on a through highway for safe and efficient operation, nothing in this
section shall be construed to prevent such installations.  When circumstances
warrant, the Director also may omit stop signs on roadways intersecting through
highways under his jurisdiction.  Before the Director either installs or
removes a stop sign under this paragraph, he shall give notice, in writing, of
that proposed action to the Municipality at least thirty days before installing
or removing the stop sign.
   (b)   Other streets or highways or portions thereof, are hereby designated
through streets or highways, if they are within the Municipality, if they have
a continuous length of more than one mile between the limits of such street or
highway or portion thereof, and if they have "stop" or "yield" signs or traffic
control signals at the entrances of the majority of intersecting streets or
highways.  For purposes of this section, the limits of such street or highway
or portion thereof, shall be a municipal corporation line, the physical
terminus of the street or highway or any point on such street or highway at
which vehicular traffic thereon is required by regulatory signs to stop or
yield to traffic on the intersecting street, provided that in residence
districts the Municipality may by ordinance designate such street or highway,
or portion thereof, not to be a through highway and thereafter the affected
residence district shall be indicated by official traffic control devices. 
Where two or more streets or highways designated under this subsection (b)
intersect and no traffic control signal is in operation, stop signs or yield
signs shall be erected at one or more entrances thereto by the Ohio Department
of Transportation or by Council or the authorized local authority, except as
otherwise provided in this section.
   (c)   Stop signs need not be erected at intersections so constructed as to
permit traffic to safely enter a through street or highway without coming to a
stop.  Signs shall be erected at such intersections indicating that the
operator of a vehicle shall yield the right of way to or merge with all traffic
proceeding on the through street or highway.
   (d)   Council or the authorized local authority may designate additional
through streets or highways and shall erect stop signs, yield signs or traffic
control signals at all streets and highways intersecting such through streets
or highways, or may designate any intersection as a stop or yield intersection
and shall erect like signs at one or more entrances to such intersection.  (ORC
4511.65)
   313.03  TRAFFIC SIGNAL INDICATIONS.
   Highway traffic signal indications for vehicles, and pedestrians shall have
the following meanings:
   (a)   Steady Green Signal Indication:
      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a circular green signal indication is
permitted to proceed straight through or turn right or left, or make a u-turn
movement except as such movement is modified by a lane- use sign, turn
prohibition sign, lane marking, roadway design, separate turn signal
indication, or other traffic control device.  Such vehicular traffic, including
vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn movement, shall yield the
right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn
movement to the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching
from the opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard
during the time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the
intersection.
      (2)   Vehicular traffic facing a green arrow signal indication, displayed
alone or in combination with another signal indication, is permitted to
cautiously enter the intersection only to make the movement indicated by such
arrow, or such other movement as is permitted by other indications displayed at
the same time.  Such vehicular traffic, including vehicles turning right or
left or making a u-turn movement, shall yield the right-of-way to both of the
following:
         A.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk.
         B.   Other traffic lawfully using the intersection.
      (3)   A.   Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication,
as provided in Section
313.05, pedestrians facing a circular green signal indication are permitted to
proceed across the roadway within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk. 
The pedestrian shall yield the right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the
intersection or so close as to create an immediate hazard at the time  that the
green signal indication is first displayed.
         B.   Pedestrians facing a green arrow signal indication, unless
otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or other traffic control
device, shall not cross the roadway.
   (b)   Steady Yellow Signal Indication:
      (1)   Vehicular traffic facing a steady circular yellow signal indication
is thereby warned that the related green movement or the related flashing arrow
movement is being terminated or that a steady red signal indication will be
exhibited immediately thereafter when vehicular traffic shall not enter the
intersection.  The provisions governing vehicular operation under the movement
being terminated shall continue to apply while the steady circular yellow
signal indication is displayed.
      (2)   Vehicular traffic facing a steady yellow arrow signal indication is
thereby warned that the related green arrow movement or the related flashing
arrow movement is being terminated.  The provisions governing vehicular
operation under the movement being terminated shall continue to apply while the
steady yellow arrow signal indication is displayed.
      (3)   Pedestrians facing a steady circular yellow or yellow arrow signal
indication, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication as
provided in Section
 313.05 or other traffic control device, shall not start to cross the roadway.
   (c)   Steady Red Signal Indication:
      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a steady circular red signal
indication, unless entering the intersection to make another movement permitted
by another signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop line; but if
there is no stop line, traffic shall stop before entering the crosswalk on the
near side of the intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, before then before
entering the intersection; and shall remain stopped until a signal indication
to proceed is displayed except as provided in subsections (c)(1), (2) and (3)
of this section.
         B.   Except when a traffic control device is in place prohibiting a
turn on red or a steady red arrow signal indication is displayed, vehicular
traffic facing a steady circular red signal indication is permitted, after
stopping, to enter the intersection to turn right, or to turn left from a one-
way street into a one-way street.  The right to proceed with the turn shall be
subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a stop at a stop
sign.
      (2)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a steady red arrow signal indication
shall not enter the intersection to make the movement indicated by the arrow
and, unless entering the intersection to make another movement permitted by
another signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop line; but if
there is no stop line, before entering the crosswalk on the near side of the
intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, then before entering the
intersection; and shall remain stopped until a signal indication or other
traffic control device permitting the movement indicated by such red arrow is
displayed.
         B.   When a traffic control device is in place permitting a turn on a
steady red arrow signal indication, vehicular traffic facing a steady red arrow
indication is permitted, after stopping, to enter the intersection to turn
right or to turn left from a one-way street into a one-way street.  The right
to proceed with the turn shall be limited to the direction indicated by the
arrow, and shall be subject to the provisions that are applicable after making
a stop at a stop sign.
      (3)   Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication as
provided in Section
313.05 or other traffic control device, pedestrians facing a steady circular
red or steady red arrow signal indication shall not enter the roadway.
      (4)   Local authorities by ordinance, or the Director of Transportation
on State highways, may prohibit a right or a left turn against a steady red
signal at any intersection, which shall be effective when signs giving notice
thereof are posted at the intersection.
   (d)   Flashing Green Signal Indication.  A flashing green signal indication
has no meaning and shall not be used.
   (e)   Flashing Yellow Signal Indication:
      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing circular yellow signal indication, is permitted to cautiously enter
the intersection to proceed straight through or turn right or left or make a u-
turn movement except as such movement is modified by lane-use signs, turn
prohibition signs, lane markings, roadway design, separate turn signal
indications, or other traffic control devices.  Such vehicular traffic,
including vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn movement, shall
yield the right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn to
the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching from the
opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard during the
time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the intersection.
      (2)   A.   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing yellow arrow signal indication, displayed alone or in combination with
another signal indication, is permitted to cautiously enter the intersection
only to make the movement indicated by such arrow, or other such movement as is
permitted by other signal indications displayed at the same time.  Such
vehicular traffic, including vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn,
shall yield the right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn to
the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching from the
opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard during the
time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the intersection.
      (3)   Pedestrians facing any flashing yellow signal indication at an
intersection, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or
other traffic control device, are permitted to proceed across the roadway
within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk.  Pedestrians shall yield
the right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that
the flashing yellow signal indication is first displayed.
      (4)   When a flashing circular yellow signal indication is displayed as a
beacon to supplement another traffic control device, road users are notified
that there is a need to pay additional attention to the message contained
thereon or that the regulatory or warning requirements of the other traffic
control device, which might not be applicable at all times, are currently
applicable.
   (f)   Flashing Red Signal Indication:
      (1)   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing circular red signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop
line; but if there is no stop line, before entering the crosswalk on the near
side of the intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, at the point nearest the
intersecting roadway where the driver has a view of approaching traffic on the
intersecting roadway before entering the intersection.  The right to proceed
shall be subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a stop at a
stop sign.
      (2)   Pedestrians facing any flashing red signal indication at an
intersection, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or
other traffic control device, are permitted to proceed across the roadway
within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk.  Pedestrians shall yield
the right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that
the flashing red signal indication is first displayed.
      (3)   When a flashing circular red signal indication is displayed as a
beacon to supplement another traffic control device, road users are notified
that there is a need to pay additional attention to the message contained
thereon or that the regulatory requirements of the other traffic control
device, which might not be applicable at all times, are currently applicable. 
Use of this signal indication shall be limited to supplementing stop, do not
enter, or wrong way signs, and to applications where compliance with the
supplemented traffic control device requires a stop at a designated point.
   (g)   General Application: In the event an official traffic-control signal
is erected and maintained at a place other than an intersection, the provisions
of this section shall be applicable except as to those provisions which by
their nature can have no application.  Any stop required shall be made at a
sign or marking on the pavement indicating where the stop shall be made, but in
the absence of any such sign or marking the stop shall be made at the signal.
   (h)   Exception.  This section does not apply at railroad grade crossings. 
Conduct of drivers of vehicles approaching railroad grade crossings shall be
governed by Ohio R.C. 4511.61 and 4511.62.  (ORC 4511.13)

the lane over which the arrow signal indication is located.
      (2)   A steady yellow “X”: A road user is to prepare to vacate the lane
over which the signal indication is located because a lane control change is
being made to a steady red “X” signal indication.
      (3)   A steady white two-way left-turn arrow: A road user is permitted to
use a lane over which the signal indication is located for a left turn, but not
for through travel, with the understanding that common use of the lane by
oncoming road users for left turns also is permitted.
      (4)   A steady white one-way left-turn arrow: A road user is permitted to
use a lane over which the signal indication is located for a left turn, without
opposing turns in the same lane, but not for through travel.
      (5)   A steady red “X”: A road user is not permitted to use the lane over
which the signal indication is located and that this signal indication shall
modify accordingly the meaning of other traffic controls present.

   (a)   Whenever special pedestrian control signals exhibiting the words
“walk” or “don’t walk”, or the symbol of a walking person or an upraised palm
are in place, such signals shall indicate the following instructions:
      (1)   A steady walking person signal indication, which symbolizes “walk”,
means that a pedestrian facing the signal indication is permitted to start to
cross the roadway in the direction of the signal indication, possibly in
conflict with turning vehicles.  The pedestrian shall yield the right-of-way to
vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the walking person
signal indication is first shown.
      (2)   A flashing upraised hand signal indication, which symbolizes “don’t
walk”, means that a pedestrian shall not start to cross the roadway in the
direction of the signal indication, but that any pedestrian who has already
started to cross on a steady walking person signal indication shall proceed to
the far side of the traveled way of the street or highway, unless otherwise
directed by a traffic control device to proceed only to the median of a divided
highway or only to some other island or pedestrian refuge area.
      (3)   A steady upraised hand signal indication means that a pedestrian
shall not enter the roadway in the direction of the signal indication.
      (4)   Nothing int his section shall be construed to invalidate the
continued use of pedestrian control signals utilizing the word “wait” if those
signals were installed prior to March 28, 1985.
      (5)   A flashing walking person signal indication has no meaning and
shall not be used.  (ORC 4511.14)

admitted with expert testimony to be considered with any other relevant and
competent evidence in determining the guilt or innocence of the defendant.
         B.   In any criminal prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for a
violation of subsection (a) or (b) of this section or for an equivalent offense
that is vehicle related, the court may admit evidence on the concentration of
alcohol, drugs of abuse, controlled substances, metabolites of a controlled
substance, or a combination of them in the defendant’s whole blood, blood serum
or plasma, breath, urine or other bodily substance at the time of the alleged
violation as shown by chemical analysis of the substance withdrawn within three
hours of the time of the alleged violation.  The three-hour time limit
specified in this subsection regarding the admission of evidence does not
extend or affect the two-hour time limit specified in Ohio R.C. 4511.192(A) as
the maximum period of time during which a person may consent to a chemical test
or tests as described in that section.
The court may admit evidence on the concentration of alcohol, drugs of abuse,
or a combination of them as described in this section when a person submits to
a blood, breath, urine or other bodily substance test at the request of a law
enforcement officer under Ohio R.C. 4511.191, or a blood or urine sample is

analyzed in accordance with methods approved by the Director of Health by an
individual possessing a valid permit issued by the Director pursuant to Ohio
R.C. 3701.143.
         C.   As used in subsection (e)(1)B. of this section, “emergency
medical technician-intermediate” and “emergency medical technician- paramedic”
have the same meanings as in Ohio R.C. 4765.01.
      (2)   In a criminal prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for
violation of subsection (a) of this section or for an equivalent offense that
is vehicle related, if there was at the time the bodily substance was withdrawn
a concentration of less than the applicable concentration of alcohol specified
in subsections (a)(1)B., C., D. and E. of this section, or less than the
applicable concentration of a listed controlled substance or a listed
metabolite of a controlled substance specified for a violation of subsection
(a)(1)J. of this section, that fact may be considered with other competent
evidence in determining the guilt or innocence of the defendant.  This
subsection does not limit or affect a criminal prosecution or juvenile court
proceeding for a violation of subsection (b) of this section or for an
equivalent offense that is substantially equivalent to that subsection.
      (3)   Upon the request of the person who was tested, the results of the
chemical test shall be made available to the person or the person’s attorney,

under arrest as described in division (A)(5) of Ohio R.C. 4511.191, the
arresting officer shall advise the person at the time of the arrest that the
person may have an independent chemical test taken at the person’s own
expense.  If the person was under arrest other than described in division (A)
(5) of Ohio R.C. 4511.191, the form to be read to the person to be tested, as
required under Ohio R.C. 4511.192, shall state that the person may have an
independent test performed at the person’s expense.  The failure or inability
to obtain an additional chemical test by a person shall not preclude the
admission of evidence relating to the chemical test or tests taken at the
request of a law enforcement officer.
      (4)   A.   As used in subsections (e)(4)B. and C. of this section,
“national highway traffic safety administration” means the National Traffic
Highway Safety Administration established as an administration of the United
States Department of Transportation under 96 Stat. 2415 (1983), 49 U.S.C.A.

a drug of abuse, or alcohol and a drug of abuse, or of a municipal ordinance
relating to operating a vehicle with a prohibited concentration of alcohol, a
controlled substance, or a metabolite of a controlled substance in the whole
blood, blood serum or plasmabreath or urine, if a law enforcement officer has
administered a field sobriety test to the operator or person in physical
control of the vehicle involved in the violation and if it is shown by clear
and convincing evidence that the officer administered the test in substantial
compliance with the testing standards for any reliable, credible, and generally
accepted field sobriety tests that were in effect at the time the tests were
administered, including, but not limited to, any testing standards then in
effect that were set by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, all
of the following apply:
            1.   The officer may testify concerning the results of the field
sobriety test so administered.

sobriety test so administered as evidence in any proceedings in the criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding.
            3.   If testimony is presented or evidence is introduced under
subsection (e)(4)B.1. or 2. of this section and if the testimony or evidence is
admissible under the Rules of Evidence, the court shall admit the testimony or
evidence and the trier of fact shall give it whatever weight the trier of fact
considers to be appropriate.
         C.   Subsection (e)(4)B. of this section does not limit or preclude a
court, in its determination of whether the arrest of a person was supported by
probable cause or its determination of any other matter in a criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding of a type described in that
subsection, from considering evidence or testimony that is not otherwise
disallowed by subsection (e)(4)B. of this section.  (ORC 4511.19; 4511.194)

analyst’s or test performer’s regular duties;
         D.   An outline of the analyst’s or test performer’s education,
training, and experience in performing the type of analysis involved and a
certification that the laboratory satisfies appropriate quality control
standards in general and, in this particular analysis, under rules of the
Department of Health.
      (2)   Notwithstanding any other provision of law regarding the admission
of evidence, a report of the type described in subsection (f)(1) of this
section is not admissible against the defendant to whom it pertains in any
proceeding, other than a preliminary hearing or a grand jury proceeding, unless
the prosecutor has served a copy of the report on the defendant’s attorney or,
if the defendant has no attorney, on the defendant.
      (3)   A report of the type described in subsection (f)(1) of this section
shall not be prima-facie evidence of the contents, identity, or amount of any
substance if, within seven days after the defendant to whom the report pertains
or the defendant’s attorney receives a copy of the report, the defendant or the
defendant’s attorney demands the testimony of the person who signed the
report.  The judge in the case may extend the seven-day time limit in the
interest of justice.

the offender to attend, for three consecutive days, a drivers’ intervention
program certified under Ohio R.C. 5119.38.
The court also may suspend the execution of any part of the three-day jail term
under this subsection if it places the offender under a community control
sanction pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.25 for part of the three days, requires the

program so certified, and sentences the offender to a jail term equal to the
remainder of the three consecutive days that the offender does not spend
attending the program.  The court may require the offender, as a condition of
community control and in addition to the required attendance at a drivers’
intervention program, to attend and satisfactorily complete any treatment or
education programs that comply with the minimum standards adopted pursuant to
Ohio R.C. Chapter 5119 by the Director of Mental Health and Addiction Services
that the operators of the drivers’ intervention program determine that the
offender should attend and to report periodically to the court on the

As used in this subsection, three consecutive days means seventy-two
consecutive hours.  If the court determines that the offender is not conducive
to treatment in a drivers’ intervention program, if the offender refuses to
attend a drivers’ intervention program, or if the jail at which the offender is
to serve the jail term imposed can provide a drivers’ intervention program, the
court shall sentence the offender to a mandatory jail term of at least six
consecutive days. 
If the court grants unlimited driving privileges to a first-time offender under
Ohio R.C. 4510.022, all penalties imposed upon the offender by the court under
subsection (h)(1)A.2. of this section for the offense apply, except that the

in addition to the required attendance at drivers’ intervention program, that
the operators of the drivers’ intervention program determine that the offender
should attend and to report periodically to the court on the offender’s
progress in the programs.  The court also may impose any other conditions of
community control on the offender that it considers necessary.
            3.   In all cases, a fine of not less than three hundred seventy-
five dollars ($375.00) and not more than one thousand seventy-five dollars

mandatory jail term.  The cumulative jail term imposed for the offense shall
not exceed six months.
In addition to the jail term or the term of house arrest with electronic
monitoring or continuous alcohol monitoring or both types of monitoring and
jail term, the court shall require the offender to be assessed by a community
addiction services provider that is authorized by Ohio R.C. 5119.21, subject to
subsection (k) of this section, and shall order the offender to follow the
treatment recommendations of the services provider.  The purpose of the
assessment is to determine the degree of the offender’s alcohol usage and to

may impose an alternative sentence under this subsection that includes a term
of house arrest with electronic monitoring, with continuous alcohol monitoring,

As an alternative to the mandatory jail term of sixty consecutive days required

The court may grant limited driving privileges relative to the suspension under
Ohio R.C. 4510.021 and 4510.13.  The court may grant unlimited driving
privileges with an ignition interlock device relative to the suspension and may
reduce the period of suspension as authorized under Ohio R.C. 4510.022.  If the

this section is unable to pay the cost of the stay in the program, the court
may order that the cost be paid from the court’s indigent drivers’ alcohol

the operation of the suspension.

   (o)   Conflict of Terms.  All terms defined in Ohio R.C. 4510.01 apply to

is alleged to have driven at a greater speed than will permit the person to
bring the vehicle to a stop within the assured clear distance ahead the
affidavit and warrant need not specify the speed at which the defendant is
alleged to have driven.
   (f)   When a speed in excess of both a prima-facie limitation and a
limitation in subsection (d) hereof is alleged, the defendant shall be charged
in a single affidavit, alleging a single act, with a violation indicated of
both subsections (b)(1)A. to (b)(6) hereof, or of a limit declared or
established pursuant to this section by the Director or local authorities, and
of the limitation in subsection (d) hereof.  If the court finds a violation of
subsection (b)(1)A. to (b)(6) hereof, or a limit declared or established
pursuant to this section has occurred, it shall enter a judgment of conviction
under such subsection and dismiss the charge under subsection (d) hereof.  If
it finds no violation of subsections (b)(1)A. to (b)(6) hereof or a limit
declared or established pursuant to this section, it shall then consider

imposed for the violation. 
      (3)   If the offender commits the offense while distracted and the
distracting activity is a contributing factor to the commission of the offense,
the offender is subject to the additional fine established under Section
303.991 of the Traffic Code.
   (e)   The offense established under this section is a strict liability
offense and Ohio R.C. 2901.20 does not apply.  The designation of this offense

noncertified copy of a record of the Registrar of Motor Vehicles that shows the
name, date of birth, and social security number of a person charged with a

subsection (a)(1) of this section or a valid license as a motorcycle operator
either in the form of an endorsement upon a driver’s or commercial driver’s

punished as indirect criminal contempt under division (A) of Ohio R.C. 2705.02
that may be filed in the underlying case. If the offender previously has been
convicted of or pleaded guilty to any violation of Ohio R.C. 4510.12 or a

previously has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to two or more violations of
Ohio R.C. 4510.12 or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the

three years of the offense the offender previously was convicted of or pleaded
guilty to one or more violations of Ohio R.C. 4510.12 or a substantially

suspension at the time of the alleged violation of subsection (a) of this
section or the person operated a motor vehicle in violation of a restriction at
the time of the alleged violation of subsection (b) of this section.  The
person charged with a violation of subsection (a) or (b) of this section may

of Evidence, the fact that the occupant was not wearing the available occupant
restraining device, was not wearing all of the available elements of such a
device, or was not wearing such a device as properly adjusted is admissible in
evidence in relation to any claim for relief in a tort action to the extent
that the claim for relief satisfies all of the following:

   (b)   This Municipality includes the land and water within its boundaries
and the air space above such land and water, and real property outside the
corporate limits, with respect to which this Municipality has either exclusive
or concurrent legislative jurisdiction.  Where the boundary between this
Municipality and another jurisdiction is disputed, the disputed territory is
conclusively presumed to be within this Municipality for purposes of this
section.
   (c)   When an offense is committed under the laws of this Municipality, and
it appears beyond a reasonable doubt that the offense or any element of the
offense took place either in this Municipality or in another jurisdiction or
jurisdictions, but it cannot reasonably be determined in which it took place,
the offense or element is conclusively presumed to have taken place in this
Municipality for purposes of this section.
   (d)   When a person is subject to criminal prosecution and punishment in
this Municipality for an offense committed or completed outside of this
Municipality, the person is subject to all specifications for that offense that
would be applicable if the offense had been committed within this Municipality.
   (e)   Any act, conduct, or element that is a basis of a person being subject
under this section to criminal prosecution and punishment in this Municipality
need not be committed personally by the person as long as it is committed by
another person who is in complicity or conspiracy with the person.
   (f)   This section shall be liberally construed, consistent with
constitutional limitations, to allow this Municipality the broadest possible
jurisdiction over offenses and persons committing offenses in, or affecting,
this Municipality.
   (g)   For purposes of subsection (a)(2) of this section, an overt act is
substantial when it is of a character that manifests a purpose on the part of
the actor that the object of the conspiracy should be completed.
   (h)   As used in this section, “computer”, “computer system”, “computer
network”, “information service”, “telecommunication”, “telecommunications
device”, “telecommunications service”, “data”, and “writing” have the same
meaning as in Ohio R.C. 2913.01.
(ORC 2901.11)
   501.06  LIMITATION OF CRIMINAL PROSECUTION.
   (a)   Except as otherwise provided in this section, a prosecution shall be
barred unless it is commenced within the following periods after an offense is
committed:
      (1)   For misdemeanor other than a minor misdemeanor, two years;
      (2)   For a minor misdemeanor, six months.
   (b)   If the period of limitation provided in subsection (a) hereof has
expired, prosecution shall be commenced for an offense of which an element is
fraud or breach of a fiduciary duty, within one year after discovery of the
offense either by an aggrieved person, or by his legal representative who is
not himself a party to the offense.
   (c)   (1)   If the period of limitation provided in this section has
expired, prosecution shall be commenced for the following offenses during the
following specified periods of time:
         A.   For an offense involving misconduct in office by a public servant
at any time while the accused remains a  public servant, or within two years
thereafter;
         B.   For an offense by a person who is not a public servant but whose
offense is directly related to the misconduct in office of a public servant, at
any time while that public servant remains a public servant, or within two
years thereafter.
      (2)   As used in this subsection:
         A.   An "offense is directly related to the misconduct in office of a
public servant" includes, but is not limited to, a violation of Ohio R.C.
101.71, 101.91, 121.61 or 2921.13, division (F) or (H) of Ohio R.C. 102.03,
division (A) of Ohio R.C. 2921.02, division (A) or (B) of Ohio R.C. 2921.43, or
division (F) or (G) of Ohio R.C. 3517.13, that is directly related to an
offense involving misconduct in office of a public servant.
         B.   "Public servant" has the same meaning as in Ohio R.C. 2921.01.
   (d)   An offense is committed when every element of the offense occurs.  In
the case of an offense of which an element is a continuing course of conduct,
the period of limitation does not begin to run until such course of conduct or
the accused's accountability for it terminates, whichever occurs first.
   (e)   A prosecution is commenced on the date an indictment is returned or an
information filed, or on the date a lawful arrest without a warrant is made, or
on the date a warrant, summons, citation or other process is issued, whichever
occurs first.  A prosecution is not commenced by the return of an indictment or
the filing of an information unless reasonable diligence is exercised to issue
and execute process on the same.  A prosecution is not commenced upon issuance
of a warrant, summons, citation or other process, unless reasonable diligence
is exercised to execute the same.
   (f)   The period of limitation shall not run during any time when the corpus
delicti remains undiscovered.
   (g)   The period of limitation shall not run during any time when the
accused purposely avoids prosecution.  Proof that the accused absented himself
from this Municipality or concealed his identity or whereabouts is prima-facie
evidence of his purpose to avoid prosecution.
   (h)   The period of limitation shall not run during any time a prosecution
against the accused based on the same conduct is pending in this State, even
though the indictment, information or process that commenced the prosecution is
quashed or the proceedings on the indictment, information or process are set
aside or reversed on appeal.
   (i)   The period of limitation for a violation of any provision of this
General Offenses Code that involves a physical or mental wound, injury,
disability or condition of a nature that reasonably indicates abuse or neglect
of a child under eighteen years of age or of a child with a developmental
disability or physical impairment under twenty-one years of age shall not begin
to run until either of the following occurs:
      (1)   The victim of the offense reaches the age of majority.
      (2)   A public children services agency, or a municipal or county peace
officer that is not the parent or guardian of the child, in the county in which
the child resides or in which the abuse or neglect is occurring or has occurred
has been notified that abuse or neglect is known, suspected, or believed to
have occurred.  (ORC 2901.13)
   (j)   This section shall not apply to prosecutions commenced within the
period of limitations set forth in Ohio R.C. 718.12(B) for violations of the
Municipal income tax ordinance.
   501.07  REQUIREMENTS FOR CRIMINAL LIABILITY.
   (a)   Except as provided in subsection (b) hereof, a person is not guilty of
an offense unless both of the following apply:
      (1)   The person’s liability is based on conduct that includes either a
voluntary act, or an omission to perform an act or duty that the person is
capable of performing;
      (2)   The person has the requisite degree of culpability for each element
as to which a culpable mental state is specified by the language defining the
offense.
 
   (b)   When the language defining an offense does not specify any degree of
culpability, and plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict criminal
liability for the conduct described in the section, then culpability is not
required for a person to be guilty of the offense. The fact that one subsection
of a section plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict liability for an
offense defined in that subsection does not by itself plainly indicate a
purpose to impose strict criminal liability for an offense defined in other
subsections of the section that do not specify a degree of culpability.
   (c)   (1)   When language defining an element of an offense that is related
to knowledge or intent or to which mens rea could fairly be applied neither
specifies culpability nor plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict
liability, the element of the offense is established only if a person acts
recklessly.
      (2)   Subsection (c)(1) of this section does not apply to offenses
defined in the Traffic Code.
      (3)   Subsection (c)(1) of this section does not relieve the prosecution
of the burden of proving the culpable mental state required by any definition
incorporated into the offense.
   (d)   Voluntary intoxication may not be taken into consideration in
determining the existence of a mental state that is an element of a criminal
offense.  Voluntary intoxication does not relieve a person of a duty to act if
failure to act constitutes a criminal offense.  Evidence that a person was
voluntarily intoxicated may be admissible to show whether or not the person was
physically capable of performing the act with which the person is charged.
   (e)   As used in this section:
      (1)   Possession is a voluntary act if the possessor knowingly procured
or received the thing possessed, or was aware of the possessor’s control of the
thing possessed for a sufficient time to have ended possession.
      (2)   Reflexes, convulsions, body movements during unconsciousness or
sleep, and body movements that are not otherwise a product of the actor's
volition, are involuntary acts.
      (3)   "Culpability" means purpose, knowledge, recklessness or negligence,
as defined in Section
501.08.
      (4)   “Intoxication” includes, but is not limited to, intoxication
resulting from the ingestion of alcohol, a drug, or alcohol and a drug. 
         (ORC 2901.21)
   501.08  CULPABLE MENTAL STATES.
   (a)   A person acts purposely when it is the person’s specific intention to
cause a certain result, or when the gist of the offense is a prohibition
against conduct of a certain nature, regardless of what the offender intends to
accomplish thereby, it is the offender’s specific intention to engage in
conduct of that nature.
   (b)   A person acts knowingly, regardless of purpose, when the person is
aware that the person’s conduct will probably cause a certain result or will
probably be of a certain nature.  A person has knowledge of circumstances when
the person is aware that such circumstances probably exist. 
   When knowledge of the existence of a particular fact is an element of an
offense, such knowledge is established if a person subjectively believes that
there is a high probability of its existence and fails to make inquiry or acts
with a conscious purpose to avoid learning the fact.
   (c)   A person acts recklessly when, with heedless indifference to the
consequences, the person perversely disregards a substantial and unjustifiable
risk that the person’s conduct is likely to cause a certain result or is likely
to be of a certain nature.  A person is reckless with respect to circumstances
when, with heedless indifference to the consequences, the person perversely
disregards a substantial and unjustifiable risk that such circumstances are
likely to exist.
   (d)   A person acts negligently when, because of a substantial lapse from
due care, the person fails to perceive or avoid a risk that the person’s
conduct may cause a certain result or may be of a certain nature.  A person is
negligent with respect to circumstances when, because of a substantial lapse
from due care, the person fails to perceive or avoid a risk that such
circumstances may exist.
   (e)   When the section defining an offense provides that negligence suffices
to establish an element thereof, then recklessness, knowledge or purpose is
also sufficient culpability for such element.  When recklessness suffices to
establish an element of an offense, then knowledge or purpose is also
sufficient culpability for such element.  When knowledge suffices to establish
an element of an offense, then purpose is also sufficient culpability for such
element. 
(ORC 2901.22)
   501.09  ATTEMPT.
   (a)   No person, purposely or knowingly, and when purpose or knowledge is
sufficient culpability for the commission of an offense, shall engage in
conduct that, if successful, would constitute or result in the offense.
   (b)   It is no defense to a charge under this section that, in retrospect,
commission of the offense that was the object of the attempt was either
factually or legally impossible under the attendant circumstances, if that
offense could have been committed had the attendant circumstances been as the
actor believed them to be.
   (c)   No person who is convicted of committing a specific offense or of
complicity in the commission of an offense, shall be convicted of an attempt to
commit the same offense in violation of this section.
   (d)   It is an affirmative defense to a charge under this section that the
actor abandoned the actor’s effort to commit the offense or otherwise prevented
its commission, under circumstances manifesting a complete and voluntary
renunciation of the actor’s criminal purpose.
   (e)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of an attempt to commit an
offense.  An attempt to commit a drug abuse offense for which the penalty is
determined by the amount or number of unit doses of the controlled substance
involved in the drug abuse offense is an offense of the same degree as the drug
abuse offense attempted would be if that drug abuse offense had been committed
and had involved an amount or number of unit doses of the controlled substance
that is within the next lower range of controlled substance amounts than was
involved in the attempt.  An attempt to commit any other misdemeanor is a
misdemeanor of the next lesser degree than the misdemeanor attempted.  In the
case of an attempt to commit an offense other than a violation of Ohio R.C.
Chapter 3734 that is not specifically classified, an attempt is a misdemeanor
of the first degree if the offense attempted is a felony under the Ohio Revised
Code, and a misdemeanor of the fourth degree if the offense attempted is a
misdemeanor.  An attempt to commit a minor misdemeanor is not an offense under
this section. 
   (f)   As used in this section, “drug abuse offense” has the same meaning as
in Ohio R.C. 2925.01.  (ORC 2923.02)
   501.10  COMPLICITY.
   (a)   No person, acting with the kind of culpability required for the
commission of an offense, shall do any of the following:
      (1)   Solicit or procure another to commit the offense;
      (2)   Aid or abet another in committing the offense;
      (3)   Cause an innocent or irresponsible person to commit the offense.
   (b)   It is no defense to a charge under this section that no person with
whom the accused was in complicity has been convicted as a principal offender.
   (c)   No person shall be convicted of complicity under this section unless
an offense is actually committed, but a person may be convicted of complicity
in an attempt to commit an offense in violation of Section
501.09.
   (d)   If an alleged accomplice of the defendant testifies against the
defendant in a case in which the defendant is charged with complicity in the
commission of or an attempt to commit an offense, an attempt to commit an
offense or an offense, the court when it charges the jury, shall state
substantially the following:
         "The testimony of an accomplice does not become
      inadmissible because of his complicity, moral turpitude
      or self-interest, but the admitted or claimed complicity
      of a witness may affect his credibility and make his
      testimony subject to grave suspicion, and require that
      it be weighed with great caution.
"It is for you, as jurors, in the light of all the facts presented to you from
the witness stand, to evaluate such testimony and to determine its quality and
worth or its lack of quality and worth."
   (e)   It is an affirmative defense to a charge under this section that,
prior to the commission of or attempt to commit the offense, the actor
terminated his complicity, under circumstances manifesting a complete and
voluntary renunciation of his criminal purpose.
   (f)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of complicity in the
commission of an offense, and shall be prosecuted and punished as if he were a
principal offender.  A charge of complicity may be stated in terms of this
section, or in terms of the principal offense.
(ORC 2923.03)
   501.11  ORGANIZATIONAL CRIMINAL LIABILITY.
   (a)   An organization may be convicted of an offense under any of the
following circumstances:
      (1)   The offense is a minor misdemeanor committed by an officer, agent
or employee of the organization acting in its behalf and within the scope of
the officer’s, agent’s or employee’s office or employment, except that if the
section defining the offense designates the officers, agents or employees for
whose conduct the organization is accountable or the circumstances under which
it is accountable, those provisions shall apply.
      (2)   A purpose to impose organizational liability plainly appears in the
section defining the offense, and the offense is committed by an officer, agent
or employee of the organization acting in its behalf and within the scope of
the officer’s, agent’s or employee’s office or employment, except that if the
section defining the offense designates the officers, agents or employees for
whose conduct the organization is accountable or the circumstances under which
it is accountable, those provisions shall apply.
      (3)   The offense consists of an omission to discharge a specific duty
imposed by law on the organization.
      (4)   If, acting with the kind of culpability otherwise required for the
commission of the offense, its commission was authorized, requested, commanded,
tolerated or performed by the board of directors, trustees, partners or by a
high managerial officer, agent or employee acting in behalf of the organization
and within the scope of such a board’s or person’s office or employment.
   (b)   If strict liability is imposed for the commission of an offense, a
purpose to impose organizational liability shall be presumed, unless the
contrary plainly appears.
   (c)   In a prosecution of an organization for an offense other than one for
which strict liability is imposed, it is a defense that the high managerial
officer, agent or employee having supervisory responsibility over the subject
matter of the offense exercised due diligence to prevent its commission.  This
defense is not available if it plainly appears inconsistent with the purpose of
the section defining the offense.
   (d)   As used in this section, "organization" means a corporation for profit
or not for profit, partnership, limited partnership, joint venture,
unincorporated nonprofit association, estate, trust or other commercial or
legal entity.  "Organization" does not include an entity organized as or by a
governmental agency for the execution of a governmental program.  (ORC 2901.23)
   501.12  PERSONAL ACCOUNTABILITY FOR ORGANIZATIONAL CONDUCT.
   (a)   An officer, agent or employee of an organization as defined in Section
501.11 may be prosecuted for an offense committed by such organization, if he
acts with the kind of culpability required for the commission of the offense,
and any of the following apply:
      (1)   In the name of the organization or in its behalf, he engages in
conduct constituting the offense, or causes another to engage in such conduct,
or tolerates such conduct when it is of a type for which he has direct
responsibility;
      (2)   He has primary responsibility to discharge a duty imposed on the
organization by law, and such duty is not discharged.
   (b)   When a person is convicted of an offense by reason of this section, he
is subject to the same penalty as if he had acted in his own behalf.  (ORC
2901.24)
   501.13  CONSPIRACY.
   (a)   No person, with purpose to commit or to promote or facilitate the
commission of aggravated murder, murder, kidnapping, abduction, compelling
prostitution, promoting prostitution, trafficking in persons, aggravated arson,
arson, aggravated robbery, robbery, aggravated burglary, burglary, engaging in
a pattern of corrupt activity, corrupting another with drugs, a felony drug
trafficking, manufacturing, processing or possession offense, theft of drugs,
or illegal processing of drug documents, the commission of a felony offense of
unauthorized use of a vehicle, illegally transmitting multiple commercial
electronic mail messages or unauthorized access of a computer in violation of
Ohio R.C. 2923.421 or the commission of a violation of any provision of Ohio
R.C. Chapter 3734, other than Ohio R.C. 3734.18, that relates to hazardous
wastes, shall do either of the following:
      (1)   With another person or persons, plan or aid in planning the
commission of any of the specified offenses;
      (2)   Agree with another person or persons that one or more of them will
engage in conduct that facilitates the commission of any of the specified
offenses.
   (b)   No person shall be convicted of conspiracy unless a substantial overt
act in furtherance of the conspiracy is alleged and proved to have been done by
the accused or a person with whom the accused conspired, subsequent to the
accused’s entrance into the conspiracy.  For purposes of this section, an overt
act is substantial when it is of a character that manifests a purpose on the
part of the actor that the object of the conspiracy should be completed.
   (c)   When the offender knows or has reasonable cause to believe that a
person with whom the offender conspires also has conspired or is conspiring
with another to commit the same offense, the offender is guilty of conspiring
with that other person, even though the other person’s identity may be unknown
to the offender.
   (d)   It is no defense to a charge under this section that, in retrospect,
commission of the offense that was the object of the conspiracy was impossible
under the circumstances.
   (e)   A conspiracy terminates when the offense or offenses that are its
objects are committed or when it is abandoned by all conspirators.  In the
absence of abandonment, it is no defense to a charge under this section that no
offense that was the object of the conspiracy was committed.
   (f)   A person who conspires to commit more than one offense is guilty of
only one conspiracy, when the offenses are the object of the same agreement or
continuous conspiratorial relationship.
   (g)   When a person is convicted of committing or attempting to commit a
specific offense or of complicity in the commission of or attempt to commit the
specific offense, the person shall not be convicted of conspiracy involving the
same offense.
   (h)   (1)   No person shall be convicted of conspiracy upon the testimony of
a person with whom the defendant conspired, unsupported by other evidence.
      (2)   If a person with whom the defendant allegedly has conspired
testifies against the defendant in a case in which the defendant is charged
with conspiracy and if the testimony is supported by other evidence, the court,
when it charges the jury, shall state substantially the following:
   “The testimony of an accomplice that is supported by other evidence does not
become inadmissible because of the accomplice’s complicity, moral turpitude, or
self-interest, but the admitted or claimed complicity of a witness may affect
the witness’ credibility and make the witness’ testimony subject to grave
suspicion, and requires that it be weighed with great caution.
   It is for you, as jurors, in light of all the facts presented to you from
the witness stand, to evaluate such testimony and to determine its quality and
worth or its lack of quality and worth”.
      (3)   “Conspiracy”, as used in subsection (h)(1) of this section, does
not include any conspiracy that results in an attempt to commit an offense or
in the commission of an offense.
   (i)   The following are affirmative defenses to a charge of conspiracy:
      (1)   After conspiring to commit an offense, the actor thwarted the
success of the conspiracy under circumstances manifesting a complete and
voluntary renunciation of the actor’s criminal purpose.
      (2)   After conspiring to commit an offense, the actor abandoned the
conspiracy prior to the commission of or attempt to commit any offense that was
the object of the conspiracy, either by advising all other conspirators of the
actor’s abandonment, or by informing any law enforcement authority of the
existence of the conspiracy and of the actor’s participation in the conspiracy.
   (j)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of conspiracy, which is a
misdemeanor of the first degree, when the most serious offense that is the
object of the conspiracy is a felony of the fifth degree.
   (k)   This section does not define a separate conspiracy offense or penalty
where conspiracy is defined as an offense by one or more sections of this Code,
other than this section.  In such a case, however:
      (1)   With respect to the offense specified as the object of the
conspiracy in the other section or sections, subsection (a) hereof defines the
voluntary act or acts and culpable mental state necessary to constitute the
conspiracy;
      (2)   Subsections (b) to (i) hereof are incorporated by reference in the
conspiracy offense defined by the other section or sections of this Code.
   (l)   (1)   In addition to the penalties that otherwise are imposed for
conspiracy, a person who is found guilty of conspiracy to engage in a pattern
of corrupt activity is subject to divisions (B)(2) and (3) of Ohio R.C.
2923.32, division (A) of Ohio R.C. 2981.04 and division (D) of Ohio R.C.
2981.06.
      (2)   If a person is convicted of or pleads guilty to conspiracy and if
the most serious offense that is the object of the conspiracy is a felony drug
trafficking, manufacturing, processing or possession offense, in addition to
the penalties or sanctions that may be imposed for the conspiracy under
subsection (j) hereof and Ohio R.C. Chapter 2929, both of the following apply:
         A.   The provisions of divisions (D), (F) and (G) of Ohio R.C.
2925.03, division (D) of Ohio R.C. 2925.04, division (D) of Ohio R.C. 2925.05,
division (D) of Ohio R.C. 2925.06 and division (E) of Ohio R.C. 2925.11 that
pertain to mandatory and additional fines, driver’s or commercial driver’s
license or permit suspensions, and professionally licensed persons and that
would apply under the appropriate provisions of those divisions to a person who
is convicted of or pleads guilty to the felony drug trafficking, manufacturing,
processing, or possession offense that is the most serious offense that is the
basis of the conspiracy shall apply to the person who is convicted of or pleads
guilty to the conspiracy as if the person had been convicted or pleaded guilty
to the felony drug trafficking, manufacturing, processing or possession offense
that is the most serious offense that is the basis of the conspiracy.
         B.   The court that imposes sentence upon the person who is convicted
of or pleads guilty to the conspiracy shall comply with the provisions
identified as being applicable under subsection (l)(2) of this section, in
addition to any other penalty or sanction that it imposes for the conspiracy
under subsection (j) of this section and Ohio R.C. Chapter 2929.
   (m)   As used in this section:
      (1)   “Felony drug trafficking, manufacturing, processing or possession
offense” means any of the following that is a felony:
         A.   A violation of Ohio R.C. 2925.03, 2925.04, 2925.05, or 2925.06;
         B.   A violation of Ohio R.C. 2925.11 that is not a minor drug
possession offense.
      (2)   “Minor drug possession offense” has the same meaning as in Ohio
R.C. 2925.01.  (ORC 2923.01)
   501.99  PENALTIES FOR MISDEMEANORS.
   (a)   Financial Sanctions.  In addition to imposing court costs pursuant to
Ohio R.C. 2947.23, the court imposing a sentence upon an offender for a
misdemeanor committed under the Codified Ordinances, including a minor
misdemeanor, may sentence the offender to any financial sanction or combination
of financial sanctions authorized under this section.  If the court in its
discretion imposes one or more financial sanctions, the financial sanctions
that may be imposed pursuant to this section include, but are not limited to,
the following:
      (1)   Restitution.  Unless the misdemeanor offense is a minor misdemeanor
or could be disposed of by the traffic violations bureau serving the court
under Traffic Rule 13, restitution by the offender to the victim of the
offender’s crime or any survivor of the victim, in an amount based on the
victim’s economic loss.  The court may not impose restitution as a sanction
pursuant to this section if the offense is a minor misdemeanor or could be
disposed of by the traffic violations bureau serving the court under Traffic
Rule 13.  If the court requires restitution, the court shall order that the
restitution be made to the victim in open court or to the adult probation
department that serves the jurisdiction or the clerk of the court on behalf of
the victim.
   If the court imposes restitution, the court shall determine the amount of
restitution to be paid by the offender.  If the court imposes restitution, the
court may base the amount of restitution it orders on an amount recommended by
the victim, the offender, a presentence investigation report, estimates or
receipts indicating the cost of repairing or replacing property, and other
information, provided that the amount the court orders as restitution shall not
exceed the amount of the economic loss suffered by the victim as a direct and
proximate result of the commission of the offense.  If the court decides to
impose restitution, the court shall hold an evidentiary hearing on restitution
if the offender, victim or survivor disputes the amount of restitution.  If the
court holds an evidentiary hearing, at the hearing the victim or survivor has
the burden to prove by a preponderance of the evidence the amount of
restitution sought from the offender.
All restitution payments shall be credited against any recovery of economic
loss in a civil action brought by the victim or any survivor of the victim
against the offender.  No person may introduce evidence of an award of
restitution under this section in a civil action for purposes of imposing
liability against an insurer under Ohio R.C. 3937.18.
If the court imposes restitution, the court may order that the offender pay a
surcharge, of not more than five per cent of the amount of the restitution
otherwise ordered, to the entity responsible for collecting and processing
restitution payments.
The victim or survivor may request that the prosecutor in the case file a
motion, or the offender may file a motion, for modification of the payment
terms of any restitution ordered.  If the court grants the motion, it may
modify the payment terms as it determines appropriate.
      (2)   Fines.  A fine in the following amount:
         A.   For a misdemeanor of the first degree, not more than one thousand
dollars ($1,000);
         B.   For a misdemeanor of the second degree, not more than seven
hundred fifty dollars ($750.00);
         C.   For a misdemeanor of the third degree, not more than five hundred
dollars ($500.00);
         D.   For a misdemeanor of the fourth degree, not more than two hundred
fifty dollars ($250.00);
         E.   For a minor misdemeanor, not more than one hundred fifty dollars
($150.00).
      (3)   Reimbursement of costs of sanctions.
         A.   Reimbursement by the offender of any or all of the costs of
sanctions incurred by the government, including, but not limited to, the

businesses within the City, thereby reducing or eliminating the adverse
secondary effects from such business. The provisions of this chapter have
neither the purpose nor effect of imposing a limitation or restriction on the
content of any communicative materials, including sexually oriented materials.
Similarly, it is not the intent nor effect of this chapter to restrict or deny
access by adults to sexually oriented materials protected by the First

oriented entertainment to their intended market. Neither is it the intent nor
effect of the chapter to condone or legitimize the distribution of obscene
material.

   921.04  SERVICE OUTSIDE CITY LIMITS; RATES.
   For any lot, parcel of land, building or premises situated outside the City
and having any connection with the City's sewerage system or otherwise
discharging sewage, industrial wastes, water or other liquids, either directly
or indirectly, into the City's sewerage system, the charge shall be based upon
the quantity of water used thereon or therein as the same is measured by a
water meter or meters there in use, as hereinafter described, and there shall
be charged the rates set out in Section
921.03 plus thirty percent (30%).
(Ord. 952.  Passed  2-3-49.)

   In the event a lot, parcel of land, building or premises discharging sewage,
industrial wastes, water or other liquids, either directly or indirectly, into
the City's sanitary sewerage system obtains part or all of the water used from
other sources than the City water works, which is not measured by a water meter
or is measured by a water meter not acceptable to the Safety-Service Director
then, in each such case, the owner or other interested parties shall, at his or
their expense, install and maintain water meters satisfactory to the Director
on all supplies other than City water and the quantity of water used to
determine the sewerage charge shall be the sum of the quantities of water
measured by all meters.

the amount allowed for a minimum bill per month or quarter year, and it can be
shown to the satisfaction of the Safety-Service Director that a portion of
water as measured by the water meter or meters does not and cannot enter the
sanitary sewerage system, then the Director may determine in such a manner and
by such methods as he may find practicable the percentage of metered water
entering the sanitary sewerage system or he may require or permit the
installation of additional meters in such a manner as to determine the quantity

October 18, 1979.  See Chapter
922 for relevant provisions.)
   921.08  INDUSTRIAL WASTES; RATES.
   (a)   For any lot, parcel of land, building or premises having or proposing
to have any connection with the City sanitary sewerage system or otherwise
proposing to discharge industrial wastes, either directly or indirectly, into
the City sanitary sewerage system, a written permit must first be duly issued
by the Safety Service Director. Such written permit shall be granted after a
determination is made that no injurious acids, alkalies, toxic substances, oils
and greases, ammonia or dissolved gases are contained in the wastes which may
injure the sanitary sewerage system, its appurtenances or parts thereof, or may
hinder the treatment and purification of sewage. Where the industrial wastes
contain such injurious materials or have a biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) in
excess of 200 parts per million or suspended solids (SS) in excess of 325 parts
per million, as determined by an analysis of composite samples, satisfactory
pretreatment may be required. Where industrial wastes contain BOD in excess of
200 milligrams per liter and SS in excess of 325 milligrams per liter, a
surcharge shall be levied using the following formula:
   Surcharge ($/month) = ($9.30 x lbs BOD) + ($1.10 x lbs SS)
   The determination of pounds shall be calculated in the following manner:
   Average Monthly Flow in MGD x 8.34 x monthly flow weighted average BOD (mg/
l) = lbs of BOD
   Average Monthly Flow in MGD x 8.34 x monthly flow weighted average SS (mg/l)
= lbs of SS
Where:
   MGD = millions gallons per day
   Mg/l = miligrams per liter
   lbs. = pounds
(Ord. 2016-3809.  Passed 5-5-16.)
   921.09  PAYMENT OF CHARGES.
   The sewerage charges provided in this chapter shall be payable monthly or
quarterly at the office of the City Department of Water and may be made payable
at the same time as water bills are payable in the district in which the lot,
parcel of land or premises is located.  The due date shall be that specified on
the statement for the sewerage service charge presented to the user of the
sewerage system.
   The average service charge as provided for in this chapter shall be payable
in four quarterly or twelve monthly payments in each year, as provided in
Sections
921.03 and
921.04.
(Ord. 952.  Passed 2-3-46.)
   921.10  NONPAYMENT; CITY'S REMEDY.

collected by the City Department of Water and the Safety-Service Director shall
make and enforce such by-laws and regulations as may be deemed necessary for
the safe, economical and efficient management and protection of the City
sewerage system, for the construction and use of house sewers and connections
to the sewerage system and for the regulation, collection, rebating and
refunding of such charges.
(Ord. 952.  Passed 2-3-49.)
   921.12  SEWER FUND; PURPOSE.
   The funds received from the collection of such sewerage service charges as
hereinbefore authorized shall be deposited daily with the City Treasurer and
shall be deposited in an account known as the "Sewer Fund".  When appropriated
by Council, such moneys shall be available for the payment of the cost and
expense of the operation, maintenance, management and repair of the sanitary
sewerage system, and any surplus in the Fund may be used for the enlargement or
replacement of the same, for the payment of the interest on any incurred debt
for the construction of such sewerage system and for the creation of a sinking
fund for the payment of such debt, but shall not be used for the extension of
sewers to serve unsewered areas or for any other purpose whatsoever.
(Ord. 952.  Passed 2-3-49.)
   921.13  SEWAGE AGREEMENTS WITH OTHER MUNICIPALITIES.
   The Safety-Service Director, subject to the approval of Council, shall and
is hereby authorized to enter into agreements with the County, with cities and
villages and with corporations and individuals whose premises are located
outside the City and who desire to discharge sewage, industrial wastes, water
or other liquids into the City's sewerage system, which agreements shall fix
the terms and conditions under which such sewage, industrial wastes, water or
other liquids may be discharged into the sewerage system.  All funds received
in connection with such agreements shall be deposited and expended in

sewer from the source to the furtherest end of the property to be served at the
expense of the person requesting such sewer.  The sewer so constructed shall
become the property of the City upon its completion and acceptance of the City
Engineer.
   (c)   In the event that the City determines that a larger sewer line should
be constructed than the one requested then upon construction of the larger
sewer line the City shall assume an additional expense of the material for such
sewer only and so much of such expense that exceeds the size of the sewer
necessary and adequate to serve the property for which such sewer service is
requested.

   For any use not shown herein, the number of units shall be determined by the
City Engineer on the basis of accepted engineering practice on the basis of
anticipated flow from applicant when compared to a single-family residence
where the flow of 400 gallons per residence per day will be considered as a
unit of one.
   The tap-ins charge will be calculated in accordance with this schedule by
multiplying the benefitted number of units by the rate for a unit of one.
   (d)   Where connection is made directly into a trunk or interceptor sewer,
and where the property to be connected has not been assessed for at least the
equivalent cost of construction on eight inch lateral sewer to serve such
property, the charge as prescribed by subsections (b) and (c) hereof shall be
increased by an amount equal to the frontage of the parcel of land for which

within a street right of way, the charges as prescribed by subsections (b), (c)
and (d) hereof shall be increased by one hundred dollars ($100.00) to defray
the cost of restoring the City street to its original condition.
   (f)   Charges for connections made outside the boundaries of the City and
not subject to any separate agreements (County Sewer District No. 1) shall be
one hundred fifty percent (150%) of the applicable charge for a connection made
within the City.
   (g)   The initial tap-in charge as set forth in the preceding subsections
shall be increased by an amount equal to two percent (2%) of the initial charge
on January 1, 1975, and on January 1 of each year thereafter until January 1,
1998, and such charges as so increased shall remain in effect and by the tap-in
charges applicable during the calendar year in which the tap-in permit is
obtained.  Such incremental charges are designed to offset the interest costs
involved by the City in constructing such sewers.
   (h)   The permits and charges provided for in this section shall not be
deemed to preclude the subsequent levy of assessments against benefitted
properties to provide funds for the construction of sanitary sewers required to
provide local sewer service to such properties, and the permit and charges
provided for by this section shall be in addition to any other permits and
charges required by any other legislation and regulations of the City.
   (i)   In the event that the Safety-Service Director shall ascertain that any
property has been connected directly or indirectly to the municipal sewerage
system in violation of the provisions of this section, the City Engineer is
hereby authorized to disconnect such property, or have the same disconnected,
until such violation shall cease.  The City shall be reimbursed by the violator
for expenses incurred by the City in making such disconnection.

charge as calculated in accordance with the applicable subsection (b), (c),
(d), (e), (f) and (g) hereof in installments the Engineer shall calculate the
installment payment by adding fifteen percent (15%) to the total tap-in charge
to offset interest charges and the total so calculated divided then by sixty,
this amount then so determined shall be the monthly installment payable over
sixty installments.  The Engineer shall so certify the monthly installment
amount to the Safety-Service Director to be billed and collected in the same
manner as sanitary sewer charges are billed and collected as provided for in
this chapter.
(Ord. 1526.  Passed 2-21-74.)
   921.17  NONRESIDENT TAP-INS.
   (a)   Persons owning property immediately adjacent to the corporate limits
of the City, who are desirous of tapping into the City sewer immediately
available to their property shall make application for permission to tap into
the sewer to Council for its consideration.
   (b)   The application shall state the name of the property owner, give a
description of the property and buildings thereon to be served and promise and
covenant that if the permit is issued the privilege shall not be extended to
include other houses or buildings on such property described in the application
and that the applicant will pay all costs of constructing the sewer.  The
applicant shall be sworn to and subscribed before a notary public as being true
in every respect.
   (c)   Council, after duly considering the application, shall refer the same
to the City Engineer and Safety-Service Director for information as to the size
of the sewer to be tapped into, its present capacity and load and a
recommendation as to whether tapping is feasible in view of existing
circumstances.  It shall then be the duty of the Engineer and Director to
submit the report to Council for its further consideration and approval.
   (d)   If Council approves the application, it shall then direct the Safety-
Service Director to issue the sewer tapping permit to the applicant upon the
payment to the Director of the fee as set forth in Section
921.16.

   No person shall discharge or cause to be discharged any unpolluted
stormwater, surface water, groundwater, roof runoff, subsurface drainage,
uncontaminated cooling water or unpolluted industrial process water to the
sewage system.  Any existing roof drain connections carrying unpolluted
stormwater to the sewage system shall be disconnected above ground in a manner
approved by the Engineer.
(Ord. 90-2655.  Passed 7-5-90.)
   922.03  SPECIFIC LIMITATIONS AND PROHIBITIONS.
   (a)   The following described substances, material, waters or wastes shall
be limited to discharge to the City's sewage system to concentrations or
quantities which will not cause interference or harm to either the sewers,
sewage treatment process or equipment; will not have an adverse effect after
treatment on the receiving stream; will not cause violations of the NPDES
permit, requirements or regulations; or will not endanger the public's lives or
property or constitute a nuisance.  The Director may set limitations more
severe than the following if such limitations are necessary to meet the above
objectives.  These local limits may be found in the Fremont Local Limits
Document, the most recent technologically based local limits evaluation as
approved by the Ohio EPA.  In setting these  limitations to the acceptability,
the Director will give consideration to such factors as the quantity of subject
wastes in relation to flows and velocities in the sewers, materials or
construction of sewers, the wastewater treatment processes employed, the
capacity of the Water Pollution Control Center and its sludge recycling
program, the degree of treatability of the wastes, and other pertinent factors,
including cost effectiveness. 
      (1)   When limits in a Pretreatment Standard are expressed only in terms
in mass pollutant per limit of production, the Director may convert the limits
to equivalent limitations expressed either as mass of pollutants discharged per
day or effluent concentrations for purpose of calculating effluent limitations
applicable to individual Industrial Users (IU).
      (2)   Any IU operating under a Wastewater Contribution Permit
incorporating equivalent mass or concentration limits calculated from a
production based standard shall notify the Director within two business days
after the user has a reasonable basis to know that the production level will
significantly change within the next calendar month.  Failure to adequately
notify the Director will require the IU to meet the mass or concentration
limits in its Wastewater Contribution Permit that were based on the original
estimate of the long term average production rate.
         
   (b)   The limitations included in this chapter or restrictions of materials
or characteristics of waste or wastewater discharged to the sewage system which
will not be violated without the approval of the Director are as follows:
      (1)   Industrial wastes containing floatable oil, fat or grease.
      (2)   Wastewater having a temperature higher than 104 degrees Fahrenheit.
      (3)   Any garbage that has not been properly shredded.
      (4)   Any wastewater which, by interaction with other water or wastes in
sewage system releases obnoxious gases, forms suspended solids which interfere
with the sewage system, or creates a condition injurious to structures and
treatment processes.  The Director shall require all discharges to conform to
all NPDES permit requirements and any other applicable State or Federal
requirements.
      (5)   Any waters or wastes that create a hazard to humans or animals or
creates any hazard in the receiving waters of the Water Pollution Control
Center, or directly causes the City of Fremont to violate its NPDES permit.
   While direct limits for these wastes are usually included in a Wastewater
Contribution Permit, those users that are not required to have a Wastewater
Contribution Permit or that do not have a specific limit listed in the
Wastewater Contribution Permit shall not exceed background concentrations of
these wastes.
   These concentrations may be changed as necessary pursuant to applicable
promulgated limiting concentrations established by State or Federal agencies.
      (6)   Any radioactive wastes or isotopes of such half-lives or
concentrations to exceed State or Federal regulations.
      (7)   Quantities of flow, concentrations or both which constitute "slug"
as defined in Section
922.01(a)(30).
   (c)   No user shall ever increase the use of process water or in any way
attempt to dilute a discharge as a partial or complete substitute for adequate
treatment to achieve compliance with the limitations contained in the Federal
Categorical Pretreatment Standards, or in any other pollutant-specific
limitations developed by the City or State.
   (d)   Each user shall provide protection from accidental discharge of
prohibited materials or other substances regulated by this chapter.  Facilities
to prevent accidental discharge of prohibited materials shall be provided and
maintained at the owner or user's own cost and expense.  Detailed plans showing
facilities and operating procedures to provide this protection shall be
submitted to the City for review, and shall be approved by the City before
construction of the facility.  All affected existing users shall complete such
a plan within 180 days after the effective date of this chapter.  Review and
approval of such plans and procedures shall not relieve the industrial user
from the responsibility to modify the user's facility as necessary to meet the
requirements of this chapter.  In the case of an accidental discharge, the user
will be required to immediately notify the Director of the incident.  The
notification shall include location of discharge, type of waste, concentration,
volume and correction.
      (1)   Within five days following an accidental discharge, the user shall
submit to the Director a detailed written report describing the cause of the
discharge and measures to be taken by the user to prevent similar future
occurrences.  Such notification shall not relieve the user of any expense,
loss, damage, or other liability which may be incurred as a result of damage to
the sewage system, fish kills, or any other damage to person or property.  Such
notification shall not relieve the user of any fines, civil penalties or other
liability which may be imposed by its chapter or other applicable law.
   (e)   In the event that an industrial user experiences an "upset" that
causes a discharge of prohibited or limited materials regulated by this
chapter, the user shall notify the Director, the police, and the Fremont WPCC
immediately.  The notification shall include the location of the discharge,
type of wastes, concentration, volume and corrective action.  Within five days
following the "upset" discharge the user shall submit to the Director a
detailed written report, including the following facts:
      (1)   An upset occurred and the IU can identify the cause(s) of the
upset;
      (2)   The facility was at the time being operated in a prudent and
workmanlike manner and in compliance with applicable operation and maintenance
procedures;
      (3)   The IU has submitted the following information to the Fremont WPCC
within twenty-four hours of becoming aware of the upset;
         A.   A description of the indirect discharge and cause of non-
compliance.
         B.   The period of non-compliance including exact dates and times or,
if not corrected, the anticipated time the non-compliance is expected to
continue.
         C.   Steps being taken and/or planned to reduce, eliminate, and
prevent recurrence of the noncompliance.
   (f)   The Industrial User seeking to establish the affirmative defense of an
"upset" shall have the burden of proof.
   (g)   The Industrial User shall control production of all discharges to the
extent necessary to maintain compliance with Pretreatment Standards upon
reduction, loss, or failure of its treatment facility until the facility is
restored or an alternative method of treatment is provided.  This requirement
applies in the situation where, among other things, the primary source of power
of treatment facility is reduced, lost or fails.
   (h)   No person shall discharge or cause to be discharged any of the
following described water or wastes into the sewage system:
      (1)   Any gasoline benzene, naphtha, fuel oil, or other flammable or
explosives liquids, solids or gas or pollutants which create fire or explosion
hazard in the sewer system including but not limited to, wastestreams with a
closed cup flash point of less than 140 degrees Fahrenheit or 60 degrees
Centigrade using the test method specified in 40 CFR 261.21.
      (2)   Any water containing toxic or poisonous solids, liquids or gases in
sufficient quantity, either singly or by interaction with other wastes to
injure or interfere with any waste treatment processes, result in toxic gases,
vapors, or fumes, constitute a hazard to humans or animals, create a hazard in
the receiving water's of the Water Pollution Control Center.
      (3)   Any water or wastes having a pH lower than 6.0 or higher than 10.0
or as otherwise required.  For Industrial User (IU's) utilizing continuous pH
monitoring, the total time during which the pH values are outside the required
range of pH values shall not exceed one hour maximum on any day, and the total
time during which the pH values are outside the required range of pH values
shall not exeed 7 hours and 26 minutes in any calendar month.
      (4)   Solid viscous substances in quantities or of such size capable of
causing obstruction of flow in sewers or other interferences with the process
operation of the sewage system.
      (5)   No person shall access the sewer system or the Water Pollution
Control Center for any activity including discharge of hauled septic or
industrial waste except at locations and at times as designated by the Director
with the Director's approval.  Any removal of manhole lids, or other access to
the sewer system for the purpose of discharging wastes at times and/or location
other than those designated by the Director, or without the expressed
permission of the Director, shall be considered a violation and shall be
subject to the remedies specified in Section
922.04 and/or Section
 922.99.
      (6)   Any petroleum oil, nonbiodegradable cutting oil or products of
mineral oil origin in amounts that cause pass through or interference or of
concentrations of 50 mg/l, whichever is less, to be determined by approved
solvent extraction methods as prescribed in the most recent revision of 40 CFR
136.
   (i)   No person shall maliciously, willfully or negligently break, damage,
destroy, uncover, deface or tamper with any structure or equipment which is
part of the sewage system.
   (j)   (1)   Bypass is prohibited and the Director may initiate enforcement
activities against an IU for a bypass unless:
         A.   Bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life; personal injury
or severe property damage or;
         B.   There were no feasible alternatives to the bypass, such as the
use of auxiliary treatment facilities, retention of untreated wastes, or
maintenance during normal periods of equipment downtime.  This condition is not
satisfied if adequate back up equipment should have been installed in the
exercise of reasonable engineering judgement to prevent a bypass which occurred
during normal periods of equipment downtime or preventative maintenance and;
         C.   The IU submitted notices as required.
      (2)   An industrial user may allow bypass to occur which does not cause
Pretreatment Standards or requirements to be violated but only if it also is
for essential maintenance to assure efficient operation.
         A.   If an Industrial User knows in advance of the need for a bypass,
it shall submit prior notice to the Director, if possible, at least ten days
before the date of the bypass.
         B.   An Industrial User shall submit oral notice of an unanticipated
bypass that exceeds applicable Pretreatment Standards to the Director and
Fremont WPCC within twenty-four hours from the time the IU becomes aware of the
bypass.  A written submission must be provided within five days from the time
the IU becomes aware of the bypass.  The written submission shall contain a
description of the bypass, its cause, its duration, including exact times and
dates, and if the bypass has not been corrected, the anticipated time it is
expected to continue; and steps taken or planned to reduce, eliminate and
prevent recurrence of the bypass.  The Director may waive the written report on
a case-by-case basis if the oral report is received within twenty-four hours.
      (3)   The Director may approve an anticipated bypass, after considering
its adverse effects, if the Director determines that it will meet the
conditions listed in
922.03(j)(2).
   (k)   A notice shall be permanently posted on the user's bulletin board or
other prominent place advising employees whom to call in the event of a
dangerous discharge.  Employers shall insure that all employees who may cause
or suffer such a dangerous discharge to occur are advised of the emergency
notification procedure.

   922.04  REMEDIAL OPTIONS OF DIRECTOR; ADMINISTRATIVE FINDINGS AND ORDERS.
   (a)   If any wastewater discharged or proposed to be discharged into the
sewage system contains the substances or characteristics herein described, the
Director may:
      (1)   Suspend the wastewater treatment service and/or Wastewater
Contribution Permit when such suspension is necessary, in order to stop an
actual or threatened discharge which presents or may present an imminent
endangerment to the health or welfare of persons, causes interference to the
Water Pollution Control Center or its sludge program or causes the City to
violate its NPDES permit.  Any person or Significant Industrial User (SIU)
notified of the suspension of wastewater treatment service and/or the
Wastewater Contribution Permit shall immediately stop or eliminate the
contribution.  In the event of failure of the person or SIU to comply
voluntarily with the suspension order, the City shall take such steps as deemed
necessary including immediate severance of the sewer connection to prevent or
minimize damage to the sewage system or endangerment to any individuals.  The
City shall reinstate the Wastewater Contribution Permit and/or the wastewater
treatment service upon proof of elimination of the noncomplying discharge.  A
detailed written statement submitted by the user describing the causes of the
harmful contribution and the measures taken to prevent any future occurrence
shall be submitted to the City within fifteen days of the date of occurrence;
      (2)   Require pretreatment to an acceptable condition or acceptable
amount of contaminant before discharge into the sewage system;
      (3)   Require payment to cover added costs of handling and treating the
wastes not covered by existing charges;

   1113.06  FINAL PLAT.
   (a)   General.  The final plat shall incorporate all changes or
modifications required by the Planning Commission, otherwise it shall conform
to the preliminary plat.  The final plat may constitute only that portion of
the approved preliminary plat which the subdivider proposes to record and
develop at one (1) time, provided that such portion conforms with all
requirements of these rules and regulations.
   (b)   Professional Assistance.  The final plat shall be prepared by a
registered surveyor or licensed engineer.
   (c)   Filing.  The subdivider shall prepare and file the final plat for
approval with the Planning Commission, and as many copies as may be required by
the Commission.  The final plat shall be considered officially filed after it
is examined by the City Engineer and/or the County Engineer, if the proposed
subdivision lies within his jurisdiction, and is found to be in full compliance
with the formal provisions of these rules and regulations.
   The final plat shall be filed at least ten (10) working days prior to the
meeting at which it is to be considered.  The final plat shall be filed not
later than twelve (12) months after the date of approval of the preliminary
plat, otherwise it shall be considered void unless extended by formal action of
the Planning Commission.
   Together with the final plat, the subdivider shall submit a written
statement on proposed use of the subdivided property, cross-sections and
profiles of streets and construction drawings and the required certificates.
   (d)   Approval.  The Planning Commission shall take action on the final plat
within thirty (30) days after the same has been officially filed; otherwise the
plat shall be deemed to have been approved.  The certificate of the Planning
Commission as to the date of submission of the plat for approval and the
failure to take action within such time shall be sufficient in lieu of the
written endorsement or evidence of approval herein required.  If disapproved,
the grounds for disapproval of the final plat shall be stated on the record of
the Planning Commission including the reference to the regulation violated by
the plat, and a copy of such record of the Commission shall be forwarded to the
subdivider.  The subdivider shall make the necessary corrections and resubmit
the final plat within thirty (30) days to the Commission for its approval.
   The subdivider shall be given written notice of the final approval of the
plat by the Planning Commission.  The subdivider shall then present the plat to
Council for approval.
   Approval of the final plat by the Planning Commission shall not constitute
acceptance by the City of the dedication of any public street or open public
grounds shown upon the final plat.  (ORC 711.041)  The City Engineer and/or the
County Engineer, when the subdivision falls within his jurisdiction, shall,
upon written request by the owner of the land upon which the street has been
constructed, check the construction and if the Engineer finds that such street
has been constructed in accordance with the specifications set forth on the
approved plat, and that such street is in good repair, then such finding,
endorsed on the approved plat, shall constitute an acceptance of the street for
public use by the City and/or the County.
(ORC 711.091)
   (e)   Recording.  The subdivider shall record the final plat in the office
of the Recorder of Sandusky County within sixty (60) days after the date of
final approval, otherwise the final plat shall be considered void.
   The subdivider shall, immediately upon recording, file with the City
Engineer a reproducible copy of the final plat and all plans and profiles.
   No changes, erasures, modifications or revisions other than those requested
by the City Engineer and/or the County Engineer, or the County-City Board of
Health, or to correct metes and bounds, shall be made on the final plat after
final approval has been given by the Planning Commission and the final plat has
been recorded in the office of the County Recorder, unless such plat has first
been resubmitted to the Planning Commission and such change, erasure,
modification or revision has been first approved by the Commission.  Any final
plat so changed without first being submitted to the Commission and reapproved
shall institute proceedings to have the plat stricken from the records of the
County Recorder.
   Upon recording, the final plat shall thereupon be a sufficient conveyance to
vest in the City the fee of the parcel of land designated or intended for
streets, alleys, ways, commons or other public uses, to be held in the
corporate name in trust for the uses and purposes set forth in the instrument.

   (a)   Length.  No block shall be longer than 1,200 feet nor less than 500
feet, except in unusual circumstances when considered advisable by the Planning
Commission.  Where a subdivision adjoins a major thoroughfare, the greater
dimension of the block shall front along such major highway to minimize the
number of points of ingress or egress.
   (b)   Arrangement of Lots.  Blocks shall be arranged so as to provide two
(2) rows or tiers of lots.
   (c)   Crosswalks.  Where blocks are over 750 feet in length, a crosswalk

corner lots shall be discouraged.
      (4)   Corner lots.  Corner lots shall have a minimum frontage of seventy-
five (75) feet measured at the building line in order to permit adequate
setbacks.
   (c)   Side Lot Lines.  Side lot lines shall be at right angles to street
lines or radial to curved street lines and shall be straight, except where
variation because of topography or other circumstances will provide a better
subdivision layout.
   (d)   Corner Lot Radius.  All corner lots, whether at the intersection of
the rights of way of two (2) streets or of an alley and a street, shall have a
curve with a minimum radius of twenty (20) feet joining the two (2) sidelines
of such rights of way.
   (e)   Setback Line.
      (1)   On secondary and minor streets.  The minimum setback line shall be
twenty-five (25) feet measured from the property line, and shall be required in

five (35) feet on all major thoroughfares.
   (f)   Lots Using Septic Tanks.  Lots presently served with septic tanks may
continue in such use so long as such use is in compliance with the rules and
regulations of the City-County Health Board or until such lots are accessible
to a sewer, at which time such septic tank use shall terminate and connection
shall be made to the sewer.
(Ord. 1431.  Passed 1-18-73.)
   1115.05  COMMERCIAL OR INDUSTRIAL SITES.
   Where an overall design for a commercial or industrial section is submitted
for an area of three (3) acres or more, the Planning Commission may not require
the platting of individual lots.  In such case, the development plans for the
development shall be submitted to the Planning Commission for consideration and
approval prior to the filing of the application for building permits.
(Ord. 1310.  Passed 7-29-71.)
   1115.06  LARGE-SCALE DEVELOPMENTS.
   Large-scale developments, planned unit developments, multi-use and variable
density or cluster developments not otherwise anticipated by these rules and
regulations, shall be submitted to the Planning Commission for consideration.
(Ord. 1310.  Passed 7-29-71.)
   1115.07  PUBLIC SITES AND OPEN SPACES.
   (a)   Procedure for Allocating Open Space.  The allocation of areas for
parks, playgrounds, school sites and other public open spaces shall be by one
(1) of the following methods:
      (1)   Dedication to the City;
      (2)   Reservation of land for use of property owners by deed or
covenants.
   (b)   Conformance with the City Open Space Plan.  Conformance with the City
plan for parks and other open public grounds shall be required where a
designated site shown on the City plan is located in whole or in part within a
proposed subdivision.  The Planning Commission may request the subdivider to
dedicate or reserve such area which lies within the subdivision, provided that
the amount of land to be dedicated for park purposes shall not exceed ten
percent (10%) of the total area of the subdivision.
   (c)   Large-scale Developments.  For large-scale developments, the Planning
Commission may request the subdivider to dedicate or reserve sites for
playgrounds and parks whose character, extent and location will be suitable to
the needs created by such development, whether or not such sites are shown on
the City open space plan.  Such areas shall be in the judgment of the Planning
Commission, of reasonable size for the particular use.  In general, the
subdivider shall be required to set aside ten percent (10%) of the gross area
of the subdivision for this purpose.
   (d)   Money Payments.  In lieu of a provision of land for parks and
playgrounds, particularly where such public land will be too small for use, the
Planning Commission may request payment of money to the City.  This payment
must be not more than ten percent (10%) of the market value of the entire tract
prior to subdivision and cannot be used by the City except to create, improve,
expand or maintain public recreational uses serving the neighborhood created by
or including the subdivision.
   (e)   Surface Water Areas.
      (1)   Easement along streams.  Whenever any stream or important surface
drainage course is located within the area being subdivided, the subdivider
shall provide a permanent easement dedicated to the proper authority for the
purpose of widening, deepening, relocating, improving or protecting the stream
for drainage or public use.
      (2)   Flooding and poor drainage.  The right is reserved to disapprove
any subdivision which is subject to periodic flooding or which contains
extremely poor drainage facilities.  However, if the subdivider agrees to make
such improvements as will make the area completely safe for residential
occupancy, the subdivision may be approved, subject, however, to the approval
of the Planning Commission, the County-City Board of Health, and the City
Engineer and/or County Engineer when the subdivision falls within his
jurisdiction.
   (f)   Preservation of Outstanding Features.  The preservation of outstanding
features such as scenic spots, historic sites, watercourses or exceptionally
fine groves of trees shall be shown due regard.  Dedication to and acceptance
by a public agency is usually the best means of assuring their preservation.
(Ord. 1310.  Passed 7-29-71.)
   1115.08  VARIANCES.
   Where topography and other physical conditions make full compliance with the
subdivision design standards of this chapter an undue hardship upon the owner,
the Planning Commission may refer the problem of compliance to the City
Engineer and/or the County Engineer when the subdivision falls within his
jurisdiction, for recommendations as to possible variances.

   1133.01  ZONING DISTRICTS ESTABLISHED AND PURPOSES.
   The following zoning districts and their uses are established for the City
of Fremont, Ohio:
   (a)   Conservancy District.  The purpose of the Conservancy District is to
preserve areas of open space.  In some cases, construction shall be restricted
so as to protect lands necessary to convey floodwaters.
   (b)   R-1 Single-Family Residential District.  The purpose of the R-
1 District is to provide an area for medium to low density, residential
development.  The only permitted residential use shall be single-family.
   (c)   R-2 Mixed Residential District.  The purpose of the R-2 District is to
permit a variety of residential development in areas that can accommodate them
without disturbing the character of the surrounding neighborhoods.  Residential
uses permitted in the R-2 District include one- and two-family dwellings. 
Three-family dwellings may be permitted if a valid conditional use permit is
obtained.
   (d)   R-3 Multiple-Family Residential District.  The purpose of the R-
3 District is to provide areas for the introduction of multiple-family
residential development including apartment buildings, condominiums,
manufactured home parks and other similar developments.
   (e)   R-O Residential/Office District.  The purpose of the R-O District is
to provide increased flexibility to those areas that are intermediate between
commercial and residential areas.
   (f)   PUD (Planned Unit Development) District.  The purpose of the PUD
District is to establish a permissive zoning procedure for the development of
new tracts of residential development on a planned unit basis in accordance
with an approved, overall development plan.  The intent is to be flexible in
the regulation of the basic land planning and to encourage imaginative site
planning that provides both a variety of dwelling types and lot sizes and
usable common open space as an integral part of the development.
   (g)   B-1 CBD Central Business District.  The purpose of the B-1 CBD
District is to encourage the viability of the commercial core of the City of
Fremont.  By locating more intensive commercial uses in close proximity to each
other, each use will support and benefit the others.
   (h)   B-2 General Commercial District.  The purpose of the B-2 District is
to accommodate extensive commercial uses that require large lots, usually for
display and/or outdoor storage purposes, and highway oriented businesses that
require highway or thoroughfare frontage for visibility and ready accessibility
for their customers who come from a sizeable trade area extending well beyond
the City of Fremont.
   (i)   I-1 Wholesaling and Light Industry District.  The purpose of the I-
1 District is to allow for wholesale operations and limited nuisance industry.
   (j)   I-2 General Industrial District.  The purpose of the I-2 District is
to reflect the existing pattern of industrial establishments in the community,
to allow for their future expansion and to delineate additional industrial land
for new industry.  The intent is to designate those lands that have the best
industrial development potential by virtue of good access to the State highway
network and/or railroad right of way, that are capable of being fully served by
all necessary utilities, and are somewhat removed from adjacent residential
development and housing.
      (Ord. 85-2391.  Passed 12-5-85.)
   (k)   Hospital Zone (H).  The purpose of the Hospital “H” District is to
provide for adequate maintenance and growth of the existing hospital and
related facilities in a manner compatible with surrounding residential
neighborhoods.  To this end, the district will permit hospital facilities and
certain other health service accessory uses designed to be subordinate to and
supportive of hospital facilities.  The district requires that all hospital and
related allowable uses be designed to preserve the residential character of
adjoining areas.  This is to be accomplished in part by requiring adequate
parking, landscaped buffers, usable open space, yard areas and other design
features minimizing the impact of these medically related uses on neighboring
residential properties.  The district also permits low-density residential
dwellings where necessary as interim uses and prohibits intrusive uses or
buildings which would be in conflict with the purposes stated above. (Ord. 94-
2867.  Passed 8-18-94.)
   1133.02  CONFORMITY WITH DISTRICT REGULATIONS.
   No building or structure shall be erected or altered, nor any land within
the corporate limits used, except when in conformity with the regulations
prescribed for the districts established by this chapter and designated by the
official Zoning Map.

to the current zoning status of land areas within the City.
   1134.03  AMENDMENTS AND CORRECTIONS OF OFFICIAL ZONING MAP.

   1134.04  INTERPRETATION OF BOUNDARIES.
   (a)   Where zoning district boundaries are delineated to follow or
approximately follow property lines, such property lines shall be considered as
the district boundaries.
   (b)   Where the zoning district boundaries are shown to follow or
approximately follow the centerlines or right-of-way lines of highways, streets
or alleys, such centerlines or right-of-way lines shall be considered as the
district boundaries.
   (c)   Whenever any highway, street, alley, railroad or other public right of
way is officially abandoned by the City, the adjoining zoning district boundary
shall be automatically extended to the centerline of the abandoned right of
way, and such area shall become subject to the regulations of the zoning
district in which it is located.  If only a portion of a right of way is
abandoned, the adjoining zoning district boundary, or the district boundary
nearest the abandoned area shall be extended.
   (d)   Where zoning district boundaries are delineated to be parallel or
approximately parallel to the centerlines or right-of-way lines, the district
boundary shall be considered as being parallel thereto, at the same distance
indicated on the official Zoning Map.  When no dimension is shown on the map,
the distance shall be determined in accordance with the scale shown on the
official Zoning Map.

   1139.01  INTENT.
   At the time of the adoption of this Zoning Ordinance, there exist lots of
record, structures and uses of structures and land which do not conform to the
requirements of this Zoning Ordinance.  While such conditions are generally
permitted to continue, the purpose of this chapter is to:
   (a)   Set forth specific procedures and requirements controlling the
continuation, expansion or alteration of such nonconformities, and in certain
cases, to establish specific requirements to eliminate such conditions.
   (b)   Encourage the improvement and maintenance of nonconformities in order
to maintain the quality and the character of zoning districts.
   1139.02  GENERAL COMPLIANCE STANDARDS.
   (a)   Nonconforming buildings, structures or uses shall not be extended,
enlarged, restored, structurally altered, moved to another zoning lot or
relocated within the same lot except in conformance with the regulations of
this chapter.
   (b)   The change in ownership of a nonconforming building, structure, use or
lot of record does not, in itself, require the nonconformity to be corrected.
   (c)   Nonconforming uses which have been discontinued or structures
containing nonconforming uses removed for a period of eighteen (18) consecutive
months shall not be re-established except in conformity with the requirements
of this Zoning Ordinance.  Nonconforming uses include use of land, structures
and/or equipment and fixtures.
   (d)   If any nonconforming building, structure or use is damaged to the
extent that the use or occupation cannot continue, the right to maintain the
nonconformity shall terminate unless it can be re-established or occupied
within eighteen (18) months for one-, two or three-family dwelling units and
their accessory uses/buildings or within twenty-four (24) months for all other
structures or uses and re-established in conformance with district
requirements.
   1139.03  NONCONFORMING LOTS OF RECORD.
   Any lot of record existing at the effective date of adoption of this Zoning
Ordinance or any of its subsequent amendments, which does not conform to the
lot requirements of the districts in which it is located, is to be considered
to be a nonconforming lot of record.
   (a)   Where there exists one (1) nonconforming lot of record in single
ownership, with frontage along a public right of way, such shall be considered
a buildable lot for the district in which it is located.  However, any use
shall comply with the other requirements pertaining to the use and district.
   (b)   Where two (2) or more contiguous, nonconforming, vacant lots of record
are in single ownership, the Zoning Inspector may require replatting to
minimize the nonconformity.  The replatted lots shall be approved by the
Planning Commission and once approved, the replatted lots shall be considered
as having met the lot size requirements of this Zoning Ordinance.  The number
of replatted lots of record shall at least equal one-half (1/2) of the original
number of lots of record.
   1139.04  NONCONFORMING STRUCTURES.
   Where a lawful structure exists, at the effective date of adoption or
amendment of this Zoning Ordinance, that could not be built under the terms of
this Zoning Ordinance, such structure may be continued so long as it remains
otherwise lawful, provided that any enlargement or alteration of nonconforming
buildings or structures does not increase its nonconformity.  For purposes of
this section, increasing a nonconformity does not include extensions of
existing nonconformities assuming no other variances are required.
   1139.05  NONCONFORMING USES.
   Where otherwise lawful uses of land or structures exist at the effective
date of adoption of this Zoning Ordinance, or amendments thereto, which would
not be permitted by the regulation contained in this Zoning Ordinance, such
uses may be continued so long as they remain otherwise lawful, provided:
   (a)   Any nonconforming use may, upon approval by the Board of Zoning
Appeals, be expanded not to exceed twenty-five percent (25%) of the ground
floor square footage as comprised in the original nonconforming use, provided
that such expansion conforms to all other zoning requirements pertaining to the
use as determined by the Board.  The expansion of a nonconforming use located
within a nonconforming building or structure shall comply with the requirements
of Section
1139.04.
   (b)   A change from one (1) nonconforming use to another may be permitted,
provided that the Board of Zoning Appeals determines that the adverse effects
of the proposed use do not exceed those of the previous use.  In making that
determination, the Board shall insure that the proposed nonconforming use will
not exceed the existing nonconforming use in terms of generation by employees
or customers, parking requirements and any other pertinent criteria.
   (c)   The Board of Zoning Appeals may hold a public hearing to consider the
application, but is not required to do so.  If a public hearing is held, the
public notice requirements found in Section
1159.02(c) and (d) shall be followed.
   (d)   A request for change in the nonconforming use of a lot or structure
shall be accompanied by a complete application and fee.  Review process shall
follow the procedures set for in Section
1159.02.
   (e)   Any use of a specific property which is conditionally permitted in a
zoning district in accordance with the provisions of this Zoning Ordinance
shall not be considered as a nonconforming use in the zoning district in which
it is conditionally permitted.  Such conditionally permitted use shall be
considered a conforming use on the particular lot on which it is located, if it
meets all of the requirements of the district in which it is located.
   (f)   A nonconforming business may expand its off-street parking area on to
an adjacent lot or lots providing that the buffering requirements of Section
 1149.04 are met and the Board of Zoning Appeals follows procedures of Chapter
1137 and issue a conditional use permit.
   (g)   Any other expansion of a nonconforming use shall not be allowed into
adjacent lots purchased after the Zoning Ordinance made the original building a
nonconforming use or into adjacent lots previously owned by the same land owner
and used in conformity with the Zoning Ordinance and which did not qualify as a
nonconforming use.

   1150.01  INTENT.
   This Chapter is intended to improve and protect the environment, character
and value of surrounding neighborhoods by providing for the installation and
maintenance of landscaping and the preservation of natural plant growth. The
provision of landscaping and the retention of natural plant growth reduces
erosion, provides natural water retention and filtration, provides shade,
abatement of noise, glare, buffers incompatible uses, aids in urban temperature
control and improves the aesthetic quality of a community. Side landscaping
will also assist traffic control, both vehicular and pedestrian, thereby
promoting the public health, safety and general welfare. The guidelines listed
below are intended to be used in conjunction with rather than substitute for
Chapter
1149 Off-Street Parking and Loading. The provisions of this section are minimum

receipt by the office of the Zoning Inspector.  The filing of an administrative
appeal shall stay all proceedings in furtherance of the action appealed from,
unless the Zoning Inspector certifies to the Board that, by reason of the facts
presented in the application, a stay would cause imminent peril to life and
property.
   (e)   The Board shall render any decision as follows:
      (1)   For administrative appeals, the Board shall reverse, affirm or
modify the order, requirement, decision or determination that is being

applicant.

   1163.01  NOTICE OF VIOLATION.
   The Zoning Inspector shall give written notice, by certified mail, return
receipt requested, or by other means, to ensure actual notice to persons
responsible for any alleged violation.  Such notice shall state the reasons why
the Zoning Inspector believes there is a violation in fact and shall require an
answer or a correction of the alleged violation, as determined by the Zoning
Inspector, within a reasonable time limit set by the Zoning Inspector.  The
notice shall also state, and it is hereby declared, that failure to reply or
correct the alleged violation to the satisfaction of the Zoning Inspector
within the set time limit constitutes an admission of the violation.
   1163.02  RESPONSE TO NOTICE OF VIOLATION.
   The manner in which persons responsible for an alleged violation of this
Zoning Ordinance respond to the notice of violation shall determine the course
of action taken by the Zoning Inspector as follows:
   (a)   Correction of Violation Within Time Limit.  If, within the time limit
set, the alleged violation is corrected, as determined by the Zoning Inspector,
"violation corrected" shall be noted on his copy of the notice and retained as
official City records.
   (b)   Petition for Appeal.  If, within the time limit set, persons
responsible for the alleged violation petition the Board of Zoning Appeals for
an administrative review to determine whether or not there is an error by the
Zoning Inspector in regard to the interpretation of this Zoning Ordinance, then
no legal action shall be initiated by the City against those responsible for
the alleged violation until after the Board has made its determination.
   (c)   Request for Extension of Time.  If a reply is received within the time
limit set indicating that an alleged violation will be corrected, but that more
time is required than was granted by the original notice, the Zoning Inspector
may grant an extension of time, if he deems such extension is warranted by the
circumstances of the case, and if such extension will not, in his opinion,
cause imminent peril to life, health or property.  In acting on such a request,
the Zoning Inspector shall state his reasons in writing, for granting or
refusing to grant the extension and shall transmit the same by certified mail,
return receipt requested, or other means to ensure actual notice, to those to
whom original notice was sent.
   (d)   No Correction and No Reply.  If there is no reply within the time
limit set, thus establishing an admission of the violation as provided in
Section
1163.01 , and the alleged violation is not corrected to the satisfaction of the
Zoning Inspector within the time limit set, he shall take or cause to be taken
such action as is warranted by the continuation of an admitted violation.

Chairman and Vice Chairman shall be choosen by a majority vote of the Board.
   (c)   The Secretary of the Board shall be appointed by the Mayor and may be
an employee of the City.
   (d)   The Mayor may recommend the removal of any member of the Board for
neglect of duty or malfeasance in office to Council.  Council may remove a
member of the Board from office by an affirmative vote of at least three-
quarters of Council only after having first given to such member a written copy
of the charges against him and an opportunity to be publicly heard in person or
by counsel in his own defense; and any such removal shall be final.  The
procedure of such public hearing and any further provisions regarding removal
shall be governed by the Civil Service Rules of the City.
   (e)   Two members of the Board shall constitute a quorum for the purpose of
conducting the business thereof.  A vacancy on the Board shall not impair the
right of the other members to exercise all the power of the Board.
   (f)   Each member of the Board shall serve without salary, but shall be paid
necessary and actual expenses expended in performing the business of the Board.
   (g)   The Board is charged with the following duties to implement the stated
policy of this chapter:

perform those duties with which it is charged under the terms of this chapter.
         (Ord. 84-2312.  Passed 5-17-84.)
   1305.06  PROCEDURES AND ENFORCEMENT.
   (a)   Any person subjected to an unlawful housing practice may file within
360 days of the alleged violation with the Board a complaint in writing, sworn
to or affirmed, which shall state:
      (1)   The name and address of the person aggrieved;
      (2)   The name and address of the person against whom the complaint is
filed;
      (3)   A description and the address of the dwelling, which involves the
alleged discriminatory housing practice; and
      (4)   A concise statement of the facts, including pertinent dates,
constituting the alleged discriminatory housing practice, and such other
information as may be required by the Board.
   The complaint may be reasonably and fairly amended.  The Board may also
corroborate or initiate complaints on the basis of studies carried out by its
staff or volunteers authorized by the Board.
   (b)   Upon the filing of a complaint the Secretary of the Board shall make
such investigations as he deems appropriate to ascertain facts and issues. 
Such investigations shall be conducted within fourteen business days after the
filing of the complaint.  The investigations may be extended when deemed
necessary by the Chairman of the Fair Housing Board.  If the Secretary
determines that there are reasonable grounds to believe a violation has
occurred, he shall attempt to conciliate the matter by methods of initial
conference and persuasion with all interested parties and such representatives
as the parties may choose to assist them.  Conciliation conferences shall be
informal and nothing said or done during such initial conference shall be made
public by any member of the Board or its staff unless the parties agree thereto
in writing.
   (c)   The terms of conciliation agreed to by the parties shall be reduced to
writing and incorporated into a consent agreement to be signed by the parties,
which agreement is for conciliation purposes only and does not constitute an
admission by any party that the law has been violated.  Consent agreements
shall be signed on behalf of the Board by its chairman.
   (d)   The Board is authorized to seek the cooperation and aid of the Ohio
Real Estate Commission, Ohio Civil Rights Commission or the U.S. Department of
Housing and Urban Development and any other person or group regarding any
matter before the Board.
   (e)   If the Secretary determines that the complaint lacks reasonable
grounds upon which to base a violation of this chapter, he shall so inform the
Board and the Board may in its discretion, dismiss such complaint or order such
further investigation as may be necessary.  The Board shall not dismiss such
complaint without first affording either party an opportunity to appear before
the Board.
   (f)   If the Secretary, with respect to a matter which involves a violation
of this chapter, fails to conciliate a complaint after the parties have in good
faith attempted such conciliation, fails to effect an informal conciliation
agreement or a formal consent agreement or determines that a complaint is not
susceptible of conciliation,  he shall so notify the Board and the Board shall
thereafter schedule a public hearing to determine whether a violation of this
chapter has been committed.  The Board shall serve upon the respondent a
written statement of charges and a summons and shall serve upon all interested
parties a notice of the time and place of the hearing.  The respondent or his
authorized counsel may file and amend such statements with the Board prior to
the hearing date as it deems necessary in support of its position.  The hearing
shall be opened to the public.  The hearing shall be held not less than fifteen
calendar days nor more than thirty calendar days after service of the statement
of charges and summons.  The summons so issued shall be signed by two members
of the Board and the issuance of such summons shall require the attendance of
named persons and the production of relevant documents and records.  The
failure to comply with a summons shall constitute a violation of this chapter. 
The interested parties may, at their option, appear before the Board in person
or by a duly authorized representative and may have the assistance of any
attorney.  The parties may present testimony and evidence, and the right to
cross examine witnesses shall be preserved.  All testimony and evidence shall
be given under oath or by affirmation.  The Secretary shall keep a full record
of the hearing, which record shall be public and open to inspection by any
person, and upon request by any principal party to the proceeding, the Board
shall furnish such party a copy of the hearing record, at such cost as the
Board deems appropriate.
   (g)   If at the conclusion of the hearing, the Board determines upon the
preponderance of the evidence that the person complained against has violated
this chapter, the Board shall, after consultation with the Law Director in
executive session, state its findings to and cause the Law Director to prepare
and issue an order under Board directive requiring the person complained
against to cease and desist from such unlawful conduct and to take such
affirmative action as shall effectuate the purpose of this chapter, with notice
that if the Board upon investigation by the Secretary determines that the
person complained against has not, after fifteen calendar days following
service of the Board's order, complied with the order, the Board shall
recertify the matter to the Law Director for enforcement.
   The Law Director shall seek compliance by appropriate civil action brought
in the name of the Fair Housing Board of the City before a court of competent
jurisdiction.
   (h)   If at the conclusion of the hearing the Board determines upon the
preponderance of the evidence of the record that the person complained against
has not violated this chapter the Board  shall so state and publish its
findings and issue its orders dismissing the complaint.
(Ord. 84-2312.  Passed 5-17-84.)
   1305.99  PENALTY.
   In any proceeding where the court determines that there has been a violation
of this chapter, the court shall award compensatory damages and where
appropriate, punitive damages of not more than one thousand dollars ($1,000)
along with attorney fees and court costs.  The court may also order such other
relief as it deems necessary or appropriate which may include, but is not
limited to, issuance of any permanent or temporary injunction, temporary
restraining order or other order.

   1307.01  DEFINITIONS.
   Unless specifically defined below, words or phrases used in these
regulations shall be interpreted so as to give them the meaning they have in
common usage and to give these regulations the most reasonable application.
   (a)   “Accessory Structure” means a structure on the same lot with, and of a
nature customarily incidental and subordinate to, the principal structure.
   (b)   “Appeal” means a request for review of the Floodplain Administrator's
interpretation of any provision of these regulations or a request for a
variance.
   (c)   “Base Flood” means the flood having a one percent (1%) chance of being
equaled or exceeded in any given year.  The base flood may also be referred to
as the one percent (1%) chance annual flood or one hundred (100) year flood.
   (d)   “Base (100-Year) Flood Elevation (BFE)” means the water surface
elevation of the base flood in relation to a specified datum, usually the
National Geodetic Vertical Datum of 1929 or the North American Vertical Datum
of 1988, and usually expressed in Feet Mean Sea Level (MSL).  In Zone AO areas,
the base flood elevation is the natural grade elevation plus the depth number
(from 1 to 3 feet).
   (e)   “Basement” means any area of the building having its floor subgrade
(below ground level) on all sides.
   (f)   “Development” means any manmade change to improved or unimproved real
estate, including but not limited to buildings or other structures, mining,
dredging, filling, grading, paving, excavation or drilling operations or
storage of equipment or materials.
   (g)   “Enclosure Below the Lowest Floor.”  See “Lowest Floor.”
   (h)   “Executive Order 11988 (Floodplain Management).” Issued by President
Carter in 1977, this order requires that no federally assisted activities be
conducted in or have the potential to affect identified special flood hazard
areas, unless there is no practicable alternative.
   (i)   “Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA)” means the agency with the
overall responsibility for administering the National Flood Insurance Program.
   (j)   “Fill” means a deposit of earth material placed by artificial means.
   (k)   “Flood” or “Flooding” means a general and temporary condition of
partial or complete inundation of normally dry land areas from:
      (1)   The overflow of inland or tidal waters, and/or
      (2)   The unusual and rapid accumulation or runoff of surface waters from
any source.
   (l)   “Flood Hazard Boundary Map (FHBM)” means usually the initial map,
produced by the Federal Emergency Management Agency, or U.S. Department of
Housing and Urban Development, for a community depicting approximate special
flood hazard areas.
   (m)   “Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM)” means an official map on which the
Federal Emergency Management Agency or the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban
Development has delineated the areas of special flood hazard.
   (n)   “Flood Insurance Risk Zones” means zone designations on FHBMs and
FIRMs that indicate the magnitude of the flood hazard in specific areas of a
community.  Following are the zone definitions:
   Zone A:  Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year flood; base
flood elevations are not determined.
   Zones A1-30 and Zone AE:  Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-
year flood; base flood elevations are determined.
   Zone AO:  Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year flood; with
flood depths of 1 to 3 feet (usually sheet flow on sloping terrain); average
depths are determined.
   Zone AH:  Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year flood; flood
depths of 1 to 3 feet (usually areas of ponding); base flood elevations are
determined.
   Zone A99:  Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year flood to be
protected from the 100-year flood by a Federal flood protection system under
construction; no base flood elevations are determined.
   Zone B and Zone X (shaded):  Areas of 500-year flood; areas subject to the
100-year flood with average depths of less than 1 foot or with contributing
drainage area less than 1 square mile; and areas protected by levees from the
base flood.
   Zone C and Zone X (unshaded):  Areas determined to be outside the 500-year
floodplain.
   (o)   “Flood Insurance Study (FIS)” means the official report in which the
Federal Emergency Management Agency or the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban
Development has provided flood profiles, floodway boundaries (sometimes shown
on Flood Boundary and Floodway Maps), and the water surface elevations of the
base flood.
   (p)   “Flood Protection Elevation” means the Flood Protection Elevation, or
FPE, is the base flood elevation plus one (1) foot of freeboard.  In areas
where no base flood elevations exist from any authoritative source, the flood
protection elevation can be historical flood elevations, or base flood
elevations determined and/or approved by the floodplain administrator.
   (q)   “Floodway” means the channel of a river or other watercourse and the
adjacent land areas that have been reserved in order to pass the base flood
discharge.  A floodway is typically determined through a hydraulic and
hydrologic engineering analysis such that the cumulative increase in the water
surface elevation of the base flood discharge is no more than a designated
height. In no case shall the designated height be more than one foot at any
point within the community.  The floodway is an extremely hazardous area, and
is usually characterized by any of the following: Moderate to high velocity
flood waters, high potential for debris and projectile impacts, and moderate to
high erosion forces.
   (r)   “Freeboard” means a factor of safety usually expressed in feet above a
flood level for the purposes of floodplain management.  Freeboard tends to
compensate for the many unknown factors that could contribute to flood heights
greater than the height calculated for a selected size flood and floodway
conditions, such as wave action, obstructed bridge openings, debris and ice
jams, and the hydrologic effect of urbanization in a watershed.
   (s)   “Historic structure” means any structure that is:
      (1)   Listed individually in the National Register of Historic Places (a
listing maintained by the U.S. Department of Interior) or preliminarily
determined by the Secretary of the Interior as meeting the requirements for
individual listings on the National Register;
      (2)   Certified or preliminarily determined by the Secretary of the
Interior as contributing to the historical significance of a registered
historic district or a district preliminarily determined by the Secretary to
qualify as a registered historic district; or
      (3)   Individually listed on the State of Ohio's inventory of historic
places maintained by the Ohio Historic Preservation Office.
      (4)   Individually listed on the inventory of historic places maintained
by City of Fremont’s historic preservation program, which program is certified
by the Ohio Historic Preservation Office.
   (t)   “Hydrologic and hydraulic engineering analysis” means an analysis
performed by a professional engineer, registered in the State of Ohio, in
accordance with standard engineering practices as accepted by FEMA, used to
determine flood elevations and/or floodway boundaries.
   (u)   “Letter of Map Change (LOMC)” is an official FEMA determination, by
letter, to amend or revise effective Flood Insurance Rate Maps, Flood Boundary
and Floodway Maps, and Flood Insurance Studies.  LOMCs are broken down into the
following categories:
   “Letter of Map Amendment (LOMA)” means a revision based on technical data
showing that a property was incorrectly included in a designated special flood
hazard area.  A LOMA amends the current effective Flood Insurance Rate Map and
establishes that a specific property is not located in a special flood hazard
area.
   “Letter of Map Revision (LOMR)”  means a revision based on technical data
that, usually due to manmade changes, shows changes to flood zones, flood
elevations, floodplain and floodway delineations, and planimetric features. 
One common type of LOMR, a LOMR-F, is a determination concerning whether a
structure or parcel has been elevated by fill above the base flood elevation
and is, therefore, excluded from the special flood hazard area.
   “Conditional Letter of Map Revision (CLOMR)”  means a formal review and
comment by FEMA as to whether a proposed project complies with the minimum
National Flood Insurance Program floodplain management criteria.  A CLOMR does
not amend or revise effective Flood Insurance Rate Maps, Flood Boundary and
Floodway Maps, or Flood Insurance Studies.
   (v)   “Lowest floor” means the lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area
(including basement) of a structure.  This definition excludes an "enclosure
below the lowest floor" which is an unfinished or flood resistant enclosure
usable solely for parking of vehicles, building access or storage, in an area
other than a basement area, provided that such enclosure is built in accordance
with the applicable design requirements specified in these regulations for
enclosures below the lowest floor.
   (w)   “Manufactured home” means a structure, transportable in one or more
sections, which is built on a permanent chassis and is designed for use with or
without a permanent foundation when connected to the required utilities.  The
term "manufactured home" does not include a "recreational vehicle."  For the
purposes of these regulations, a manufactured home includes manufactured homes
and mobile homes as defined in Chapter 3733 of the Ohio Revised Code.
   (x)   “Manufactured home park,” as specified in the Ohio Administrative Code
3701-27-01, means any tract of land upon which three or more manufactured
homes, used for habitation are parked, either free of charge or for revenue
purposes, and includes any roadway, building, structure, vehicle, or enclosure
used or intended for use as part of the facilities of the park.  A tract of
land that is subdivided and the individual lots are not for rent or rented, but
are for sale or sold for the purpose of installation of manufactured homes on
the lots, is not a manufactured home park, even though three or more
manufactured homes are parked thereon, if the roadways are dedicated to the
local government authority.
   (y)   “National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP)” means a Federal program
enabling property owners in participating communities to purchase insurance
protection against losses from flooding.  This insurance is designed to provide
an insurance alternative to disaster assistance to meet the escalating costs of
repairing damage to buildings and their contents caused by floods.
Participation in the NFIP is based on an agreement between local communities
and the Federal government that states if a community will adopt and enforce
floodplain management regulations to reduce future flood risks to all
development in special flood hazard areas, the Federal government will make
flood insurance available within the community as a financial protection
against flood loss.
   (z)   “New construction” means structures for which the "start of
construction" commenced on or after the initial Flood Regulations effective
date, April 16, 1987, and includes any subsequent improvements to such
structures.
   (aa)   “Person” includes any individual or group of individuals,
corporation, partnership, association, or any other entity, including state and
local governments and agencies.  An agency is further defined in the Ohio
Revised Code Section 111.15 as any governmental entity of the state and
includes, but is not limited to, any board, department, division, commission,
bureau, society, council, institution, state college or university, community
college district, technical college district, or state community college. 
"Agency" does not include the general assembly, the controlling board, the
adjutant general's department, or any court.
   (bb)   “Recreational vehicle” means a vehicle which is:
      (1)    Built on a single chassis,
      (2)    400 square feet or less when measured at the largest horizontal
projection,
      (3)    Designed to be self- propelled or permanently towable by a light
duty truck, and
      (4)    Designed primarily not for use as a permanent dwelling but as
temporary living quarters for recreational, camping, travel, or seasonal use.
   (cc)   “Registered Professional Architect” means a person registered to
engage in the practice of architecture under the provisions of sections 4703.01
to 4703.19 of the Revised Code.
   (dd)   “Registered Professional Engineer” means a person registered as a
professional engineer under Chapter 4733 of the Revised Code.
   (ee)   “Registered Professional Surveyor” means a person registered as a
professional surveyor under Chapter 4733 of the Revised Code.
   (ff)   “Special Flood Hazard Area,” also known as “Areas of Special Flood
Hazard”, means the land in the floodplain subject to a one percent (1%) or
greater chance of flooding in any given year.  Special flood hazard areas are
designated by the Federal Emergency Management Agency on Flood Insurance Rate
Maps, Flood Insurance Studies, Flood Boundary and Floodway Maps and Flood
Hazard Boundary Maps as Zones A, AE, AH, AO, A1 30, and A99.  Special flood
hazard areas may also refer to areas that are flood prone and designated from
other federal state or local sources of data including but not limited to
historical flood information reflecting high water marks, previous flood
inundation areas, and flood prone soils associated with a watercourse.
   (gg)   “Start of construction” means the date the building permit was
issued, provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction,
rehabilitation, addition, placement, or other improvement was within 180 days
of the permit date.  The actual start means either the first placement of
permanent construction of a structure on a site, such as the pouring of slab or
footings, the installation of piles, the construction of columns, or any work
beyond the stage of excavation; or the placement of a manufactured home on a
foundation.  Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as
clearing, grading, and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets
and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings,
piers, or foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include
the installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or
sheds not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main structure.  For a
substantial improvement, the actual start of construction means the first
alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building,
whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of a building.
   (hh)   “Structure” means a walled and roofed building, manufactured home, or
gas or liquid storage tank that is principally above ground.
   (ii)   “Substantial Damage” means damage of any origin sustained by a
structure whereby the cost of restoring the structure to its before damaged
condition would equal or exceed fifty percent (50%) of the market value of the
structure before the damage occurred.
   (jj)   “Substantial Improvement” means any reconstruction, rehabilitation,
addition, or other improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or
exceeds fifty percent (50%) of the market value of the structure before the
"start of construction" of the improvement.  This term includes structures,
which have incurred "substantial damage," regardless of the actual repair work
performed.  The term does not, however, include:
      (1)   Any improvement to a structure that is considered "new
construction,"
      (2)   Any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing
violations of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications
which have been identified prior to the application for a development permit by
the local code enforcement official and which are the minimum necessary to
assure safe living conditions; or
      (3)   Any alteration of a "historic structure," provided that the
alteration would not preclude the structure's continued designation as a
"historic structure."
   (kk)   “Variance” means a grant of relief from the standards of these
regulations consistent with the variance conditions herein.
   (ll)   “Violation” means the failure of a structure or other development to
be fully compliant with these regulations.
      (Ord. 2011-3547.  Passed 4-7-11.)
   1307.02  GENERAL PROVISIONS.
   (a)   Statutory Authorization.  Article XVIII, Section 3 of the Ohio
Constitution grants municipalities the legal authority to adopt land use and
control measures for promoting the health, safety, and general welfare of its
citizens.  Therefore, the Council of the City of Fremont, State of Ohio, does
ordain as follows:
   (b)   Findings of Fact.  The City of Fremont has special flood hazard areas
that are subject to periodic inundation, which may result in loss of life and
property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental
services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief,
and impairment of the tax base.  Additionally, structures that are inadequately
elevated, floodproofed, or otherwise protected from flood damage also
contribute to the flood loss.  In order to minimize the threat of such damages
and to achieve the purposes hereinafter set forth, these regulations are
adopted.
   (c)   Statement of Purpose.  It is the purpose of these regulations to
promote the public health, safety and general welfare, and to:
      (1)   Protect human life and health;
      (2)   Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control
projects;
      (3)   Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with
flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
      (4)   Minimize prolonged business interruptions;
      (5)   Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water
and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located
in areas of special flood hazard;
      (6)   Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the proper use and
development of areas of special flood hazard so as to protect property and
minimize future flood blight areas;
      (7)   Ensure that those who occupy the areas of special flood hazard
assume responsibility for their actions;
      (8)   Minimize the impact of development on adjacent properties within
and near flood prone areas;
      (9)   Ensure that the flood storage and conveyance functions of the
floodplain are maintained;
      (10)   Minimize the impact of development on the natural, beneficial
values of the floodplain;
      (11)   Prevent floodplain uses that are either hazardous or
environmentally incompatible; and
      (12)   Meet community participation requirements of the National Flood
Insurance Program.
   (d)   Methods of Reducing Flood Loss.  In order to accomplish its purposes,
these regulations include methods and provisions for:
      (1)   Restricting or prohibiting uses which are dangerous to health,
safety, and property due to water hazards, or which result in damaging
increases in flood heights or velocities;
      (2)   Requiring that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities,
which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction;
      (3)   Controlling the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels,
and natural protective barriers, which help accommodate or channel floodwaters;
      (4)   Controlling filling, grading, dredging, excavating, and other
development which may increase flood damage; and,
      (5)   Preventing or regulating the construction of flood barriers, which
will unnaturally divert flood, waters or which may increase flood hazards in
other areas.
   (e)   Lands to Which These Regulations Apply.  These regulations shall apply
to all areas of special flood hazard within the jurisdiction of the City of
Fremont as identified in Section
1307.02(f), including any additional areas of special flood hazard annexed by
the City of Fremont.
   (f)   Basis for Establishing the Areas of Special Flood Hazard.  For the
purposes of these regulations, the following studies and/or maps are adopted:
      (1)   The “Flood Insurance Study Sandusky County, Ohio and Incorporated
Areas” and “Flood Insurance Rate Map Sandusky County, Ohio and Incorporated
Areas” both effective April 18, 2011.
      (2)   Other studies and/or maps, which may be relied upon for
establishment of the flood protection elevation, delineation of the 100-year
floodplain, floodways or delineation of other areas of special flood hazard.
      (3)   Any hydrologic and hydraulic engineering analysis authored by a
registered Professional Engineer in the State of Ohio which has been approved
by the City of Fremont as required by Section
1307.05(c) Subdivisions and Large Scale Developments.
   Any revisions to the aforementioned maps and/or studies are hereby adopted
by reference and declared to be a part of these regulations.  Such maps and/or
studies are on file at the City of Fremont, 323 South Front Street.
   (g)   Abrogation and Greater Restrictions.  These regulations are not
intended to repeal any existing ordinances including Subdivision Regulations,
Zoning or Building Codes.  In the event of a conflict between these regulations
and any other ordinance, the more restrictive shall be followed.  These
regulations shall not impair any deed restriction, covenant or easement but the
land subject to such interests shall also be governed by the regulations.
   (h)   Interpretation.  In the interpretation and application of these
regulations, all provisions shall be:
      (1)   Considered as minimum requirements;
      (2)   Liberally construed in favor of the governing body; and,
      (3)   Deemed neither to limit nor repeal any other powers granted under
state statutes.  Where a provision of these regulations may be in conflict with
a state or Federal law, such state or Federal law shall take precedence over
these regulations.
   (i)   Warning and Disclaimer of Liability.  The degree of flood protection
required by these regulations is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes
and is based on scientific and engineering considerations.  Larger floods can
and will occur on rare occasions.  Flood heights may be increased by man made
or natural causes.  These regulations do not imply that land outside the areas
of special flood hazard or uses permitted within such areas will be free from
flooding or flood damage.  These regulations shall not create liability on the
part of the City of Fremont, any officer or employee thereof, or the Federal
Emergency Management Agency, for any flood damage that results from reliance on
these regulations or any administrative decision lawfully made thereunder.
   (j)   Severability.  Should any section or provision of these regulations be
declared by the courts to be unconstitutional or invalid, such decision shall

   (j)   Map Maintenance Activities.  To meet National Flood Insurance Program
minimum requirements to have flood data reviewed and approved by FEMA, and to
ensure that the City of Fremont’s flood maps, studies and other data identified
in Section
1307.02(f) accurately represent flooding conditions so appropriate floodplain
management criteria are based on current data, the following map maintenance
activities are identified:
      (1)   Requirement to Submit New Technical Data.
         A.   For all development proposals that impact floodway delineations
or base flood elevations, the community shall ensure that technical data
reflecting such changes be submitted to FEMA within six months of the date such
information becomes available.  These development proposals include:
            1.   Floodway encroachments that increase or decrease base flood
elevations or alter floodway boundaries;
            2.   Fill sites to be used for the placement of proposed structures
where the applicant desires to remove the site from the special flood hazard
area;
            3.   Alteration of watercourses that result in a relocation or
elimination of the special flood hazard area, including the placement of
culverts; and
            4.   Subdivision or large-scale development proposals requiring the
establishment of base flood elevations in accordance with Section
1307.05(c).
         B.   It is the responsibility of the applicant to have technical data,
required in accordance with Section
1307.03(j)(1), prepared in a format required for a Conditional Letter of Map
Revision or Letter of Map Revision, and submitted to FEMA.  Submittal and
processing fees for these map revisions shall be the responsibility of the
applicant.
         C.   The Floodplain Administrator shall require a Conditional Letter
of Map Revision prior to the issuance of a floodplain development permit for:
            1.   Proposed floodway encroachments that increase the base flood
elevation; and
            2.   Proposed development that increases the base flood elevation
by more than one foot in areas where FEMA has provided base flood elevations
but no floodway.
         D.   Floodplain development permits issued by the Floodplain
Administrator shall be conditioned upon the applicant obtaining a Letter of Map
Revision from FEMA for any development proposal subject to Section
1307.03(j)(1)A.
      (2)   Right to Submit New Technical Data.  The Floodplain Administrator
may request changes to any of the information shown on an effective map that
does not impact floodplain or floodway delineations or base flood elevations,
such as labeling or planimetric details.  Such a submission shall include
appropriate supporting documentation made in writing by the Mayor of the City
of Fremont, and may be submitted at any time.
      (3)   Annexation/Detachment.  Upon occurrence, the Floodplain
Administrator shall notify FEMA in writing whenever the boundaries of the City
of Fremont have been modified by annexation or the community has assumed
authority over an area, or no longer has authority to adopt and enforce
floodplain management regulations for a particular area.  In order that the
City of Fremont’s Flood Insurance Rate Map accurately represent the City’s
boundaries, include within such notification a copy of a map of the City of
Fremont suitable for reproduction, clearly showing the new corporate limits or
the new area for which the City has assumed or relinquished floodplain
management regulatory authority.
   (k)   Data Use and Flood Map Interpretation.  The following guidelines shall
apply to the use and interpretation of maps and other data showing areas of
special flood hazard:
      (1)   In areas where FEMA has not identified special flood hazard areas,
or in FEMA identified special flood hazard areas where base flood elevation and
floodway data have not been identified, the Floodplain Administrator shall
review and reasonably utilize any other flood hazard data available from a
federal, state, or other source.
      (2)   Base flood elevations and floodway boundaries produced on FEMA
flood maps and studies shall take precedence over base flood elevations and
floodway boundaries by any other source that reflect a reduced floodway width
and/or lower base flood elevations.  Other sources of data, showing increased
base flood elevations and/or larger floodway areas than are shown on FEMA flood
maps and studies, shall be reasonably used by the Floodplain Administrator.
      (3)   When Preliminary Flood Insurance Rate Maps and/or Flood Insurance
Study have been provided by FEMA:
         A.   Upon the issuance of a Letter of Final Determination by the FEMA,
the preliminary flood hazard data shall be used and replace all previously
existing flood hazard data provided from FEMA for the purposes of administering
these regulations.
         B.   Prior to the issuance of a Letter of Final Determination by FEMA,
the use of preliminary flood hazard data shall only be required where no base
flood elevations and/or floodway areas exist or where the preliminary base
flood elevations or floodway area exceed the base flood elevations and/or
floodway widths in existing flood hazard data provided from FEMA.  Such
preliminary data may be subject to change and/or appeal to FEMA.
      (4)   The Floodplain Administrator shall make interpretations, where
needed, as to the exact location of the flood boundaries and areas of special
flood hazard.  A person contesting the determination of the location of the
boundary shall be given a reasonable opportunity to appeal the interpretation
as provided in Section
1307.04, Appeals and Variances.
      (5)   Where a map boundary showing an area of special flood hazard and
field elevations disagree, the base flood elevations or flood protection
elevations (as found on an elevation profile, floodway data table, established
high water marks, etc.) shall prevail. 
   (l)   Substantial Damage Determinations.  Damages to structures may result
from a variety of causes including flood, tornado, wind, heavy snow, fire,
etc.  After such a damage event, the Floodplain Administrator shall:
      (1)   Determine whether damaged structures are located in special flood
hazard areas;
      (2)   Conduct substantial damage determinations for damaged structures
located in special flood hazard areas; and
      (3)   Make reasonable attempt to notify owners of substantially damaged
structures of the need to obtain a floodplain development permit prior to
repair, rehabilitation, or reconstruction.
   Additionally, the Floodplain Administrator may implement other measures to
assist with the substantial damage determination and subsequent repair
process.  These measures include issuing press releases, public service
announcements, and other public information materials related to the floodplain
development permits and repair of damaged structures; coordinating with other
federal, state, and local agencies to assist with substantial damage
determinations; providing owners of damaged structures materials and other
information related to the proper repair of damaged structures in special flood
hazard areas; and assist owners of substantially damaged structures with
Increased Cost of Compliance insurance claims.

   (c)   Appeals.  Any person affected by any notice and order, or other
official action of the Floodplain Administrator may request and shall be
granted a hearing on the matter before the Appeals Board provided that such
person shall file, within thirty days of the date of such notice and order, or
other official action, a brief statement of the grounds for such hearing or for
the mitigation of any item appearing on any order of the Floodplain
Administrator’s decision.  Such appeal shall be in writing, signed by the
applicant, and be filed with the Floodplain Administrator.  Upon receipt of the
appeal, the Floodplain Administrator shall transmit said notice and all
pertinent information on which the Floodplain Administrator’s decision was made
to the Appeals Board.
   Upon receipt of the notice of appeal, the Appeals Board shall fix a
reasonable time for the appeal, give notice in writing to parties in interest,
and decide the appeal within a reasonable time after it is submitted.
   (d)   Variances.  Any person believing that the use and development
standards of these regulations would result in unnecessary hardship may file an
application for a variance.  The Appeals Board shall have the power to
authorize, in specific cases, such variances from the standards of these
regulations, not inconsistent with Federal regulations, as will not be contrary
to the public interest where, owing to special conditions of the lot or parcel,
a literal enforcement of the provisions of these regulations would result in
unnecessary hardship.
      (1)   Application for a variance.
         A.   Any owner or agent thereof, of property for which a variance is
sought shall make an application for a variance by filing it with the
Floodplain Administrator, who upon receipt of the variance shall transmit it to
the Appeals Board.
         B.   Such application at a minimum shall contain the following
information: Name, address, and telephone number of the applicant; legal
description of the property; parcel map; description of the existing use;
description of the proposed use; location of the floodplain; description of the
variance sought; and reason for the variance request.
         C.   All applications for a variance may be accompanied by a variance
application fee set in the Schedule of Fees adopted by the Council of the City
of Fremont.
      (2)   Public Hearing.  At such hearing the applicant shall present such
statements and evidence as the Appeals Board requires.  In considering such
variance applications, the Board shall consider and make findings of fact on
all evaluations, all relevant factors, standards specified in other sections of
these regulations and the following factors:
         A.   The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the
injury of others.
         B.   The danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion
damage.
         C.   The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to
flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner.
         D.   The importance of the services provided by the proposed facility
to the community.
         E.   The availability of alternative locations for the proposed use
that are not subject to flooding or erosion damage.
         F.   The necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where
applicable.
         G.   The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and
anticipated development.
         H.   The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan
and floodplain management program for that area.
         I.   The safety of access to the property in times of flood for
ordinary and emergency vehicles.
         J.   The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise, and
sediment transport of the floodwaters and the effects of wave action, if
applicable, expected at the site.
         K.   The costs of providing governmental services during and after
flood conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities and
facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water systems, and streets and
bridges.
         Variances shall only be issued upon:
         A.   A showing of good and sufficient cause.
         B.   A determination that failure to grant the variance would result
in exceptional hardship due to the physical characteristics of the property. 
Increased cost or inconvenience of meeting the requirements of these
regulations does not constitute an exceptional hardship to the applicant.
         C.   A determination that the granting of a variance will not result
in increased flood heights beyond that which is allowed in these regulations;
additional threats to public safety; extraordinary public expense, nuisances,
fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local laws.
         D.   A determination that the structure or other development is
protected by methods to minimize flood damages.
         E.   A determination that the variance is the minimum necessary,
considering the flood hazard, to afford relief.
Upon consideration of the above factors and the purposes of these regulations,
the Appeals Board may attach such conditions to the granting of variances, as
it deems necessary to further the purposes of these regulations.
      (3)   Other conditions for variances.
         A.   Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if
any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.
         B.   Generally, variances may be issued for new construction and
substantial improvements to be erected on a lot of one-half acre or less in
size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed
below the base flood level, providing items in Section
1307.04(d)(2)A. to K. have been fully considered.  As the lot size increases
beyond one half acre, the technical justification required for issuing the
variance increases.
         C.   Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given
written notice that the structure will be permitted to be built with a lowest
floor elevation below the base flood elevation and the cost of flood insurance
will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the reduced lowest
floor elevation.
   (e)   Procedure at Hearings. 
      (1)   All testimony shall be given under oath.
      (2)   A complete record of the proceedings shall be kept, except
confidential deliberations of the Board, but including all documents presented
and a verbatim record of the testimony of all witnesses.
      (3)   The applicant shall proceed first to present evidence and testimony
in support of the appeal or variance.
      (4)   The Administrator may present evidence or testimony in opposition
to the appeal or variance.
      (5)   All witnesses shall be subject to cross-examination by the adverse
party or their counsel.
      (6)   Evidence that is not admitted may be proffered and shall become
part of the record for appeal.
      (7)   The Board shall issue subpoenas upon written request for the
attendance of witnesses.  A reasonable deposit to cover the cost of issuance
and service shall be collected in advance.
      (8)   The Board shall prepare conclusions of fact supporting its
decision.  The decision may be announced at the conclusion of the hearing and
thereafter issued in writing or the decision may be issued in writing within a
reasonable time after the hearing.
   (f)   Appeal to the Court.  Those aggrieved by the decision of the Appeals
Board may appeal such decision to the Sandusky County Court of Common Pleas, as
provided in Chapter 2506 of the Ohio Revised Code.

1307.05(d).
   (h)   Above Ground Gas or Liquid Storage Tanks.  All above ground gas or
liquid storage tanks shall be anchored to prevent flotation or lateral movement
resulting from hydrodynamic and hydrostatic loads.
   (i)   Assurance of Flood Carrying Capacity.  Pursuant to the purpose and
methods of reducing flood damage stated in these regulations, the following
additional standards are adopted to assure that the reduction of the flood
carrying capacity of watercourses is minimized:
      (1)   Development in floodways.
         A.   In floodway areas, development shall cause no increase in flood
levels during the occurrence of the base flood discharge.  Prior to issuance of
a floodplain development permit, the applicant must submit a hydrologic and
hydraulic analysis, conducted by a registered professional engineer,
demonstrating that the proposed development would not result in any increase in
the base flood elevation; or
         B.   Development in floodway areas causing increases in the base flood
elevation may be permitted provided all of the following are completed by the
applicant:
            1.   Meet the requirements to submit technical data in Section
1307.03(j)(1);
            2.   An evaluation of alternatives, which would not result in
increased base flood elevations and an explanation why these alternatives are
not feasible;
            3.   Certification that no structures are located in areas that
would be impacted by the increased base flood elevation;
            4.   Documentation of individual legal notices to all impacted
property owners within and outside the community, explaining the impact of the
proposed action on their property; and
            5.   Concurrence of the Mayor of the City of Fremont and the Chief
Executive Officer of any other communities impacted by the proposed actions.
      (2)   Development in riverine areas with base flood elevations but no
floodways.
         A.   In riverine special flood hazard areas identified by FEMA where
base flood elevation data are provided but no floodways have been designated,
the cumulative effect of any proposed development, when combined with all other
existing and anticipated development, shall not increase the base flood
elevation more than 1.0 (one) foot at any point.  Prior to issuance of a
floodplain development permit, the applicant must submit a hydrologic and
hydraulic analysis, conducted by a registered professional engineer,
demonstrating that this standard has been met; or,
         B.   Development in riverine special flood hazard areas identified by
FEMA where base flood elevation data are provided but no floodways have been
designated causing more than one foot increase in the base flood elevation may
be permitted provided all of the following are completed by the applicant:
            1.   An evaluation of alternatives which would result in an
increase of one foot or less of the base flood elevation and an explanation why
these alternatives are not feasible;
            2.   Section
1307.05(i)(1)B., items 1. and 3. - 5.
      (3)   Alterations of a watercourse.  For the purpose of these
regulations, a watercourse is altered when any change occurs within its banks. 
The extent of the banks shall be established by a field determination of the
"bankfull stage."  The field determination of "bankfull stage" shall be based
on methods presented in Chapter 7 of the USDA Forest Service General Technical
Report RM-245, Stream Channel Reference Sites: An Illustrated Guide to Field
Technique or other applicable publication available from a Federal, State, or
other authoritative source.  For all proposed developments that alter a
watercourse, the following standards apply:
         A.   The bankfull flood carrying capacity of the altered or relocated
portion of the watercourse shall not be diminished.  Prior to the issuance of a
floodplain development permit, the applicant must submit a description of the
extent to which any watercourse will be altered or relocated as a result of the
proposed development, and certification by a registered professional engineer
that the bankfull flood carrying capacity of the watercourse will not be
diminished.
         B.   Adjacent communities, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, and the
Ohio Department of Natural Resources, Division of Water, must be notified prior
to any alteration or relocation of a watercourse.  Evidence of such
notification must be submitted to the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
         C.   The applicant shall be responsible for providing the necessary
maintenance for the altered or relocated portion of said watercourse so that
the flood carrying capacity will not be diminished.  The Floodplain
Administrator may require the permit holder to enter into an agreement with the
City of Fremont specifying the maintenance responsibilities.  If an agreement
is required, it shall be made a condition of the floodplain development permit.
         D.   The applicant shall meet the requirements to submit technical
data in Section
1307.03(j)(1)A.3. when an alteration of a watercourse results in the relocation
or elimination of the special flood hazard area, including the placement of
culverts.
   (j)   Storage of Materials.  Storage of material or equipment not otherwise
prohibited in Section
1307.05(a)(2) shall be firmly anchored to prevent flotations.

   A "public nuisance" shall be deemed to be any fence, wall, shed, house,
building, structure or any part of any of the aforesaid, or any tree, pole or
smokestack, or any excavation, basement, cellar, sidewalk subspace, dock, wharf
or landing dock, which in its entirety or in any part thereof, by reason of the
condition in which the same is permitted to be or remain shall or may endanger
the life, limb or property of, or cause any hurt, harm, inconvenience,
discomfort, damage or injury to, any one or more persons in the City in any one
or more of the following particulars:
   (a)   By reason of being a nuisance to the general health of the community.
   (b)   By reason of being a fire hazard.
   (c)   By reason of being a nuisance because of long continued vacancy, lack
of reasonable or adequate maintenance of the structure or premises adjacent
thereto, thereby depreciating the enjoyment and use of property in the
immediate vicinity to such an extent that it is harmful to the community in
which such structure is situated.
   (d)   By reason of being unsafe for occupancy or use on, in, upon, about or
around the aforesaid premises.
      (Ord. 988.  Passed 6-15-67.)
   1505.02  SUMMARY ABATEMENT.
   Whenever complaint is made to the Fire Chief of the existence of a public
nuisance in the City, he shall promptly inspect or cause to be inspected the
premises on which it is alleged such public nuisance exists.  Should the Fire
Chief find that a public nuisance does exist, he shall promptly notify the
Safety-Service Director and the person, firm or corporation who, from the
records in the Sandusky County Treasurer's office, appears to be the owner of
the aforesaid property.  The Fire Chief shall leave a copy of the aforesaid
notice with the person in possession of such premises, if any, or if there is
no person in possession thereof, he shall post a copy of the notice on the
premises.  It shall be the duty of the Fire Chief to inspect the premises on
which it is alleged that such nuisance exists and to make a written report of
his findings in conjunction therewith to the Safety-Service Director.  Should
the Fire Chief and the Director find that a public nuisance exists and that the
nature thereof is such as to require its summary abatement, it shall be the
duty of the Fire Chief to cause photographs of such nuisance to be made, to
file and keep in his office the written reports of the findings aforesaid, and
further, to cause the abatement of the aforesaid nuisance within three days of
the time within which such findings are reported by him.  In abating such
nuisance, the Fire Chief shall not be required to give any further notice to
the owner thereof.
(Ord. 988.  Passed 6-15-67.)
   1505.03  ABATEMENT IN OTHER CASES; NOTICE.
   (a)   Should the Fire Chief and Safety-Service Director, after an inspection
of the premises on which it is reported a public nuisance exists, be of the
opinion that a public nuisance does exist, but the nature thereof is not such
as to require the summary abatement of such nuisance, photographs and reports
of their findings, the same as provided in Section
1505.02, shall be made and filed with the Director.  It shall further be the
duty of the Fire Chief in such cases to serve notice on the person, firm or
corporation who, from the records in the Sandusky County Treasurer's office,
appears to be the owner of the aforesaid property.  If such service of notice
cannot be made, then the Fire Chief shall leave a copy of the aforesaid notice
with the person in possession of such premises, if any, or if there is no
person in possession thereof, he shall post a copy of the notice on the
premises.
   (b)   The aforesaid notice shall state, in brief, the findings of the Fire
Chief and shall further state that unless the owner or owners thereof shall
cause the abatement of the public nuisance therein defined within thirty days
after the service or posting of the notice, the same will be abated by the City
at the expense of such owner or owners.
(Ord. 988.  Passed 6-15-67.)
   1505.04  NONCOMPLIANCE; ABATEMENT BY FIRE CHIEF; SALE OF MATERIALS.
   (a)   Should the nuisance not be abated as ordered under Section
1505.03 at the expiration of the time stated in such notice, the Fire Chief
shall have the right to enter upon such premises and to abate the nuisance
found thereon.  In abating such nuisance he may go to whatever extent may be
necessary to complete the abatement of the same and should it be practicable to
sell or salvage any material derived in the aforesaid abatement he may sell the
same at private or public sale at the best price obtainable and shall keep an
account of the proceeds thereof.  Such proceeds, if any, shall be deposited in
the General Fund of the City and any difference between the amount so received
and the cost of the abatement shall be levied as an assessment against the
aforesaid property by Council, certified to the Sandusky County Auditor and
collected as any other assessment by the City.  Should the proceeds of the sale
of such salvaged material exceed the cost of such abatement, the overage, if
any, shall be paid to the owner of the premises from which such nuisance was
abated when his proper claim therefor is established.  In abating such nuisance
the Fire Chief may call upon the Department of Public Safety-Service for
whatever assistance may be necessary or may, by private contract, obtain the
abatement thereof if such private contract is first authorized by Council.
   (b)   The remedy provided in this section shall be in addition to any
penalty provided in Section
1505.99.
(Ord. 988.  Passed 6-15-67.)
   (c)   If the owner, within thirty days thereafter fails, neglects or refuses
to repay the Fire Chief the expenses thereby incurred by him in abating the
public nuisance, the City Auditor shall certify such expenses, together with a
twenty-five percent (25%) penalty thereon to the County Auditor, and the
Auditor shall enter such expenses on the tax duplicate of the County as a
special charge against the real estate on which such building is or was
situated, and the same shall be collected as other taxes and, when collected,
shall together with the penalty thereon be refunded to the City.
   1505.05  UNANIMOUS FINDINGS REQUIRED TO PROCEED.
   No proceeding under this chapter shall be maintained unless the officers
mentioned in Section
1505.02 unanimously find that a public nuisance in fact exists, or, in the
event of a summary abatement, until and unless such officers unanimously find
that the summary abatement of such nuisance is necessary.
(Ord. 988.  Passed 6-15-67.)
   1505.06  SCOPE AND INTERPRETATION OF CHAPTER.
   This chapter shall not be deemed to be a limitation or restriction on the
authority of any department, division, official or employee of the City, but
shall be deemed as an enlargement of any authority existing by virtue of the
statutes of the State or any ordinance of the City.
(Ord. 988.  Passed 6-15-67.)
   1505.99  PENALTY.
   Any person who refuses or neglects to obey an order issued by the Fire Chief

fourth degree.  Each and every day of noncompliance after the time specified in
