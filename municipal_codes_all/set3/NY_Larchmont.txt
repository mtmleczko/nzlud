residents of Westchester County outside of the Village to these positions

Rule Law to expand such residency requirements to allow residents of
Westchester County to be eligible for appointment to said positions.

C. Based on the application, the Building Inspector shall estimate the cost
of monitoring compliance with this chapter, including any consultant
fees, and furnish such estimate, together with a basis for his
calculation, to the applicant. Before any permit is issued, the estimated
cost of inspection services shall be deposited with the Village, held in
escrow, and applied to reimburse the Village for costs and expenses
actually incurred in connection with administering compliance with this
chapter. Where the estimated amount deposited is insufficient to cover
the Village's costs, the property owner shall be responsible for any
balance due. Where the estimated amount deposited with the Village
exceeds the costs incurred, the balance shall be refunded.
D. The application for a permit to use explosives shall be signed by the
applicant and all blasters, who shall acknowledge under the penalties of
perjury that all information provided in the application or in support of
the application is true and correct. Each blaster shall also sign an
acknowledgment under the penalties of perjury that he/she has read
the entire application, that in his/her opinion the blasting at the
particular location can be conducted safely, without unreasonable risk,
and that the person's state license is valid, that he/she is fully
authorized to conduct the type of activity set forth in the application,
and that he/she agrees to abide by all federal, state, and local safety
standards.
E. During consideration of the permit application, the Building Inspector
may require any additional information deemed necessary to protect
the health, safety, and welfare of the community or to prevent property
damage. The failure of an applicant to provide such information shall be
grounds to deny an application.
F. The Building Inspector may add to any permit issued under this chapter
additional terms and conditions deemed necessary to protect public
health, safety, and welfare.
G. Each applicant shall pay a blasting permit application fee to the Village,
such fee to be fixed by the Village Board from time to time.

arising or occurring directly or indirectly by reason of storage,
transportation, manufacturing, handling, or use of explosives.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the amount of such bond may be
reduced per approval of the Village Engineer and Village Attorney. The
Village reserves the right to require the applicant to submit a
restoration bond intended for the protection of Village-owned
infrastructure located within the blast zone or within an area beyond
the blast zone as determined by the Village Engineer. The amount of
such bond shall be based upon a cost estimate prepared by the
applicant and accepted by the Village Engineer for the restoration or
reconstruction of identified infrastructure.
A. Before any blasting operations may begin and even if a blasting permit
has been issued, the permit holder shall cause to be made an in-depth
inspection of all homes, structures, and facilities within a minimum
distance of 300 feet of the center line of the site (e.g., gravity sewers) to
note and record the interior and exterior condition, including
foundation walls, sidewalks, pools, and the like. The Village Engineer
may increase such distance if reasonably required on case-by-case
basis. The inspection shall be conducted by an independent firm
experienced in this type of work, and such independent firm shall
prepare a report of such conditions, and such report shall be submitted
to the Building Inspector before any blasting may begin.
B. Should it be determined by the Building Inspector or Village Engineer
that an inspection and report on the condition of any structure in any
location beyond the area specified in § 107-7A but within the proximity
of the blast site is required, the Building Inspector or Village Engineer
shall advise the permit holder of this requirement, and the permit
holder shall have such inspection conducted, and a report shall be
submitted to the Building Inspector before any blasting may begin.
C. The permit holder shall provide continuous blast monitoring during
blast operations. Blast monitoring shall be performed by a qualified
independent firm at the permit holder's expense.
§ 107-6 LARCHMONT CODE § 107-8
103:104
§ 107-8. Storage of explosives.
In addition to storage requirements set forth by federal, state, and local
laws and regulations, the following provisions shall apply to the storage of
explosives for blasting within the Village:
§ 107-9. Blasting operations.
A. Explosives for blasting shall be kept in a magazine that complies with
all federal and state laws and regulations, is painted red, and is marked
"DANGER."
B. Explosives shall not be placed or stored in a magazine containing
blasting caps, detonators, or electric fuses. These shall be kept in a
separate magazine that is painted red and is marked "DANGER."
C. Magazines shall be secured with tamper-proof locks. Nonportable
magazines shall be completely fenced in, including the top, and warning
signs shall be affixed to such fence.
D. Explosives shall be stored on site only for the minimum duration
necessary to allow for pre-blast preparation, detonation, and cleanup.
In no case shall explosives remain stored on site for longer than 48
hours before or following the completion of blasting operations.
A. Blasting operations may not commence at any location within the
Village unless a written permit has first been obtained from the
Building Inspector authorizing blasting at the specific location and the
Building Inspector has issued written permission to proceed following
compliance with all pre-blast requirements set forth herein.
B. Blasting operations must comply with the terms of the permit and all
applicable federal, state, and local laws and regulations.
C. At least five business days prior to the commencement of blasting
operations, the permit holder shall request a pre-blast meeting with the
Building Inspector and Village Engineer to review and finalize the
proposed blasting plan, which must address the requirements set forth
in this chapter. No blasting operations shall be conducted unless such
pre-blast meeting has been held and the Building Inspector and Village
Engineer have reviewed the proposed blasting plan and are satisfied
that such plan is reasonable. The blasting plan shall include the
anticipated route through the Village for the delivery of any explosives.
In the event of any proposed change in the satisfactory blasting plan,
the permit holder shall request in writing a review of such proposed
change, and blasting operations may not commence or continue unless
and until such review occurs and the change is confirmed as
reasonable.
D. The Building Inspector and Village Engineer shall be permitted access
to observe all aspects of the blasting operations, including but not
§ 107-8 BICYCLES AND SKATEBOARDS § 107-9
103:105
limited to observation of all pre-blast preparatory site work, the
explosion/detonation, and access to the post-blast site.
E. Each blasting permit holder shall establish and delineate a blast zone
prior to detonating a blast. The blast zone must be clearly marked and
adequate precautions implemented to prevent unauthorized entry into
the area.
F. Notwithstanding any other regulations, no blasting operations shall be
performed in such manner or under such circumstances as to eject
debris into the air so as to constitute a hazard or danger or do harm or
damage to persons or property. Immediately after loading and tamping
the hole or open cut, but before firing the blast, the material to be
blasted shall, using good practices, be properly covered or screened by
a buffer of sufficient mass to prevent, with a margin of safety, the
ejection of any material capable of causing any injury or damage. After
the material has thus been covered, the blast shall be fired without
unnecessary delay.
G. No person shall use a quantity of explosives greater than necessary to
break or move the target material or use an amount of explosives that
poses a risk of injury to persons or damage to property.
H. Unless otherwise permitted by the Building Inspector or Village
Engineer, all holes drilled or otherwise excavated for holding an
explosive shall be at least six feet deep. If, however, the permit holder
or blaster can demonstrate a need to use a hole less than six feet deep
and that such cavity will not endanger public safety, the Building
Inspector or Village Engineer may, in his/her discretion, authorize the
use of blast holes less than six feet deep.
I. The permit holder and blaster shall plan each blast and take every
precaution in loading, delaying, initiation, confinement, and stemming
to control the throw of rock fragments and debris and limit ground
vibrations and the effect of air concussions to the greatest extent
possible. When blasting operations are to be conducted within 50 feet
of a property line and the adjacent property owner is not a party to the
blasting operations, the permit holder and blaster shall take all
precautions practicable, using any combination of recognized methods,
to control blasting effects to the greatest degree possible.
J. Ground blast and air standards. Peak particle velocity and overpressure
produced by any blast at a distance measured by the distance from the
blast to the closest structure or building not owned or used by the entity
conducting the blast shall not exceed 0.75 inch per second for
frequencies less than 40 hertz (Hz) or 2.0 inches per second for
frequencies of 40 hertz (Hz) or more. In addition, air pressure
emanating from such blast shall not exceed 131 decibels (dB) for highpass
filter of 0.1 hertz (Hz), or 128 decibels (dB) for a high-pass filter of
2 hertz (Hz), or 125 decibels (dB) for a high-pass filter of 6 hertz (Hz).

Engineer must reduce the maximum allowable ground blast and air
standards specified in this section if determined necessary to
provide damage protection
K. Blasting located within 25 feet of pipelines or adjoining structures shall
require the express written approval from the Building Inspector or
Village Engineer.
L. All pipelines and structures exposed during excavation shall be
adequately protected from damage before proceeding with blasting.
M. The permit holder's representative identified in the permit application
shall be on site during all blasting operations.
N. Dust control. The permit holder shall implement measures to limit the
emission and migration of dust generated by the blasting operations,
including the drilling of holes and immediately following detonation of
explosives. All dust control measures, including but not limited to water
hoses intended for wetting the blasting site, shall be staged and ready
for deployment prior to detonation.
O. Traffic control. The permit holder shall implement measures for the
maintenance and protection of traffic during blasting operations,
especially detonation. The permit holder shall work with the Village's
Police Department to close temporarily public roads, including
sidewalks, both abutting the property on which the blasting is to occur
and within the blast zone, and any other public property as designated
by the Building Inspector or Village Engineer, immediately prior to,
during, and following the completion of explosives detonation. Public
roads, including sidewalks, and any public property so designated shall
not be reopened until confirmation that they are safe for vehicular and
pedestrian traffic and travel. The permit holder shall notify the Village's
Police Department of such temporary closures no sooner than 24 hours
prior to the planned blasting detonation.
P. Personal protective equipment. All natural persons shall possess and
wear appropriate personal protective equipment recommended or
required by federal, state, or local law or regulation during all blasting
operations.
Q. Day and time restrictions. Detonation of explosives shall only be
permitted to occur on days and during the times during which
mechanical rock excavation is permitted to occur as specified within the
Village's Zoning Law, specifically § 381-44 of Village Code.
R. The permit holder shall comply with all soil moving operations
requirements set forth in § 381-42B(3) even where a soil moving permit
is not required, unless waived in whole or in part in writing by the
Building Inspector or Village Engineer.

on property that has a lot line lying within 300 feet of any lot line of
the property on which the blast is to occur and any additional lots
as required by the Building Inspector or Village Engineer. Said
notice shall be approved by the Building Inspector and shall state
the blasting permit holder's name, the blasting permit number, the
location of the blast, the date(s) and time(s) during which blasting
is to occur, emergency telephone numbers for the police, fire, and
ambulance service, and the type of blast warning to be used, such
as a whistle, siren, or horn. Such notice shall be given by certified
or certificated mail, and an affidavit, executed by the permit holder
attesting to such mailing, along with the actual notice and list of
addressees and addresses, shall be filed with the Building
Department before blasting operations may commence.
(2) Upon receipt of the notice specified in § 107-10A(1) above, all
property owners and managing agents shall immediately distribute
a copy of such notice to tenants and, except for one-family
dwellings, post such notice in conspicuous place(s) where it is
reasonable to believe that persons entering or leaving the premises
will see such notice.
B. Posting of intent to blast on the subject property. No less than 10 days
prior to blasting, the permit holder shall post a sign on the property
where blasting is to occur, in the form prescribed by the Building
Department, stating the date(s) and time(s) during which such
operations will occur. Such sign shall be placed in a location plainly
visible from the most commonly traveled street upon which the
property fronts, but in no case more than 20 feet back from the front lot
line. Such sign shall be appropriately revised as necessary. An affidavit
attesting to such posting shall be filed with the Building Department
before blasting operations may commence.
C. Blast warnings.
(1) The blasting contractor shall notify all occupants of all houses
within 300 feet of the blast zone on the morning of each day when

within 150 feet of the blast zone immediately before each blast is
fired.
(2) The blasting permit holder shall notify the Village's Building
Inspector, Village Engineer, Police Department, and Fire
Department of an impending blast by at least two hours, but not
more than 12 hours, prior to the time each blast is scheduled.
§ 107-10 LARCHMONT CODE § 107-10
103:108
§ 107-11. Recordkeeping.
(3) At least three minutes before firing a blast, the blaster shall give
warning thereof by causing a competent person carrying a red flag
to be stationed a reasonable distance and not less than 150 feet
from the blast zone at each avenue of approach, by sounding a
recognized and loud whistle, siren, or horn and by calling out the
words "a blast" several times repeated and loud enough to be heard
at a distance of 300 feet from blast zone. In addition, the whistle,
siren, or horn shall be sounded again 30 seconds prior to blasting.
A. A record of each blast shall be kept on a form approved by the Building
Inspector. All such records shall be retained by the permit holder and
blaster as prescribed by state law and made available for inspection as
a matter of public record.
(1) The permit holder shall record the following information for each
blast and submit a true copy of such record to the Building
Inspector at the end of each day:

B. Every incident of personal injury or property damage caused by the use
of explosives within the Village shall be regarded as presumptive
evidence of negligence on the part of the blaster concerned with the use
of such explosives, and the blasting permit shall be revoked, unless it
shall appear at a subsequent hearing that the accident occurred despite
the observance of all proper precautions in the handling of such
explosive, and pending such hearing, such permit shall be suspended.
C. Any damage to existing pipes, facilities, or structures shall be repaired
or rebuilt at the blasting contractor's sole expense, and failure to do so
may result in calling of the bonds required herein.

of any other official, revoke or modify a permit issued pursuant to this
chapter where it appears the permit holder has violated any federal,
state, or local law or regulation, including but not limited to a false
statement or representation on the application for a blasting permit or
violation of any applicable safety standard or where the Building
Inspector or Village Engineer determines that public safety has been
compromised. The Building Inspector may modify or revoke a permit by
notifying in writing the permit holder or his/her/its representative that
the permit has been modified or revoked. Where a permit has been
revoked, the Building Inspector shall send a written notice of
revocation to the permit holder by first-class mail without unnecessary
delay, but not later than five business days after revocation, setting
forth the reasons the permit was revoked. The notice of revocation shall
include a statement informing the permit holder of the right to appeal
such revocation by filing a notice of appeal with the Village Clerk within
20 business days. Where a permit is modified, the Building Inspector
shall give the permit holder written notice of the modifications. In the
event of an incident of personal injury or property damage leading to
revocation, the blasting permit shall not be reissued or renewed except
upon delivery to the Building Inspector of a new and additional bond
that meets the requisite terms herein, and the Building Inspector may
amend the blasting permit by adding whatever additional restrictions
are deemed necessary to ensure public health and safety is maintained
and another similar accident does not reoccur.
B. Appeals. A permit holder who has had his permit revoked or modified
may appeal and seek relief from the modifications or reinstatement of
the permit. An appeal pursuant to this section shall be heard by the
Chief of Police, the Village Engineer, and the Fire Chief, or any of their
designees, sitting as a Board of Appeals. The Building Inspector shall
appear and state his/her findings and the reasons for revoking or
modifying the permit. The permit holder and/or the blaster shall be
offered the opportunity to appeal and present evidence why the permit
should not be modified or revoked. The Appeal Board may sustain the
Building Inspector's decision, may reinstate a permit, or may amend
any modifications imposed by the Building Inspector. Where the
Appeals Board reinstates a permit, the Board may modify the permit by
adding whatever terms and conditions it deems necessary to protect
public health, safety, welfare, and property. The decision of the appeal
panel shall be final.
A. In addition to any penalty prescribed by federal or state law or
regulation, any person who violates or fails to comply with any
provision of this chapter shall, following conviction, be guilty of a
misdemeanor.

§ 125-10 LARCHMONT CODE § 125-11
129:118
§ 129-1. Purpose.
The Village of Larchmont is primarily a residential community. The Village
Board considers the maintenance of the quiet enjoyment of the residential
areas of the village to be among its most important responsibilities. The
Board has received a continuous series of complaints in recent years, which
it finds to be justified, from homeowners in residential districts located
near retail business districts of the village, regarding noise, both from
persons and automobiles, vandalism and excessive traffic flow during the
early morning hours, all emanating from retail business districts of the
village. In weighing the extreme irritation, inconvenience and diminution
of property values which homeowners and their families have experienced
and are experiencing as a result of early morning retail business operations
against the relatively minor inconvenience that would be caused to retail
business establishments if they were required to close to the public for a
few hours in the early morning and considering that the desire of retail
business establishments to earn some minor, additional profit by staying
open beyond normal business hours is outweighed by the right of citizens
in the residential area to the quiet enjoyment of their homes, particularly
during the early morning hours, the Village Board has determined to enact
this chapter in the best interests of the community as a whole.
§ 129-2. Hours of operation.
No retail business in the Village of Larchmont, as defined in the Village of
Larchmont Zoning Law,11 which is located on a lot that is within 500 feet
of any other lot in the village which is legally used for residential purposes
may be open for sales to the public between the hours of 12:00 midnight
and 6:00 a.m.
§ 129-3. Penalties for offenses. [Amended 9-14-1987 by L.L. No.
4-1987]
In addition to any other penalties or remedies available to the Village of
Larchmont, any person, corporation, firm or other entity found guilty of
violating any of the provisions of this chapter shall be subject to a fine of
up to $250 or imprisonment for not more than 15 days, or both. Each day
such violation continues shall constitute a separate offense and shall be
punishable as such.

COMMUNITY CHOICE AGGREGATION (ENERGY) PROGRAM
§ 137-1. Legislative findings; intent and purpose; authority; title.
11.Editor's Note: See Ch. 381, Zoning.
§ 125-11 BUSINESS HOURS § 137-1
129:119
A. It is the policy of both the Village of Larchmont and the State of New
York to reduce costs and provide cost certainty for the purpose of
economic development, to promote deeper penetration of energy
efficiency and renewable energy resources, such as wind and solar, and
wider deployment of distributed energy resources, as well as to
examine the retail energy markets and increase participation of and
benefits for residential and small commercial customers in those
markets. Among the policies and models that may offer benefits in New
York is community choice aggregation, which allows local governments
to determine the default supplier of electricity and natural gas on
behalf of its residential and small commercial customers.
B. The purpose of this CCA Program is to allow participating local
governments, including the Village of Larchmont, to procure energy
supply service for their residential and small commercial customers,
who will have the opportunity to opt out of the procurement, while
maintaining transmission and distribution service from the existing
distribution utility. This chapter establishes a program that will allow
the Village of Larchmont to put out for bid the total amount of natural
gas and/or electricity being purchased by local residential and small
commercial customers. Bundled customers will have the opportunity to
have more control to lower their overall energy costs, to spur clean
energy innovation and investment, to improve customer choice and
value, and to protect the environment thereby, fulfilling the purposes of
this chapter and fulfilling an important public purpose.
C. The Village of Larchmont is authorized to implement this Community
Choice Aggregation (Energy) Program pursuant to § 10, Subdivision
1(ii)(a)(12) of the New York Municipal Home Rule Law; and State of
New York Public Service Commission Case No. 14-M-0564, Petition of
Sustainable Westchester for Expedited Approval for the
Implementation of a Pilot Community Choice Aggregation Program
within the County of Westchester, Order Granting Petition in Part
(issued February 26, 2015), as may be amended, including subsequent
orders of the Public Service Commission issued in connection with or
related to Case No. 14-M-0564 (collectively, the "order"). "Order" shall
also mean orders of the Public Service Commission related to State of
New York Public Service Commission Case No. 14-M-0224, Proceeding
on Motion of the Commission to Enable Community Choice Aggregation
Programs (issued December 15, 2014) to the extent that orders related
to Case No. 14-M-0224 enable actions by the Village of Larchmont not
otherwise permitted pursuant to orders related to Case 14-M0564;
provided, however, that in the event of any conflict between orders from
Case No. 14-M-0564 and orders from Case No 14-M-0224, orders from
Case No 14-M-0564 shall govern the CCA Program.
D. This chapter shall be known and may be cited as the "Community
Choice Aggregation (Energy) Program."

§ 137-2. Definitions.
For purposes of this chapter, and unless otherwise expressly stated or
unless the context otherwise requires, the terms in this chapter shall have
the meanings employed in the State of New York Public Service
Commission's Uniform Business Practices or, if not so defined there, as
indicated below:
BUNDLED CUSTOMERS — Residential and small commercial customers of
electricity or natural gas ("fuels") who are purchasing the fuels from the
distribution utility.
COMMUNITY CHOICE AGGREGATION PROGRAM or CCA PROGRAM —
A municipal energy procurement program which replaces the incumbent
utility as the default supplier for all bundled customers within the Village.
DISTRIBUTION UTILITY — The owner or controller of the means of
distribution of the natural gas or electricity that is regulated by the Public
Service Commission.
PUBLIC SERVICE COMMISSION — The New York State Public Service
Commission.
SMALL COMMERCIAL — Nonresidential customers as permitted by the
order.
SUPPLIERS — Energy service companies (ESCOs) that procure electric
power and natural gas for bundled customers in connection with this
chapter or, alternatively, generators of electricity and natural gas or other
entities who procure and resell electricity or natural gas.
SUSTAINABLE WESTCHESTER — A not-for-profit organization comprised
of member municipalities in Westchester County, New York.
§ 137-3. Establishment of program.
A. A Community Choice Aggregation (Energy) Program is hereby
established by the Board of Trustees, whereby the Village shall work
together with Sustainable Westchester to implement the CCA Program
to the full extent permitted by the order, as set forth more fully herein.
The Village's role under the CCA Program involves aggregating the
electric and/or natural gas supply of its residents and entering into a
contract with one or more suppliers for supply and services. Under the
CCA Program, the operation and ownership of the utility service shall
remain with the distribution utility.
B. The Village's purchase of energy supply through a CCA Program
constitutes neither the purchase of a public utility system nor the
furnishing of utility service. The Village will not take over any part of
the electric or gas transmission or distribution system and will not
furnish any type of utility service but will instead negotiate with
suppliers on behalf of participating residential and small commercial
customers.

C. In order to implement the CCA Program, the Village will adopt one or
more resolutions that outline the process of and conditions for
participation in the CCA Program, including but not limited to signing a
contract for a compliant bid with one or more suppliers, all as
consistent with the local law and the order.
D. The Public Service Commission supervises retail markets and
participants in these markets through legislative and regulatory
authority and the Uniform Business Practices, which includes rules
relating to the eligibility of participating ESCOs, the operation by which
ESCOs provide energy services, and the terms on which customers may
be enrolled with ESCOs.
A. As permitted by the order, the Village may request from the distribution
utilities aggregated customer information by fuel type and service
classification on a rolling basis.
B. Sustainable Westchester, on behalf of the Village of Larchmont, shall
issue one or more requests for proposals to suppliers to provide energy
to participants and may then award a contract in accordance with the
CCA Program.
C. Sustainable Westchester or the Village, if the Village so chooses, will
then request individual customer data from the distribution utility in
accordance with the CCA Program.
D. Sustainable Westchester or the Village, if the Village so chooses, and
the selected supplier will then notify bundled customers of the contract
terms and their opportunity to opt out of the CCA Program.
E. In accordance with and for purposes of the order, the existing
distribution utility, Consolidated Edison Company of New York, Inc., will
provide to Sustainable Westchester aggregate and customer-specific
data (including usage data, capacity tag obligations, account numbers,
and service addresses) of all bundled customers in the Village not
currently enrolled with an ESCO.
F. Sustainable Westchester and the Village will protect customer
information as required by law, subject to the order and the limitations
of the New York State Freedom of Information Law.
A. The Village or in conjunction with the ESCO will notify its residential
and small commercial customers, by letter notice, of the Village's
decision to establish the CCA Program, of the contract terms with an
ESCO, and of the opportunity to opt out of the CCA Program.
B. The letter notice will be sent to each customer at the address provided
by the distribution utility and will explain the CCA Program and the

which the customer can opt out of the CCA Program, and provide
information on how the customer can access additional information
about the CCA Program.
C. The opt-out period shall be 20 days.
D. CCA Program bundled customers, upon enrollment, will receive a
welcome letter that will explain the customers' options for canceling
the enrollment if they believe they were enrolled incorrectly or
otherwise decide to withdraw from the CCA Program in favor of another
supplier. The welcome letter also will explain that residential customers
are entitled to the added protection of the mandated three-day
rescission period as detailed in Section 5(B)(3) of the Uniform Business
Practices.
A. Sustainable Westchester shall be responsible for filing an annual report
with the Public Service Commission, which identifies the number of
customers enrolled in the CCA Program by municipality and customer
class, the number of customers who returned to utility service or
service with another supplier during the reporting period, and the
average cost of commodity supply by month for the reporting period.

and general welfare of the inhabitants of the Village of Larchmont that
certain self-service coin-operated dry-cleaning machines and

Underwriters' Laboratories, Inc., including perchlorethylene. If
perchlorethylene or any chlorinated hydrocarbon is a component
part of any solvent used in a self-service coin-operated dry-cleaning
machine, then such dry-cleaning machine or machines shall not be
used if the odor of perchlorethylene or any chlorinated
hydrocarbon is masked or altered in any fashion or if the
concentration of solvent vapor of such perchlorethylene or
chlorinated hydrocarbon is greater than 100 parts of such vapor to
1,000,000 parts of air at any time and anywhere in the
establishment in which such self-service coin-operated drycleaning
machines are in use. Generally, no distinctive odor of such
chlorinated hydrocarbon vapor should be noticeable in the
customer area at any time such establishment is open for business.
(5) Enclosure of service area. Only the front or customer side of drycleaning
machines shall be exposed in the customer area. The
working or maintenance portion of the machines shall be separated
from the front of such machines by a solid partition from floor to

textile, fabric, garment or other article and from the drum in which
same shall be placed and in the event of mechanical or electrical
failure, except by the attendant.
§ 143-11 LARCHMONT CODE § 143-11
143:128
(7) Storage and equipment area. Solvent storage tanks, power boxes
and other sources of danger shall be so situated as to be
inaccessible to the general public and patrons of such
establishments. Solvent for makeup shall be stored only in closed
containers which are properly labeled. The transfer of solvent in
open buckets or containers is prohibited.
(8) Spotting. No spotting operations utilizing solvents other than water
shall be permitted on the premises except by authorized
employees.
(9) Drying time. The drying time of the operating cycle shall be
sufficient so that odor-detectable concentrations of solvent vapors
are not dispersed with the cleaned garments.
(10) Exits. All self-service coin-operated dry-cleaning establishments
shall have two exits, properly marked, to grade which shall be at
least 25 feet apart from each other and access therefrom shall be
provided to a street or public way.
(11) Residue; storage and disposal. Filter residue and other residue
containing solvent from such dry-cleaning machines shall be
disposed of so as not to create a health hazard or nuisance. A
locked metal container with closely fitted cover lid shall be used for
temporary storage outside the building.
(12) Exhaust systems. An exhaust system shall be provided for the
removal of toxic vapors, shall be under static pressure by reason of
mechanical fans and shall include the following features:
(a) Customer area.
[1] The customer area shall be ventilated through the
enclosure into the service area and thence to the
atmosphere according to the following minimum
requirements, but based on the volume of the premises:
Number of Machines
Minimum Ventilation per
Machine (cubic feet per
minute)
1 to 4 500
5 to 8 400
9 to 6 350
Over 16 300
[2] This ventilation system shall be continuously operated at
all times when the establishment is open for business, and
such system should be interlocked with the dry-cleaning
machines so that the latter cannot be made available for
operation without actuating this exhaust system. The
machine shall be designed so that air for ventilation of the
§ 143-11 DRY-CLEANING AND LAUNDRY § 143-11
143:129
customer area will be drawn through the front loading
door when it is open. Ventilating air from the customer
area shall be drawn through the enclosure by means of
either the front loading door, when open, or the open grill
of the cabinet housing at a face velocity of at least 100 feet
per minute.
(b) Machine. Each machine must be vented through a tumbler
exhaust duct under static pressure to the atmosphere.
(c) Service area. The service area behind the enclosure must be
provided with a separately wired general ventilation fan to the
atmosphere to be used in emergencies such as spillage of
solvent. In addition, at least one scavenger duct for each two
machines, such ducts to be connected to the continuously
operating customer area ventilation system, must be provided
to pick up vapors surrounding the equipment at the floor. The
suction opening of these scavenger ducts should be located
two to four inches above the floor.
(13) Exhaust terminations. All such exhaust system terminations shall
exhaust to the outside atmosphere, be at least seven feet above the
roof, be installed in such a manner as to provide rapid dispersal of
vapors, be located so as to prevent recirculation, be located as
remotely as possible from appliance air intakes and in no event
create a nuisance or expose the public to fumes. Discharges shall
be directed away from air intake openings, windows or ventilation
openings. Such exhaust terminations shall be properly screened
and weather capped.
(14) Makeup air; negative pressure. To compensate for the air being
continuously exhausted from the customer area and to prevent the
development of negative pressure in the premises, appropriate
fresh-air intakes must be provided to allow fresh air from the
outside atmosphere to enter said customer area. It will probably be
necessary to add extra heating facilities to heat this incoming fresh
air during the winter or heating season.
(15) Lint traps. Direct equipment exhausts and vents shall be provided
with lint traps or arrestors which shall be cleaned on a regular
maintenance schedule as determined by the Building Inspector.
[Amended 9-14-1987 by L.L. No. 4-1987]
(16) Solvent safety sump. To limit vapor accumulation and to remove
solvent due to accidental spillage or failure of equipment or solvent
containers, all self-service coin-operated dry-cleaning machines
and also all solvent storage containers shall be installed inside a
tray or dike area which shall be curbed around its perimeter to a
height sufficient to retain the entire volume of solvent in the system
or systems and container or containers. A separate drain system
shall be installed inside the tray or dike area so as to allow the
§ 143-11 LARCHMONT CODE § 143-11
143:130
§ 143-12. User instructions and precautions.
prompt drainage by gravity of the entire volume of solvent to a
closed, buried storage tank of adequate size. The entire floor of the
service area shall be impervious to the solvent and to water and
shall be sloped to the solvent drains. Such overflow storage tanks
shall be vented to the atmosphere in a similar manner to exhaust
terminations, as outlined in Subsection A(13).
(17) Fire extinguishers. Each such establishment shall be provided with
accessible, portable fire-extinguisher equipment, approved by the
Fire Department, of the carbon-dioxide or dry-chemical type, and
such extinguisher equipment shall be regularly maintained on an
annual basis or after a fire on the premises.
(18)No pressing machines. In such self-service coin-operated drycleaning
establishment, commercial-type pressing machines for
use by the general public will not be permitted.
(19) Gas mask. The attendant shall be trained in the use of a gas mask,
to be provided in an accessible location in each such establishment.
Such gas mask shall be an approved Bureau of Mines canister-type
with specific canister for the solvent used, shall be kept in good
repair and available for immediate use.
(20) Servicing equipment. Each such dry-cleaning machine is to be
checked daily and kept in good repair, and the regular maintenance
schedule of the manufacturer is to be adhered to. All maintenance
personnel shall be familiar with all necessary machinery repairs
and instructed as to the solvent hazards.
B. Temporary regulations. The Building Inspector may order the
temporary observance of such additional regulations as he may deem
necessary for the protection of customers, employees or the public.
Such temporary regulations shall expire, however, unless approved by
the Board of Trustees at its first regularly scheduled meeting following
the imposition thereof.
A. All self-service coin-operated dry-cleaning-machine establishments
shall prominently display lighted indoor signs warning the general
public of the danger of excessive solvent vapor inhalation and skin
irritation from unevaporated dry cleaning solvent, restriction on age of
machine users, instructions as to what types and loads of materials may
not be safely put in such dry-cleaning machine, not to use open-flame
gas dryers on newly cleaned fabrics or garments, that garments or
materials which retain an odor of the cleaning solvent may be
dangerous if placed in a small, enclosed, occupied space such as an
automobile, and other pertinent precautions.
B. A complete step-by-step instruction list for customer use must be
posted in a conspicuous location near the machines. Emergency

ARTICLE III
Sanitary Sewer Rent
[Adopted 4-18-2015 by L.L. No. 5-2016]
§ 229-10. Background.
A. In recent decades, federal and state legislation has been enacted along
with strict regulatory action dealing with the collection, treatment, and
discharge of human wastewater. The Village of Larchmont manages and
maintains 22 miles of a sanitary collection sewer within its borders.
Volumes from the sewers flow into the Westchester County trunk sewer
system and are treated at county sewage treatment plants, eventually
discharging into the Long Island Sound. It is critically important that
the Village maintain, repair, improve and replace, when necessary,
components of its sanitary sewer collection system in order to reduce
extraneous flows and illegal discharges into its collection system before
such flows enter the county trunk lines. A major component of the
extraneous flows into the sanitary sewer collection system is inflow and
infiltration from groundwaters and poorly functioning storm drainage
pipes. Municipalities must, by law, take action to fix and maintain
sanitary sewer collection systems and storm drains to reduce all
nonsanitary flows into the sanitary sewer system, as the additional
volumes adversely impact the trunk lines and the ability to treat waste
at treatment plants.
B. The Federal Water Pollution Control Act, also known as the "Clean
Water Act," creates strict guidelines for municipalities for managing
stormwater and sanitary sewer systems, with the goal of optimal public
health and safety. Under Section 402(p)(3)(B) of the Clean Water Act,
municipal separate stormwater sewer systems (MS4) are required to
reduce pollutants in stormwater systems to the maximum extent
practicable. To regulate such stormwater systems, the Environmental
Protection Agency (EPA) is authorized to enforce the Clean Water Act
and to encourage municipalities to reduce harmful pollutants going into
the stormwater system. Section 304(m) of the Clean Water Act sets
forth guidelines which deal with discharges and pollutants. The Village
of Larchmont, which manages an MS4, must adhere to a set of six
minimum measures in the administration of its stormwater system. One
of those minimum measures is maintaining the separation of
stormwater and sanitary sewer systems to prevent inflow between the
two systems.
C. Section 824.11 of the Westchester County Code also mandates that
municipalities "take immediate action to reduce extraneous flows of
water due to infiltration, illegal inflow and illegal stormwater
connections to tributary [sanitary] sewer systems within a
municipality's borders which are adversely impacting upon many
County POTW treatment plants in their ability to treat waste, comply
with their State Pollution Discharge Elimination System permits
(SPDES permits), and to protect and enhance the local environment."
§ 229-10 SALES, SPECIAL § 229-10
223:205
§ 229-11. Establishment of sewer rents.
Pursuant to Article 14-F of the New York State General Municipal Law
(the "Sewer Rent Law"), and in order to defray the cost of maintaining
and improving the Village's sanitary sewer system, sewer rents are hereby
established. The revenue collected by these sewer rents shall be used
for the general operation, maintenance, repairs and improvements of the
municipality's sanitary sewer system in accordance with state law.
§ 229-12. Definitions.
As used in this article, the following terms shall have the meanings
indicated:
CLEAN WATER ACT — The Federal Water Pollution Control Act (33 U.S.C.
§ 1251 et seq.) and any subsequent amendments thereto.
PUBLICLY OWNED TREATMENT WORKS (POTW) TREATMENT PLANT
— The portion of the POTW which is designated to provide treatment
(including recycling and reclamation) of municipal sewage and industrial
wastewater.
SANITARY SEWAGE — Sewage discharging from the sanitary conveniences
of dwellings (including apartment houses), office buildings, assisted-living
facilities, or institutions and free from stormwater, surface water, industrial
water, industrial wastes and other wastes.
SANITARY SEWER — A sewer intended to carry only sanitary or sanitary
and industrial wastewaters from residences, commercial buildings, and
institutions to which stormwaters, surface waters and groundwaters are not
intentionally admitted through either direct or indirect connection or lack
of maintenance or neglect.
SEWAGE — A combination of the water-carried wastes from residences,
business buildings, institutions and commercial establishments, together
with such groundwater, surface water and stormwater as may be
inadvertently present.
Therefore, a municipality must take all actions necessary to ensure that
the sanitary sewer system and stormwater system are not integrated.
D. Article 14-F of the New York State General Municipal Law allows for
municipalities to impose sewer rents on real property, to be used solely
for the maintenance, repair and improvements of the sanitary sewer
system. These funds will help further facilitate the Village of
Larchmont's compliance with the federal, state, and county guidelines
on sanitary sewer systems by establishing a steady stream of dedicated
funding to perform the necessary maintenance, repairs and
improvements to mitigate the infiltration and inflows from other
sources, including, but not limited to, stormwater and other illicit
connections to the sanitary sewer system. Compliance with federal,
state, and county code further enhances and protects the public health,
safety and welfare.
§ 229-10 LARCHMONT CODE § 229-12
223:206
SEWAGE SYSTEM — All facilities for collecting, regulating, pumping and
transporting sewage to and away from the POTW treatment plant.

consisting entirely of water from any form of natural precipitation and
resulting from such precipitation.
STORMWATER SYSTEM — Publicly owned facilities on public land or
privately owned facilities on private land by which stormwater is collected
and/or conveyed, including, but not limited to, any roads with drainage
systems, municipal streets, gutters, curbs, inlets, piped storm drains,
pumping facilities, retention and detention basins, natural and humanmade
or altered drainage channels, reservoirs and other stormwater
appurtenances to control and manage the flow of stormwater.
§ 229-13. Sanitary sewer rents; payment schedule.
§ 229-14. Sewer rent fund.
All revenues generated from sanitary sewer rents, including interests and
penalties, shall be kept in a separate account to be designated as the "sewer
rent fund." All such funds, together with the interest thereon, shall be used
in accordance with General Municipal Law § 453 and this article.
§ 229-15. Effective period of sewer rents.
The sanitary sewer rents identified in § 229-13 herein shall be effective for
sewer use beginning May 2016 and shall appear on the subsequent water
bill and each water bill thereafter.
§ 229-16. Basis for rent schedule; nonconsumption of water.
A. The owners of real property within the Village of Larchmont and those
outside the Village using the Village's sanitary sewer system or any part
thereof shall be required to pay a sanitary sewer rent for the purpose of
defraying the costs of operating, maintaining, repairing, replacing and
otherwise improving the sanitary sewer system.
B. The Village Board of Trustees shall establish by resolution a per-unit
rent schedule based on water consumption and a flat rent for properties
that are only connected to the sanitary sewer system and are not served
by the Village water system. These rents shall be included in the
Village's Fees and Charges Schedule.
C. The Village Board of Trustees shall consider uses of water, such as
irrigation, that do not directly enter the sanitary sewer system and set a
sewer rent rate reflective of that consideration.
D. All sewer rents shall be payable at intervals consistent with the water
billing schedule as set forth in § 283-21 of the Larchmont Village Code.
§ 229-12 SALES, SPECIAL § 229-16
223:207
§ 229-17. Lien; penalty for nonpayment.
A. The Village Board of Trustees shall impose a rent schedule based on
water consumption, setting a standard sewer rent per unit of water.
One unit of water constitutes 100 cubic feet (one ccf) or 748 gallons.
B. If water is not consumed or utilized, and a connection is maintained
with the Village's sanitary sewer system, a flat sewer rent per quarter
shall be imposed and shall also be included in the Village's Fees and
Charges Schedule.
A. Sewer rents shall constitute a lien on the date payable, upon the real
property served by the sewer system or such part or parts thereof for
which sewer rents have been established and imposed, and such lien
shall continue thereon until paid or satisfied. The lien shall be prior and
superior to every other lien or claim except the lien of an existing tax,
assessment or other lawful charge imposed by or for the Village.
B. A penalty of 5% of the sewer rent shall be imposed for the first month
unpaid and subsequently increased 1% for each succeeding month that
the rent remains unpaid.

Treasurer shall determine the amount of tax due from such information
as he/she is able to obtain and, if necessary, may estimate the tax on the
basis of external indexes or otherwise. He/she shall give notice of such
determination to the person liable for such tax. Such determination

241:247
§ 251-7. Mailing of notice.
Any notice authorized or required under the provisions of this article may
be given by mailing the same to the person for whom it is intended in a
postpaid envelope, addressed to such person at the address given by him
in the last return filed by him under this article or, if no return has been

provisions of this article by the giving of notice, shall commence to run from
the date of mailing of such notice.
§ 251-8. Late penalty.

or any portion thereof within the time required by this article shall be
subject to a penalty of 5% of the amount of tax due, plus 1% of such tax
for each month of delay or fraction thereof, excepting the first month, after

Treasurer, however, for cause shown, may extend the time for filing any
return and, if satisfied that the delay was excusable, may remit all or any
portion of the penalty fixed by the foregoing provisions of this section.
§ 251-9. Refunds.
If, within one year from the payment of any tax or penalty, the payer thereof
shall make application for a refund thereof and the Village Treasurer or

her decision to the person liable for the tax. Such decision may be
reviewed by a proceeding under Article 78 of the Civil Practice Law and
Rules of the State of New York if application therefor is made within
90 days after the giving of notice of such decision. An order to review
such decision shall not be granted unless the amount of any tax sought
to be reviewed, with interest and penalties thereon, if any, shall be first
deposited with the Village Treasurer and an undertaking filed with him
in such amount and with such sureties as a Justice of the Supreme
Court shall approve, to the effect that, if such proceeding is dismissed
or the tax confirmed, the applicant will pay all costs and charges which
may accrue in the prosecution of such proceeding, or at the option of
the applicant, such undertaking may be in a sum sufficient to cover the
tax, interest, penalties, costs and charges aforesaid, in which event, the
applicant shall not be required to pay such tax, interest and penalties
as a condition precedent to the granting of such order.

required by this article, the tax may be assessed at any time.

§ 251-21. Exempted improvements.
An improvement to any real property used solely for residential purposes
as a one- , two- or three-family residence shall be exempt from taxation to

improvement is used for the purpose of facilitating and accommodating the

To qualify as physically disabled for the purposes of this article, an

Veterans Exemption
[10-16-2017 by L.L. No. 9-2017]
§ 251-28. Purpose.
§ 251-29. Adjustment of § 458 Exemption.
If the total assessed value of the real property for which an exemption
pursuant to § 458 has been granted increases or decreases as the result
of a revaluation or update of assessments, and a material change in level
of assessment, as provided in Title 2 of Article 12 of Chapter 50-a of the
Consolidated Laws of the State of New York, is certified for the assessment
roll pursuant to the rules of the Commissioner of Taxation and Finance,
the Assessor shall increase or decrease the amount of such exemption
by multiplying the amount of such exemption by the change in level of
assessment factor.
A. Section 458 of the New York Real Property Tax Law ("§ 458") affords
certain veterans of military service (described in § 458) or certain
members of their families (described in § 458) who own real property
(as described in § 458) a limited exemption from real estate taxes based
upon what the statute calls "eligible funds." Under § 458, the maximum
amount of the partial exemption is $7,500. Since properties in the
Village currently are assessed at only a fraction of their actual value, a
maximum of $7,500 affords a veteran a reasonable exemption.
However, since the Village Board anticipates that the assessments of
real property in the Village will be revalued to reflect their full value in
time for the promulgation of the 2018 tentative tax assessment roll, the
exemption allowed by § 458 will be significantly diminished if the
maximum amount of the exemption remains fixed at $7,500.
B. Subdivision 5 of § 458 authorizes the Village Board, by local law, to
adjust the maximum amount of the partial exemption which § 458
allows to reflect revaluation, thereby continuing to make the exemption
produce a reasonable reduction in real estate taxes for those persons
entitled to it. Through this enactment, the Village Board exercises the
right given to it by Subdivision 5 of § 458.

§ 263-2. Definitions.
As used in this chapter, the following terms shall have the meanings
indicated:
OWNER — Any person or entity, other than the Village of Larchmont.
PARK TREES — Trees, shrubs, bushes and all other woody vegetation in
public parks having individual names and all areas owned by the Village or
to which the public has free access as a park.
STREET TREES — Trees, shrubs, bushes and all other woody vegetation on
land lying between property lines on either side of all streets, avenues or
ways within the Village.
VILLAGE ARBORIST — A certified arborist who is engaged by the Village
from time to time.
A. The preservation and maintenance of trees is necessary to protect the
health, safety, environment, ecosystems and general welfare of the
inhabitants of the Village of Larchmont. Trees provide necessary shade,
green space and aesthetic appeal, impede soil erosion, aid water
absorption, buffer noise, and provide other environmental benefits and
generally enhance the quality of life within the Village. The destruction
and damage of trees and the indiscriminate and excessive cutting of
trees cause barren and unsightly conditions, create surface drainage
problems, increase municipal costs to control drainage, impair stability
of real property values and adversely affect the character of the
community.
B. The purpose of this chapter is to promote and protect public safety, the
general welfare and the environment by regulating the planting,
maintenance, and removal of trees on certain property within the
Village of Larchmont.

employees, is prohibited from climbing trees with the aid of spurs. Any
wires of public utilities passing among the branches of trees shall be

ARTICLE I
Pine Brook - Premium Border and Hommocks Border
[Adopted 6-30-1986 by L.L. No. 7-1986]
§ 321-1. Authority; legislative intent.
Under regulations issued by the State of New York pursuant to § 8-0113 of
the State Environmental Quality Review Act [Section 617.4(j) of the New
York Codes, Rules and Regulations], a local agency may designate specific
geographic areas within its boundaries as "critical areas of environmental
concern" (also called "critical environmental areas" or "CEA's"). The cited
regulations set forth criteria for such designation. The intent of this article
is to designate certain areas in the Village of Larchmont which meet those
criteria as "critical environmental areas," thereby affording them the
protections against adverse actions prescribed by law and regulations for
such areas [Section 617.12(a)(11) of the New York Codes, Rules and
Regulations].
§ 321-2. Findings; enumeration of characteristics.
The Village of Larchmont finds, on the basis of detailed study by the Coastal
Zone Management Committee and the Conservation Advisory Commission,
that the areas described in § 321-3 below meet the prescribed criteria
referred to in § 321-1 in that each of them contains important tidal or
freshwater wetlands and an abundance of fish and wildlife, as described in
detail in Section II of the Local Waterfront Revitalization Program of the
Town of Mamaroneck and the Village of Larchmont, and that each of them
has an exceptional or unique character as one or more of the following:
§ 321-3. Designation of critical areas.
In accordance with the authority granted by Section 617.4 of Title 6 of the
New York Codes, Rules and Regulations, the following geographic areas are
designated as "critical areas of environmental concern":
A. A benefit to public health and public safety through absorption of
stormwater and mitigation of pollution.
B. An important fish and wildlife habitat.
C. An aesthetically important area of open space in an otherwise highly
developed residential area.
D. A setting for environmental education, quiet recreation and appropriate
cultural activities.
E. An area possessing great sensitivity to ecological change arising from
actions in or contiguous to the area.

ARTICLE II
East Creek
[Adopted 7-6-1987 by L.L. No. 3-1987]
§ 321-5. Authority; legislative intent.
Under regulations issued by the State of New York pursuant to § 8-0113 of
the State Environmental Quality Review Act [Section 617.4(j) of the New
York Codes, Rules and Regulations], a local agency may designate specific
geographic areas within its boundaries as "critical areas of environmental
concern" (also called "critical environmental areas" or "CEA's"). The cited
regulations set forth criteria for such designation. The intent of this article
is to designate an additional area in the Village of Larchmont which meets
those criteria as a "critical environmental area," thereby affording to it
the protections against adverse actions prescribed by law and regulations
for such areas [Section 617.12(a)(11) of the New York Codes, Rules and
Regulations].
§ 321-6. Findings; enumeration of characteristics.
The Village of Larchmont finds, on the basis of detailed study by the Coastal
Zone Management Commission, that:
A. The aboveground portion of East Creek, as shown on the map attached
to this article and as described in Section II(8) of the Local Waterfront
Revitalization Program adopted by the Village of Larchmont and the
Town of Mamaroneck in 1986, has an exceptional and unique character
as an aesthetically important area of open space adjacent to a highly
developed area, as a setting for environmental education and quiet
recreation and as an area possessing quiet sensitivity to ecological
change arising from actions in or contiguous to the area.
B. Environmental disturbance in or near East Creek, especially apt to
occur where it flows above ground, tends to aggravate problems of
siltation and pollution downstream in the Hommocks Marsh, an
environmentally sensitive and valuable tidal marsh shared between the
Village of Larchmont and the Town of Mamaroneck, their respective
portions of which are included in areas designated by them in 1986 as
critical environmental areas called, respectively, the "Hommocks
Border" (Village of Larchmont) and the "Hampshire - Hommocks Salt
Marsh Complex" (Town of Mamaroneck). Protection and restoration of
the Hommocks Marsh is called for in the Local Waterfront
Revitalization Program under Policies 7 and 7A (fish and wildlife
habitats) and under Policies 44 and 44A (tidal and freshwater
wetlands).
C. Section IV(b)(10) of the Local Waterfront Revitalization Program calls
for action to correct existing deteriorated conditions in the
aboveground portion of East Creek. To have lasting effect, such action
§ 321-5 CRITICAL ENVIRONMENTAL AREAS § 321-6
321:401
§ 321-7. Designation of critical area.
In accordance with the authority granted by Section 617.4 of Title 6 of the
New York Codes, Rules and Regulations, the East Creek Border is hereby
designated as a "critical area of environmental concern." See Schedule C
attached to this chapter for detailed legal description, and Map 1 attached
to this chapter for visual description.39
§ 321-8. When effective.
The designation contained herein shall take effect 30 days after filing
of notification with the New York State Commissioner of Environmental
Conservation that the above area has been designated as a "critical area of
environmental concern."
should be accompanied by protective legislation to help prevent such
conditions from recurring.
D. The stream bed of East Creek in its aboveground portion lies partly in
the Village of Larchmont and partly in the unincorporated area of the
Town of Mamaroneck. Accordingly, CEA status can best be conferred on
this area by action of both municipalities. On March 18, 1987, the Town
Board adopted a local law conferring CEA status on those parts of the
subject area lying within its jurisdiction.

office of the Village Clerk.

§ 331-2. Types of actions.
A. Purpose and scope.
(1) The purpose of this section is to simplify the task of determining
whether or not a proposed action may have a significant effect on
the environment by identifying the types of actions which are likely
to have a significant effect and those which will not have a
significant effect.
(2) Due to the complex and varied nature of actions, the lists in this
section are not all-inclusive. Any omission from the Type I and Type
II list of actions as set forth herein shall not be conclusive. In these
instances, or if, in the opinion of the Planning Commission, a
proposed project or activity may have a significant effect upon the
environment, although it does not meet the specific standards set
forth under Type I actions, the Planning Commission may, at its
discretion, require that an environmental impact statement be
prepared.
B. The following classification system is used in this section:
(1) Type I: actions or classes of actions that are likely to require
preparation of environmental impact statements because they will,
in almost every instance, have a significant effect on the
environment.
(2) Type II: actions or classes of actions which have been determined
as not to have a significant effect on the environment and which do
not require environmental impact statements under this Part.40
NOTE: This Part41 does not apply to actions by private persons
where no agency action is involved. The following lists are
intended to cover only actions of agencies or actions which must
be approved, funded or otherwise acted upon by an agency.
C. Type I actions.
(1) Construction of new or expansion by more than 50% of existing
size, square footage or usage of existing:

The village shall maintain files open for public inspection of all notices of
completion, draft and final environmental impact statements and written
determinations prepared or caused to be prepared by the Planning
Commission.
§ 331-22. Coordination of multiple agencies; lead agency
requirements.
A. Consistent with social, economic and other essential considerations of
state policy, to the maximum extent practicable, from among the
reasonable alternatives thereto, the action to be carried out or
approved is one which minimizes or avoids adverse environmental
effects, including the effects disclosed in the relevant environmental
impact statement.
B. All practicable means will be taken in carrying out or approving the
action to minimize or avoid adverse environmental effects, including
the effects disclosed in the relevant environmental impact statements.
A. When an action which may have a significant effect on the environment
involves more than one agency, all involved agencies shall, to the fullest
extent possible, coordinate their environmental reviews through a lead
agency, to the end that the requirements of Article 8 of the
Environmental Conservation Law and of this chapter are met by a
single draft environmental impact statement, a single final
environmental impact statement and, if conducted and practicable, a
single hearing process. In order to expedite this coordination,
§ 331-18 LARCHMONT CODE § 331-22
331:416
applicants must specify in their applications to the Planning
Commission which other agencies, to the best of their knowledge, will
have jurisdiction by law over proposed actions.

Commission determines may have a significant effect on the
environment, the Planning Commission shall immediately notify all
other agencies which may be involved in the proposed action and
request full coordination of the environmental review of such action.
The designation of the lead agency shall be made within 30 calendar
days following the filing of a complete application.
C. In the case of an action involving an applicant, the lead agency shall
immediately notify the applicant in writing that it is the lead agency and
request the applicant to prepare a draft environmental impact
statement.
D. If a question arises as to which agency is the lead agency, the agencies
shall resolve the question themselves and designate a lead agency in
writing on the basis of the following:
(1) The agency to first act on the proposed action.
(2) A determination of which agency has the greatest responsibility for
supervising or approving the action as a whole.
(3) A determination of which agency has more general governmental
powers as compared to single or limited powers or purposes.
(4) A determination of which agency has the greatest capability for
providing the most thorough environmental assessment of the
action.
(5) A determination of whether the anticipated impacts of the action
being considered are primarily of statewide, regional or local
concern, e.g., if such impacts are primarily of local concern, the
local agency should be the lead agency.
E. If such agencies are unable to resolve the question within the
prescribed 30 days, they shall submit the question in written form to
the Commissioner of the Department of Environmental Conservation,
who shall, within five business days, on the basis of the criteria
specified above, designate the lead agency.
F. If it should be determined that the Village of Larchmont is not the lead
agency in regard to an action, it shall have no further obligations under
this chapter with respect to the action being considered except:
(1) To provide its views where appropriate and, to the extent practical,
appropriate technical analysis and support.
(2) To make the findings required by § 331-18 herein.
§ 331-22 ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY REVIEW § 331-22
331:417
§ 331-23. Exemption of actions prior to statutory effective date.
Action undertaken or approved prior to the dates specified in Article 8 of
the Environmental Conservation Law for local agencies shall be exempt
from this chapter and the provisions of Article 8 of the Environmental
Conservation Law and Part 617 of Title 6 of the New York Codes, Rules
and Regulations; provided, however, that if after such dates the Village
of Larchmont or any of its departments, boards, commissions, officers or
employees having jurisdiction modifies an action undertaken or approved
prior to that date and the Planning Commission determines that the
modification may have significant adverse effect on the environment, such
modification shall be an action subject to this chapter and Part 617 of Title
6 of the New York Codes, Rules and Regulations.
§ 331-24. When effective.
(3) Not to approve, commence or engage in such action until the
procedures set forth in Article 8 of the Environmental Conservation
Law and § 331-18 of this chapter have been completed.
A. This chapter shall take effect June 1, 1977, as to actions directly
undertaken by the Village of Larchmont or any of its officers,
departments, agencies or boards.
B. This chapter shall take effect September 1, 1977, as to the actions for
which the Village of Larchmont issues licenses, permits, certificates or
other entitlements.
C. The effective dates mentioned herein are subject to possible action by
the State Legislature, the appropriate state agency or the Governor to
change such dates. If such action is taken, the effective dates will
become those dates fixed by the State Legislature, the appropriate state
agency or the Governor, as the case may be.

Precautions During Building Operations
§ 334-27. Excavations.
A. Temporary support: Until permanent support has been provided, all
excavations shall be safeguarded and protected by the person causing
the excavations to be made, to avoid all danger to life or limb. Where
necessary, such excavations shall be retained by temporary retaining
walls, sheet piling and bracing or other approved method to support the
adjoining earth.
(1) Examination of adjoining property: Before any excavation or
demolition is undertaken, license to enter upon adjoining property
for the purpose of physical examination shall be afforded by the
owner and tenants of such adjoining property to the person
undertaking such excavation or demolition, prior to the
commencement and at reasonable periods during the progress of
the work.
(2) Notice to the Building Inspector: If the person who causes an
excavation to be made or an existing structure to be demolished
has reason to believe that an adjoining structure is unsafe, that
person shall forthwith report in writing to the Building Inspector.

structure is found unsafe, the Building Inspector shall order it
repaired as provided in § 334-20.
(3) Responsibility of adjoining owner: The person making or causing an
excavation to be made shall, before starting the work, give at least
a one-week notice in writing to the owner of each neighboring
building or structure, the safety of which may be affected. Having
received consent to enter a building, structure or premises, such
person shall make the necessary provisions to protect it
structurally and to insure it against damage by the elements which
may ensue from such excavation. If license to enter is not afforded,
then the adjoining owner shall have the entire responsibility of
providing both temporary and permanent support of his premises
at his own expense. For that purpose, the adjoining owner shall be
afforded the license when necessary to enter the property where
the excavation is to be made.
(4) Excavations for other than construction purposes: Excavations
made for the purpose of removing soil, earth, sand, gravel, rock or
other materials shall be performed in such a manner as will prevent
injury to neighboring properties or to the street which adjoins the
lot where such materials are excavated, and to safeguard the
general public health and welfare.
B. Permanent support: Permanent support shall be provided in accordance
with Subsection B(1) and (2) below.

person who causes such excavation to be made, if afforded the
necessary license to enter the adjoining premises, shall preserve
and protect from injury at all times and at his own expense such
adjoining structure or premises which may be affected by the

§ 335-2 ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY REVIEW § 335-7
331:461
A. Prohibition of illegal discharges.
(1) No person shall discharge or cause to be discharged into the
municipal storm drainage system or watercourses any materials,
including but not limited to pollutants or wastewaters containing
any pollutants that cause or contribute to a violation of applicable
water quality standards, other than stormwater.
(2) The commencement, conduct or continuance of any illegal
discharge to the storm drainage system is prohibited except as
described as follows:
(a) The following discharges are exempt from discharge
prohibitions established by this article: water line flushing or
other potable water sources, landscape irrigation or lawn
watering, diverted stream flows, rising groundwater,
groundwater infiltration to storm drains, uncontaminated
pumped groundwater, foundation or footing drains (not
including active groundwater dewatering systems), crawl
space pumps, air conditioning condensation, springs,

under law or practices applicable or prevailing at the time of
connection.
§ 335-7 LARCHMONT CODE § 335-7
331:462
§ 335-8. Suspension of MS4 access.
§ 335-9. Industrial or construction activity discharges.
Any person subject to an industrial or construction activity NPDES
stormwater discharge permit shall comply with all provisions of such
permit. Proof of compliance with said permit may be required in a form
acceptable to the authorized enforcement agency prior to the allowing of
discharges to the MS4.
§ 335-10. Monitoring of discharges.
(3) A person is considered to be in violation of this article if the person
connects a line conveying sewage to the MS4, or allows such a
connection to continue.
A. Suspension due to illegal discharges in emergency situations. The
authorized enforcement agency may, without prior notice, suspend MS4
discharge access to a person when such suspension is necessary to stop
an actual or threatened discharge that presents or may present
imminent and substantial danger to the environment, or to the health or
welfare of persons, or to the MS4 or waters of the United States. If the
violator fails to comply with a suspension order issued in an emergency,
the authorized enforcement agency may take such steps as deemed
necessary to prevent or minimize damage to the MS4 or waters of the
United States, or to minimize danger to persons.
B. Suspension due to the detection of illegal discharge. Any person
discharging to the MS4 in violation of this article may have his/her MS4
access terminated if such termination would abate or reduce an illegal
discharge. The authorized enforcement agency will notify a violator of
the proposed termination of its MS4 access. The violator may petition
the authorized enforcement agency for a reconsideration and hearing.
C. A person commits an offense if, without the prior approval of the
authorized enforcement agency, the person reinstates MS4 access to
premises terminated pursuant to this section.
A. Applicability. This section applies to all facilities that have stormwater
discharges associated with industrial activity, including construction
activity.
B. Access to facilities.
(1) The authorized enforcement agency shall be permitted to enter and
inspect facilities subject to regulation under this article as often as
may be necessary to determine compliance with this article. If a
discharger has security measures in force which require proper
identification and clearance before entry into its premises, the
discharger shall make the necessary arrangements to allow access
to representatives of the authorized enforcement agency.
§ 335-7 ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY REVIEW § 335-10
331:463
§ 335-11. Use of best management practices to prevent, control,
and reduce stormwater pollutants.
The authorized enforcement agency will promulgate, subject to approval of
the Planning Board, requirements identifying best management practices
(2) Facility operators shall allow the authorized enforcement agency
ready access to all parts of the premises for the purposes of
inspection, sampling, examination and copying of records that must
be kept under the conditions of an NPDES permit to discharge
stormwater, and the performance of any additional duties as
defined by state and federal law.
(3) The authorized enforcement agency shall have the right to set up
on any permitted facility such devices as are necessary in the
opinion of the authorized enforcement agency to conduct
monitoring and/or sampling of the facility's stormwater discharge.
(4) The authorized enforcement agency has the right to require the
discharger to install monitoring equipment as necessary. The
facility's sampling and monitoring equipment shall be maintained
at all times in a safe and proper operating condition by the
discharger at its own expense. All devices used to measure
stormwater flow and quality shall be calibrated to ensure their
accuracy.
(5) Any temporary or permanent obstruction to safe and easy access to
the facility to be inspected and/or sampled shall be promptly
removed by the operator at the written or oral request of the
authorized enforcement agency and shall not be replaced. The
costs of clearing such access shall be borne by the operator.
(6) Unreasonable delays in allowing the authorized enforcement
agency access to a permitted facility is a violation of a stormwater
discharge permit and of this article. A person who is the operator of
a facility with a NPDES permit to discharge stormwater associated
with industrial activity commits an offense if the person denies the
authorized enforcement agency reasonable access to the permitted
facility for the purpose of conducting any activity authorized or
required by this article.
(7) If the authorized enforcement agency has been refused access to
any part of the premises from which stormwater is discharged, and
he/she is able to demonstrate probable cause to believe that there
may be a violation of this article, or that there is a need to inspect
and/or sample as part of a routine inspection and sampling
program designed to verify compliance with this article or any
order issued hereunder, or to protect the overall public health,
safety, and welfare of the community, then the authorized
enforcement agency may seek issuance of a search warrant from
any court of competent jurisdiction.
§ 335-10 LARCHMONT CODE § 335-11
331:464
for any activity, operation, or facility which may cause or contribute to
pollution or contamination of stormwater, the storm drainage system, or
waters of the U.S. The owner or operator of a commercial or industrial
establishment shall provide, at its own expense, reasonable protection from
accidental discharge of prohibited materials or other wastes into the
municipal storm drainage system or watercourses through the use of these
structural and nonstructural BMPs. Further, any person responsible for a
property or premises that is, or may be, the source of an illegal discharge
may be required to implement, at said person's expense, additional
structural and nonstructural BMPs to prevent the further discharge of
pollutants to the municipal separate storm sewer system. Compliance with
all terms and conditions of a valid NPDES permit authorizing the discharge
of stormwater associated with industrial activity, to the extent practicable,
shall be deemed compliance with the provisions of this section. These
BMPs shall be part of a stormwater pollution prevention plan (SWPPP) as
necessary for compliance with requirements of the NPDES permit.
§ 335-12. Watercourse protection.
Every person owning property through which a watercourse passes, or such
person's lessee, shall keep and maintain that part of the watercourse within
the property free of trash, debris, excessive vegetation, and other obstacles
that would pollute, contaminate, or significantly retard the flow of water
through the watercourse. In addition, the owner or lessee shall maintain
existing privately owned structures within or adjacent to a watercourse,
so that such structures will not become a hazard to the use, function, or
physical integrity of the watercourse.
§ 335-13. Notification of spills.
Notwithstanding other requirements of law, as soon as any person
responsible for a facility or operation, or responsible for emergency
response for a facility or operation, has information of any known or
suspected release of materials that is resulting or may result in illegal
discharges or pollutants discharging into stormwater, the storm drainage
system, or water of the U.S., said person shall take all necessary steps to
ensure the discovery, containment, and cleanup of such release. In the event
of such a release of hazardous materials, said person shall immediately
notify emergency response agencies of the occurrence via emergency
dispatch services. In the event of a release of nonhazardous materials,
said person shall notify the authorized enforcement agency in person or
by phone or facsimile no later than the next business day. Notifications in
person or by phone shall be confirmed by written notice addressed and
mailed to the Village Building Inspector and Village Mayor within three
business days of the phone notice. If the discharge of prohibited materials
emanates from a commercial or industrial establishment, the owner or
operator of such establishment shall also retain an on-site written record of
the discharge and the actions taken to prevent its recurrence. Such records
shall be retained for at least three years and shall be made available to the
authorized enforcement agency upon request at any time.

ARTICLE II
Stormwater Management and Erosion and Sediment Control
§ 335-23. General provisions; exemptions.
A. Findings of fact. It is hereby determined that:
(1) Land development activities and associated increases in site
impervious cover often alter the hydrologic response of local
watersheds and increase stormwater runoff rates and volumes,
flooding, stream channel erosion, or sediment transport and
deposition;
(2) This stormwater runoff contributes to increased quantities of
water-borne pollutants, including siltation of aquatic habitat for
fish and other desirable species;
(3) Clearing and grading during construction tends to increase soil
erosion and add to the loss of native vegetation necessary for
terrestrial and aquatic habitat;
(4) Improper design and construction of stormwater management
practices can increase the velocity of stormwater runoff thereby
increasing stream bank erosion and sedimentation;
(5) Impervious surfaces allow less water to percolate into the soil,
thereby decreasing groundwater recharge and stream baseflow;
(6) Substantial economic losses can result from these adverse impacts
on the waters of the municipality;
(7) Stormwater runoff, soil erosion and nonpoint source pollution can
be controlled and minimized through the regulation of stormwater
runoff from land development activities;
(8) The regulation of stormwater runoff discharges from land
development activities in order to control and minimize increases
in stormwater runoff rates and volumes, soil erosion, stream
channel erosion, and nonpoint source pollution associated with
stormwater runoff is in the public interest and will minimize threats
to public health and safety; and
(9) Regulation of land development activities by means of performance
standards governing stormwater management and site design will
produce development compatible with the natural functions of a
particular site or an entire watershed and thereby mitigate the
adverse effects of erosion and sedimentation from development.
B. Purpose. The purpose of this article is to establish minimum stormwater
management requirements and controls to protect and safeguard the
general health, safety, and welfare of the public residing within the
Village of Larchmont and to address the findings of fact in Subsection A
§ 335-23 ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY REVIEW § 335-23
331:469
of this section. This article seeks to meet those purposes by achieving
the following objectives: [Amended 1-24-2011 by L.L. No. 1-2011]
(1) Meet the requirements of minimum measures 4 and 5 of the NYS
Department of Environmental Conservation State Pollutant
Discharge Elimination System (SPDES) General Permit for
Stormwater Discharges from Municipal Separate Stormwater
Sewer Systems (MS4s), Permit No.GP-0-10-002, or as amended,
revised, or replaced;
(2) Require land development activities to conform to the substantive
requirements of the NYS Department of Environmental
Conservation SPDES General Permit for Construction Activities,
Permit No. GP-0-10-001, or as amended, revised or replaced;
(3) Minimize increases in stormwater runoff from land development
activities in order to reduce flooding, siltation, increases in stream
temperature, and streambank erosion, and to maintain the
integrity of stream channels;
(4) Minimize increases in pollution caused by stormwater runoff from
land development activities that would otherwise degrade local
water quality;
(5) Minimize the total annual volume of stormwater runoff that flows
from any specific site during and following development to the
maximum extent practicable;
(6) Reduce stormwater runoff rates and volumes, soil erosion and
nonpoint source pollution, wherever possible, through stormwater
management practices to ensure that these management practices
are properly maintained, and to eliminate threats to public safety;
and
(7) Require the use of green infrastructure practices to control
stormwater runoff such as protecting natural areas, reducing
impervious cover, and runoff reduction techniques to the maximum
extent practicable for land development activities that would result
in a certain net increase in impervious coverage; for all other land
development activities, encourage the use of green infrastructure
practices to the maximum extent practicable. [Amended
11-21-2016 by L.L. No. 8-2016]
C. Statutory authority. In accordance with Article 10 of the Municipal
Home Rule Law of the State of New York, the Village of Larchmont

Administration
§ 337-11. Designation of local administrator.
The Building Inspector of the Village of Larchmont is hereby appointed
local administrator to administer and implement this chapter by granting or
denying floodplain development permits in accordance with its provisions.
§ 337-12. Purpose of floodplain development permit; fees.
§ 337-13. Permit application.
The applicant shall provide the following information as appropriate;
additional information may be required on the permit application form:
A. Purpose. A floodplain development permit is hereby established for all
construction and other development to be undertaken in areas of
special flood hazard in this community for the purpose of protecting its
citizens from increased flood hazards and ensuring that new
development is constructed in a manner that minimizes its exposure to
flooding. It shall be unlawful to undertake any development in an area
of special flood hazard, as shown on the Flood Insurance Rate Map
enumerated in § 337-6, without a valid floodplain development permit.
Application for a permit shall be made on forms furnished by the local
administrator and may include but not be limited to plans, in duplicate,
drawn to scale and showing the nature, location, dimensions and
elevations of the area in question, existing or proposed structures, fill,
storage of materials, drainage facilities and the location of the
foregoing.
B. Fees. All applications for a floodplain development permit shall be
accompanied by an application fee as fixed by the Board of Trustees
from time to time. In addition, the applicant shall be responsible for
reimbursing the Village of Larchmont for any additional costs necessary
for review, inspection and approval of this project. The local
administrator may require a deposit of no more than $500 to cover
these additional costs.
A. The proposed elevation, in relation to mean sea level, of the lowest floor
(including basement or cellar) of any new or substantially improved
structure to be located in Zones A1-A30, AE or AH or Zone A if base
flood elevation data is available. Upon completion of the lowest floor,
the permittee shall submit to the local administrator the as-built
elevation, certified by a licensed professional engineer or surveyor.
B. The proposed elevation, in relation to mean sea level, of the bottom of
the lowest structural member of the lowest floor (excluding pilings and

relocated as a result of proposed development. Computations by a
licensed professional engineer must be submitted that demonstrate
that the altered or relocated segment will provide equal or greater
conveyance than the original stream segment. The applicant must
submit any maps, computations or other material required by the
Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to revise the
documents enumerated in § 337-6, when notified by the local
administrator, and must pay any fees or other costs assessed by FEMA
for this purpose. The applicant must also provide assurances that the
conveyance capacity of the altered or relocated stream segment will be
maintained.
G. A technical analysis, by a licensed professional engineer, if required by
the local administrator, which shows whether proposed development to
be located in an area of special flood hazard may result in physical
damage to any other property.
H. In Zone A, when no base flood elevation data is available from other
sources, base flood elevation data shall be provided by the permit
applicant for subdivision proposals and other proposed developments
(including proposals for manufactured home and recreational vehicle
parks and subdivisions) that are greater than either 50 lots or five
acres.

§ 337-14. Powers and duties of local administrator.
Duties of the local administrator shall include but not be limited to the
following:
components. Said plans and specifications shall be developed or
reviewed by a licensed professional engineer or architect, and shall be
accompanied by a statement, bearing the signature of the architect or
engineer, certifying that the design and methods of construction to be
used are in accordance with accepted standards of practice and with all
applicable provisions of this chapter.
A. Permit application review. The local administrator shall conduct the
following permit application review before issuing a floodplain
development permit:
(1) Review all applications for completeness, particularly with the
requirements of § 337-13, Permit application, and for compliance
with the provisions and standards of this chapter.
(2) Review subdivision and other proposed new development,
including manufactured home parks, to determine whether
proposed building sites will be reasonably safe from flooding. If a
proposed building site is located in an area of special flood hazard,
all new construction and substantial improvements shall meet the
applicable standards of Article V and, in particular, § 337-15B.
(3) Determine whether any proposed development in an area of special
flood hazard may result in physical damage to any other property
(e.g., stream bank erosion and increased flood velocities). The local
administrator may require the applicant to submit additional
technical analyses and data necessary to complete the
determination. If the proposed development may result in physical
damage to any other property or fails to meet the requirements of
Article V, no permit shall be issued. The applicant may revise the
application to include measures that mitigate or eliminate the
adverse effects and resubmit the application.
(4) Determine that all necessary permits have been received from
those governmental agencies from which approval is required by
state or federal law.
B. Use of other flood data.
(1) When the Federal Emergency Management Agency has designated
areas of special flood hazard on the community's Flood Insurance
Rate Map (FIRM) but has neither produced water surface elevation
data (these areas are designated Zone A or V on the FIRM) nor
identified a floodway, the local administrator shall obtain, review
and reasonably utilize any base flood elevation and floodway data
available from a federal, state or other source, including data
developed pursuant to § 337-13G, as criteria for requiring that new
§ 337-13 FLOOD DAMAGE PREVENTION § 337-14
337:497
construction, substantial improvements or other proposed
development meet the requirements of this chapter.
(2) When base flood elevation data is not available, the local
administrator may use flood information from any other
authoritative source, such as historical data, to establish flood
elevations within the areas of special flood hazard, for the purposes
of this chapter.
C. Alteration of watercourses. The local administrator shall:
(1) Notify adjacent communities and the New York State Department
of Environmental Conservation prior to permitting any alteration or
relocation of a watercourse and submit evidence of such
notification to the Regional Director, Region II, Federal Emergency
Management Agency.
(2) Determine that the permit holder has provided for maintenance
within the altered or relocated portion of said watercourse so that
the flood-carrying capacity is not diminished.
D. Construction stage. The local administrator shall:
(1) In Zones A1-A30, AE and AH and also Zone A if base flood elevation
data is available, upon placement of the lowest floor or completion
of floodproofing of a new or substantially improved structure,
obtain from the permit holder a certification of the as-built
elevation of the lowest floor or floodproofed elevation in relation to
mean sea level. The certificate shall be prepared by or under the
direct supervision of a licensed land surveyor or professional
engineer and certified by the same. For manufactured homes, the
permit holder shall submit the certificate of elevation upon
placement of the structure on the site. A certificate of elevation
must also be submitted for a recreational vehicle if it remains on a
site for 180 consecutive days or longer (unless it is fully licensed
and ready for highway use).
(2) In Zones V1-V30 and VE, and also Zone V if base flood elevation
data are available, upon placement of the lowest floor of a new or
substantially improved structure, the permit holder shall submit to
the local administrator a certificate of elevation, in relation to mean
sea level, of the bottom of the lowest structural member of the
lowest floor (excluding pilings and columns). For manufactured
homes, the permit holder shall submit the certificate of elevation
upon placement of the structure on the site. An elevation certificate
must also be submitted for a recreational vehicle if it remains on a
site 180 consecutive days or longer (unless it is fully licensed and
ready for highway use).
(3) Any further work undertaken prior to submission and approval of
the certification shall be at the permit holder's risk. The local
administrator shall review all data submitted. Deficiencies detected
§ 337-14 LARCHMONT CODE § 337-14
337:498
shall be cause to issue a stop-work order for the project unless
immediately corrected.
E. Inspections. The local administrator and/or the developer's engineer or
architect shall make periodic inspections at appropriate times
throughout the period of construction in order to monitor compliance
with permit conditions and enable said inspector to certify, if requested,
that the development is in compliance with the requirements of the
floodplain development permit and/or any variance provisions.
F. Stop-work orders.
(1) The local administrator shall issue or cause to be issued a stopwork
order for any floodplain development found ongoing without a
development permit. Disregard of a stop-work order shall subject
the violator to the penalties described in § 337-9 of this chapter.
(2) The local administrator shall issue or cause to be issued a stopwork
order for any floodplain development found noncompliant
with the provisions of this chapter and/or the conditions of the
development permit. Disregard of a stop-work order shall subject
the violator to the penalties described in § 337-9 of this chapter.
G. Certificate of compliance.
(1) In areas of special flood hazard, as determined by documents
enumerated in § 337-6, it shall be unlawful to occupy or to permit
the use or occupancy of any building or premises, or both, or part
thereof hereafter created, erected, changed, converted or wholly or
partly altered or enlarged in its use or structure until a certificate
of compliance has been issued by the local administrator stating
that the building or land conforms to the requirements of this
chapter.
(2) A certificate of compliance shall be issued by the local
administrator upon satisfactory completion of all development in
areas of special flood hazard.

A. Elevation. The following standards, in addition to the standards in
§§ 337-15A, 337-15B, and 337-16, apply to structures located in areas of
special flood hazard as indicated:
(1) Within Zones A1-A30, AE and AH, and also Zone A if base flood
elevation data are available, new construction and substantial
improvements shall have the lowest floor (including basement)
elevated to or above two feet above the base flood level.
(2) Within Zone A, when no base flood elevation data are available,
new and substantially improved structures shall have the lowest
floor (including basement) elevated at least three feet above the
highest adjacent grade.
(3) Within Zone AO, new and substantially improved structures shall
have the lowest floor (including basement) elevated above the
highest adjacent grade at least as high as two feet above the depth
number specified in feet on the community's Flood Insurance Rate
Map enumerated in § 337-6 (at least two feet if no depth number is
specified).
(4) Within Zones AH and AO, adequate drainage paths are required to
guide floodwaters around and away from proposed structures on
slopes.
A. Elevation. New construction and substantial improvements shall be
elevated on pilings, columns or shear walls such that the bottom of the
lowest horizontal structural member supporting the lowest elevated
floor (excluding columns, piles, diagonal bracing attached to the piles
or columns, grade beams, pile caps and other members designed to
either withstand storm action or break away without imparting
damaging loads to the structure) is elevated to or above two feet above
base flood level so as not to impede the flow of water.
§ 337-16 LARCHMONT CODE § 337-18
337:504
B. Determination of loading forces. Structural design shall consider the
effects of wind and water loads acting simultaneously during the base
flood on all building components.
(1) The structural design shall be adequate to resist water forces that
would occur during the base flood. Horizontal water loads
considered shall include inertial and drag forces of waves, current
drag forces, and impact forces from waterborne storm debris.
Dynamic uplift loads shall also be considered if bulkheads, walls, or
other natural or man-made flow obstructions could cause wave runup
beyond the elevation of the base flood.
(2) Buildings shall be designed and constructed to resist the forces due
to wind pressure. Wind forces on the superstructure include
windward and leeward forces on vertical walls, uplift on the roof,
internal forces when openings allow wind to enter the house, and
upward force on the underside of the house when it is exposed. In
the design, the wind should be assumed to blow potentially from
any lateral direction relative to the house.
(3) Wind loading values used shall be those required by the building
code.
C. Foundation standards.
(1) The pilings or column foundation and structure attached thereto
shall be adequately anchored to resist flotation, collapse or lateral
movement due to the effects of wind and water pressures acting
simultaneously on all building components. Foundations must be
designed to transfer safely to the underlying soil all loads due to
wind, water, dead load, live load and other loads (including uplift
due to wind and water).
(2) Spread footings and fill material shall not be used for structural
support of a new building or substantial improvement of an existing
structure.
D. Pile foundation design.
(1) The design ratio of pile spacing to pile diameter shall not be less
than 8:1 for individual piles (this shall not apply to pile clusters
located below the design grade). The maximum center-to-center
spacing of wood piles shall not be more than 12 feet on center
under load-bearing sills, beams, or girders.
(2) Pilings shall have adequate soil penetration (bearing capacity) to
resist the combined wave and wind loads (lateral and uplift)
associated with the base flood acting simultaneously with typical
structure (live and dead) loads, and shall include consideration of
decreased resistance capacity caused by erosion of soil strata
surrounding the piles. The minimum penetration for foundation
piles is to an elevation of five feet below mean sea level (msl) datum
§ 337-18 FLOOD DAMAGE PREVENTION § 337-18
337:505
if the BFE is +10 msl or less, or to be at least 10 feet below msl if
the BFE is greater than +10 msl.
(3) Pile foundation analysis shall also include consideration of piles in
column action from the bottom of the structure to the stable soil
elevation of the site. Pilings may be horizontally or diagonally
braced to withstand wind and water forces.
(4) The minimum acceptable sizes for timber piles are a tip diameter of
eight inches for round timber piles and eight inches by eight inches
for square timber piles. All wood piles must be treated in
accordance with requirements of EPEE-C3 to minimize decay and
damage from fungus.
(5) Reinforced concrete piles shall be cast of concrete having a twentyeight-
day ultimate compressive strength of not less than 5,000
pounds per square inch, and shall be reinforced with a minimum of
four longitudinal steel bars having a combined area of not less than
1% nor more than 4% of the gross concrete area. Reinforcing for
precast piles shall have a concrete cover of not less than 1 1/4
inches for No. 5 bars and smaller and not less than 1 1/2 inches for
No. 6 through No. 11 bars. Reinforcement for piles cast in the field
shall have a concrete cover of not less than two inches.
(6) Piles shall be driven by means of a pile driver or drop hammer,
jetted, or augered into place.
(7) Additional support for piles in the form of bracing may include
lateral or diagonal bracing between piles.
(8) When necessary, piles shall be braced at the ground line in both
directions by a wood timber grade beam or a reinforced concrete
grade beam. These at-grade supports should be securely attached
to the piles to provide support even if scoured from beneath.
(9) Diagonal bracing between piles, consisting of two-inch by eightinch
(minimum) members bolted to the piles, shall be limited in
location to below the lowest supporting structural member and
above the stable soil elevation, and aligned in the vertical plane
along pile rows perpendicular to the shoreline. Galvanized steel
rods (minimum diameter 1/2 inch) or cable-type bracing is
permitted in any plane.
(10) Knee braces, which stiffen both the upper portion of a pile and the
beam-to-pile connection, may be used along pile rows
perpendicular and parallel to the shoreline. Knee braces shall be
two-by-eight lumber bolted to the sides of the pile/beam, or four-byfour
or larger braces framed into the pile/beam. Bolting shall
consist of two 5/8-inch galvanized steel bolts (each end) for two-byeight
members, or one 5/8-inch lag bolt (each end) for square
members. Knee braces shall not extend more than three feet below
the elevation of the base flood.
§ 337-18 LARCHMONT CODE § 337-18
337:506
E. Column foundation design. Masonry piers or poured-in-place concrete
piers shall be internally reinforced to resist vertical and lateral loads,
and be connected with a movement-resisting connection to a pile cap or
pile shaft.
F. Connectors and fasteners. Galvanized metal connectors, wood
connectors, or bolts of size and number adequate for the calculated
loads must be used to connect adjoining components of a structure. Toe
nailing as a principal method of connection is not permitted. All metal
connectors and fasteners used in exposed locations shall be steel, hotdipped
galvanized after fabrication. Connectors in protected interior
locations shall be fabricated from galvanized sheet.
G. Beam to pile connections. The primary floor beams or girders shall span
the supports in the direction parallel to the flow of potential floodwater
and wave action and shall be fastened to the columns or pilings by
bolting, with or without cover plates. Concrete members shall be
connected by reinforcement, if cast in place, or (of precast) shall be
securely connected by bolting and welding. If sills, beams, or girders
are attached to wood piling at a notch, a minimum of two 5/8-inch
galvanized steel bolts or two hot-dipped galvanized straps 3/16 inch by
four inches by 18 inches, each bolted with two 1/2-inch lag bolts per
beam member, shall be used. Notching of pile tops shall be the
minimum sufficient to provide ledge support for beam members without
unduly weakening pile connections. Piling shall not be notched so that
the cross-section is reduced below 50%.
H. Floor and deck connections.
(1) Wood two-inch by four-inch (minimum) connectors or metal joist
anchors shall be used to tie floor joists to floor beams/girders.
These should be installed on alternate floor joists, at a minimum.
Cross bridging of all floor joists shall be provided. Such crossbridging
may be one-inch by three-inch members, placed eight feet
on-center maximum, or solid bridging of the same depth as joist at
same spacing.
(2) Plywood should be used for subflooring and attic flooring to provide
good torsional resistance in the horizontal plane of the structure.
The plywood should not be less than 3/4-inch total thickness, and
should be exterior grade and fastened to beams or joists with 8d
annular or spiral thread galvanized nails. Such fastening shall be
supplemented by the application of waterproof industrial adhesive
applied to all bearing surfaces.
I. Exterior wall connections. All bottom plates shall have any required
breaks under a wall stud or an anchor bolt. Approved anchors will be
used to secure rafters or joists and top and bottom plates to studs in
exterior and bearing walls to form a continuous tie. Continuous 15/
32-inch or thicker plywood sheathing, overlapping the top wall plate
and continuing down to the sill, beam, or girder, may be used to provide
§ 337-18 FLOOD DAMAGE PREVENTION § 337-18
337:507
the continuous tie. If the sheets of plywood are not vertically
continuous, then two-by-four nailer blocking shall be provided at all
horizontal joints. In lieu of the plywood, galvanized steel rods of 1/
2-inch diameter or galvanized steel straps not less than one inch wide
by 1/16 inch thick may be used to connect from the top wall plate to the
sill, beam, or girder. Washers with a minimum diameter of three inches
shall be used at each end of the 1/2-inch round rods. These anchors
shall be installed no more than two feet from each corner rod, no more
than four feet on center.
J. Ceiling joist/rafter connections.
(1) All ceiling joists or rafters shall be installed in such a manner that
the joists provide a continuous tie across the rafters. Ceiling joists
and rafters shall be securely fastened at their intersections. A
metal or wood connector shall be used at alternate ceiling joist/
rafter connections to the wall top plate.
(2) Gable roofs shall be additionally stabilized by installing two-by-four
blocking on two-foot centers between the rafters at each gable end.
Blocking shall be installed a minimum of eight feet toward the
house interior from each gable end.
K. Projecting members. All cantilevers and other projecting members
must be adequately supported and braced to withstand wind and water
uplift forces. Roof eave overhangs shall be limited to a maximum of two
feet and joist overhangs to a maximum of one foot. Larger overhangs
and porches will be permitted if designed or reviewed by a registered
professional engineer or architect and certified in accordance with
§ 337-13.
L. Roof sheathing.
(1) Plywood, or other wood material, when used as roof sheathing,
shall not be less than 15/32 inch in thickness, and shall be of
exterior sheathing grade or equivalent. All attaching devices for
sheathing and roof coverings shall be galvanized or be of other
suitable corrosion-resistant material.
(2) All corners, gable ends, and roof overhangs exceeding six inches
shall be reinforced by the application of waterproof industrial
adhesive applied to all bearing surfaces of any plywood sheet used
in the sheathing of such corner, gable end, or roof overhang.
(3) In addition, roofs should be sloped as steeply as practicable to
reduce uplift pressures, and special care should be used in
securing ridges, hips, valleys, eaves, vents, chimneys, and other
points of discontinuity in the roofing surface.
M. Protection of openings. All exterior glass panels, windows, and doors
shall be designed, detailed, and constructed to withstand loads due to
the design wind speed of 75 miles per hour. Connections for these

areas).
The following standards apply to new and substantially improved
commercial, industrial and other nonresidential structures, in addition to
the requirements in §§ 337-15A, 337-15B and 337-16.
elements must be designed to transfer safely the design loads to the
supporting structure. Panel widths of multiple-panel sliding glass doors
shall not exceed three feet.
N. Breakaway wall design standards.
(1) The breakaway wall shall have a design safe loading resistance of
not less than 10 pounds per square foot and not more than 20
pounds per square foot, with the criterion that the safety of the
overall structure at the point of wall failure be confirmed using
established procedures. Grade beams shall be installed in both
directions for all piles considered to carry the breakaway wall load.
Knee braces are required for front row piles that support
breakaway walls.
(2) Use of breakaway wall strengths in excess of 20 pounds per square
foot shall not be permitted unless a registered professional
engineer or architect has developed or reviewed the structural
design and specifications for the building foundation and
breakaway wall components, and certifies that (1) the breakaway
walls will fail under water loads less than those that would occur
during the base flood; and (2) the elevated portion of the building
and supporting foundation system will not be subject to collapse,
displacement, or other structural damage due to the effects of wind
and water loads acting simultaneously on all building components
(structural and nonstructural). Water loading values used shall be
those associated with the base flood. Wind loading values shall be
those required by the building code.
A. Within Zones A1-A30, AE and AH and also Zone A, if base flood
elevation data is available, new construction and substantial
improvements of any nonresidential structure, together with attendant
utility and sanitary facilities, shall either:
(1) Have the lowest floor, including basement or cellar, elevated to or
above two feet above the base flood elevation; or
(2) Be floodproofed so that the structure is watertight below two feet
above the base flood level with walls substantially impermeable to

§ 337-22. Appeals board.
A. The Zoning Board of Appeals as established by the Village of Larchmont
shall hear and decide appeals and requests for variances from the
requirements of this chapter.
B. The Zoning Board of Appeals shall hear and decide appeals when it is
alleged that there is an error in any requirement, decision or
determination made by the local administrator in the enforcement or
administration of this chapter.
C. Those aggrieved by the decision of the Zoning Board of Appeals may
appeal such decision to the Supreme Court pursuant to Article 78 of the
Civil Practice Law and Rules.
D. In passing upon such applications, the Zoning Board of Appeals shall
consider all technical evaluations, all relevant factors, standards
specified in other sections of this chapter and:
(1) The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the
injury of others.
(2) The danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion damage.
(3) The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood
damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner.
(4) The importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to
the community.
(5) The necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where
applicable.
(6) The availability of alternative locations for the proposed use which
are not subject to flooding or erosion damage.
(7) The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated
development.
(8) The relationship of the proposed use to the Comprehensive Plan
and floodplain management program of that area.
(9) The safety of access to the property in times of flood for ordinary
and emergency vehicles.
(10) The costs to local governments and the dangers associated with
conducting search-and-rescue operations during periods of
flooding.
§ 337-22 FLOOD DAMAGE PREVENTION § 337-22
337:513
§ 337-23. Conditions for variances.
(11) The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise and sediment
transport of the floodwaters and the effects of wave action, if
applicable, expected at the site.
(12) The costs of providing governmental services during and after
flood conditions, including search-and-rescue operations and
maintenance and repair of public utilities and facilities such as
sewer, gas, electrical and water systems and streets and bridges.
E. Upon consideration of the factors of Subsection D and the purposes of
this chapter, the Zoning Board of Appeals may attach such conditions to
the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purpose
of this chapter.
F. The local administrator shall maintain the records of all appeal actions,
including technical information, and report any variances to the Federal
Emergency Management Agency upon request.
A. Generally, variances may be issued for new construction and
substantial improvements to be erected on a lot of 1/2 acre or less in
size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures
constructed below the base flood level, provided that the items in
§ 337-22D(1) through (12) have been fully considered. As the lot size
increases beyond the 1/2 acre, the technical justification required for
issuing the variance increases.
B. Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic
structures upon determination that:
(1) The proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the
structure's continued designation as an historic structure.
(2) The variance is the minimum necessary to preserve the historic
character and design of the structure.
C. Variances may be issued by a community for new construction and
substantial improvements and for other development necessary for the
conduct of a functionally dependent use, provided that:
(1) The criteria of Subsections A, D, E and F of this section are met.
(2) The structure or other development is protected by methods that
minimize flood damages during the base flood and create no
additional threat to public safety.

increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.
E. Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is
the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief.
§ 337-22 LARCHMONT CODE § 337-23
337:514
F. Variances shall only be issued upon receiving written justification of:
(1) A showing of good and sufficient cause.
(2) A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in
exceptional hardship to the applicant.
(3) A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in
increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety or
extraordinary public expense; create nuisances; cause fraud on or
victimization of the public; or conflict with existing chapters or
ordinances.
G. Any applicant to whom a variance is granted for a building with the
lowest floor below the base flood elevation shall be given written notice
over the signature of a community official that the cost of flood
insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from
lowest floor elevation.

ARTICLE III
Public Displays
[Adopted 9-8-1986 by L.L. No. 8-1986]
§ 357-21. Legislative intent.
§ 357-22. Definitions.
As used in this article, the following terms shall have the meanings
indicated:
PHYSICAL DISPLAY — Shall have the plain and common meaning of those
words. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the term shall
include signs, posters, signboards and the like, except those which are
carried by people and not placed on or affixed to the ground (except
momentarily).
PRIVATE PARTY — Any person, corporation, partnership, firm or other
entity, except the Village of Larchmont and its various boards, commissions,
committees, departments and agencies.
A. Recent court decisions have brought to the Village Board's attention the
fact that certain types of physical displays are deemed to be symbolic
speech and, as such, are entitled to the same constitutional protections
and safeguards and subject to the same types of regulation as verbal
speech.
B. Physical displays have characteristics which obviously make them
different in some respects from verbal speech. For example, they are
generally more permanent than a person or group of people who speak
and then move on. Their size can be almost limitless. If not constructed
and erected properly, they can be dangerous. They can attract vandals
and, particularly if placed in parks, children. One cannot tell who is
responsible for their placement and removal without a mechanism for
responsible persons to identify themselves.
C. Being aware that certain physical displays on public property are
entitled to the same protections as verbal speech and also being aware
that physical displays are different from verbal speech in some
respects, the Village Board believes that it is in the best interest of the
village to have a stated set of rules regarding such displays which can
be applied evenhandedly, which will encourage and provide for
dissemination of ideas on public property in a manner consistent with
the other uses made of the property and which will maximize the public
health, safety and welfare.
D. The Village Board heretofore established a Public Forum Committee to
study the subject of displays on public property and report to the Board
its findings and recommendations. The Committee has done so. The
Board is in accord with the Committee's report, and it is the Board's
intent to implement the Committee's recommendations by enacting this
article.
§ 357-21 SIGNS, ADVERTISEMENTS AND PUBLIC § 357-22
357:535
PUBLIC PROPERTY — All streets, highways and sidewalks within the
Village of Larchmont, whether public or private, and all other lands owned
by or dedicated to the Village of Larchmont.
§ 357-23. Displays on streets and sidewalks.
Except as otherwise specifically permitted by local law, either heretofore
or hereinafter enacted, no physical displays may be erected, placed or
maintained on any street or sidewalk within the Village of Larchmont by
private parties; provided, however, that the traditional annual sidewalk
sales conducted by village merchants may continue to be conducted by
village merchants upon resolution of the Village Board.
§ 357-24. Displays on nonpark property.
No physical displays may be erected, placed or maintained on any other
public property in the Village of Larchmont which has not been dedicated
by resolution or local law of the Village Board as a public park.
§ 357-25. Displays on public park property.
Physical displays may be placed on property which has been dedicated by
resolution or local law of the Village Board as public park property under
the following terms and conditions:
A. No physical displays containing commercial advertising, soliciting
funds or advertising any event, whether by a profit or nonprofit
organization, shall be permitted.
B. Physical displays shall not be permitted in any location in the following
parks because there is no appropriate place to place them without
interfering with the primary uses of the parks and/or because of traffic
and safety hazards to motorists and people using these parks:
(1) Lorenzen Park.
(2) Pine Brook Park.
(3) Kane Park (Parcels 1 and 2).
(4) Parklet at intersection of Palmer Avenue and Parkway (Dematte
Memorial).
C. In the remaining six village parks, physical displays shall be permitted
in the locations shown in Appendix A to this article.48
D. Application and permit.
(1) Any private party wishing to place a display in one of the permitted
locations shall submit an application to the Village Clerk in the
form shown in Appendix B to this article49 containing the
48.Editor's Note: Appendix A is included at the end of this chapter.
§ 357-22 LARCHMONT CODE § 357-25
357:536
information requested thereon. The description of the display and
the accompanying sketch or plan shall be sufficiently detailed for
the Village Building Inspector to determine the structural integrity
of the proposed display and how it will be anchored to the ground,
if at all. The application shall be submitted at least 30 days prior
to the first date the applicant is requesting to place the display on
park property.
(2) Action by Building Inspector.
(a) Upon receipt of the application, the Village Clerk shall forward
a copy thereof to the Village Building Inspector. The Building
Inspector shall then examine the description of the proposed
display in order to determine whether the proposed display will
be structurally sound and sufficiently anchored.

applicant to make the required determination, he may request
the necessary information from the applicant, who shall supply
it within five days of the request.
(c) Within 15 days of receipt of all necessary information, the
Village Building Inspector shall advise the Village Clerk
whether the proposed display, as described to him, appears to
be structurally sound for its purpose and properly anchored. If
the Building Inspector finds the display will not be structurally
sound or properly anchored or if insufficient information has
been submitted to him, no permit shall issue.
(3) If the Building Inspector issues a positive determination, the
Village Clerk shall issue a permit upon the filing with her of an
agreement by the applicant to defend, indemnify and hold the
village harmless in connection with the display in the form attached
hereto as Appendix C50 and an insurance certificate naming the
village as a coinsured in connection with the display, with liability
limits as set by Village Board resolution from time to time.
E. Each display shall be accompanied by a sign prominently placed and
readable by passersby containing letters of at least 12 inches, stating by
whom the display has been erected and further stating that the person
or organization is "a private (party or organization), not the Village of
Larchmont."
F. Each display shall be erected in accordance with the description
submitted to the Building Department as described above.
G. No display shall remain in place for more than three weeks, and the
applicant shall remove it and restore the property to the condition it

Law).51
§ 375-2. Legislative intent; purpose.
A. This chapter is intended to provide a framework for agencies of the
Village of Larchmont to consider the policies and purposes contained in
the local waterfront revitalization program when reviewing applications
for actions or direct agency actions and to assure, to the maximum
extent practicable, that such actions are consistent with said policies
and purposes.

enhancement and utilization of the natural and man-made resources of
the unique coastal area of the Village of Larchmont take place in a
coordinated and comprehensive manner to ensure a proper balance
between natural resources and the need to accommodate population
growth and economic development. Accordingly, it is the purpose of this
chapter to achieve such a balance, permitting the beneficial use of
coastal resources while preventing loss of living marine resources and
wildlife; diminution of open space areas or public access to the
waterfront; erosion of shoreline; impairment of scenic beauty; losses

the affirmative, the manner in which and the extent to which
the inconsistency and/or advancement is likely to result.
(d) If the questions in Subsection C(1)(a) and (b) are both

(2) The Commission may also, in its discretion, suggest ways in which
the purposes of the proposed action might be accomplished in a
manner that would result in less hindrance or no hindrance to the
policies and purposes of the LWRP and/or in greater advancement
of them.
D. If the Commission finds, in its opinion rendered under Subsection C of
this section, that the proposed action will substantially hinder the
achievement of or be substantially inconsistent with one or more
policies of the LWRP, the referring agency shall, as soon as possible

district and its peculiar suitability for particular uses, and with a view to
conserving the value of buildings and encouraging the most appropriate use
of land throughout the Village of Larchmont.
§ 381-3. Application of regulations.

a use variance has been granted by the Zoning Board of Appeals
pursuant to Article X shall be deemed to be a nonconforming use.
B. Except as hereinafter provided, no building or structure or part thereof
shall hereafter be erected, structurally altered, enlarged or rebuilt
except in conformity with the dimensional regulations herein
prescribed. Structures for which area variances have been granted by

land, or part thereof, which use constitutes a nonconforming use under
the provisions of this chapter, may be continued, subject to the

are diminished below the area required by this chapter, the existence of
such structure shall be deemed to be a violation of this chapter. The lot
or yard areas of structures existing at the time of the passage of this
chapter shall not be diminished below the requirements provided for herein
for structures erected after the passage of this chapter, and any such
diminishment shall render such structure in violation of this chapter. Such
required areas shall not be included as a part of the required areas of any

ARTICLE V
Supplementary Use and Dimensional Regulations
§ 381-30. Application of supplementary use and dimensional
regulations.
The use and dimensional regulations contained in this article are
supplemental and additional to the use and dimensional regulations
provided for in Article IV of this chapter. Whenever the standards or
regulations provided for in this Article V conflict with other requirements of
the chapter, the standards of this article shall apply. The approving agency
may, when reasonable, waive compliance or modify the supplemental
requirements as provided in this Article V in connection with an approval,
an approval with modification or disapproval of a development application,
except that any waiver or modification of a dimensional requirement as
provided in this Article V shall be subject to the grant of an area variance
by the Zoning Board of Appeals as provided for in § 381-77 of this chapter.
The waiver or modification of nondimensional supplemental requirements
of this article by the approving agency shall be granted only upon a showing
by the applicant that: 1) compliance with such requirements would result
in an unnecessary hardship, or that the benefits to the neighborhood or
Village of Larchmont from granting such a waiver outweigh the detriments
thereof; and 2) when such requirements are found not to be requisite in the
interest of the public health, safety and general welfare, or are found to be
inappropriate to the particular use for which approval is being sought.
§ 381-31. (Reserved)
§ 381-32. Interpretation of required yards.
A. No lot shall be so reduced in area as to make any yard or court smaller

B. No part of a yard, court or other open space provided around any
building or structure for the purpose of complying with the provisions
of this chapter shall be included as a part of a yard, court or other open
space required under this chapter for another building or structure.
C. Whenever a lot is formed from part of a lot already occupied by a
building, such separation shall be effected in such manner as not to
impair any of the provisions of this chapter with respect to the existing
building, and no permit shall be granted for the erection of a building or
structure upon the new lot thus created unless it complies with the
provisions for this chapter.
D. Yard depth shall be measured by drawing a straight line between the lot
line and the exterior wall of the structure, such that the line is
perpendicular to the lot line in the case of a curved lot line, is
perpendicular to the tangent of the lot line at all points along the lot
line. The depth shall be measured at the narrowest point between the

height of the highest of the two side walls of such court and shall be not

enclosed court not less than the width.

§ 381-33 WATERFRONT REVITALIZATION § 381-33
375:575
§ 381-34. Building height and shape.
shall be not less than 50% of the depth of the required front
yard of the adjacent residence district.
F. Land between street and building in residence districts. For all
residence districts, no portion of a lot having less than half the
minimum required lot width may be counted in determining minimum
required lot area.
A. All buildings shall be required to comply with the maximum height
standards in the Schedule of Dimensional Regulations, except as
provided in Subsection E of this section. The height of a building shall
be measured pursuant to § 381-7.
(1) In addition, for one-family residences, at no point around the
perimeter of the building shall the height be permitted to exceed 30
feet. For the purposes of this subsection, the height shall be
measured from either the preexisting or proposed grade,
whichever is lower, to the highest point of the roof in the case of a
flat, curved, or shed roof, or to the deck level in the case of a
mansard roof, or to the average distance between the eaves and the
ridge in the case of a gable, hip, or gambrel roof.
B. For both one-family residences and accessory structures, no dormer,
measured at its highest point, shall exceed the height of the ridge of the
roof to which it is attached. For dormers above the second full story of a
one-family residence, the exterior width of any individual dormer facing
the front, side, or side-front yards shall not exceed 30% of the width of
the roof to which it is attached. The width of the roof shall be measured
from end to end at the eaves.
C. Height-setback ratio.
(1) In the W, R-30, R-20, R-15, R-12.5, and R-10 Zones, the maximum
height of a one-family residence in the side and rear yards,
measured at the minimum required yard setback, shall not exceed
20 feet above the unfinished average grade along the facade.
Thereafter, the height of such building may be increased by two
feet for each additional one-foot distance provided from the
minimum required yard setback line.
(2) In the R-7.5 and R-5 Zones, the maximum height of a one-family
residence in the side and rear yards, measured at the minimum
required yard setback, shall not exceed 20 feet above the
unfinished average grade along the facade. Thereafter, the height
of such building may be increased by three feet for each additional
one-foot distance provided from the minimum required yard
setback line.
§ 381-33 LARCHMONT CODE § 381-34
375:576
§ 381-35. Flag lots and street frontage.
(3) However, in no event shall the height of the building exceed the
maximum height standard pursuant to the Schedule of Dimensional
Regulations.
D. Restriction on undifferentiated walls and rooflines for one-family
residence. In the case of one-family residential dwellings, the facades
facing the front yard, the side yard and the side-front yard shall not
create a wall which extends along a single uninterrupted plane for a
distance of more than 40 linear feet. However, this limitation on an
uninterrupted plane may be modified if deemed appropriate by the
Architectural Review Board. Such planes shall be broken up by building
offsets, by differentiated building heights and rooflines, and by the
following features, which shall be provided throughout its entire length:
windows and door openings, and/or other architectural features such as
projecting windows. In meeting the intent and purpose of this section,
roof eaves may extend into required front, side and rear yard setbacks
by a distance of up to 2 1/2 feet. [Amended 8-8-2005 by L.L. No.
3-2005; 9-27-2006 by L.L. No. 1-2006]
E. The limitations as to height set forth in the Schedule of Dimensional
Regulations (included at the end of this chapter) shall not apply to:
(1) Parapet walls not less than three feet high; church spires; belfries,
cupolas and domes of churches not for human occupancy;
chimneys; and flagpoles.
(2) Bulkheads, elevator head houses, water tanks, water towers, hose
towers, cooling towers or other structures required for permitted
industries and the principal walls of churches, schools and other
permitted public and semipublic buildings, provided that the
aggregate area of such structures above the roof shall not exceed
10% of the area of the principal building, and provided that, for
each foot by which such building or superstructure exceeds the
permitted height limits, the required front, side and rear yards
shall each be increased by one foot.
A. Flag lots shall be prohibited in all zones.
B. Minimum street frontage. No residential lot shall have a street frontage
measuring less than 50 feet, except that lots which front entirely on the
outer curve of a curved street shall have a minimum street frontage of
40 feet, and, further, that lots which front entirely on a cul-de-sac shall
have a minimum street frontage of 35 feet. In addition, no lot shall have
a street frontage measuring less than 70% of the minimum required lot
width. Where another section of this chapter requires a wider street
frontage than required herein, that section shall determine the
minimum requirement.
§ 381-34 WATERFRONT REVITALIZATION § 381-36
375:577
§ 381-36. Space between principal and accessory buildings.
Accessory buildings, including, without limitation, garages if detached from
a principal building, shall not be less than four feet from the principal
building. The measurement shall be made by measuring the minimum clear
distance measured between the exterior walls of the two buildings;
provided, however, that roof overhangs may project into the required
separation as long as they are no closer to each other at any point than two
feet apart. (See § 381-40D.)
§ 381-37. Maximum gross residential floor area ratio (FAR) and
increased setbacks for single-family dwellings in One-Family
Residence Districts and Waterfront Coastal Zone District. [Added
11-21-2016 by L.L. No. 11-2016]
A. Purpose and applicability. The purpose of this section is to preserve and
protect neighborhood character, open space, and visual aesthetics by
controlling the actual and/or perceived scale of one-family dwellings
and accessory buildings in the one-family residence and waterfront
coastal zone districts by establishing maximum gross residential floor
area ratios (FAR) and, in certain cases, requiring increased side yard
setbacks. The regulations are intended to guard against dwellings that
are disharmonious in size to the dwellings to which they are adjacent
and proximate, as well as to increase the open space around dwellings
of a certain size, while preserving the diversity of the size and design of
single-family dwellings within the Village.
B. Maximum gross residential floor area ratio (FAR) in One-Family
Residence Districts and the Waterfront Coastal Zone District. As
illustrated in the table in this Subsection B, the maximum gross
residential floor area ratio (FAR) for one-family dwellings shall be as
follows:
(1) Lots of 4,000 square feet or less shall have a maximum FAR of 0.64.
(2) Lots between 4,001 square feet and 15,000 square feet shall have a
maximum FAR of 0.64 minus 0.02 for every 1,000 square feet or
part thereof in excess of 4,000 square feet [maximum floor area
ratio = 0.64 - (0.02 x ((lot area - 4,000) ÷ 1,000))]
(3) Lots between 15,001 square feet and 20,000 square feet shall have
a maximum FAR of 0.42, minus 0.01 for every 1,000 square feet or
part thereof in excess of 15,000 square feet [maximum floor area
ratio = 0.42 - (0.01 x ((lot area - 15,000) ÷ 1,000))]
(4) Lots between 20,001 square feet and 30,000 square feet shall have
maximum FAR of 0.37, minus 0.005 for every 1,000 square feet or
part thereof in excess of 20,000 square feet [maximum floor area
ratio = 0.37 - (0.005 x ((lot area - 20,000) ÷ 1,000))]
(5) Lots in excess of 30,000 square feet shall have a maximum FAR of
0.32.

A. The maximum permitted lot coverage for lots in the One-Family
Residence Districts and the Waterfront Coastal Zone District shall be as
follows:
(1) For lots of 5,000 square feet of lot area or less, the permitted lot
coverage shall not exceed 50% plus 1% of additional lot coverage
for each 400 square feet of lot area or part thereof less than 5,000
square feet, but in no event shall the lot coverage exceed 55%
[maximum lot coverage = 0.5 + (0.01 x ((5,000 - lot area) ÷ 400))].

yard (except in the rear portion thereof), or side-front yard.
B. No breezeway, porte-cochere, or other roofed structure connecting an
accessory structure to the principal structure may be more than 20 feet
in length. For the purposes of this provision, any breezeway, portecochere,
or other roofed structure located generally between a
principal and accessory structure shall be deemed to be connecting the
two if it lies within two feet of both. If an accessory building is attached
to the principal building via a roofed structure, then the accessory
building shall be required to meet the yard requirements of the
principal building.
C. To the extent deemed necessary by the Building Inspector or, if the
application comes before it, by the Planning Board for the maintenance
of privacy or for reducing visual impacts, accessory structures shall be
screened along the rear and along the nearest side yard by a reasonable
planting of vegetative buffer, which may be required to include
evergreens.
D. All accessory structures shall be located a minimum distance of 10 feet
from the principal structure. The measurement shall be made by
measuring the minimum clear distance between the exterior walls of
the two buildings. Sills, belt courses, ornamental features, cornices,
and eaves may project into the required separation, provided that all
such projections shall be at least 15 feet above finished grade.
A. Attached garages. An attached garage or a carport shall not principally
be used for storage other than for one or more automobiles and/or
boats and shall be within walls of or attached to the principal building
or connected to it by open or enclosed breezeway. It shall be used for
housing only of one or more automobiles owned by or leased to the
occupant and shall be limited in size to one such vehicle per 5,000
square feet of lot area, and no gasoline or oil may be stored or service
rendered therein. Space for one automobile or boat may be rented to a

G. Gasoline pumps and storage. No gasoline pumps or storage shall be
permitted except as provided for in § 381-51K(1) through (4).
H. Retaining walls. In order to minimize potential detrimental impacts
associated with disturbance of established vegetation on existing steep
slopes and avoid creating new steep slopes or grading that is
disharmonious with the neighborhood topography or character, all
retaining walls shall comply with the following provisions, and no
retaining walls shall be installed except where the applicant
demonstrates that each disturbance and/or retaining wall is necessary
for the reasonable use of the property and that no adverse impacts will
result. [Added 12-19-2016 by L.L. No. 18-2016]
(1) All retaining walls shall comply with the following design
requirements:
(a) Structural retaining walls shall be constructed of permanent,
uniform, engineered materials such as concrete, precast block,
or masonry. Exposed areas of the retaining wall shall be faced
in a more naturalistic and/or rusticated material such as
cultured stone, brick, or stone that reflects the prevailing wall
style of older homes in the Village.
(b) Landscape retaining walls may be constructed in the same
fashion as structural or retaining walls described in
§ 381-41H(1)(a) above or of stone or cultured stone or durable
or preservative-treated wood, or other durable materials.
§ 381-41 LARCHMONT CODE § 381-41
375:590
(c) The grading in front of and behind all retaining walls and the
retaining walls themselves shall be constructed in a manner so
as to permit the continued flow of natural drainage and shall
not cause surface water to be blocked or dammed to create
ponding, either upon the property upon which such wall is
located or upon any adjoining or adjacent property or street.
(d) Landscaping installed in the vicinity of any structural retaining
wall shall be appropriate for the location and shall not have a
root system that will impair the integrity of the retaining wall.
(2) All retaining walls that exceed 2 1/2 feet in height, measured as set
forth in § 381-41H(3), shall comply with the following additional
design requirements:
(a) The applicant shall submit the following plans prepared by a
licensed civil engineer:
[1] A site plan showing the location and dimension of the
retaining wall;
[2] A grading plan with contour lines at a minimum of two-foot
intervals;
[3] Construction details, including the type of materials,
height and thickness of the retaining wall, type of backfill,
and drainage features;
[4] Soil cut/fill and import/export totals; and
[5] A landscaping plan for areas within 10 feet of the proposed
wall.
(b) Prior to the issuance of a building permit, all proposed
retaining walls that exceed 2 1/2 feet in height shall be
reviewed by the Village Engineer or consulting engineer for
structural design and integrity, as well as the potential for
adverse drainage, erosion, or other impacts.
(3) Measurement of height. For the purpose of this § 381-41H, the
height of each retaining wall, and the height of each tier of a wall
system, shall be measured as a vertical distance from its
bottommost exposed grade to the top of the retaining wall. The
maximum height along a varying-height retaining wall shall be
used to determine the height of each wall.
(4) Height and location of retaining walls.
(a) Retaining walls may abut property lines without a required
setback.
(b) Only one retaining wall may be permitted in each of the
following yard areas: a) within 20 feet of the front property
§ 381-41 WATERFRONT REVITALIZATION § 381-41
375:591
line; b) within 20 feet of a side-front property line; c) within
10 feet of a side property line; and d) within 30 feet of a rear
property line. In each case, the maximum permitted height
of such single retaining wall within such distances from a
property line shall not exceed 2 1/2 feet.
(c) A second retaining wall may be permitted beyond 20 feet of a
front or side-front property line, beyond 10 feet of a side
property line, and beyond 30 feet of a rear property line,
provided that each second retaining wall shall not exceed 3 1/2
feet in height, and provided that the cumulative height of
retaining walls in any yard is not greater than five feet in
height.
(d) The measurement of the cumulative height of retaining walls
shall be the sum of the height of each separate wall (with the
height of each retaining wall being defined as the
measurement at its point of maximum height).
(e) Where a fence is placed directly above a retaining wall, or
where the distance between a fence and retaining wall running
roughly parallel is equal to or less than five feet, the
cumulative height of the retaining wall and fence shall not
exceed five feet. The area between such fence and retaining
wall shall be maintained as a landscaped area consisting of
lawn, shrubs, or other vegetation.
(f) Retaining walls running roughly parallel shall be separated by
a bench of minimum horizontal distance equal to twice the
vertical height of the taller of the two retaining walls.
(g) Unless the presence of rock prevents regrading, the finished
grade of areas in front of, behind, or between retaining walls
shall not exceed one vertical foot to four horizontal feet and
shall be properly graded, stabilized, and drained in accordance
with the Village Code.
(h) Exceptions for heights of retaining walls in floodplain areas.
The heights of retaining walls may be increased beyond the
maximums set in set forth in § 381-41H(4)(b) and (c) where
such retaining walls are utilized to raise the finished habitable
floor area elevation of a building or structure above the onehundred-
year floodplain elevation established by the Federal
Emergency Management Agency or its successor, except that
the heights of such retaining walls shall not raise the floor
elevation of the habitable floor area above the floodplain
elevation by more than two feet. The applicant may be required
to utilize methods that decrease the height of a single retaining
wall, such as using two or more tiered retaining walls or
regrading the areas in front of or behind such walls.
§ 381-41 LARCHMONT CODE § 381-41
375:592
(5) The Planning Board may, for good cause shown, permit retaining
walls of greater heights and in different locations other than as
specified in § 381-41H(4), but only upon a demonstration that the
applicant used best efforts to comply with the standards set forth in
§ 381-41H(4). The Planning Board may vary such standards only to
the minimum extent reasonably possible.

J. Generators and outdoor HVAC equipment. Generators and outdoor
HVAC (heating, ventilating, and/or air-conditioning) equipment shall be
permitted outdoors as accessory structures in all One-Family Residence
Districts and the Waterfront Coastal Zone District in accordance with
all of the following requirements: [Added 11-21-2016 by L.L. No.
13-2016]
(1) A concrete or other paved pad or pads supporting such equipment
shall not exceed 80 square feet in total.
(2) Such equipment shall not be located in the front or side-front yard
and shall be located in the rear yard wherever possible. Where
such placement in the rear yard is impractical or infeasible, such
equipment shall be located in a side yard as close to the principal
building as possible, but in no circumstance shall the side yard
setback of the equipment be less than one half of the required side
yard setback for the principal building.
(3) Such equipment shall be screened by vegetation of a type, height
and density that provides for year-round screening, so that the
generator or HVAC equipment shall not be visible at grade level
from adjoining property or the public street. Such screening shall
be maintained in good condition at all times.
(4) Such equipment shall comply with the maximum sound pressure
levels set forth in § 195-3 of the Village Code. Additionally, the
Building Inspector or appropriate land use board may require such
equipment to be enclosed with materials specifically designed and
intended to attenuate such sound so as to bring them down to the
levels mandated by the Village Code. Post-installation testing to
measure the adequacy of such noise attenuation and compliance
with the Village Noise Code may be required.
K. Standards for driveway setbacks and shared driveways. The following
standards shall apply to all driveways serving one-family dwellings in
One-Family Residence Districts and the Waterfront Coastal Zone
District: [Added 11-21-2016 by L.L. No. 14-2016]
(1) No driveway shall be located less than two feet from a side
property line in the R-5 and R-7.5 One-Family Residence Districts
and less than four feet in all other One-Family Residence Districts
and the Waterfront Coastal Zone District.
(2) No driveway shall be located less than 35 feet to the intersection of
two or more streets.
(3) The maximum width of a driveway located within 20 feet of the
front or side-front property line shall not exceed 12 feet.
§ 381-41 LARCHMONT CODE § 381-41
375:594
§ 381-42. Changes of grade and soil movement. [Added 12-19-2016
by L.L. No. 19-2016]
Purpose and applicability. In order to minimize the extent to which the
existing overall topographical character of the one-family residential areas
within the Village are changed; minimize the potential negative impacts
of substantial grade changes on the community and visual aesthetics;
minimize the net amount of soil imported or exported and control the
quality of the soil imported; discourage rock blasting and rock chipping; and
minimize the removal of trees and established vegetation, destabilization of
sloped areas, and the extent and rate of stormwater runoff and soil erosion
in accordance with all applicable federal, state, and local regulations, the
following provisions shall apply to changes in grade and soil movement:
(4) Driveways that are shared by two adjoining lots shall be permitted
only when approved by the Planning Board under the following
conditions:
(a) Such a shared driveway shall only be permitted when the use
of a single shared driveway would significantly enhance traffic
safety, reduce the extent of lot coverage on both lots, and
resemble when viewed from the street, to the extent practical,
a driveway that serves a single lot.
(b) Such a shared driveway shall be no wider than 12 feet in width
for the length of the driveway from the street to the extreme
rear corner of the dwelling that is located closest to the street;
at such corner, the shared driveway may then be required to
divide into two separate driveways, provided that each
driveway is separated by a planting strip that widens to at least
three feet on either side of the property line within 10 feet of
such division.
(c) Such a shared driveway shall also be set back at least three
feet from the sides of the principal buildings on each lot, which
setbacks shall be maintained as a landscaped strip consisting
of lawn, shrubs, or other vegetation.
A. Maximum increase/decrease in existing grade. For one-family
residential lots, changes in topographic contours shall be in accordance
with the following:
(1) For each lot, the grading plan should seek to balance areas of fill
and excavation, in order to minimize changes to existing
topography and also to minimize the net import or export of soil.
(2) At each location across a lot, the maximum allowable change
(raising or lowering) in existing grade shall depend on the
location's distance from the property line and not exceed the
maximum change in grade as set forth in accordance with the
following table:
§ 381-41 WATERFRONT REVITALIZATION § 381-42
375:595
Distance From Property Line
(feet)
Maximum Change in Grade
From Existing Grade
(feet)
50 and greater 5
40 to 50 4
30 to 40 3
0 to 30 2
(3) Retaining walls may be utilized to stabilize horizontal surfaces that
are at different elevations, provided that such retaining walls
comply with the provisions set forth in § 381-41H and that they do
not have the effect of changing the existing grade beyond the
limitations set forth herein.
(4) For the purposes of this Subsection A, existing grade shall either be
the contour of elevations based upon an up-to-date topographic
survey verified in the field of one foot contour lines, or the contour
elevations and/or spot elevations as shown on an existing
conditions survey map prepared by a registered land surveyor. Said
contours or spot elevations shall be based upon North American
Vertical Datum (NAVD) of 1988.
(5) In any areas of a lot where regrading occurs, the slope of the
finished grade shall not exceed one vertical foot for every four
horizontal feet and shall be properly stabilized and drained in
accordance with applicable provisions in the Village Code.
(6) In order to minimize the potential for excessively tall, exposed
garage and walkout basement levels, the maximum differential
between the points of highest and lowest finished grade around the
exposed surfaces of a building shall not exceed eight feet.
B. Soil movement.
(1) Soil-moving permits required. No person shall import or export or
cause more than 25 cubic yards of soil to be imported or exported
within any twelve-month period without first obtaining a soil
movement permit as hereinafter provided. No construction or
building permit nor certificate of occupancy shall be issued until a
soil movement permit has been issued. No permit shall be issued
for longer than 12 months.
(2) Maximum amounts of soil importation to or exportation from a onefamily
residential lot.
(a) Regardless of whether a building or other permit is being
sought, the maximum quantity of soil that may be imported to
or exported from a one-family residential lot shall be the
volume in cubic yards that is equal to 1/2 foot multiplied by the
§ 381-42 LARCHMONT CODE § 381-42
375:596
lot area (in square feet). Cubic yards of soil generated from
excavations for basements and swimming pools shall not be
counted toward such maximum quantity of soil. The Planning
Board may, for good cause shown, permit greater quantities
of soil to be imported or exported, but only to the minimum
extent reasonably possible, and only upon a demonstration that
the applicant used best efforts to comply with the maximum
quantity of soil specified herein.
(b) Up to 25 net cubic yards of soil that is imported or exported
shall be permitted as of right for all one-family residential lots.
Regardless of quantity, documentation shall be provided to the
Building Department prior to import or export activities
identifying the origination and off-site destination points.
Should the soil not be from a natural unimpacted borrow
source, data shall be provided in accordance with New York
State Department of Environmental Conservation, Division of
Environmental Remediation guidance document DER-10, as
amended from time to time, to demonstrate that the materials
are free of contaminants and are suitable for the intended use.
(c) A soil-moving permit from the Building Inspector shall be
required if the amount of soil to be imported or exported
exceeds 25 net cubic yard but is less than 185 net cubic yards.
As part of the permitting process, all documentation required
under § 381-42B(2)(b) shall be submitted. In addition, for
processed or manufactured materials not from an unimpacted
borrow source, data shall be furnished from a New York State
Certified Laboratory demonstrating that the soil is free of
contaminants and suitable for the intended use. A signed chain
of custody form shall also be furnished for all imported or
exported materials. If material is not from a natural
unimpacted borrow source, the processing facilities' applicable
state's registration or permit documentation shall be provided
to the Building Department.
(d) A soil-moving permit from the Planning Board shall be required
when the amount of soil to be imported or exported meets or
exceeds 185 net cubic yards. All documentation required under
§ 381-42B(2)(c) shall be submitted.
(e) The Building Inspector and Planning Board shall not issue a
soil-moving permit unless the applicant demonstrates that the
amount of soil to be imported or exported is no greater than is
reasonably necessary for the development and use of the lot.
(3) Soil-moving operations. In all operations for which a soil-moving
permit is required, the following operational requirements shall
apply:
§ 381-42 WATERFRONT REVITALIZATION § 381-42
375:597
(a) Prior to the start of the soil moving operations, the following
must be performed: 1) sediment barriers shall be installed and
maintained throughout the duration of the project for which
soil is being imported or exported in accordance with all
federal, state, and local regulations; 2) tree protection
measures shall be installed pursuant to the Building
Inspector's approval. The Building Inspector may also, at his/
her discretion, require the limits of the soil disturbance to be
delineated with construction fencing and other reasonable
measures to protect adjoining and adjacent property, including
streets, sidewalks, drains, and catch basins.
(b) The top layer of soil to a depth of six inches shall not be
removed from the lot but shall be stockpiled on the lot
separately from any other soil stockpiled and respread over the
lot after the remainder of the soil has been moved or after
construction has been completed. All stockpiles shall be
covered securely with a tarpaulin to protect the topsoil and to
prevent flying dust and other nuisances.
(c) All boulders, tree stumps, and other debris that are uncovered
during soil-moving operations shall be removed from the lot.
(d) In dry weather, the ground where soil-moving operations are
conducted shall be dampened to prevent flying dust.
(e) To prevent spillage of soil, no trucks shall be loaded above the
level of the sides of the truck. Each day, at the applicant's sole
expense, all adjoining streets, sidewalks, and paved surfaces
shall be cleaned of any spillage of soil or other debris. All
truckloads shall be covered securely with a tarpaulin, and if
necessary, the soil therein shall be treated with water or
chemicals to prevent flying dust. The Building Department may
require designation of an on-site soil- or mud-tracking control
area to prevent tracking of soil and mud onto public streets.
The tracking control may be accomplished with a fabric-lined
gravel bed area or other means reasonably required by the
Building Department.
(f) All debris, including soil, arising from the soil-moving
operations shall be removed from the surface of any Village
catch basin, and the Village Administrator shall be notified
immediately. If the Village Administrator determines that the
catch basin needs to be cleaned more thoroughly, the Village
will undertake the work and charge the expense thereof to the
owner as a lien against the lot.
(g) At the conclusion of soil-moving operations or construction, the
lot shall be graded to conform to the approved contour lines
and grades and stabilized to prevent erosion.
§ 381-42 LARCHMONT CODE § 381-42
375:598
§ 381-43. Supplementary design guidelines.
(h) All excavation, removal, and other mandatory ground cover
work, including restoration of property to final grades and
subsequent seeding, must be completed within 12 months from
the date of the permit.
(i) Soil-moving operations, including loading or unloading, are
prohibited between 5:00 p.m. and 8:00 a.m., Monday through
Friday, and all day on Saturday, Sunday, and federal and state
public holidays.
A. Design guidelines for lot and building frontages on Palmer, Chatsworth
and Larchmont Avenues and the Boston Post Road. In the review of

A. Definitions. As used in this section, the following terms shall have the
meaning indicated:
AFFORDABLE AFFIRMATIVELY FURTHERING FAIR HOUSING
(AFFH) UNIT —
A for-purchase housing unit that is affordable to a household whose
income does not exceed 80% of the area median income (AMI) for
Westchester as defined annually by the United States Department
of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) and for which the
annual housing cost of a unit, including common charges, principal,
interest, taxes and insurance (PITI), does not exceed 33% of 80%
AMI, adjusted for family size and that is marketed in accordance
with the Westchester County Fair and Affordable Housing
Affirmative Marketing Plan; and
(1)
A rental unit that is affordable to a household whose income does
not exceed 60% AMI and for which the annual housing cost of the
unit, defined as rent plus any tenant-paid utilities, does not exceed
30% of 60% AMI adjusted for family size and that is marketed
in accordance with the Westchester County Fair and Affordable
Housing Affirmative Marketing Plan.
(2)
B. Required affordable AFFH unit component.
(1) Within all residential developments of 10 or more units created by
subdivision or site plan approval, no fewer than 10% of the total
number of units must be created as AFFH units. In residential
developments of five to nine units, at least one AFFH unit shall be
created. Rounding shall be done as follows: for 10 to 14 housing
units: one AFFH unit; for 15 to 24 housing units: two AFFH units;
then continuing in like increments as the number of housing units
increase.
(2) No preferences shall be utilized to prioritize the selection of
income-eligible tenants or purchasers for AFFH units created
under this subsection.
§ 381-44 LARCHMONT CODE § 381-45
375:602
(3) Notwithstanding the above, all such AFFH units, whether for
purchase or for rent, shall be marketed in accordance with the
Westchester County Fair and Affordable Housing Affirmative
Marketing Plan.
C. Maximum rent and sales price. The maximum monthly rent for an AFFH
unit and the maximum gross sales price for an AFFH unit shall be
established in accordance with United States Department of Housing
and Urban Development guidelines as published in the current edition
of the "Westchester County Area Median Income (AMI) Sales and Rent
Limits" available from the County of Westchester.
D. Time period of affordability. Units designated as AFFH units must
remain for a minimum of 50 years from date of initial certificate of
occupancy for rental properties and from date of original sale for
ownership units.
E. Property restriction. A property containing any AFFH units must be
restricted using a mechanism such as a declaration of restrictive
covenants in recordable form acceptable to municipal counsel which
shall ensure that the AFFH unit shall remain subject to regulations for
the minimum fifty-year period of affordability. Among other provisions,
the covenants shall require that the unit be the primary residence of the
resident household selected to occupy the unit. Upon approval, such
declaration shall be recorded against the property containing the AFFH
unit prior to the issuance of a certificate of occupancy for the
development.
F. Unit appearance and integration.
(1) Within single-family developments, the AFFH units may be singlefamily
homes or if the Planning Board so elects, they may be
incorporated into one or more two-family homes. If the Planning
Board so elects, one or more AFFH units may be located on a lot
meeting 75% of the minimum lot area for the single-family homes in
the development. Each such two-family home shall be located on a
lot meeting the minimum lot area for the single-family homes in the
development. All such units shall be indistinguishable in
appearance, siting and exterior design from the other single-family
homes in the development, to the furthest extent possible. Interior
finishes and furnishings may be reduced in quality and cost to
assist in the lowering of the cost of development of the AFFH units.
(2) Within multifamily developments, the AFFH units shall be
physically integrated into the design of the development, and
where multiple AFFH units are required, to the extent feasible,
they shall be distributed among various sizes (efficiency, one-, two-,
three- and four-bedroom units) in the same proportion as all other
units in the development. The AFFH units shall not be
distinguishable from other market rate units from the outside or
building exteriors. Interior finishes and furnishings may be reduced
§ 381-45 WATERFRONT REVITALIZATION § 381-45
375:603
in quality and cost to assist in the lowering of the cost of
development of the AFFH units.
G. Minimum floor area.
(1) The minimum gross floor area per AFFH unit shall not be less than
80% of the average floor area of nonrestricted housing units in the
development and no less than the following:
Dwelling Unit
Minimum Gross Floor Area
(square feet)
Efficiency 450
1-bedroom 675
2-bedroom 750
3-bedroom 1,000 (including at least 1.5 baths)
4-bedroom 1,200 (including at least 1.5 baths)
For the purposes of this section, paved terraces or balconies may
be counted toward the minimum gross floor area requirement in
an amount not to exceed 1/3 of the square footage of such terraces
or balconies.
(2) As an alternative or supplemental standard if the Planning Board so
elects, the minimum gross floor area per AFFH unit shall be in
accordance with the standards set forth by the New York State
Division of Housing and Community Renewal and the New York
State Housing Trust Fund Corporation in Section 4.03.03 of the
most recent edition of its joint Design Manual, http://nysdhcr.gov/
Publications/DesignHandbook/UF2009 DesignHandbook. pdf.58
H. Occupancy standards. For the sale or rental of AFFH units, the
following occupancy schedule shall apply:
Number of Bedrooms Number of Persons
Efficiency Minimum: 1, Maximum: 1
1 Minimum: 1, Maximum: 3
2 Minimum: 2, Maximum: 5
3 Minimum: 3, Maximum: 7
4 Minimum: 4, Maximum: 9
I. Affirmative marketing. The AFFH units created under the provisions of
this section shall be sold or rented, and resold and rerented during the
required period of affordability, to only qualifying income-eligible
households. Such income-eligible households shall be solicited in
accordance with the requirements, policies and protocols established in
58.Editor's Note: So in original.
§ 381-45 LARCHMONT CODE § 381-45
375:604
the Westchester County Fair and Affordable Housing Affirmative
Marketing Plan so as to ensure outreach to racially and ethnically
diverse households.
J. Resale requirements.
(1) In the case of owner-occupied AFFH units, the title to said property
shall be restricted so that in the event of any resale by the home
buyer or any successor, the resale price shall not exceed the thenmaximum
sales price for said unit, as determined in this law, or the
sum of the net purchase price (i.e., gross sales prices minus
subsidies) paid for the unit by the selling owner, increased by the
percentage increase, if any, in the Consumer Price Index for Urban
Wage Earners and Clerical Workers in the New York-Northern New
Jersey Area, as published by the United States Bureau of Labor
Statistics (the "Index") on any date between a) the month that was
two months earlier than the date on which the seller acquired the
unit and b) the month that is two months earlier than the month in
which the seller contracts to sell the unit. If the Bureau stops
publishing this index and fails to designate a successor index, the
Village of Larchmont will designate a substitute index, and the cost
of major capital improvements made by the seller of the unit while
said seller of the unit owned the unit as evidenced by paid receipts
depreciated on a straight-line basis over a fifteen-year period from
the date of completion and such approval shall be requested for
said major capital improvements no later than the time the seller of
the unit desires to include it in the resale price.
(2) Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event shall the resale price
exceed an amount affordable to a household at 80% of AMI at the
time of the resale.
K. Lease renewal requirements.
(1) Applicants for rental AFFH units shall, if eligible and if selected for
occupancy, sign leases for a term of no more than two years. As
long as a resident remains eligible and has complied with the terms
of the lease, said resident shall be offered renewal leases for a term
of no more than two years each. Renewal of a lease shall be subject
to the conditions of federal, state or county provisions that may be
imposed by the terms of the original development funding
agreements for the development or to the provisions of other
applicable local law.
(2) If no such provisions are applicable and if a resident's annual gross
income should subsequently exceed the maximum then allowable,
as defined in this chapter, then said resident may complete their
current lease term and shall be offered a nonrestricted rental unit
available in the development at the termination of such lease term,
if available. If no such dwelling unit shall be available at said time,
the resident may be allowed to sign one additional one-year lease
§ 381-45 WATERFRONT REVITALIZATION § 381-45
375:605
§ 381-46. (Reserved)
for the AFFH unit they occupy but shall not be offered a renewal of
the lease beyond the expiration of said term.
L. Administrative and monitoring agency. The County of Westchester shall
be responsible for monitoring the AFFH units during the units' periods
of affordability and for monitoring compliance with the affirmative
marketing responsibilities of those creating the AFFH units.
M. Expedited project review process.
(1) Preapplication meeting. The Planning Board's preapplication
meeting process shall be followed in connection with developments
which include AFFH units. The purposes of the preapplication
meeting will include discussion of means to expedite the
development application review process through:
(a) The early identification of issues, concerns, code compliance
and coordination matters that may arise during the review and
approval process.
(b) The establishment of a comprehensive review process outline,
proposed meeting schedule and conceptual timeline.
(2) Meeting schedule and timeline. Village departments, boards,
commissions, committees and staff shall endeavor to honor the
proposed meeting schedule and conceptual timeline established as
an outcome of the preapplication process to the greatest extent
possible during the review and approval process, subject to the
demonstrated cooperation of the applicant to adhere to same.
Should the approval process extend beyond one year, an applicant
for a development including AFFH units shall be entitled to at least
one additional meeting per year with the same departments,
boards, commissions or committees to review any and all items
discussed at previous preapplication meetings.
(3) Calendar/agenda priority. Municipal departments, boards,
commissions, or committees with review or approval authority over
applications for developments which include AFFH units shall give
priority to such applications by placing applications for
developments including AFFH units high enough on all meeting
and work session calendars and agendas so they will not be
bumped to a subsequent meeting, because of lack of time and,
when feasible based on the ability to conduct required reviews and
public notice, with the intent of shortening minimum advance
submission deadlines to the extent practicable.

signs and lighting will properly complement the architectural
design of the subject building;
(b) Whether they will result in an overly bright, busy, garish or
otherwise unattractive appearance; and
(c) Whether the use will tend to dominate the streetscape in the
vicinity of the subject site.
(3) Criteria for action by the Zoning Board of Appeals on special permit
applications for takeout food establishments in the RB District and
RC District and retail food establishments in the RC District.
(a) General criteria. The applicant shall demonstrate to the Zoning
Board of Appeals that the proposed use will meet the general
criteria for the granting of special permits set forth in Article X
of this chapter.

to the Zoning Board of Appeals:
[1] That the proposed use meets the building design
guidelines criteria set forth in this chapter;
[2] The proposed storefront design, wall signs, window signs
and lighting will properly complement the architectural
design of the building;
§ 381-51 LARCHMONT CODE § 381-51
375:618
[3] That the proposed use will not result in an overly bright,
busy, garish or otherwise unattractive appearance; and
[4] That the proposed use will not tend to dominate and will
properly enhance the streetscape in the vicinity of the
subject site.
(4) Parking and traffic criteria. The Zoning Board of Appeals shall
make certain that adequate on-street parking is available to serve
the proposed takeout food establishment or the retail food
establishment, particularly during peak periods. The Zoning Board
of Appeals may require the applicant to submit a parking survey
that documents existing parking conditions at various specified
times of the day and the effects of additional parking likely to be
needed for the proposed use. Said parking survey shall consider
the availability of curbside parking that serves the one-stop pickup
needs that often characterize a takeout business.
(5) Additional criteria to be applied to takeout food establishments:
(a) In order to avoid hazards at heavily trafficked areas, including
the intersections of Boston Post Road and Larchmont Avenue;
Boston Post Road and Chatsworth Avenue; Palmer Avenue and
Larchmont Avenue; and Palmer Avenue and Chatsworth
Avenue, no takeout food establishment in the RB or RC
Districts, and no retail food establishment with takeout
counters in the RC District, shall be located within 100 feet of
these intersections, unless the applicant demonstrates to the
Board that the nature of the use and/or the availability of onstreet
and off-street parking is such that the short-term
parking needs that are often generated by a takeout business
can be satisfied without causing traffic hazards and/or
significant additional congestion at such locations.
(b) In order to reduce traffic and parking congestion, takeout food
establishments with takeout counters should not be located
next to other uses with similar characteristics, unless it is
demonstrated to the satisfaction of the Zoning Board of
Appeals that adequate parking is available to serve more than
one such use in a given location.
(c) When reviewing the application, the Zoning Board of Appeals
shall consider the proximity of takeout establishments in the
RB and RC Districts and retail food establishments with
takeout counters in the RC District to each other and to nearby
residential properties and consider traffic, noise, cooking
odors and other conditions that could adversely affect adjacent
land and buildings, including the ground floor (see "ground
story") use of apartment buildings.
(d) In order to reduce odor problems, the Zoning Board of Appeals
shall consider the location of exhaust fans and the provision of
§ 381-51 WATERFRONT REVITALIZATION § 381-51
375:619
features such as exhaust system filters, grease extractors and
other devices to mitigate odors. Properly maintained trash
disposal facilities that minimize adverse impacts on nearby
residential properties shall be provided.
(e) If a proposed takeout counter, refrigerator, oven, vending
machine, sign or other equipment in a takeout establishment is
located so that it is visible from the abutting street and
sidewalk, the Zoning Board of Appeals may require additional
mitigation measures to ensure that the proposed use properly
blends into the streetscape, addressing design components
such as location of counters or equipment, window treatment,
sign design and illumination.

E. Wireless telecommunications antennas, support structures and
equipment facilities.
(1) Findings; purposes; intent.
(a) Findings and purposes. The Village finds that one of the
principal assets of the Village is its attractive, low-rise, onefamily
residential character; that wireless telecommunications
facilities are generally unsightly, cause visual blight and, if not
sited in appropriate locations, could seriously damage the
aesthetic character of the Village; that the existence of
wireless telecommunications facilities within the Village
without proper safeguards to protect the aesthetic character of
the community would be counter to the Village's
Comprehensive Plan; that, after consultation with the Village
Engineer and consideration of the fact that the Village is only
approximately one square mile in size, the most appropriate
areas for the siting of wireless telecommunications facilities
are existing sites or Village property where communications
facilities can be most adequately hidden from view; and that it
is unnecessary and would be adverse to the aesthetic character
of the community to allow wireless telecommunications
facilities within one-family residence districts.
(b) It is the intent of the Village to protect and promote the health,
safety and general welfare of its residents by establishing an
orderly process for regulating the siting of wireless
telecommunications facilities. Therefore, a primary purpose of
this section is to establish standards to minimize the adverse
visual impact of wireless telecommunications facilities through
proper site placement, design and height limitation in order to
preserve the aesthetic character of the Village and to maintain
§ 381-55 WATERFRONT REVITALIZATION § 381-55
375:625
property values; to establish standards for the safe provision
of wireless telecommunications services consistent with
applicable state and federal law; and to encourage the shared
use of wireless telecommunications facilities where
appropriate. The potential locations for facilities within the
Town of Mamaroneck antenna zone are particularly
appropriate because these locations contain or are near sites
containing existing facilities where new facilities might be
collocated or with which new facilities will visually blend. The
two potential Village-owned sites (Village Hall and the public
works yard) present unique opportunities to site the facilities
because, while they are in or adjacent to residential areas,
the existing improvements can be used to screen the antennas
from their residential neighbors. It is for these reasons, and not
revenue generation, that this section gives preference to these
locations.
(2) Except as otherwise provided herein, no wireless
telecommunications antenna (hereinafter "antenna" or
"antennas"), support structure or equipment facility shall hereafter
be used, erected, changed or altered unless a special permit is
obtained from the Zoning Board of Appeals in conformity with this
chapter.
(3) Location requirements. Any application for the installation of an
antenna, support structure or equipment facility shall comply with
the following requirements:
(a) Such application shall not be approved unless the Board finds
that the applicant has shown that adequate service cannot be
accommodated by the installation of the proposed antenna,
support structure and/or equipment facility within the Town of
Mamaroneck zoning district where such antennas are
permitted;
(b) If the Zoning Board of Appeals makes the finding required in
Subsection E(3)(a) above, such application shall not be
approved unless the Zoning Board of Appeals makes an
additional finding that the applicant has shown that adequate
service cannot be accommodated on property owned by the
Village of Larchmont [see Subsection E(10) below]; and
(c) Upon findings required by Subsection E(3)(a) and (b), the
Zoning Board of Appeals may grant a special permit for
installation of an antenna, installation of a support structure on
or in an existing building of four stories or more in one of the
following districts: Retail Business (RB); Retail Center (RC).
(4) Collocation requirements. The Zoning Board of Appeals shall have
the authority to require an applicant to demonstrate that the
antenna and/or related equipment planned for the proposed
§ 381-55 LARCHMONT CODE § 381-55
375:626
location cannot be accommodated in or on a building, support
structure and/or equipment facility where one or more antennas
are already lawfully located for one or more of the following
reasons:
(a) The absence of existing installations in the area requiring
service;
(b) The antenna would exceed the structural capacity of the
existing or approved support structure or building, as
documented by a qualified professional engineer, and the
existing or approved support structure cannot be reinforced,
modified or replaced to accommodate the planned or
equivalent antenna at a reasonable cost;
(c) The antenna would cause interference, materially impacting
the usability of other existing or planned antenna(s) at the
support structure or building, as documented by a qualified
professional engineer, and the interference cannot be
prevented at a reasonable cost; and/or
(d) Make no more than a reasonable charge for shared use, based
on generally accepted accounting principles. The charge may
include, but is not limited to, a pro rata share of the cost of site
selection, planning, project administration, land costs, site
design, construction and maintenance, financing, return on
equity, depreciation and all of the costs of adapting the support
structure or equipment to accommodate a shared user without
causing electromagnetic interference.
(5) Performance standards for antennas, support structures and
equipment facilities. Antennas, support structures and equipment
facilities shall conform to the following standards:
(a) Proof of noninterference from antenna(s). Each application for
installation of an antenna shall include either a preliminary or
a certified statement of a qualified professional engineer that
the installation of the antenna, including reception and
transmission function, will not interfere with the radio,
wireless or telecommunications services enjoyed by properties
within or near the Village or with public safety, radio, wireless
and telecommunications. In the event that only a preliminary
statement is submitted with the application, a final certified
statement of noninterference shall be provided prior to the
issuance of a building permit.
(b) Antenna safety. Antennas shall be subject to state and federal
regulations pertaining to nonionizing radiation and other
health hazards related to such facilities. If new more restrictive
standards are adopted, the antennas shall be made to comply
or continued operations may be restricted by the Board of
§ 381-55 WATERFRONT REVITALIZATION § 381-55
375:627
Trustees. The cost of verification of compliance shall be borne
by the owner and/or operator of the support structure.
(c) Lighting. Except as specifically required by the Federal
Aviation Administration or other federal or state authority, no
antenna, support structure or equipment facility shall be
illuminated, except that buildings may use lighting required by
the New York State Building Code or when required for
security reasons pertaining directly to the security of the
particular communications facility. When lighting is used, it
shall be shielded to prevent undue impact on the surrounding
neighborhood. All lighting must be approved by the Zoning
Board of Appeals as part of the special permit.
(d) Signs and advertising. The use of any portion of an antenna,
support structure or equipment facility for signs other than
warning or equipment information signs (not including branch
names) is prohibited. Only warning and equipment information
signs approved by the Zoning Board of Appeals as part of the
special permit shall be permitted.
(e) Height limitations. Maximum height of an antenna, support
structure or equipment facility shall be no greater than
necessary, as determined by the Zoning Board of Appeals.
Accordingly, such heights shall be set by the Zoning Board of
Appeals on a case-by-case basis and shall not be limited by the
building height regulations of this chapter.
(f) Screening. All antennas, support structures and equipment
facilities shall be located and screened in such a manner as to
be as hidden to the extent reasonably practicable.
(6) Review. A special permit issued pursuant to this section shall be
subject to review by the Zoning Board of Appeals at five-year
intervals at the expense of the owner and/or operator of the
equipment to determine whether the technology in the provision of
wireless telecommunications has changed such that the necessity
for the permit at the time of its approval has been eliminated or
modified, and whether the permit should be modified or terminated
as a result of any such change.
(7) Abandoned or unused antennas, support structures or equipment
facilities; removal. Abandoned or unused antennas, support
structures or equipment facilities shall be removed as follows:
(a) Each abandoned or unused antenna, support structure or
equipment facility shall be removed within three months of the
cessation of its use for its originally intended purpose, unless a
time extension is approved by the Zoning Board of Appeals. In
the event that an antenna, support structure or equipment
facility is not removed within such three-month period, the
antenna, support structure or equipment facility may be
§ 381-55 LARCHMONT CODE § 381-55
375:628
removed by the Village and all costs incurred in connection
with such removal shall be assessed against the property
where the antenna, structure or facility was located.
(b) Unused portions of support structures above a manufactured
connection shall be removed within six months of the time they
first become unused. The replacement of all or any portion of
an antenna, support structure or equipment facility previously
removed requires the issuance of a new special permit.
(8) Referral. Upon filing, the Building Inspector shall forward a copy of
the application to the Architectural Board of Review.
(9) Reports from the Architectural Board of Review. The Architectural
Board of Review shall file a written report with the Zoning Board of
Appeals containing its recommendations on the application within
30 days of referral. The Zoning Board of Appeals shall careful
review and consider such report and recommendation in making its
decision. If the Architectural Board of Review fails to render its
report within 30 days, the Zoning Board of Appeals may act without
the benefit of the report.
(10) Antennas, support structures and equipment facilities on Village
property. Notwithstanding anything in this chapter to the contrary,
antennas, support structures and equipment facilities located on
property owned by the Village of Larchmont shall not be subject to
the provisions of the Village's land use regulations, except the
building and fire code,60 it being the intention of the Village that
such antennas, support structures and equipment facilities will be
addressed by the Board of Trustees on a case-by-case basis;
provided, however, that nothing herein shall be construed in any
way to require the Village to permit the placement of any antenna,
support structure or equipment facility on Village property.
F. (Reserved)
G. Tennis courts and swimming pools in conjunction with townhouse
developments approved by special permit. Such special permits shall be
reviewed and approved by the Board of Trustees, subject to the
following:
(1) No more than one outdoor, noncommercial tennis court per 20
townhouse units in the development shall be permitted;
(2) No artificial lighting shall be permitted;

regardless of how small the fraction.
C. If a single building contains several uses, the total number of spaces
required shall be the sum of the spaces required for each of the uses.
D. No additional spaces beyond those required for principal uses are
required for accessory uses, unless specifically required by the
Planning Board or the Zoning Board of Appeals in connection with site
plan or special permit approval.
E. In the event that the parking requirements herein are such that they
effectively prevent a lot from being developed at the density otherwise
permissible under this Zoning Law, or in the event that such parking
requirements otherwise conflict with other sections of this Zoning Law,
these parking requirements shall supersede and be controlling.
F. Parking of commercial vehicles out of doors on private property is

to the institution of or increase in parking requirements for the zone in
which such lots are located, shall not be subject to such new or
increased parking requirements with respect to preexisting square
footage; provided, however, that such lots shall be required to continue
and maintain at least the number of parking spaces already existing at
the time the requirements are increased, up to the maximum required
under the new law.
B. Demolition and simultaneous rebuilding.
(1) If, after June 5, 1989, properties in commercial districts lawfully
demolish (including accidental demolition by fire, flood and the
like) existing square footage for which they were exempt from
providing parking under Subsection A above and lawfully and
simultaneously rebuild new square footage elsewhere on the same
lot, they shall not be required to provide additional parking for that
portion of such new square footage as is less than or equal to the
amount of square footage demolished; provided, however, that such
properties shall be required to continue and maintain at least the
number of parking spaces already existing at the time the
demolition occurs, up to the maximum required by law, as then
most recently amended.
(2) For the purposes of this subsection, the word "simultaneously"
shall mean commencement of construction of the new square
footage within nine months after the start of demolition of the old

[Added 11-21-2016 by L.L. No. 7-201662]
§ 381-68-A. Legislative intent.
In order to ensure that proposed development and use of land within
the area of the Village of Larchmont will have a harmonious relationship
with the existing or permitted use of contiguous land and of adjacent
neighborhoods and so to ensure that the health, safety, welfare, comfort and
convenience of the public is fully considered, this Article VIIIA is hereby
enacted pursuant to the provisions of § 7-725 of the Village Law of the State

As used in this Article VIIIA, the following terms shall have the meanings
indicated:
SITE PLAN — A plan which shows the proposed development and use of
the land within the Village of Larchmont. Such plan shall consist of a map
affirmatively demonstrating compliance with and adequate provision for all
of the criteria, matters and the items listed in § 381-68-G, Subsection B,
herein.
§ 381-68-C. Delegation of authority.
The authority for approval of each and every site plan and all amendments
thereto and modifications thereof is hereby delegated to the Planning
Commission of the Village of Larchmont.
§ 381-68-D. Applicable standards.
In acting on any site plan application, the Planning Commission, in addition
to all other applicable laws, shall take into consideration the following
standards:
A. Traffic access and roads. All proposed traffic access and roads are
adequate but not excessive in number, adequate in width, alignment
and visibility, and not located too near street corners or other places of
public assembly. Necessary traffic signalization and other safety
controls, devices and facilities have been properly given consideration
and duly provided wherever appropriate or warranted.
B. Circulation and parking. Adequate off-street parking and loading
spaces are provided to prevent the parking in public streets of vehicles
of any persons connected with or visiting the site, and the interior

required off-street parking lots.
C. Screening and landscaping. All playground, parking, loading, public
and other service areas are reasonably screened by a double row of
hemlocks or equivalent, five feet in height and four feet on center, at all
seasons, from the view of adjacent lots and streets, and the scale and
quality of the landscaping or fencing of the site enhances the character
of the neighborhood.
D. Natural and other significant features. All water bodies, wetlands, steep
slopes, hilltops, ridgelines, trees, outstanding natural topography,
significant geological features and other areas of scenic, ecological and
historic value are preserved insofar as possible, and flood hazard is
minimized.
E. Fire protection. All proposed structures, equipment or material shall be
readily accessible for fire protection.
F. Drainage. [Amended 6-30-1986 by L.L. No. 6-198664]

compliance with the form, scope and substance of all applicable
design criteria shall be provided to accommodate expected loads
from the tributary watershed when developed to the maximum
density permitted under the existing zoning standards. Drainage
shall be conducted to a point of adequate and suitable disposal.
(2) On sites of 10,000 square feet or more and in other instances
determined by the Planning Commission to be appropriate after
consultation with the Village Engineer, development shall be so
designed and executed as to limit overflow from the site to zero
increase in the rate of runoff and to create zero decrease in the rate
of upstream runoff into the site, as related to existing conditions,
except that the Planning Commission, after consultation with the
Village Engineer, may substitute a different requirement for a
particular site if it determines that the substituted requirement will
be more effective in controlling flooding and erosion at the site and
at other locations.
(3) On parcels of five acres or more, the Planning Commission may
require that development is so designed and executed as to reduce
the rate of runoff by a stipulated percentage not to exceed 20%, as
compared with existing conditions, through drainage systems,
water retention and/or the maintenance of open spaces, both those

spaces as may be required for this purpose, but without reducing
the rate of runoff into the site from upstream. Such a requirement
shall not be applied unless the Planning Commission determines
that it is an appropriate and important means of preventing an
increase in erosion and flooding at the site and/or at other
locations. In making such determination, the Planning Commission
shall consult with the Village Engineer and with the Westchester
County Soil and Water Conservation District, who shall respond
within the time limits set by this Article VIIIA. Failure to respond
within such time limits shall be deemed approval by such agencies.
A. No building permit shall be issued until site plan approval shall have
been obtained from the Planning Commission.
B. No certificate of occupancy for any structure or use upon or within the
site shall be issued until all of the required conditions of the site plan

below-grade infrastructure or materials to remain on the lot, the
applicant shall submit a certified statement from the applicant's
engineer that the foundation and such infrastructure and materials
and the methods proposed to cover them are structurally sufficient

character or limited nature of a development or change in use or to special
conditions peculiar to a site, the submission of a final site plan, or of
certain portions of the information normally required as part of the site
development plan, is inappropriate or unnecessary or that strict compliance
with said submission requirements will cause extraordinary and
unnecessary hardship, the Planning Commission may waive such
submission requirements wherever, in the opinion of the Commission, such

A. Defintions. For the purposes of this § 381-68-N:
LANDSCAPE PLAN — A plan prepared by and bearing the seal of a
landscape architect; provided, however, in an appropriate case, the
Planning Board may permit the Landscape Plan to be prepared by an
arborist or other qualified professional. If applicants wish to have the
landscape plan prepared by a party other than a registered landscape
architect, this topic should be discussed with the Planning Board at
the pre-submission conference. The landscape plan shall show the
proposed landscaping for the project. Without limiting the generality
of the foregoing, the landscape plan shall provide the specific details
regarding removal and planting of trees as is provided below. It shall
be within the authority of the Planning Board to approve, disapprove
or require modifications to the landscape plan. The purpose of this
§ 381-68-N is to provide for and encourage the preservation and
maintenance of trees for their benefits, which include, but are not
limited to, soil stabilization, drainage control, oxygen production,
shade, and aesthetic appeal.
MATURE TREE — Any deciduous tree with a trunk measurement of
eight inches or greater in diameter at fifty four inches above the ground
on the uphill side; or any evergreen tree with a height of 15 feet or more
above the ground on the uphill side.
B. Prohibition on site work.
§ 381-68-L LARCHMONT CODE § 381-68-N
375:648
(1) No site work in anticipation of site plan approval may be performed
until such site plan approval is obtained. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, no filling, excavating, removal of any
topsoil, gravel, dirt, sand, shrubs, trees or any other such material
for the purpose of erecting a building or structure or otherwise for
the purpose of construction may be carried out anywhere on the
subject property until site plan approval, if required for the
proposed construction, is first obtained for the proposed
construction.
(2) If the prohibition set forth in Subsection B(1) above is violated, no
site plan application will be processed until the violation is
remediated in accordance with a remediation plan approved by the
Planning Board. The Planning Board may require, among other
things, that such remediation plan provide for the replacement in
kind of any trees, shrubs, or other material which has been
removed in violation of this section. Additional penalties as
provided for in Subsection D below shall also apply.
C. Landscape plan; preservation of mature trees and other vegetation.
(1) Each application for site plan approval shall include a landscape
plan which must show, unless otherwise determined by the
Planning Board, i) all existing mature trees on the entire property
which is the subject of the site plan application, ii) which mature
trees are to be removed or destroyed, specifying their types and
sizes, and iii) the reasons they are being removed and/or destroyed.
The Planning Board shall have the authority to require new trees to
be planted and, with input from the Parks and Trees Committee, to
specify their location and type, and to require replacement of
existing trees in kind or with such trees of such type as the
Planning Board (with input from Parks and Trees) determines are
appropriate in the circumstances.
(2) The applicant shall design the development plan in such a manner
as to minimize the number of mature trees to be removed or
destroyed in order to accommodate the development. Where
feasible, the Planning Board may require proposed improvements
to be relocated or removed in order to preserve mature trees. It will
not be deemed feasible to require such relocation or removal where
doing so would substantially interfere with a permitted use.
(3) On sites in the Village's R, W and MF Zoning Districts which are
devoid of mature trees or sparsely populated with such trees, the
Planning Board may require the installation of supplemental trees.
A baseline design standard for such supplementation shall be that
the trees have a diameter of at least three inches and that there will
be an overall density of one tree for 3,000 square feet of land area
or fraction thereof.
§ 381-68-N WATERFRONT REVITALIZATION § 381-68-N
375:649
(4) In addition to the requirements for mature trees, the Planning
Board shall also have the authority to require the preservation or
enhancement of other vegetation on the site. The reasons for
requiring such preservation or enhancement may include, but shall
not be limited to, aesthetic value due to species or location or that
removal of existing vegetation would excessively alter drainage or
affect the stability of slopes.
(5) The construction management plan for the project shall include the
methods that will be employed to protect existing trees and other
vegetation on the site during construction. The Planning Board
shall have the authority to approve, disapprove or require the
modification of such construction management plan.
(6) Trees which have been designated for preservation, including
supplemental trees, shall be deemed to be required site
improvements, and their preservation and replacement, as
necessary, including the replacement of trees damaged during
construction, shall remain the responsibility of the applicant and
subsequent property owners. In addition to any other bonding
required by the Planning Board in connection with the site plan
approval, the Planning Board shall require a bond, letter of credit
or cash deposit, calculated to provide sufficient funds for the
replacement of trees to be preserved or supplemental trees which
may be damaged during construction. Such bonding shall be for a
period of at least one year after all improvements in connection
with the site plan have been completed. Prior to release of the bond
or other security, the trees shall be inspected to insure that they
have not been damaged and that future growth will be
characteristic of the species.
(7) The requirements herein for tree preservation shall not apply to
lots for existing houses in a new subdivision, provided that such
lots and houses will not be altered to accommodate development of
the subdivision. However, this provision shall not relieve the
subdivider and site plan applicant of the responsibility to include in
the tree preservation plan for the subdivision/site plan any mature
tree located within 50 feet of a new lot or required subdivision
improvement. When lots for existing houses have been excluded
from the tree preservation plan, the landscape architect shall set
forth on the plan which lots have been excluded and shall certify
that the plan does include all mature trees located within 50 feet of
a new lot or other subdivision improvement and that surrounding
development will not substantially alter the environment of the
trees on such lot.
D. Violations; penalties. It shall be a violation of law for any person or
entity to remove, damage or fail to preserve any tree or vegetation
which they were not permitted to remove or damage, or which they
were required to preserve, pursuant to the terms of this § 381-68-N of
the Code of the Village of Larchmont.
§ 381-68-N LARCHMONT CODE § 381-68-N
375:650
§ 381-68-O. Penalties for noncompliance. [Added 2-24-2003 by L.L.
No. 1-2003]
§ 381-69. (Reserved)
(1) In addition to any other penalties provided for violation of this site
plan law or failure to adhere to the details of an approved site plan,
any person violating any of the provisions of this § 381-68-N of the
Code of the Village of Larchmont shall be guilty of a violation (i.e.,
not a misdemeanor or felony) punishable by a fine of up to $500.
Each day a violation continues shall constitute a separate offense;
and
(2) No building, demolition or excavation permit may be issued, and if
previously issued shall be revoked, nor shall any certificate of
occupancy be issued until such violation is cured in accordance
with Subsection D(3) below; and
(3) Any person or entity who removes, damages, destroys or fails to
preserve any tree or other vegetation in accordance with this
§ 381-68-N shall replace, in kind, each and every tree and other
vegetation which has been removed, damaged or destroyed. If such
a tree was so large and mature that it cannot reasonably be
replaced, the Building Inspector, upon advice of the Village
Arborist, may require the planting of multiple trees. If multiple
trees cannot be planted on the site of the violation, other available
spaces on public property may be used to accommodate the
balance of the required planting.
A. Without limiting any other provisions of this Article VIIIA, the following
shall be violations of this Article VIIIA:
(1) Failure to comply with any provision of the Planning Commission's
resolution of site plan approval.
(2) Failure to install and maintain any improvements (including
plantings and signage) shown or described on the approved site
plan and related submissions.
B. Each such violation of this Article VIIIA shall be punishable by a fine of
up to $250. The continuation of an offense against the provisions of this
Article VIIIA shall constitute, for each day the offense is continued, a
separate and distinct offense hereunder.

be provided for on the subdivision plat.
B. Should any provision of these regulations conflict or be inconsistent
with any provision of the Village Law, such provision of the Village Law
shall govern. However, should any provision of these regulations
conflict with any regulation, ordinance or local law of the village, then
these regulations shall govern. In order that land may be subdivided in
accordance with this policy, these regulations are hereby adopted.

§ 381-69-D. Application requirements.
Whenever any subdivision of land, as hereinbefore defined, is proposed to

§§ 381-69-H through 381-69-R of this chapter, the intent being that the
Planning Board be afforded a review of any previously filed subdivisions that
have not been fully developed.
§ 381-69-E. Consideration of preliminary layout by Board.
[Amended 9-14-1987 by L.L. No. 4-1987]

§ 381-69-F. Meeting of Board and subdivider; notice of decision.
After arriving at tentative conclusions, the Planning Board will discuss
the preliminary layout with the subdivider or his/her agents at a regular
meeting or a special meeting duly convened of said Board. After such
discussion, the Planning Board will communicate in writing to the
subdivider:
A. All specific changes which it believes desirable in the preliminary
layout.
B. The character and extent of the required improvements for which
waivers may have been requested and which, in its opinion, may be

§ 381-69-G. Final layout approval.
waived without jeopardy to the public health, safety, morals and general
welfare.
A. The subdivider, following receipt of this communication with respect to
the preliminary layout and the changes, if any, to be made therein, shall,
within six months thereafter, make a submission to the Planning Board
satisfactory to the Village Engineer, which shall consist of five copies of
the final layout of the subdivision plat, accompanied by two separate
sets of prints showing the completed detailed construction drawings,
including but not limited to street profiles, construction details, etc., in
accordance with the provisions of §§ 381-69-H through 381-69-R of this
chapter. Before the Planning Board accepts submission of the final
layout, including the construction drawings, and prior to setting the
date for the public hearing, it shall obtain from the Village Engineer or
other duly designated official a certificate stating that the street or
streets and any improvements already constructed by the subdivider or
improvements to be constructed in accordance with the construction
drawings, as approved, are satisfactory to him/her. [Amended
11-21-2016 by L.L. No. 7-2016]
B. If the certification is with respect to improvements already made, said
official shall certify as to such parts of said improvements that are
satisfactory as of the date of his/her certificate. Before the Planning
Board accepts submission of the final layout of the subdivision plat, the
subdivider shall obtain the approval of any governmental agency having
jurisdiction in the premises. Upon receipt of all such certifications and
approvals in writing and in satisfactory form, the Planning Board shall
accept submission of such final layout and shall set a date, within 30
days of such submission, to hold a public hearing as required pursuant
to § 7-728 of the Village Law. The Planning Board will then, within 45
days from and after the date of the final submission above provided,
approve, modify or disapprove such final layout and the construction
drawings by endorsement thereon, and, upon approval, the subdivider
shall submit to the Planning Board the original tracings, in ink on cloth,
of the final plat and the detailed construction drawings. These tracings
shall then be turned over to the Village Engineer for safekeeping. If the
Planning Board requires any modifications of the subdivision plat or the
construction drawings at the public hearing, the subdivider shall be
required to make such changes to the final plat and construction
drawings as submitted and resubmit new prints with the tracings to the
Planning Board at the next meeting, with the approval of the Village
Engineer, and final action by the Planning Board will not be taken prior
to the further meeting at which these plans are submitted. [Amended
9-14-1987 by L.L. No. 4-1987]
C. If and when the Planning Board approves the final layout of the

the terms of said resolution, be required to tender offers for deeds of
cession, in form satisfactory to the Village Attorney, of all lands included
in the beds of streets and highways and for easements or parks as
required by the Planning Board, and a note or endorsement shall be
placed upon the plan or plat reading as follows: "Approval of this plat by
the Planning Board does not constitute an acceptance by the village of
the dedication of any street, highway, park or other public open space,

thereof, adequate off-street loading space, suitably surfaced, shall be
provided in connection with all lots designed for commercial use.
J. In front of areas designated and zoned for commercial use, or where the
proposed subdivision requires and the subdivider proposes to file a
petition for a change in zoning to permit such use, the street width shall
be increased by such amount on each side as may be deemed necessary
by the Planning Board and to assure the free flow of through traffic
without interference by parked or parking vehicles and to provide
adequate and safe parking space for such commercial or business
district.
K. In general, street lines within a block, deflecting from each other to any
extent whatever, shall be connected with a curve, the radius of which
for the inner street lines shall be not less than 370 feet on main

erect a building or structure on one or more lots, plots or sites in any
subdivision submitted for approval, or which have ever been the subject
of subdivision approval, the Planning Commission may require that
such person submit to the Board of Architectural Review for its
approval, pursuant to Local Law No. 2,69 plans of all types of buildings
proposed to be erected on all lots, plots or sites in such subdivision and
the location thereof. [Added 7-5-1967]

§ 381-70 WATERFRONT REVITALIZATION § 381-71
375:667
Subsection F above, if destroyed or damaged to the extent, as
determined by the Building Inspector, of over 50% of the volume of such
structure above the foundation, shall be restored in nonconforming
form or location on the lot or for the continuance of a nonconforming
use therein. However, such building, structure, generator, or outdoor
HVAC equipment, if accidentally destroyed or damaged due to fire,
explosion or other similar cause, to the extent, as determined by the
Building Inspector, of not more than 50% of its volume above the
foundation, may, if so permitted by the Zoning Board of Appeals, be
restored in substantially the same location, provided that it is not
enlarged. The Zoning Board of Appeals may also permit the
continuance without enlargement of such previously existing
nonconforming use subject to such additional limitations and
safeguards as it may deem necessary in the public interest for the
protection of nearby conforming uses.
H. (Reserved)
I. Application for a permit to rebuild or restore the damaged portion of
any building, structure, generator, or outdoor HVAC equipment
damaged or destroyed as set forth in Subsection G above shall be filed
within six months of the day of such damage and shall be accompanied
by plans for reconstruction which, as to such portions, shall comply
with the provisions of this chapter in all respects save as to the use of
the building or structure.
J. If a permit for such rebuilding or restoration is granted, it shall lapse
one year thereafter unless reconstruction in accordance therewith has
been satisfied; and
K. New buildings on lot less than the minimum area. A permit may be
issued for the erection of a building for a permitted use on a lot for
which a valid conveyance has been recorded prior to the adoption of
any zoning amendment making said lot nonconforming in area or
dimension, notwithstanding that the area or dimensions of such lot are
less than that required for the district in which such lot lies, provided:
(1) That all yard setbacks and other requirements which are in effect
at the time of the obtaining of the building permit are satisfied; and
(2) That said lot(s) was not in common ownership at the time of said
amendment with one or more contiguous lots which would make
the lots conform if combined. For the purpose of this chapter,
property in the name of a husband or wife shall be deemed in
common ownership with property in the name of such person's
spouse.

§ 381-72. Nonconforming construction. [Amended 11-21-2016 by
L.L. No. 17-2016; 12-19-2016 by L.L. No. 23-2016]
Nothing in this chapter shall be deemed to require any change in the plans,
construction or designated use of any building complying with laws then in
effect for which a permit was duly issued and on which actual construction
was lawfully begun prior to the effective date of this chapter and upon
which building actual construction has been diligently carried on. "Actual
construction" is hereby defined to be the actual placing of construction
materials in their permanent position, fastened in a permanent manner;
except that, where a basement or cellar is being excavated, such excavating
shall be deemed to be actual construction or where demolition or removal
of an existing structure has been substantially begun preparatory to
rebuilding, such demolition and removal shall be deemed to be actual
construction, provided that actual construction work shall be diligently
carried on to the extent of completing the ground-story framework,
including the second tier of beams, within six months and the whole
building within one year from the effective date of this chapter. Similarly,
whenever the provisions of this chapter are amended in the future so as
to effect a change in the permitted use of land or buildings, the provisions
hereof, with regard to building permits issued prior to the effective day
of this chapter, shall apply to building permits issued for construction in
such changed district prior to the effective date of the amendment effecting
such change. Except with respect to amendments concerning mechanical
rock excavation and blasting, amendments to this chapter adopted between
October 17, 2016, and December 31, 2016, shall not affect development(s)
for which final subdivision approval or site plan approval was granted
before October 17, 2016.
§ 381-73. Change or extension of nonconforming uses.
A. No nonconforming use shall hereafter be extended; provided, however,
that after notice and hearing, the Zoning Board of Appeals may permit a
nonconforming use to be extended throughout those parts of a building
which were manifestly arranged or designed for such use prior to the
time of enactment of this chapter, if no structural alterations, except
those required for health or safety, are made therein. No
nonconforming use shall be changed to another nonconforming use,
except that within six months after the cessation of a lawfully existing
nonconforming use, the Zoning Board of Appeals, after notice and
hearing, may grant a temporary conditional permit for a new
nonconforming use within the same structure, provided that it shall find
that:
(1) The proposed new nonconforming use will be more in keeping with
the character of the neighborhood than the former nonconforming
use;
(2) It will generate less traffic; and
§ 381-72 WATERFRONT REVITALIZATION § 381-73
375:669
§ 381-74. Existing clubhouses.
Subject to the provisions of § 381-51D, a building lawfully used on the
effective date of this chapter as a clubhouse may be reconstructed or
enlarged, subject to the following conditions and safeguards:
§ 381-75. (Reserved)
§ 381-76. (Reserved)
(3) It will tend to facilitate the later conversion of the structure to a
conforming use.
B. No such temporary permit shall be for more than five years, with not
more than two successive extensions thereof, and the Zoning Board of
Appeals, in granting such temporary permit or any renewal thereof,
shall impose such conditions as it deems necessary in the public
interest for the protection of nearby conforming uses.
A. If destroyed or damaged, to whatever extent from whatever cause, it
may be reconstructed to its prior dimensions in its prior location,
provided that in all other respects the structure to be erected shall
comply with this chapter and the Building Code.71
B. No enlargement of such clubhouse use, whether by addition of new
footage facilities or accessory buildings, shall be permitted, except
under special permit issued by the Zoning Board of Appeals under the
provisions of Article VI and in strict conformity with the general
requirements and standards set forth therein and the requirement of
§ 381-51D.

ARTICLE X
Zoning Board of Appeals
§ 381-77. Zoning Board of Appeals; variances, interpretations and
special permits.
The Zoning Board of Appeals, consisting of five persons, heretofore
established pursuant to the provisions of Article VII of the Village Law,
is hereby continued with all the powers and duties prescribed by law
and by this chapter, which powers and duties are summarized and more
particularly specified as follows, provided that none of the following
provisions shall be deemed to limit any power of the Zoning Board of
Appeals that is conferred by general law:
A. Interpretation. On appeal from an order, requirement, decision or
determination made by an administrative official or on request by an
official, board or agency of the Village, to decide any question involving
the interpretation of any provision of this chapter, including the
determination of the exact location of any district boundary if
uncertainty with respect thereto remains after exhausting the rules
specified in § 381-10.
B. Variances.
(1) Use variances. On appeal from an order, requirement, decision,
interpretation or determination by an administrative official, the
Zoning Board of Appeals shall have the power to grant use
variances, as defined herein.
(a) No use variance shall be granted by the Zoning Board of
Appeals unless it finds that the applicable zoning regulations
have caused the applicant unnecessary hardship. In order to
prove unnecessary hardship, the applicant must prove that, for
each and every permitted use under the zoning regulations for
the particular district where the property is located:
[1] The applicant cannot realize a reasonable return, provided
that lack of return is substantial as demonstrated by
competent financial evidence;
[2] The alleged hardship relating to the property in question is
unique and does not apply to a substantial portion of the
district or neighborhood;
[3] The requested use variance, if granted, will not alter the
essential character of the neighborhood; and
[4] The alleged hardship has not been self-created.
(b) In the granting of use variances, the Zoning Board of Appeals
shall grant the minimum variance that it shall deem necessary
and adequate to address the unnecessary hardship proved by
§ 381-77 WATERFRONT REVITALIZATION § 381-77
375:671
the applicant and at the same time preserve and protect the
character of the neighborhood and the health, safety and
welfare of the community.
(c) The granting of the variance shall be in harmony with the
general purpose and intent of this chapter and will not be
injurious to the neighborhood and otherwise detrimental to the
public welfare.
(2) Area variances. On appeal from an order, requirement, decision,
interpretation or determination by an administrative official, the
Zoning Board of Appeals shall have the power to grant area
variances, as defined herein.
(a) In determining whether to grant an area variance, the Zoning
Board of Appeals must weigh the variance's benefit to the
applicant against the variance's detriment to the health, safety
and welfare of the neighborhood or community. The Zoning
Board of Appeals must also consider the following factors:
[1] Whether an undesirable change will be produced in the
character of the neighborhood or a detriment to nearby
properties will be created by the granting of the area
variance;
[2] Whether the benefit sought by the applicant can be
achieved by some method feasible for the applicant to
pursue other than an area variance;
[3] Whether the requested area variance is substantial;
[4] Whether the proposed variance will have an adverse effect
or impact on the physical or environmental conditions in
the neighborhood or district; and
[5] Whether the alleged difficulty was self-created, which
consideration shall be relevant to the decision of the
Zoning Board of Appeals but shall not necessarily preclude
the granting of the area variance.
(b) In the granting of area variances, the Zoning Board of Appeals
shall grant the minimum variance that it shall deem necessary
and adequate and at the same time preserve and protect the
character of the neighborhood and the health, safety and
welfare of the community.
(3) In the granting of both use variances and area variances, the
Zoning Board of Appeals shall have the authority to impose such
reasonable conditions and restrictions as are directly related to and
incidental to the proposed use of the property. Such conditions
shall be consistent with the spirit and intent of this chapter and
§ 381-77 LARCHMONT CODE § 381-77
375:672
shall be imposed for the purpose of minimizing any adverse impact
such variance may have on the neighborhood or community.
C. Special permit. The Zoning Board of Appeals is hereby authorized to
grant or deny special permit applications as set forth in Article V of this
chapter.
D. Procedures for appeals, interpretations and variances.
(1) The Zoning Board of Appeals shall hold a public hearing on every
appeal and application made to it, notice of which hearing and of
the substance of the appeal or application shall be given by
publication in the official newspaper of the Village at least 10 days
before the date of such hearing and by such other notice as the
Zoning Board of Appeals by duly adopted rule shall require.
(2) At least 10 days before the date of any public hearing, notice of
such public hearing shall be transmitted to the Clerk of any
adjacent municipality, the boundary of which lies 500 feet or less
from the property that is the subject of the appeal or application.
Any agency of the adjacent municipality so notified may submit to
the Zoning Board of Appeals an advisory opinion on said appeal or
application at any time prior to the rendering of a decision.
(3) Notice.
(a) The Board shall not act upon any application for a variance
unless notice of the hearing on such application, similar in
content to that required to be published in the newspaper, shall
be mailed by regular mail, at least 10 days prior to the date of
such hearing, to the record owners of neighboring properties
as follows:
[1] In the case of use variances, to the record owners of
property within 500 feet of the subject property; or
[2] In the case of all other variances, to the record owners of
property within 250 feet of the subject property.
(b) For the purpose of this section, the term "record owner(s)"
shall mean the person(s) shown on the record of the tax office
of the Village of Larchmont on the date the notice is mailed as
being the owner(s) of the property.
(c) In the event there is substantial compliance with this section,
the failure of any property owner to receive the required notice
shall not invalidate any action taken by the Board in connection
with the application the required notice refers to.
(4) All provisions of this chapter relating to the Zoning Board of
Appeals shall be strictly construed. The Board, as a body of limited
jurisdiction, shall act in full conformity with all provisions of law
and of this chapter and in strict compliance with all limitations
§ 381-77 WATERFRONT REVITALIZATION § 381-77
375:673
§ 381-78. (Reserved)
§ 381-79. (Reserved)
contained therein; provided, however, that the procedural
requirements set forth in this chapter shall not operate to deprive
an applicant or appellant of the right of application or appeal
if such applicant or appellant has substantially observed such
procedural requirements.
(5) All appeals and applications made to the Zoning Board of Appeals
shall be in writing, on forms prescribed by the Board, and each
such appeal or application shall fully set forth the circumstances of
the case, refer to the specific provision of the law involved and shall
exactly set forth, as the case may be, the interpretation that is
claimed, the details of the variance that is applied for and the
grounds on which it is claimed that the same should be granted or
the use for which the special permit is sought. Every decision of the
Zoning Board of Appeals shall be recorded on standard forms
adopted by the Board and shall fully set forth the circumstances of
the case and the findings on which the decision is based. Every
decision of the Zoning Board of Appeals shall be by resolution, and
each such resolution shall be filed in the office of the Secretary of
the Board. The Zoning Board of Appeals shall notify the Planning
Board and the Building Inspector of its decision in each case. The
Zoning Board of Appeals shall report to the Board of Trustees
periodically, at least annually.

Upon submission of any application pursuant to this chapter, the applicant
shall provide to the Building Department a nonrefundable fee in the form
of a check or money order made payable to the Village of Larchmont in the
amount specified in the fee schedule set by the Board of Trustees from time
to time. No application shall be accepted for review unless such fee is paid
in full.
§ 381-98. Costs for consultant fees; escrow accounts. [Amended
11-21-2016 by L.L. No. 16-2016]
In addition to any other fees and expenses set forth in this chapter, in
the event that a reviewing official, board, or agency deems it necessary or
appropriate to hire consultants for engineering, planning, legal, technical,
environmental, or other such professional review of an application, the
applicant shall be required to bear the actual expense thereof, including,
without limitations, any on-site inspections deemed necessary. At or around
the time of submission of any application pursuant to this chapter, the
reviewing official, board, or agency shall require the applicant to fund an
escrow account(s) to be held by the Village in a reasonable amount to be
determined by said reviewing official, board, or agency from which such
consultant expenses will be paid as they accrue. The Village's Treasurer's
Office shall provide to the applicant copies of any vouchers submitted by
the consultants to the Village for payment as such vouchers are submitted.
When the balance in such escrow account(s) is reduced to one-third of
its initial amount, the applicant shall deposit additional funds into such
account(s) to bring the balance(s) up to the amount of the initial deposit.
If such account(s) are not replenished within 30 days after the Village
notifies the applicant in writing of the requirement for such additional
deposit, the reviewing official, board, or agency may suspend its review of
the application. Upon completion of review of the application and payment
of all consultant fees, any sums remaining in the escrow account shall be
refunded to the applicant. No building permit or certificate of occupancy
relating to such application shall be issued until the applicant has caused
all such expenses to be paid.

Section 2. Section 381-7, Definitions, is hereby amended by adding the following definition:
PUBLIC AMENITY SUPPLEMENTED MIXED-USE DEVELOPMENT
A building containing 3 or more dwelling units and ground floor nonresidential use, that is designed, occupied and utilized in a manner that
results in a substantial enhancement to the Village's business district and
provides public amenities, which may include, among others, public parking
and/or other infrastructure improvements. The requirement to provide public
amenities can be satisfied by an in kind contribution or fee in lieu to be set by
the Village Board during the Special Permit process, commensurate with the
zoning density benefits that are achieved.
Section 3. The Schedule of Dimensional Regulations, Attachment 2 to Chapter 381, is
hereby amended by adding a footnote 8 to the RC - Retail Center zoning district, as
follows:
(8) Subject to limitation by the Village Board, a Public Amenity Supplemented
Mixed-Use Development shall comply with the following requirements:
10,000 square foot minimum lot area; 40-foot minimum lot width; 0-foot front
yard, 0-foot side yards, 0-foot rear yard, 100% principal building coverage,
maximum number of stories: 4, principal building maximum height: 50 feet
from existing grade along the Chatsworth Avenue frontage of the subject
property; provided, however, the Village Board may allow a partial additional
story as provided in Section 381-51.N. Within these maximums, coverage,
height and story limitations will be set by the Village Board on a case-by-case
basis as part of the Special Permit process.
Section 4. Section 381-51 is hereby amended to add a new subsection “N” to read as
follows:
§ 381-51.N - Public Amenity Supplemented Mixed-Use Development. A mixed-use 
2
building(s) supplemented by public amenity improvements including in kind and fee in
lieu contributions, may be permitted by Special Permit to be granted by the Village
Board in its sole discretion, provided that, at a minimum, the following requirements
are met:
(1) A Public Amenity Supplemented Mixed-Use Development shall be
located within the RC - Retail Center zoning district.
(2) The proposed Public Amenity Supplemented Mixed-Use Development
shall be designed, occupied and utilized in a manner that results in a
substantial enhancement to the Village's business district, as determined
by the Village Board.
(3) The site shall be located to the east side of Palmer Avenue and west of
Vanderburgh Avenue, with frontage on Chatsworth Avenue.
(4) The site shall be a minimum of 10,000 square feet in area.
(5) A minimum of 50% of the first floor's gross floor area (exclusive of offstreet parking) shall be occupied by retail, restaurant, theater, food
establishment or group fitness class uses. A minimum of 70% of a
Chatsworth Avenue building's street level frontage shall be occupied by
the above stated non-residential uses. No first floor (street level)
residential dwelling units are permitted to front on the Chatsworth
Avenue street frontage, and if provided on the first floor of the building,
must be located so as to not face the Chatsworth Avenue street frontage.
The only residential component permitted to front on the Chatsworth
Avenue street level street frontage is a lobby entrance.
(6) To be eligible for the Special Permit, an applicant shall provide, in
addition to other public enhancements, (and in addition to the off-street
parking required for the building) a public amenity of municipal
parking. The requirement to provide an enhancement to municipal
parking and other public amenities can be satisfied by an in kind
contribution or fee in lieu to be set by the Village Board during the
Special Permit process, commensurate with the zoning density benefits
that are achieved.
(7) If there is municipal parking adjacent to the applicant’s property which
does not have adequate pedestrian access to Chatsworth Avenue, one
public amenity shall be an improved accessway of a width and design to
be determined by the Village Board and Planning Board in the Special
Permit/Site Plan process which shall include it being designed to meet, at
a minimum, ADA requirements, provided through the applicant’s
property to Chatsworth Avenue, to be dedicated for public use.
Appropriate easements or other property rights shall be granted and/or
exchanged to facilitate thisrequirement.
(8) The applicant may be required to provide to the Village other public
amenities, such as infrastructure improvements, as the Village Board
deems commensurate with the zoning density benefits that are achieved
by the applicant.
3
(9) If the Village Board determines that public amenities being provided sufficiently
exceed those the Village Board would otherwise deem adequate pursuant to
subsections (6), (7), and (8) above, the Village Board may, in its sole discretion,
permit an additional partial story to be constructed. Provided, however, such partial
story, if permitted, must be set back by at least 25% of the depth of the building
from the Chatsworth Avenue façade of the story below it, and can be no more than
60% of the square footage of the story below it and it shall be no more than 13 feet
in height. Among the considerations/determinations to be made by the Village Board
shall be that such partial story, if permitted, will not result in a significant adverse
visual impact.
(10) Off-street parking shall be provided in accordance with §381-64,
except that the requirement for multi-family dwellings shall be 1.25 per
unit.
(11) Awnings and canopies shall be of such height, width and design as may
be determined by the Village Board in its sole discretion.
(12) A Public Amenity Supplemented Mixed-Use Development shall, at a
minimum, comply with the following design guidelines. For good cause
shown, the Village Board may grant a waiver of these guidelines upon
consultation with the Planning Board.
(a) To maintain a unified streetscape, a minimum of 85% of the
building's street façade shall be located on or within three feet (3’)
of the front property line.
(b) Ground level non-residential spaces that face Chatsworth
Avenue shall have clear glass on at least 60% of their facades
between 3 and 8 feet above grade.
(c) A continuous sidewalk shall be maintained along the building's
Chatsworth Avenue frontage. No more than 5% of the sidewalk's
length shall be crossed by features such as driveways, alleys or
service bay openings.
(d) No overhead utility wires shall be permitted along the building's
principal street frontage.
(e) Street trees, lighting and other streetscape features shall be
provided along the street frontage consistent with the existing
streetscape.
(f) The development shall include secure enclosed bicycle storage
for residents and commercial tenant employees. Additionally, a
public bike rack, accommodating a minimum of 5 bikes, shall be
provided for visitors and customers, and located as required by
the Village Board.
(g) A Public Amenity Supported Mixed-Use Building shall make a
tangible effort to reduce its carbon footprint through employing 
4
green building measures such as those advocated by the US
Green Building Council or the Green Building Institute. The
building shall be built to LEED Certification standards and shall
include measures such as
• Utilizing energy star, water sense, green seal or other
similarly endorsed mechanical equipment and
appliances.
• Utilizing sustainable building materials with a high
percentage of recycled content.
• Utilizing construction materials with low levels of volatile
organic compounds.
• Utilizing energy efficient windows and doors.
• Utilizing insulation with high R-values.
• Utilizing a green or low reflectivity roof.
• Providing electric vehicle charging stations.
(h) The building shall be composed of high quality, durable
building materials that reflect the character of the Village, and
relate harmoniously to adjacent properties.
(i) Such other design features the Village Board may require.
(13) The granting of the special permit will not result in development which
will substantially over-burden Village infrastructure (e.g. storm sewer,
sanitary sewer, water supply systems) nor substantially exacerbate already
overburdened infrastructure.
(14) Architectural Review Approval for Building Permits for Public Amenity
Supplemented Mixed-Use Development structures shall be granted by the
Village Board as part of the Public Amenity Supplemented Mixed-Use
Development Special Permit review process. The Village Board may seek
advice regarding the architectural design from the Village Architectural
Review Board and/or a professional architectural consultant.
Section 5. Section 381-47 is hereby amended to read as follows:
§ 381-47. Special permits required and approval agency. No building or structure may
be erected, altered or used and no lot or land may be used for one of the special permit

Section 7. Severability. If any section, subsection, clause, phrase or other portion of this Local
Law is, for any reason, declared invalid, in whole or in part, by any court, agency, commission,
