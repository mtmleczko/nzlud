VILLAGE OF GRANVILLE ZONING LAW
Article 1 General Provisions 1
ARTICLE 1
GENERAL PROVISIONS
A. Short Title:
This Local Law shall be known and cited as the “Zoning Law of the Village of Granville,”
Washington County, New York.
B. Authority:
Pursuant to the authority and power granted under Village Law Section 7-700, the Village
Board of Trustees of the Village of Granville, County of Washington, New York hereby
adopts and enacts as follows:
C. Purpose:
The Zoning Law of the Village of Granville, which includes both the zoning text and the
zoning map, has been adopted in order to advance the goals, policies, and recommendations
of the Village of Granville Comprehensive Plan. The Comprehensive Plan serves as the
planning policy document for the Village, while the Zoning Law establishes land use
regulations to advance these policies. It is the intent of the Village Board that all planning
and zoning decisions are to be made in accordance with the Comprehensive Plan.
The Zoning Regulations and Districts herein set forth and as identified upon the Zoning
Map of the Village of Granville are made for the purpose of promoting public health, safety,
and general welfare and prescribing the most desirable use for which the land in each
district may be adapted and those uses to be subjected to special regulations, while
conserving value of land throughout the Village. The height, bulk, and location of buildings
and other structures, the area of yards, courts, and other open spaces, the density of
population, and location and use of buildings, structures and land for trade, industry,
residence or other purpose, are hereby restricted and regulated as hereinafter provided.
Such regulations have been designed to lessen congestion in the streets; to secure safety from
fire, flood, and other dangers; to provide adequate sunlight, air, convenience of access, and
to facilitate the adequate provision of transportation, water, sewage, schools, parks, open
space, and other public requirements.
The Zoning Law has also been crafted to encourage certain types of development in areas
where the land is well suited for such development, and/or where such development has
already occurred, and/or where infrastructure is available to support both the type and
intensity of the proposed use. In encouraging development in designated areas, it is the
intent that nearby properties and/or neighborhoods are not significantly impacted as a
result, either through environmental impacts, visual effects, or through a reduction in
property values.
In addition to the above general purposes, the Zoning Law of the Village of Granville, either
directly or indirectly, is designed to advance the following Goals of the Village of Granville

that its area or any of its dimensions or open spaces shall be smaller than required by this
Law.
5. No building or occupancy permit shall be issued unless the Code Enforcement Officer is
satisfied that the land or parcel in question has no natural characteristics which would
endanger the health, safety or welfare of the resident, or others. Such natural
characteristics may include fire, flooding, and excessive slope.

Permit Approval, and Requiring Site Plan Review Approval shall be permissible in their
respective districts. All other uses are expressly prohibited.

VILLAGE OF GRANVILLE ZONING LAW
Article 6 Non-Conforming Uses and Structures 51
ARTICLE 6
NON-CONFORMING USES AND STRUCTURES
A. Purpose:
The purpose of this article is to provide for the regulation of non-conforming
(grandfathered) buildings, structures, and uses, and to specify those circumstances and
conditions under which non-conforming buildings, structures, and uses are permitted to
continue.
B. Repeal of Previous Zoning Ordinance and Map:
The zoning ordinance known as the Zoning Ordinance of the Village of Granville, New
York, adopted March 20, 1928, and all amendments thereto, is hereby repealed, with the
provision that violations of such Zoning Ordinance of 1928, and all amendments thereto,
shall remain violations to the extent that the matters in violation do not conform to the
provisions of this Zoning Law.
C. Continuation of a Lawful Non-Conforming Use:
Any lawfully existing use of land or a building or structure or part thereof, established at the
time this article or any amendment hereto becomes effective, that no longer conforms with
the provisions of the zoning district in which it is located, shall be considered a legal nonconforming
use and may be continued, subject to all other provisions of this article, even
though such building, structure, or uses of land do not conform with the provisions of the
zoning district in which it is located. A lawfully existing use is considered legal when such
use was established in conformance with former codes or as amended by variances.
D. Maintenance of a Non-Conforming Use:
A non-conforming use must be maintained in such a condition that it will not constitute a
danger to the safety, health, or general welfare of the public. Failure to comply with this
requirement shall cause a lawful non-conforming building or use to be terminated when
maintenance has not been completed within six (6) months of notification of the owner by
the Code Enforcement Officer.
E. Changes:
Once changed to a conforming use, no building, structure, or land shall be permitted to
revert to a non-conforming use.
F. Restoration of a Non-Conforming Use After Damage:
Any non-conforming building or structure, or any building or structure containing a nonconforming
use, which is damaged or destroyed by fire, flood, wind, earthquake, act of
nature, or act of man, must be repaired or rebuilt within one (1) year of the damage or
destruction. However, in rebuilding or repairing the structure, the building’s footprint may
not be increased. Failure to repair or reconstruct the building or structure within one (1)
VILLAGE OF GRANVILLE ZONING LAW
Article 6 Non-Conforming Uses and Structures 52
year shall cause a lawful non-conforming use to terminate. The Village Board is empowered
to extend this period upon receipt of a written request from the owner at least thirty (30)
days in advance of the expiration of the yearlong period.
G. Prior Construction Approval:
Any non-conforming building or structure for which a building permit has been issued prior
to the effective date of this Law, may be completed and used in accordance with the plans
and approved specifications within (1) one year of the date of the permit, providing:
1. Substantial construction is underway under a valid building permit on the effective date
of this ordinance. “Substantial construction” shall be interpreted as the expenditure of a
sum on excavation, site preparation, and/or construction exceeding twenty-five percent
(25%) of the estimated cost of such structure as stated on the building permit. The mere
issuance of a building permit or planning/zoning approval shall not be sufficient to
establish a vested right, and consequently, entitle the owner to continue with the
establishment of a non-conforming use or building.
H. Abandonment or Discontinuance:
1. Whenever a non-conforming use or the use of a non-conforming building, structure, or
property has been discontinued for a period of eighteen (18) consecutive months, such
use is terminated, and any subsequent use of the building, structure, or property must
comply with the requirements of the zoning district in which it is located.
2. There may be occasions when the landowner and Code Enforcement Officer do not agree
on the date in which a non-conforming use was discontinued, damaged, or destroyed. In
these instances, the burden is on the landowner to demonstrate when said
discontinuance, damage, or destruction occurred. Proof should be in the form of a utility
bill, telephone bill, business receipt, police report, canceled rent payment check, or any
other written documentation that clearly identifies a date in which the non-conforming
use was still operating, or the date of discontinuance, damage, or destruction is in
dispute. The landowner must also provide a notarized affidavit swearing to the date or
dates in which the non-conforming building or use was still operating, or to the date
which the non-conforming building or use ceased operation.
I. Displacement:
No non-conforming use shall be extended to displace a conforming use.
J. Alterations:
Any non-conforming building, structure, or use of land shall not be altered or enlarged
except in accordance with the following provisions:
1. Such alterations shall be permitted only upon the same lot as in existence at the date the
use became non-conforming.
2. In buildings that are entirely non-conforming relative to use or dimensional
VILLAGE OF GRANVILLE ZONING LAW
Article 6 Non-Conforming Uses and Structures 53
requirements, repairs, and alterations may be made to the building, provided that such
repairs or alterations do not increase the building footprint of the building.
3. Any non-conforming use, building, or structure may be enlarged up to, but not more
than, twenty-five percent (25%) of its floor area, as it existed at the time of passage of this
Zoning Law. Such enlargement must conform to all other regulations of the district in
which it is located and may be used only for the existing non-conforming use. Such
enlargement, with the exception of single-family residential units, is subject to site plan
review.

b. Alternate Members:

provisions of this section relating to ZBA member training and continuing education,
VILLAGE OF GRANVILLE ZONING LAW
Article 9Administration and Enforcement 69
attendance, conflict of interest, compensation, eligibility, vacancy in office, removal,
and service on other boards, shall also apply to alternate members.
c. Removal of Members:
After a public hearing, any member of the ZBA may be removed for non-compliance
with minimum requirements relating to meeting attendance and training as
established by the Village Board of Trustees by Local Law.
2. Powers and Duties:
a. Unless otherwise provided by Local Law, the jurisdiction of the Zoning Board of
Appeals shall be appellate only and shall be limited to hearing and deciding appeals
from and reviewing any order, requirement, decision, interpretation, or
determination made by the Code Enforcement Officer pursuant to this article. Such
appeal may be taken by any person aggrieved, or by an officer, department, board or
bureau of the Village.
b. The Zoning Board of Appeals shall have the power to make, adopt, and promulgate
such written rules of procedure, bylaws and forms as it may deem necessary for the
proper execution of its duties and to secure the intent of this Law. Such rules, bylaws
and forms shall not be in conflict with, nor have the effect of waiving any provision
of, this Law or any other Law of the Village of Granville.
c. The ZBA is governed by, and shall act in strict accordance with, the procedures
specified by Village Law 7-712, this Law, and its own duly adopted rules, bylaws, and
forms. Upon proper request made in the form and manner prescribed by the ZBA
and accompanied by a fee in accord with a schedule adopted by the Village Board, the
ZBA shall perform the following functions:
1) Hear and decide any question properly brought before it involving the
interpretation of any provision of this Law.
2) Hear and decide appeals from any decision, determination, act, or failure to act of
the Code Enforcement Officer, and all matters properly referred to it by the
enforcement officer.
d. In exercising the above-mentioned powers, and duties, the Zoning Board of Appeals
may, in conformity with Village Law, reverse, affirm or modify the order,
requirement, decision or determination appealed from and shall make such order,
requirement, decision or determination as ought to be made in the case referred to it.
To that end, the ZBA shall have all the powers of the Code Enforcement Officer from
whom the appeal is made. The concurring vote of a majority of the ZBA shall be
necessary to reverse any order, requirement, decision, or determination of the Code
Enforcement Officer or to decide in favor of the applicant any matter upon which
such board is required to pass.
e. Interpretation:
The Zoning Board of Appeals shall upon proper request interpret any decision or
interpretation of the Code Enforcement Officer regarding the regulations and
VILLAGE OF GRANVILLE ZONING LAW
Article 9Administration and Enforcement 70
requirements of this Zoning Law. Following the denial of a Building Permit
application or Certificate of Occupancy in which an individual or corporation
disputes the Code Enforcement Officer’s reading or interpretation of any provisions
of this Law, the individual or corporation can appeal said decision or interpretation in
writing to the ZBA. The ZBA is required to hold a public hearing prior to acting on
any appeal involving an interpretation.
f. Use Variances:
1) The Zoning Board of Appeals for the use of land for a purpose which is otherwise
not allowed or is prohibited by the applicable zoning regulations.
2) A use variance is a mechanism that allows for the establishment of a land use that
is not permitted within a particular zoning district. For example, if an individual
would like to open a restaurant in a single-family residential zoning district that
prohibits restaurants, the use variance would provide a means of “relief” if
warranted.
3) While the establishment of a prohibited land use within a particular zoning
district could have a significant adverse impact on the neighborhood, there may
be instances where a property owner is subjected to “unnecessary hardship” as a
result of zoning restrictions placed on his/her property. Following denial of a
Building Permit by the Code Enforcement Officer, an individual or corporation
may appeal to the ZBA and seek administrative relief via a use variance.
4) In order to prove “unnecessary hardship,” the applicant shall demonstrate to the
ZBA that for each and every permitted use under the zoning regulations for the
particular district where the property is located:
a) The applicant cannot realize a reasonable return, provided that lack of return is
demonstrated by competent financial evidence.
b) That the alleged hardship relating to the property in question is unique, and
does not apply to a substantial portion of the district or neighborhood.
c) That the requested use variance, if granted, will not alter the essential character
of the neighborhood.
d) That the alleged hardship has not been self-created.
5) The ZBA in the granting of use variances shall grant the minimum variance that it
shall deem necessary and adequate to address the unnecessary hardship proved
by the applicant, and at the same time preserve and protect the character of the
neighborhood and the health, safety and welfare of the community.
g. Area Variances:
1) The Zoning Board of Appeals for the use of land in a manner which is not allowed
by the dimensional or physical requirements of the applicable zoning regulations.
2) An area variance is a mechanism that allows a landowner to build on their
property in a way that is otherwise prohibited by this Zoning Law. Typically, an
VILLAGE OF GRANVILLE ZONING LAW
Article 9Administration and Enforcement 71
area variance is sought by an individual or corporation wishing to waive one or
more dimensional standards such as minimum front, rear and side yard setbacks,
maximum site coverage, minimum lot width, minimum or maximum parking
spaces, etc.
3) Due to the peculiarities of a particular parcel, i.e. rock outcrops, odd-shaped
parcel, excessively steep slopes, etc.; there may be instances when it simply is not
possible or practical to build on a parcel without violating certain dimensional
zoning regulations. Following denial of a building permit by the Code
Enforcement Officer, an individual or corporation may appeal to the ZBA and
seek administrative relief via an area variance.
4) When considering an area variance, the ZBA is charged with the task of balancing
the benefit of the variance to the petitioner against its impacts on the area. The
ZBA will consider all five of the following factors and state the findings of each:
a) Whether an undesirable change will be produced in the character of the
neighborhood or a detriment to nearby properties will be created by the
granting of the area variance.
b) Whether the benefit sought by the applicant can be achieved by some method,
feasible for the applicant to pursue, other than an area variance.
c) Whether the requested area variance is substantial.
d) Whether the proposed variance will have an adverse effect or impact on the
physical or environmental conditions in the neighborhood or district.
e) Whether the alleged difficulty was self-created; which consideration shall be
relevant to the decision of the ZBA, but shall not necessarily preclude the
granting of the area variance.
5) The ZBA, in the granting of area variances, shall grant the minimum variance that
it shall deem necessary and adequate and at the same time preserve and protect
the character of the neighborhood and the health, safety and welfare of the
community.
h. Imposition of Conditions:
The ZBA shall, in the granting of both use variances and area variances, have the
authority to impose such reasonable conditions and restrictions as are directly related
to and incidental to the proposed use of the property. Such conditions shall be
consistent with the spirit and intent of this Zoning Law, and shall be imposed for the
purpose of minimizing any adverse impact such variance may have on the
neighborhood or community.
3. Procedure:
a. Meetings Minutes and Records:
1) All meetings of the ZBA shall be held at the call of the chairperson and at such
other times as such board may determine. Such chairperson, or in his or her

circulation in the Village of Granville at least ten (10) days prior to such hearing.
The cost of sending or publishing any notices relating to such appeal, or a
reasonable fee relating thereto, shall be borne by the appealing party and shall be
paid to the board prior to the hearing of such appeal. Upon the hearing, any party
may appear in person, or by agent or attorney.
2) At least five (5) days before such hearing, a written notice of the public hearing is
to be forwarded to the appropriate official any National or State Park Commission
having jurisdiction over any park or parkway within five hundred (500) feet of the
property affected by an appeal and to the County Planning Board as required by
General Municipal Law §239m.
d. Voting Requirements:
Every motion or resolution of the ZBA shall require for its adoption the affirmative
vote of a majority of all the members of the board as fully constituted regardless of
vacancies or absences. Where an action is the subject of a referral to the County
planning agency or regional planning council the voting provisions of §239-m of the
General Municipal Law shall apply.
e. Appeals Procedure:
Any person allegedly aggrieved by a decision, determination, act, or refusal to act, of
the Code Enforcement Officer may file an appeal with the ZBA. Such request shall
clearly State the decision, determination, act, or failure to act, of the Code

f. Stay Upon Appeal:
An appeal shall stay all proceedings in furtherance of the action appealed from,
unless the Code Enforcement Officer certifies to the ZBA, after the notice of appeal
shall have been filed with the Village Clerk, that by reason of facts stated in the
certificate a stay would, in his or her opinion, cause imminent peril to life or property,
in which case proceedings shall not be stayed otherwise than by a restraining order

the Village Clerk from whom the appeal is taken and on due cause shown.
g. Findings and Conclusions:
Within sixty-two (62) days after such public hearing, and after considering the
application, the ZBA shall either grant or deny the request or appeal and make a
written report on the findings and conclusions concerning the subject matter of such
hearing, including the reasons for the grant or denial of the relief sought. The time
within which the ZBA must render a decision may be extended by mutual consent of
the applicant and the board. Such decision shall be filed in the office of the Village
Clerk within five (5) days after the day such decision is rendered, and a copy thereof
mailed to the applicant.

premature subdivisions in light of orderly community development.

Planning Board. When so approving a preliminary plat, the Planning Board shall
state in writing modifications, if any, as it deems necessary for the submission of
the plat in final form. Within five days of the approval of such preliminary plat it
shall be certified by the Clerk of the Planning Board as granted preliminary
approval and a copy filed in his/her office, a certified copy mailed to the owner,
and a copy forwarded to the Village Board. Failure of the Planning Board to act
within such period shall constitute approval of the preliminary plat.
2) When granting approval to a preliminary plat, the Planning Board shall state the
terms of such approval, if any, with respect to: (1) the modifications to the
preliminary plat, (2) the character and extent of the required improvements for
which waivers may have been requested and which in its opinion may be waived
without jeopardy to the public health, safety, morals, and general welfare, (3) the
amount of improvement or the amount of all bonds therefore which it will require
as prerequisite to the approval of the subdivision plat. Approval of a preliminary
plat shall not constitute approval of the subdivision plat, but rather it shall be
deemed an expression of approval of the design submitted on the preliminary plat
as a guide of the Planning Board and for recording upon fulfillment of the
requirements of these regulations. Prior to approval of the subdivision plat, the
Planning Board may require additional changes as a result of further study of the
subdivision in final form or as a result of new information obtained at the public
hearing.

preliminary plat.

accordance with Village Law 7-728, a hearing shall be held by the Planning Board.
This hearing shall be advertised at least once in a newspaper of general circulation in
the Village at least ten to fifteen days before such hearing; provided, however, that
when the Planning Board deems the final plat to be in substantial agreement with a
preliminary plat approved under Article 11-B of this article, and modified in
accordance with requirements of such approval if such preliminary plat has been
approved with modification, the Planning Board may waive the requirement for such
public hearing.
f. Action on Proposed Subdivision Plat.

approve with or without modification, disapprove, or grant final approval and
authorize the signing of such plat following its receipt by the Clerk of the Planning
Board after the date of such hearing, in accordance with Village Law 7-728. This
time may be extended by mutual consent of the subdivider and the Planning
Board. Failure to take action on a final plat within the time prescribed therefore
shall be deemed approval of the plat.

shall empower a duly authorized officer to sign the plat upon completion of such
requirements as may be stated in the resolution. Within five days of such
resolution the plat shall be certified by the Clerk of the Planning Board as
conditionally approved and a copy filed in his office and a certified copy mailed to
the subdivider. The copy mailed to the subdivider shall include a certified
statement of such requirements which, when completed, will authorize the
signing of the conditionally approved final plat. Upon completion of such
requirements the plat shall be signed by said duly authorized officer of the
Planning Board. Conditional approval of a final plat shall expire 180 days after the
date of the resolution granting such approval unless the requirements have been

6. Required Improvements:
a. Improvements and Performance Bond. Before the Planning Board grants final
approval of the subdivision plat, the subdivider shall follow the procedure set forth in
either Subsection A(1) or A(2) below:
1) In an amount set by the Planning Board, the subdivider shall either file with the
Village Clerk a certified check to cover the full cost of the required improvements
or the subdivider shall file with the Village Clerk a performance bond to cover the
full cost of the required improvements. Any such bond shall comply with the
requirements of 7-728 of the Village Law and shall be satisfactory to the Village
Board and Village Engineer as to form, sufficiency, manner of execution, and
surety. A period of one year (or such other period as the Planning Board shall
determine appropriate, not to exceed three years) shall be set forth in the bond
within which required improvements must be completed.
2) The subdivider shall complete all required improvements to the satisfaction of the
Village Engineer, who shall file with the Planning Board a letter signifying the
satisfactory completion of all improvements required by the Planning Board. For
any required improvements not so completed the subdivider shall file with the
Village Clerk a bond or certified check covering the costs of such improvements
not approved by the Village Engineer. Any such bond shall be satisfactory to the
Village Board and Village Engineer as to form, sufficiency, manner of execution,
and surety.
b. Modification of Design of Improvements. If at any time before or during the
construction of the required improvements, it is demonstrated to the satisfaction of
the Village Engineer that unforeseen conditions make it necessary or preferable to
modify the location or design of such required improvements, the Village Engineer
may, upon approval by a previously delegated member of the Planning Board,
authorize modification, provided these modifications are within the spirit and intent
of the Planning Board's approval and do not extend to the waiver or substantial
alteration of the function of any improvements required by the Planning Board. The
Village Engineer shall issue any authorization under this section in writing and shall
transmit a copy of such authorization to the Planning Board at its next regular
meeting.
c. Inspection of Improvements. At least five days prior to commencing construction of
required improvements, the subdivider shall pay to the Village Clerk the inspection
fee, required by the Village Board, and shall notify the Village Board in writing of the
time when he proposes to commence construction of such improvements so the
Village Board may cause inspection to be made to assure that all Village specifications
and requirements shall be met during the construction of required improvements,
and to assure the satisfactory completion of improvements and utilities required by
the Planning Board.
d. Proper Installation of Improvements. If the Village Engineer shall find, upon
inspection of the improvements performed before the expiration date of the
VILLAGE OF GRANVILLE ZONING LAW
Article 11 Subdivision Regulations 92
performance bond, that any of the required improvements have not been constructed
in accordance with plans and specifications filed by the subdivider, he shall so report
to the Village Board, Building Inspector, and Planning Board. The Village Board then
shall notify the subdivider and, if necessary, the bonding company, and take all
necessary steps to preserve the Village's rights under the bond. No plat shall be
approved by the Planning Board as long as the subdivider is in default on a
previously approved plat.

a. Final Approval and Filing. Upon completion of the requirements in Article 11-B
above and notation to that effect upon the subdivision plat, it shall be deemed to have
final approval and shall be properly signed by the duly designated officer of the
Planning Board and may be filed by the applicant in the office of the County Clerk.
Any subdivision plat not so filed or recorded in accordance with Village Law 7-728
following the date upon which such plat is approved or considered approved by
reason of the failure of the Planning Board to act shall become null and void.
b. Plat Void if Revised After Approval. No changes, erasures, modifications, or revisions
shall be made in any subdivision plat after approval has been given by the Planning
Board and endorsed in writing on the plat, unless said plat is first resubmitted to the
Planning Board and such Planning Board approves any modifications. In the event
that any such subdivision plat is recorded without complying with this requirement,
the same shall be considered null and void, and the Planning Board shall institute
proceedings to have the plat stricken from the records of the County Clerk.
8. Public Streets and Recreation Areas:
a. Public Acceptance of Streets. The approval by the Planning Board of a subdivision
plat shall not be deemed to constitute or be evidence of any acceptance by the Village
of any street, easement, or other open space shown on such subdivision plat.
b. Ownership and Maintenance of Recreation Areas. When a park, playground, or other
recreation area shall have been shown on a plat, the approval of said plat shall not
constitute an acceptance by the Village of such area. The Planning Board shall require
the plat to be endorsed with appropriate notes to this effect. The Planning Board may
also require the filing of a written agreement between the applicant and the Village
Board covering future deed and title, dedication, and provision for the cost of
grading, development, equipment, and maintenance of any such recreation area.
C. General Requirements and Design Standards:

requirements and shall be waived by the Planning Board only under circumstances set
forth herein.
VILLAGE OF GRANVILLE ZONING LAW
Article 11 Subdivision Regulations 93
2. General:
a. Character of land. Land to be subdivided shall be of such character that it can be used
safely for building purposes without danger to health or peril from fire, flood, or
other menace.
b. Conformity to Official Map and Comprehensive Plan. Subdivisions shall conform to
the Official Map of the Village and shall be in harmony with the Comprehensive Plan.
c. Specifications for Required Improvements. All required improvements shall be
constructed or installed to conform to the Village specifications, which may be
obtained from the Village Engineer.
3. Street Layout:
a. Width, Location, and Construction. Streets shall be of sufficient width, suitably
located, and adequately constructed to conform with the Comprehensive Plan, and to
accommodate the prospective traffic and afford access for fire-fighting, snow
removal, and other road maintenance equipment. The arrangement of streets shall be
such as to cause no undue hardship to adjoining properties and shall be coordinated
so as to compose a convenient system.
b. Arrangement. The arrangement of streets in the subdivision shall provide for the
continuation of principal streets of adjoining subdivisions, and for proper projection
of principal streets into adjoining properties which are not yet subdivided, in order to
make possible necessary fire protection, movement of traffic, and the construction or
extension, presently or when later required, of needed utilities and public services
such as sewers, water, and drainage facilities. Where, in the opinion of the Planning
Board, topographic or other conditions make such continuance undesirable or
impracticable, the above conditions may be modified.
c. Minor Streets. Minor streets shall be so laid out that their use by through traffic will
be discouraged.
d. Special Treatment Along Major Arterial Streets. When a subdivision abuts or contains
an existing or proposed major arterial street, the Planning Board may require
marginal access streets, reverse frontage with screen planting contained in a nonaccess
reservation along the rear property line, deep lots with service alleys, or such
other treatment as may be necessary for adequate protection of residential properties
and to afford separation of through and local traffic.
e. Provision for Future Resubdivision. Where a tract is subdivided into lots substantially
larger than the minimum size required in the zoning district in which a subdivision is
located, the Planning Board may require that streets and lots be laid out so as to
permit future resubdivision in accordance with the requirements contained in these
regulations.
f. Dead-end Streets. The creation of dead-end or loop residential streets will be
encouraged wherever the Planning Board finds that such type of development will
not interfere with normal traffic circulation in the area. In the case of dead-end streets,
VILLAGE OF GRANVILLE ZONING LAW
Article 11 Subdivision Regulations 94
where needed or desirable, the Planning Board may require the reservation of a
twenty-foot-wide easement to provide for the continuation of pedestrian traffic and
utilities to the next street. Subdivisions containing 20 lots or more shall have at least
two street connections with existing public streets, or streets shown on the Official
Map, or streets on an approved subdivision plat for which a bond has been filed.
g. Block Size. Blocks generally shall not be less than 400 feet nor more than 1,200 feet in
length. In general, no block width shall be less than twice the normal lot depth. In
blocks exceeding 800 feet in length, the Planning Board may require the reservation of
a twenty-foot-wide easement through the block to provide for the crossing of
underground utilities and pedestrian traffic where needed or desirable and may
further specify, at its discretion, that a four-foot sidewalk be included.
h. Intersections with Collector or Major Arterial Roads. Minor or secondary street
openings into such roads shall, in general, be at least 500 feet apart.
i. Street Jogs. Street jogs with center-line offsets of less than 125 feet shall be avoided.
j. Angle of Intersection. In general, all streets shall join each other so that for a distance
of at least 100 feet the street is approximately at right angles to the street it joins.
k. Relation to Topography. The street plan of a proposed subdivision shall bear a logical
relationship to the topography of the property, and all streets shall be arranged so as
to obtain as many of the building sites as possible at or above the grade of the streets.
Grades of streets shall conform as closely as possible at the original topography.
l. Other Required Streets. Where a subdivision borders on or contains a railroad rightof-
way or limited access highway right-of-way, the Planning Board may require a
street approximately parallel to and on each side of such right-of-way, at a distance
suitable for the appropriate use of the intervening land (as for park purposes in
residential districts, or for commercial or industrial purposes in appropriate districts).
Such distances shall also be determined with due regard for the requirements of
approach grades and future grade separations.
4. Street Design:
a. Streets shall be in conformance with the Village Standard for Street Design as
approved by the Village Board and amended at the time of the application.
b. Improvements.
1) Streets shall be graded and improved with pavements, curbs and gutters,
sidewalks, storm drainage facilities, water mains, sewers, street trees, and fire
hydrants in such a manner as to meet the minimum requirements of the Village
Board and the standards established as part of the Comprehensive Plan of the
Village.
2) Waivers may be requested and the Planning Board may waive sections or reduce
the standards established as part of the Comprehensive Plan, subject to
appropriate conditions, where such improvements, in the judgment of the
Planning Board, may be omitted or altered without jeopardy to the public health,

lighting system of the Village. Such lighting standards and fixtures shall be
installed after approval by the appropriate power company and the authorized
Village electrical inspector.
c. Utilities in Streets. The Planning Board shall, wherever possible, require that
underground utilities be placed in the street right-of-way between the paved roadway
and the street line to simplify location and repair of lines when they require attention.
The subdivider shall install underground service connections to the property line of
each lot within the subdivision for such required utilities before the street is paved.
Utilities shall be installed in conformance with Public Service Law, Electric Utilities,
Part 100, Section 100.1, in new construction of underground facilities in residential
subdivisions, as amended at the time of the application.
d. Utility Easements. Where topography is such as to make impractical the inclusion of
utilities within the street rights-of-way, perpetual unobstructed easements at least 20
feet in width shall be otherwise provided with satisfactory access to the street.
Wherever possible, easements shall be continuous from block to block and shall
present as few irregularities as possible. Such easements shall be cleared and graded
where required.
e. Dead-end Streets (cul-de-sacs). Dead-end streets should conform with the Village
Standards for Street Design. At the end of temporary dead-end streets a temporary
turnaround with a pavement radius of 75 feet shall be provided, with specifications

provision shall be made for access to all lots by means of culverts or other
structures of design approved by the Village Engineer.
2) Where a subdivision is traversed by a watercourse, drainage-way, channel, or
stream, there shall be provided a stormwater easement or drainage right-of-way
as required by the Village Engineer, and in no case less than 20 feet in width.
g. Curve Radii. In general, street lines within a block, deflecting from each other at any
one point by more than 10°, shall be connected with a curve, the radius of which for
the center line of street shall not be less than 400 feet on major commercial streets, 200
feet on collector thoroughfare streets and 100 feet on minor rural streets.

space, suitably surfaced, shall be provided in connection with lots designed for
commercial use.
i. Free Flow of Vehicular Traffic Abutting Commercial Developments. In front of areas
zoned and designed for commercial use, or where a change of zoning to a zone which
permits commercial use is contemplated, the street width shall be increased by such
amount on each side as may be deemed necessary by the Planning Board to assure the
free flow of through traffic without interference by parked or parking vehicles, and to
provide adequate and safe parking space for such commercial or business district.
5. Street Names and Numbers:
a. Type of Name. All streets shown on a preliminary plat shall be approved by the
Planning Board. In general, streets shall have names and not numbers or letters.
b. Names to be Substantially Different. Proposed street names shall be substantially
different so as not to be confused in sound or spelling with present names, except
streets that join or are in alignment with streets of an abutting or neighboring
property shall bear the same name. Generally, no street should change direction by
more than 90° without a change in street name.
c. Street Names and Numbering. Naming and numbering of streets shall be done in
coordination with county requirements as amended at the time of the application.
6. Lots:
a. Buildable Lots.
1) The lot arrangement shall be such that in constructing a building in compliance
with state and local laws; there will be no foreseeable difficulties for reasons of
topography or other natural conditions. Lots should not be of such depth as to
encourage the later creation of a second building lot at the front or rear.
2) A lot intended for use for single-family residential purposes must contain a
buildable area of a minimum of 7,500 square feet (refer to the Bulk and Area
Schedule on page 33). The buildable area shall exclude areas of excessive slope
and on which state or federal environmental regulations shall preclude
development. For non-residential lots, the minimum buildable area would be
determined by the Planning Board after consideration of all relevant facts.
b. Side Lines. All side lines of lots shall be at right angles to straight street lines and
radial to curved street lines, unless a variation from this rule will give a better street
or lot plan.
c. Corner Lots. In general, corner lots should be larger than interior lots to provide for
proper building setback from each street and provide a desirable building site.
VILLAGE OF GRANVILLE ZONING LAW
Article 11 Subdivision Regulations 97

Village driveway ordinance. Driveway grades between the street and the setback line
shall not exceed 10%.
e. Access.
1) The subdividing of land shall be such as to provide, by means of a public street,
each lot with satisfactory deeded access in fee to an existing public street. When

referral shall be made immediately following approval of the preliminary plat
application. All streets proposed for dedication to the Village Board shall be marked
or designated by a licensed surveyor or engineer.
7. Drainage Improvements:
a. Removal of Spring and Surface Water. Upon recommendation by the Village
Engineer, the subdivider may be required by the Planning Board to carry away by
pipe or open ditch any spring or surface water that may exist either previous to, or as
a result of, the subdivision. Such drainage facilities shall be located in the street rightof-
way where feasible, or in perpetual unobstructed easements of appropriate width.
b. Drainage Structure to Accommodate Potential Development Upstream. A culvert or
other drainage facility shall, in each case, be large enough to accommodate potential
runoff from its entire upstream drainage area, whether inside or outside the
subdivision. The Village Engineer shall approve the design and size of facility based
on anticipated runoff from a "ten-year" storm under conditions of total potential
future development in the watershed.
c. Responsibility from Drainage Downstream. The subdivider's engineer shall also
study the effect of each subdivision on the existing downstream drainage facilities
outside the area of the subdivision; this study shall be reviewed by the Village
Engineer. Where it is anticipated that the additional runoff incident to the
development of the subdivision will overload an existing downstream drainage
facility during a five-year storm, the Planning Board shall notify the Village Board of
such potential condition. In such case, the Planning Board shall not approve the
subdivision until provision has been made for the improvement of said condition.
VILLAGE OF GRANVILLE ZONING LAW
Article 11 Subdivision Regulations 98

and of areas immediately adjacent.
d. Waiver of Plat Designation of Area for Parks and Playgrounds.
1) In cases where the Planning Board finds that, due to the size, topography or
location of the subdivision, land for park, playground, or other recreation purpose
cannot be properly located therein, or if in the opinion of the Board it is not
desirable, the Board may waive the requirement that the plat show land for such
purposes. The Board shall then require as a condition to approval of the plat a
payment to the Village of $100 per gross acre, or more if the going rate is greater,
of land which otherwise would have been acceptable as a recreation site. The
amount of land which otherwise would have been acceptable as a recreation site
shall be determined in accordance with the standards set forth in Article 11-C.

need for such improvements.
e. Reserve Strips Prohibited. Reserve strips of land, which might be used to control
access from the proposed subdivision to any neighboring property, or to any land
within the subdivision itself, shall be prohibited.
f. Reservation of Natural Features. The Planning Board shall, wherever possible,
establish the preservation of all natural features which add value to residential
