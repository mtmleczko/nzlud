the next succeeding day that is not a Sunday or a legal holiday.

three or more Municipal officers or other persons shall be construed as giving
such authority to a majority of such officers or other persons, unless it shall

provision had not been repealed or amended.

by a re-enactment or amendment of a provision of the Codified Ordinances, the
penalty, forfeiture, or punishment, if not already imposed, shall be imposed
according to the provision as amended.

(ORC 1.55)
101.06   CONFLICTING PROVISIONS.
   If the provisions of different codes, chapters, or sections of the Codified
Ordinances conflict with or contravene each other, the provisions bearing the
latest passage date shall prevail.  If the conflicting provisions bear the same
passage date, the conflict shall be construed so as to be consistent with the
meaning or legal effect of the questions of the subject matter taken as a
whole.
101.07   SEPARABILITY.
   If any provision of a section of the Codified Ordinances or the application
thereof to any person or circumstances is held invalid, the invalidity does not
affect other provisions or applications of the section or related sections
which can be given effect without the invalid provision or application, and to
this end the provisions are separable. 
(ORC 1.50)
101.99   GENERAL PENALTY.
   Whenever, in the Codified Ordinances or in any ordinance of the
Municipality, any act is prohibited or is made or declared to be unlawful or an

   EDITOR'S NOTE:  The State of Ohio operates on Eastern Daylight Savings Time
from 2:00 a.m. of the last Sunday April until 2:00 a.m. of the last Sunday in
October.  Congress on March 22, 1966, passed the Uniform Time Act requiring
uniform observance throughout the nation of Daylight Savings Time starting in
1967, except that a state legislature could exempt the entire state from
Daylight Savings Time or divide a state into not more than two parts, each with
a different time standard.  The Ohio legislature through inaction has elected
to observe Eastern Daylight Savings Time throughout the State of Ohio.
   On August 8, 2005, the Energy Policy Act of 2005 was enacted. This Act
changed the time change dates for Daylight Saving Time in the United States.
Beginning in 2007, the State of Ohio begins Daylight Saving Time at 2:00 a.m.
on the second Sunday in March and reverts to standard time at 2:00 a.m. on the
first Sunday in November. The Secretary of Energy will report the impact of
this change to Congress. Congress retains the right to resume the 2005 Daylight
Saving Time schedule once the Department of Energy study is complete.
103.02   OFFICIAL BONDS.
   (a)   All full-time and part-time employees of the City shall be covered by
a blanket position performance bond in the amount of twenty-five hundred

hereinafter set forth:

new classification title is recommended.
   (c)   Change in Plan.  The classification plan may be amended from time to
time.  Such changes may result from the need for creating new positions,
changes in organization or in assigned duties and responsibilities.
      (1)   The City Manager shall review all requests for the creation of new
positions, the abolition or consolidation of present positions, the
reclassification of positions to different job classes, and the re-allocation
of classifications to new salary ranges.  In the accomplishment of these
things, he shall study the current duties and responsibilities of positions and
take the appropriate action or make the necessary recommendation to Council in
order to insure the correct classification and allocation of the position.
      (2)   Each department head shall report to the City Manager any change in
his organization or in the assignment of duties and responsibilities of a
position which will appreciably affect the scope of the position with respect
to the relative status in the classification plan.  In instances when the scope
of the position is greatly altered, a reclassification shall be recommended.
(Ord. A-604.  Passed 7-20-64; Ord. A-2464.  Passed 12-12-05.)
   (d)   Abolition of a Position.  A position may be abolished upon
recommendation of the City Manager and action by Council for reasons of economy
or for reasons of a re-organization within a department.  In such an event,
every effort shall be made by the City Manager to re-assign any affected
regular employee to another position in the City service for which the employee
may be qualified.

131.06   PAY PLAN AND ADMINISTRATION.
   (a)   The official pay plan for the City service consists of schedules
showing established annual pay ranges and the classes which are to be
compensated within each pay range. Council may amend these schedules as
necessary. The ordinary procedure for securing needed amendments to the
official pay plan involved a survey by the City Manager and a subsequent
recommendation and report to Council.
   (b)   After each classification has been assigned to a pay range and the pay
plan and rules for its administration have been adopted by Council, each
employee shall be advised of his rate of pay and the salary range to which his
position title has been assigned. No person occupying a position covered by and
defined in the classification plan shall be paid at a rate lower than the
minimum or higher than the maximum of the pay range established for the class
to which his position is allocated. When an employee attains the maximum rate
of the pay range for this position, he should not expect further salary
increases unless:
      (1)   His position is reclassified;
      (2)   He is promoted to another position having a higher pay range; or
      (3)   A general salary increase is granted to all employees.
   The classification and pay plans for municipal employees, both in classified
and unclassified services, shall be in accordance with schedules established
from time to time by Council. (Ord. A-671. Passed 5-16-66.)
   (c)   The process for position classification for new positions shall be as
follows:
      (1)   The request for evaluation of a new position shall originate with
the department head.
      (2)   The department head will be provided a questionnaire for completion
and submittal for evaluation.
      (3)   The department head shall provide the completed questionnaire along
with a job description for the new position to the Human Resources Manager, who
shall determine the completeness of the document. If more information is
required, the questionnaire will be returned to the department head.
      (4)   The Human Resources Manager shall review the questionnaire and will
confer with the department head and personnel as appropriate. Field visits may
be necessary, as well.
      (5)   The recommendation of the Human Resources Manager will be presented
to the department head. Comments from the department head will be forwarded to
the Human Resources Manager for consideration. Once the Human Resources Manager
is satisfied with his findings, the recommendation will be forwarded to the
City Manager.
      (6)   The City Manager shall review the questionnaire and job description
and make a decision on the establishment of a new position.
      (7)   The City Manager may make a recommendation to Council, if
applicable. The decision of Council shall be final.

131.07   LONGEVITY PAY PLAN.
   (a)   In General.
      (1)   All full-time and part-time regular and probationary employees on
the City payroll prior to May 1, 1994, shall be provided with a longevity plan.
Annual longevity payments shall be made during the first half of the month of
December of each year in accordance with the schedule detailed below. Employees
must have served at least five years of continuous service and be on the City
payroll as of December 1 of the year in which longevity payments are to be
made. Longevity payments shall be based on the basic salary of the employee as
of June 30 of the year in which the longevity payment is made, and the rate of
payment shall be as follows:
         A.   Two percent of basic annual salary after five years of service.
         B.   Two and one-half percent of basic annual salary after ten years
of service.
         C.   Three percent of basic annual salary after fifteen years of
service.
         D.   Four percent of basic annual salary after twenty years of
service.
         E.   Five percent of basic annual salary after twenty-five years of
service.
      (2)   All full-time and part-time regular and probationary employees
hired by the City after May 1, 1994, will not be eligible for the longevity
bonus provided in paragraph (a)(1) hereof.
(Ord. A-1949. Passed 3-28-94; Ord. A-2324, passed 11-25-02; Ord. A-2464. Passed
12-12-05.)
   (b)   Pro Rata Payments to Retired Employees. Employees who retire under
normal or disability retirement programs of the City during any year in which
longevity payments shall be made under this plan and who, because of such
retirement, shall not be in the employment of the City as of November 30 of
that particular year shall, nevertheless, receive a pro rata longevity payment
for that year based on the number of full months of employment from the last
December 1 to the date of the employee’s retirement. Such longevity payments
shall be computed on the basis of the employee’s basic salary at the time of
retirement or as of June 30 of the year in which the longevity payment is made,
whichever is less. Such payment shall be made at the same time as other
longevity payments are made or at the date of retirement.
(Ord. A-604. Passed 7-20-64; Ord. A-2282. Passed 12-10-01.)
   (c)   Pro Rata Payments to Promoted Employees losing longevity. Employees
who are promoted to a position without longevity pay but were receiving it in
their previous job will receive pro rated longevity for the months worked prior
to the promotion in the previous position. Employees affected by this within
the past five years will be retroactively paid for the year they were promoted.
(Ord. A-2805.  Passed 12-8-14.)
131.08   NEW APPOINTMENTS.
   A new employee shall be paid at a step within the approved pay range for the
position to which he is appointed as determined by the City Manager. In most
cases, this would be at the minimum.

131.09   PROMOTIONS.
   (a)   Police. All promotional appointments, except for the Police Chief’s
position, made pursuant to Ohio R.C. 124.44, shall be for a probationary period
of six months, and no promotion is final until the appointee has satisfactorily
served his probationary period. If the service of the probationary employee is
unsatisfactory, he shall be reduced to the rank he held at the time he was
appointed to the higher rank. Promotions to the position of Police Chief will
be made pursuant to the City Charter.
   (b)   Fire. All promotional appointments in the Fire Department, except for
the Fire Chief’s position, made pursuant to the Ohio Revised Code, shall be for
a probationary period of six months. No promotion shall be deemed final until
the appointee has satisfactorily served his probationary period. At the end of
the probationary period, the Fire Chief shall transmit to the City Manager a
record of the employee’s service, and if such service is satisfactory, the
employee shall continue in his promotive rank. If at the end of the
probationary period the appointee’s service is unsatisfactory, he shall be
reduced to the rank held at the time he was appointed to the higher rank. In
all cases of unsatisfactory probationary periods in the Fire Department, the
Fire Chief shall at the end of the probationary period, furnish the employee
with a written notice of unsatisfactory probation and a detailed statement of
the basis for such findings. Within ten days thereafter, such employee may
appeal from the decision or order of the City Manager to the Municipal Civil
Service Commission, and the Commission may hear, or appoint a trial board to
hear such employee’s appeal within thirty days from its filing with the
Commission. An appeal to determine the sufficiency of the cause of demotion may
be had from the decision of the Civil Service Commission to the Court of Common
Pleas of the County in which such Municipality is situated. Such appeal shall
be taken within twenty days from the decision of the Commission. Promotions to
the position of Fire Chief will be made pursuant to the City Charter.
   (c)   Others. In order to provide advancement opportunity, when vacancies
exist, the Human Resources Manager will post a list of such vacancies
indicating the title, description of duties, basic personnel requirements,
normal work schedule and rate of pay. An interested employee may apply for such
vacancy by filing with the Human Resources Manager an employment application
declaring his desire for a promotion. Such application shall list the
employee’s qualifications. Placement and advancement shall be at the City’s
discretion and the City shall consider the employee’s experience, work history,
qualifications and seniority in filling vacancies. The City reserves the right
to fill vacancies from outside sources when in the best interest of the City as
determined by the City Manager. All promotional appointments shall be
probationary and subject to a probationary period of six months after
appointment. An employee promoted and then rejected during a probationary
period shall have the right to resume the position from which he was promoted.
Employees in their initial probationary period with the City are not eligible
for promotion in the same or other departments, unless approved by the City
Manager.
   (d)   Salary Adjustments. When an employee is promoted to a classification
having a higher pay range, he shall receive a salary increase of at least one
full step in the new range.

Ord. A-2990. Passed 12-9-19.)
131.10   TRANSFERS. 
   When an employee is transferred to a classification having a similar pay
range, no salary increase is provided.
(Ord. A-604. Passed 7-20-64.) 
131.11   DEMOTIONS.
   When an employee requests to be demoted, bumps (due to staff reductions), or
is demoted due to discipline to a lower classification, the salary of the
demoted employee shall be reduced to bring his rate within the range
established for the class to which he is demoted. If a position is reclassified
to a lower salary range, the affected employee salary will be frozen until the
employee’s salary is lower than the maximum pay for the salary range.
(Ord. A-604.  Passed 7-20-64; Ord. A-2778.  Passed 12-9-13.)
131.12   SALARY INCREMENTS.
   (a)   In General.  An employee who is appointed to a full-time or part-time
regular position within the Municipal service may receive a six-month step
increase within the employee's pay range upon judgment of the employee's
supervisor that the employee is performing his responsibilities in a
satisfactory fashion, as judged by a performance appraisal that has been
conducted by the employee's immediate supervisor within thirty days of the date
of the potential step pay increase, provided that the employee has not achieved
the top step in his particular pay grade.  Step increases shall occur in the
first pay period of July of a given year.  No step increase adjustment shall
occur if the employee has served in the position, whether by promotion or
initial appointment, for less than six months.
   A non-probationary full-time or part-time employee may receive a step
increase within the employee's pay range upon the judgment of the employee's
supervisor that the employee is performing his responsibilities in a
satisfactory fashion, as judged by a performance appraisal that has been
conducted by the employee's immediate supervisor within thirty days of the date
of the potential step pay increase, provided that the employee has not achieved
the top step in his particular pay grade.
   An employee shall not receive a step increase on more than one occasion
during any six-month period.
   (b)   Exceptional Increases.  While salary increases are ordinarily limited
to one step, the City Manager may, in special circumstances, grant salary
increases of two steps. Salary increases in excess of two steps shall require
Council approval.
   (c)   Educational Bonus.  Sworn personnel in the Police and Fire Departments

The Fire Chief, Deputy Fire Chief or Assistant Fire Chief shall be paid an
annual bonus added to the base wage upon completion and certification as a
basic EMT. The basic EMT bonus will be the equivalent EMT bonus of Fire
Lieutenant. Said bonus shall become effective the first pay period following
certification. No employee shall be entitled to receive both the paramedic
bonus and the EMT bonus.
   The Police Chief and Police Captains who have successfully completed a
National Training Program, attend an approved National refresher training
course per year, completed twenty-four hours of approved training per year, and
obtain eight points in Department approved activities will receive a bonus of

along with the second check of December of that year.
   All educational bonuses shall begin the first full pay period following the

their normal workday or all hours in excess of the basic work week.

guidelines under FLSA shall apply to these exempt employees.)
   (d)   Non-Exempt Employees. All other management/administrative employees
who have been determined to be non-exempt under the Fair Labor Standards Act
(FLSA) shall be entitled to overtime pay.
   (e)   Hourly Rate. The hourly rate shall be arrived at by dividing the
number of hours worked in the basic work year into the person's annual rate of
pay.
   (f)   Fire Department Rate. In the case of the Fire Department, the hourly
rate shall be determined by dividing 2,080 hours into the annual rate of pay.
   (g)   Call-Outs. Work performed outside the regular work schedule, unless
such work is an extension of the day's work, or without prior notice upon
leaving work on the previous day, shall constitute a call-out.
   Call-outs shall be paid at the time and one-half rate, with a minimum
guarantee of three hours at the time and one-half rate, except as noted in the
following paragraphs.
   Any employee who takes an unauthorized absence for part or all of a
regularly scheduled workday and then responds to a call-out the same day,
without working over the normal workday, including the time worked for the
call-out and any other time worked for the respective day, shall be paid at the
regular rate of pay with a minimum guarantee of two hours at that rate.
However, if the combined work for the call-out and the other regularly
scheduled work during the day exceeds the normal workday, then the employee
shall be paid at the time and one-half rate for any time worked over the normal
workday. If call-out work is performed prior to the start of the regular work
shift and continues into the regular shift, the pay rate shall revert to
straight time at the start of the regular shift and shall continue at that rate
for eight working hours.
   Additional overtime worked during the workday shall then be compensated for
at the time and one-half rate.
   Part-time employees are not eligible for call out overtime.
   (h)   Compensatory Time.  Non-exempt employees shall have the option to take
compensatory time off in lieu of overtime pay; noting that said compensatory
time off will be earned at a rate of one and one-half times the number of hours
worked. All compensatory time off will be subject to scheduling approval of the
immediate supervisor. No employee can accumulate a balance of more than sixty
hours of compensatory time (seventy-two hours for Assistant Fire Chiefs working
a fifty-four hour work week). Compensatory time must be taken within twelve
months of being accrued. In extenuating circumstances, where an employee is not
permitted to take compensatory time due to City operational responsibilities,
the City Manager may extend the twelve month time limit.

131.17   SICK LEAVE.
   (a)   Regular full-time employees shall be entitled to unlimited
accumulation of sick leave on the basis of their respective basic hourly work
week. All such sick leave and the accumulation thereof shall be in a unit of
hours. The following schedule is hereby established to indicate the proper sick
leave provisions based upon the basic hourly work week of the respective
employee:
 
                                      Sick Leave to which the Employee is
Basic Work Week of the Employee Hours Entitled for Each Complete Month of
                                      Service Hours
42                                    12
54                                    24
                                      (maximum of 192 hours/year)
 
      (1)   Police Captains and Police Chief shall have the election to
accumulate 4.62 hours of sick leave for each bi-weekly pay period (10.01 hours/
month).  Existing Police Captains and Police Chief shall make such election
within thirty days of the effective date of this section; thereafter, Police
Captains and Police Chief shall make such election within thirty days of their
appointment.
   (b)   Employees may use sick leave for absence due to illness, injury,
exposure to serious contagious disease, and for serious illness or death in the
employee's immediate family.  Sick leave is used up by deducting the number of
hours or parts of hours which the employee is absent from the normally
scheduled work day.
   (c)   For the purposes of sick leave usage due to illness or injury,
"immediate family" means: mother, father, spouse, son, and daughter.  By
special permission of the City Manager, sick leave may be used for illness or
injury for other relatives. Employees who need to use one week or more of sick
leave must submit Family Medical Leave certificate forms if the leave would
qualify under the FMLA policy.
   (d)   For the purpose of bereavement leave (paid with sick leave accrual),
this section, "immediate family" means: mother, father, sister, brother,
spouse, son, daughter, mother-in-law, father-in-law, brother-in-law, sister-in-
law, son-in-law, daughter-in-law, grandchildren, grandparents, aunts, uncles
and other persons living in the employee's home.  By special permission of the
City Manager, bereavement leave may be used for death of persons other than
those listed above.  Bereavement leave coverage for funerals is limited to
three consecutive work days.  (Assistant Fire Chiefs are limited to forty-eight
consecutive duty hours.)  Funeral leave should not count as an occurrence and
will not prevent an employee from receiving the sick usage bonus.
   (e)   Sick leave or bereavement leave shall be documented with the
appropriate leave request form including the relationship of family member to
be completed by the employee as soon as is possible.
   (f)   A department head may require an employee to submit documentation from
a medical doctor or other qualified person for the purpose of justifying an
employee's use of sick leave.  However, an employee shall be required to submit
said documentation for leaves of five consecutive days or more. Assistant Fire
Chiefs shall be required to submit documentation for leaves of three or more
consecutive shift days.  Return to work documentation shall also be required.
   (g)   When an employee is unable to work due to a job-related injury, the
City will continue to pay the employee his regular straight-time salary or
hourly wage for up to sixty calendar days.  This sixty-day period will be
reduced to thirty days if the Bureau of Worker's Compensation establishes a
reserve for the employee's worker's compensation claim.  The City Manager may
continue such payments beyond sixty days when the City Manager determines that
such a continuation will be beneficial to the City.  There will be no deduction
from accumulated sick leave for any period of time during which an employee
receives wage continuation as a result of on-the-job leave pursuant to Section
131.35.
   (h)   Any employee covered by Schedules A, B or D of Pay Table II, as set
forth in the ordinance passed each year, and the City Manager, Law Director and
City Clerk who retire after at least ten years of service with the City of
Sidney shall be entitled to payment of unused sick leave as follows:
      (1)   Except as set forth in paragraphs (h)(2) and (h)(3) hereof,
employees shall receive thirty percent of their total sick leave accumulation.
      (2)   Payment for fifty-four hour per week employees shall be made by
multiplying thirty percent times the total sick leave hours leave times the
annual salary, divided by 2080.
      (3)   Police Captains and Police Chief who choose paragraph (a)(1) above
elect one of the following options:
         A.   A Police Captain and Police Chief who retires after ten years of
service with the City of Sidney, shall be entitled to payment for unused sick
leave of thirty percent of his total sick leave accumulation.
         B.   Upon retirement or upon termination of employment other than
retirements, a Police Captain and Police Chief who has at least twenty years of
continuous service with the City and at least twenty-five years of service
credit toward retirement shall be entitled to payment for unused sick leave of
forty percent of such employee’s total sick leave accumulation. The maximum
number of hours for which the employee will receive pay for is 960 hours.
         C.   Upon retirement or upon termination of employment other than
retirement, a Police Captain and Police Chief who has at least twenty-five
years of service with the City of Sidney shall be entitled to payment for
unused sick leave of forty-five percent of his total leave accumulation. The
maximum number of hours that the employee will receive pay for is 960 hours.
      (4)   If the deceased employee has 10 or more years of service with the
City of Sidney, the City of Sidney will pay the estate of a deceased employee
the sick leave payout the employee would be entitled to if the deceased
employee would have retired and provided that the employee was a current
employee at the time of such employee’s death.
   (i)   Regular full time employees who do not use more than one day of sick
leave in a given pay year, except Senior Directors, City Clerk, Law Director
and City Manager, shall be paid a bonus equivalent to eight hours pay at the
employer's hourly rate. Said bonus is only available to those employees who do
not use more than one day of sick leave in a given pay year and are on the City
payroll from January 1 to December 31 in the year the bonus is earned. Said
bonus, if earned, will be paid at the employee's rate of pay for the last pay
period in December in the year earned and paid at the first pay period in
February of the following year. Employees who retire after December 31st but
prior to the first pay period in February will receive the bonus on their final
check.
   (j)   Temporary light duty assignment may be accommodated in accordance with
the following:
      (1)   Any employee desiring to be placed on a temporary light duty
assignment for medical reasons shall submit a written request to his department
head, explaining the nature of the illness or injury and the proposed duty
activities, and attaching a medical release for the light duty activities
contemplated.
            If light duty activities are available, but the employee has not
requested them within ten days of taking sick leave, the City may contact the
employee's physician to determine if the employee can receive medical clearance
in order to perform said light duty activities.
      (2)   The City reserves the right to determine whether to make or approve
temporary light duty assignments and to determine (with medical clearance) the
activities to be conducted in such assignment, provided, however, that all such
assignments will involve work that is directly related to the City operations
and that each request for such assignment will be evaluated on the basis of
available and suitable light duty work details for temporary assignments, as
determined by the department head and the Human Resources Manager.
      (3)   Any employee temporarily assigned to a light duty status shall be
paid according to his current pay rate. Temporary light duty assignment may
involve work activities that are typically performed by a supervisor or another
employer at a higher pay grade. However, the provisions of Section 131.34 will
not be applicable to individuals assigned to light duty activities, as
described above.
      (4)   No individual assigned to light duty status will be scheduled to
work on a holiday. The calculation of sick leave accrual for individuals on
light duty status will be computed on the basis of that individual's regular
shift assignment, even though the light duty assignment may alter the actual
work shift.

131.171   CONVERSION OF SICK LEAVE TO VACATION.
   (a)   All regular employees covered by Pay Table II who have accumulated the
amount of sick leave set forth below, may be granted additional vacation. Up to
fifty-four (54) hours additional vacation for fire personnel assigned to a
fifty-four (54)-hour work week and up to forty (40) hours additional vacation
for all other personnel can be converted annually from sick leave at a rate of
one sick leave hour for one vacation hour.

(20th) year of service and provided he or she has the minimum number of hours
(1,680 - fire/54-hour work week, 1,440 - others), he or she may annually
convert sick leave to additional vacation up to one week (54 hours - fire/54-
hour work week, 40 hours - others). This conversion will be at the rate of one
(1) sick leave hour for one (1) vacation hour. For the purposes of this
section, “service” shall mean service as a full-time employee with the City or
prior full-time service with any other political subdivision of the State.
   (c)   At no time shall an employee be allowed to convert sick leave to
vacation if such conversion would place the employee over the maximum annual
vacation allowance.

131.18   MILITARY LEAVE. 
   (a)   Any regular employee who is a member of the National Guard or militia
or of the military or naval forces of the United States, and is required to
undergo field training therein, shall be granted a leave of absence with pay
for the period of such field training.  This paid leave of absence shall be in
addition to the employee’s vacation leave, but shall not exceed twenty-two (22)
eight (8)-hour work days or one hundred seventy-six (176) hours within one (1)
calendar year.  An employee on one (1) continuous leave of absence that extends
into a subsequent calendar year or years will receive pay only for one (1)
period of twenty-two (22) work days or one hundred seventy-six (176) hours, not
for each year of the same leave.  In the case of military leave, paid leave
shall mean the difference between the employee’s regular salary and the
employee’s military base pay.  The employee must submit satisfactory evidence
of military pay in order to receive this benefit.
   (b)   Any regular employee called to active military service pursuant to an
order by the President of the United States or an act of Congress will be paid
the difference between the employee’s regular salary and the employee’s
military base pay.  A qualifying employee shall be eligible to receive this
benefit for a maximum period of two years. The employee must submit
satisfactory evidence of military pay in order to receive this benefit.
   (c)   During the employee’s military leave as permitted by subsection (b),
if the employee elects COBRA health care continuation, the City shall pay the
same monthly premium percentage contribution  towards the employee’s COBRA
coverage as it would have made for an active employee with the same health
insurance coverage.  Employees shall pay the same percentage contribution
toward their COBRA coverage as they would have made as an active employee.  A
qualifying employee shall be eligible to receive this benefit for a maximum
period of two years.
   (d)   Each employee entitled to leave under subsections (a) or (b) above
shall submit to the Human Resources Manager the published order authorizing the
call or order to the Uniformed Services or a written statement from the
appropriate military commander, in order to be credited with that leave.
   (e)   The City shall not compensate an employee for military leave beyond
what is covered in this section.
   (f)   This section is intended to replace entirely any provisions of the
Ohio Revised Code, including  Ohio R.C. 5923.05 as now written or later
amended, and those provisions shall not apply to any employee of the City.

131.19   LEAVE OF ABSENCE WITHOUT PAY. 
   A regular employee holding a position in the classified service who is
temporarily, either mentally or physically, incapacitated to perform his
duties, or who desires to engage in a course of study such as will increase his
usefulness on his return to the service, or who for any reason considered good
by the department head and the City Manager desires to secure leave from his
regular duties may, with the approval of the department head and the City
Manager, be granted special leave of absence without pay for a period not
exceeding one (1) year. The City Manager may grant leave for a period not
exceeding six (6) months and extend this leave for another six (6) months if,
in the Manager’s opinion, such leave is justified. Any employee asking for a
special leave without pay shall submit his request in writing stating the
reasons why, in the employee’s opinion, the request should be granted, the date
when he desires the leave to begin and the probable date of his return to
duty.  The employee shall not accrue vacation or sick leave during a leave of
absence without pay.
(Ord. A-2065.  Passed 12-23-96; Ord. A-2778.  Passed 12-9-13.)
131.191   FAMILY AND MEDICAL LEAVE ACT.
   (a)   Eligible employees (those who have worked for the City at least twelve
[12] months and for at least one thousand two hundred fifty [1,250] hours
during the year preceding the requested leave) are entitled to take up to
twelve (12) weeks of unpaid leave during any twelve (12)-month period from the
first day leave was taken.  This leave may be used:
      (1)   For incapacity due to pregnancy, prenatal medical care or child
birth;
      (2)   To care for the employee’s child after child birth or after
placement for adoption or foster care;
      (3)   To care for the employee’s spouse, son, daughter or parent, who has
a serious health condition; or
      (4)   For a serious health condition that makes the employee unable to
perform his job.
      Military Family Leave Entitlement. Eligible employees with a spouse, son,
daughter, or parent on active duty in a foreign country or called to active
duty status for deployment in a foreign country in the Armed Forces, including
in the National Guard or Reserves, may use their twelve (12)-week leave
entitlement to address certain qualifying exigencies. Qualifying exigencies may
include attending certain military events, arranging for alternative child or
parent care, addressing certain financial and legal arrangements, attending
certain counseling sessions, attending post-deployment reintegration briefings,
and spending time with a military member on Rest and Recuperation leave
(maximum of fifteen [15] calendar days).
      FMLA also includes a special leave entitlement that permits eligible
employees to take up to twenty-six (26) weeks of leave to care for a covered
current service member or veteran during a single twelve (12)-month period. A
covered current service member is a current member of the Armed Forces,
including a member of the National Guard or Reserves, who has a serious injury
or illness incurred or aggravated in the line of duty. A covered veteran is an
individual who was discharged or released under conditions other than
dishonorable during the five (5)-year period (not including 10-28-09 through 3-
8-13) before the first date the eligible employee takes FMLA leave to care for
the veteran, and who has a serious injury or illness incurred or aggravated in
the line of duty or related to military service, subject to certain conditions.
   (b)   All leave (paid or unpaid) taken for Family and Medical Leave Act
(FMLA) reasons shall be counted against the employee’s annual FMLA leave
entitlement.
   (c)   When leave is foreseeable, employees must provide at least thirty (30)
days advance notice, in writing, to their department heads. This requirement
can be waived with the approval of the City Manager. If thirty (30) days’
notice is not practicable, then the employee must provide as much notice as is
practicable and generally must comply with the required call-in procedure. The
initial notice must provide sufficient information for the City to determine if
the leave may qualify for FMLA protection. An employee shall complete a leave
of absence application form, available from his or her supervisor, when
requesting leave, or as soon after that as is practicable. The employee must
list on this form the reasons for the requested leave, the expected start of
the leave, and the expected length of the leave. If the employee is requesting
intermittent leave or a reduced leave schedule, the employee shall state the
reasons why the intermittent leave or a reduced leave schedule is medically
necessary and the schedule of treatment. (Intermittent leave and reduced leave
schedule are not available for birth or adoption leaves.) The employee must
also state if the requested leave is for a reason for which FMLA leave was
previously taken or certified.
      The City will designate the leave as FMLA or not and so notify the
employee. If the employee disagrees, he or she should inform the City
immediately. If the employee appears to be eligible, the City will notify the
employee of any additional information required, the amount of leave counted
against the employee’s leave entitlement and the employee’s rights and
responsibilities. If the employee is not eligible, the City will provide the
reason.
   (d)   An employee requesting leave to care for the employee’s spouse, child
or parent, or due to the employee’s own serous health condition, must submit a
medical certification completed by the health care provider of the employee or
the employee’s ill family member, demonstrating the need for the leave. The
City will provide a form for this. When the duration of the condition listed in
the original certification is thirty (30) days, or less, if the employee’s
leave (whether full time, intermittent, or on a reduced schedule) is beyond
thirty (30) days, then a new medical certification shall be required after
thirty (30) days, and each thirty (30) days after that. When the duration of
the condition listed in the original certification exceeds thirty (30) days, a
new medical certification shall be required if the employee’s leave is beyond
the specified duration or every six (6) months, whichever occurs first. A
second opinion may be required, at the City’s expense. If the opinions are
conflicting, a third opinion, at the City’s expense, may also be required.
   (e)   Definition of Serious Health Condition. A “serious health condition”
is an illness, injury, impairment, or physical or mental condition that
involves either an overnight stay in a medical care facility, or continuing
treatment by a health care provider for a condition that either prevents the
employee from performing the functions of the employee’s job, or prevents the
qualified family member from participating in school or other daily activities.
      Subject to certain conditions, the continuing treatment requirement may
be met by a period of incapacity of more than three (3) consecutive calendar
days combined with at least two (2) visits to a health care provider or one (1)
visit and a regimen of continuing treatment, or incapacity due to pregnancy, or
incapacity due to a chronic condition. Other conditions may meet the definition
of continuing treatment.
   (f)   Employees are entitled to maintain their health insurance coverage
during FMLA leave, provided that they continue to pay their share of premium
costs and meet other conditions of the coverage required for all employees.
Failure to pay premiums within thirty (30) days of the due date will result in
the cancellation of coverage, although coverage will be reinstated upon the
employee’s return to work, subject to insurance eligibility.
   (g)   All family and medical leaves are without pay, except to the extent
paid leave is available. If an employee’s reason for applying for FMLA leave
qualifies for the use of sick leave, said employee shall be required to use
paid sick leave. In all leave requests under the Family and Medical Leave Act,
the employee shall be required to use any available paid leave, including
vacation, while on FMLA leave, and the paid leave counts against the twelve
(12)-week entitlement. The employee shall not have the option of using paid
sick leave for non-medically related or non-sick leave qualifying leave.
Employees will not accrue sick leave or vacation when on unpaid FMLA leave.
   (h)   While on FMLA leave, employees shall contact their supervisors at
least once per month and indicate their intentions to return to work as
scheduled. Employees must inform their supervisors of the date they will be
able to return to work, no later than one (1) week in advance whenever
practicable. An employee on medical leave due to the employee’s own serious
health condition must, as a condition to returning to work, submit a medical
certificate releasing the employee to return to his or her job. Upon return
from FMLA leave, employees must be restored to their original or equivalent
position with equivalent pay, benefit or other employment terms.
   (i)   All leaves which may be available or taken under the Family and
Medical Leave Act are subject to the restrictions, limitations and conditions
provided in that law and any valid regulations promulgated under it. An
employee who believes his or her FMLA rights have been violated may file a
complaint with the U.S. Department of Labor or may bring a private lawsuit
against an employer. FMLA does not affect any Federal or State law prohibiting
discrimination, or supersede any State or local law or collective bargaining
agreement which provides greater family or medical leave rights.
      FMLA makes it unlawful for any employer to:
      *   Interfere with, restrain, or deny the exercise of any right provided
under FMLA;
      *   Discharge or discriminate against any person for opposing any
practice made unlawful by FMLA or for involvement in any proceeding under or
relating to FMLA.
   (j)   All requests for FMLA leave must be approved by the City Manager or
designee. Records of FMLA leave will be kept and recorded in accordance with
procedures established by the Human Resources Department. The City may require
any certificate permitted by FMLA.

131.20   JURY AND WITNESS DUTY. 
   Any employee, who is called upon for jury duty or as a witness in a court of
law, shall be granted a leave of absence for the period of such duty. The City
shall pay the employee the amount of pay which the employee would have normally
received during the absent time providing the employee turns over any
compensation received for time served during the normal work period. Where jury
or witness duty would create an undue hardship on City operations, the City
will attempt to gain the excuse of those individuals, and will need their
cooperation to do so.

131.21   SEPARATION FROM SERVICE. 
   (a)   Layoff. When it becomes necessary in any department, through lack of
funds or other causes, to reduce the number of employees in a given class,
temporary and seasonal employees, if any, shall be laid off first and
thereafter the least efficient regular employees as shown by service ratings
for the (12)-month period immediately preceding the layoff date shall be the
next laid off. In the absence of satisfactory service ratings, layoff shall be
in order of seniority, the persons last appointed being the first laid off.
   (b)   Suspension. When, in the opinion of the City Manager, an employee’s
work performance or conduct justifies a disciplinary action short of dismissal,
the employee may be suspended without pay.
   (c)   Removal. An employee may be dismissed from the service for cause. Any
one of the following causes shall be sufficient for removal from the service,
though removal may be made for causes other than these here enumerated:

      (2)   Absence without leave or failure to report after authorized leave
has expired or after such leave has been disapproved or revoked by the
appointing authority;

Once a retiring employee determines the date of such employee's last day, such
employee shall inform such employee's Supervisor and the Human Resources
Department in writing or email of that date. The use of accrued leave time of
actual service may be allowed if, in the sole discretion of the City Manager or
such Manager's designee, that the affected department will not be adversely
impacted by the reduced staffing levels.
   (e)   Resignation.  To resign in good standing, a probationary or regular
employee shall give at least two (2) weeks’ notice of his intention to resign.
   (f)   Disability Separation.  If an employee, as a result of an injury on
the job is unable to perform the substantial and essential duties of such
employee’s position for a period of twelve (12) consecutive months, the
employee shall be placed on disability separation at the end of said twelve
(12)-month period and the City may fill such employee’s position, except as
prohibited by law. Employees on disability separation shall be entitled to sick
leave pay as long as they have unused sick leave in their credit.
      (1)   Reinstatement rights.  An employee given a disability separation
shall have the right to reinstatement, within two (2) years after having been
given a disability separation, to a position in the classification the employee
held at the time of separation. When such employee is restored to such
employee’s position, the former incumbent of such position shall be demoted to
the next lower rank, and the less senior employee in years of service in the
next lower rank shall be demoted, and so on down until the less senior employee
in the point of service has been reached, who shall be laid off, if necessary.
      (2)   Request for reinstatement. Any request for reinstatement following
a disability separation must not be later than two (2) years following a
disability separation.  The request must be in writing to the City Manager.
      (3)   Medical examination.  The employee requesting reinstatement from a
disability separation shall be eligible for reinstatement after a medical
examination, conducted by a physician to be designated by the City, or upon the
submission of other appropriate medical documentation establishing that the
disability illness, injury or condition no longer exists.

the attending physician or hospital, provided that the injured employee has
reported the accident to his supervisor, as soon as is possible, in writing, on
the City’s “Employee’s Report of Injury or Accident” form provided by the
supervisor.
   (b)   In the case of an employee being disabled as a result of an on-the-job
injury, the injured employee may petition the proper state agency for a
disability allowance.
   (c)   When an employee is unable to work as a result of an on-the-job
injury, the City will continue to pay the employee his regular straight-time
salary or hourly wage for up to sixty (60) calendar days. This wage
continuation will revert to thirty (30) days if the Bureau of Workers’
Compensation established reserves for wage replacement. On-the-job injury leave
wage continuation may be extended beyond sixty (60) days at the discretion of
the City Manager. There will be no deduction from accumulated sick leave for
the period of time during which an employee is receiving wage continuation
pursuant to this section. Such wage continuation will not be awarded for any
time in which the employee is receiving Workers’ Compensation disability
benefits. At the conclusion of the wage continuation period, if the employee is
still unable to return to work, the employee has the following options:
      (1)   Elect to receive disability payments from Workers’ Compensation.
The employee would not draw the normal base wage from his accumulated leaves of
absence.
      (2)   Elect to sign over his temporary total disability check to the City
of Sidney and receive his normal base wage from his accumulated leaves of
absence. The employee may not receive both temporary total disability and draw
on his accumulated leaves of absence. When the employee signs over his
disability checks to the City, they will be applied proportionately to
reimburse his leave balances.
   (d)   Disability Separation.  If an employee, as the result of an on the job
injury, is unable to perform the substantial and material duties of his or her
position for a period of twelve (12) consecutive months, the employee shall be
placed on disability separation at the end of said twelve (12)-month period and
the City may fill his or her position. Employees on disability separation shall
be entitled to sick leave pay as long as they have unused sick leave to their
credit.
   (e)   Reinstatement Rights.  An employee given a disability separation shall
have the right to reinstatement within two (2) years after having been given a
disability separation to a position in the classification the employee held at
the time of separation. When such employee is restored to his or her position,
the former incumbent of such position shall be demoted to the next lower rank,
and the less senior employee in years of service in the next lower rank shall
be demoted, and so on down until the less senior employee in years of service
has been reached, who shall be paid off, if necessary.
   (f)   Request for Reinstatement.  Any request for reinstatement following a
disability separation must not be later than one (1) year following a
disability separation. The request must be in writing.
   (g)   Medical Examination.  The employee requesting reinstatement from a
disability separation shall be eligible for reinstatement after a medical
examination, conducted by a physician to be designated by the City, or upon the
submission of other appropriate medical documentation establishing that the
disability illness, injury, or condition no longer exists.
   (h)   Light Duty.  The City may offer temporary light duty to an employee
who is receiving Workers’ Compensation, even if the employee has not requested
light duty. If the employee refuses the light duty assignment, the City
reserves the right to file an application to terminate Workers’ Compensation
benefits and stop paying salary continuation.

131.36   GRIEVANCES. 
   (a)   Definitions.  A grievance is a wrong, real or fancied, considered by
an employee as a grounds for complaint, except in the case of personnel action
arising out of position classification, pay, demotion, suspension and
dismissal. The adjustment of complaints arising therefrom are separately
provided for. (Ord. A-1600. Passed 12-22-86.)
   (b)   Procedure. The employee shall first submit his grievance, in writing,
to his immediate supervisor. The immediate supervisor shall make careful
inquiry into the facts and circumstances of the complaint, and he shall inform
the employee, in writing, of his decision and the reasons therefor within seven
(7) calendar days after receipt of the employee’s grievance.
   If the employee is dissatisfied with the immediate supervisor’s decision, he
may obtain a review by the next person in the chain of command, who will
respond to the complaint within seven (7) calendar days. If the employee is
unsatisfied with the response, this sequence will be followed until the chain
of command is completed to the department head. If the chain of command has not
settled the complaint to the employee’s satisfaction, the employee may submit
his written grievance to the department head, who will respond to the complaint
within seven (7) calendar days. If the employee is dissatisfied with the
department head’s decision, he may obtain a review by the City Manager by
submitting to the Human Resources Manager a request for review within seven (7)
calendar days following the receipt of the decision from the department head.
The Human Resources Manager shall make such investigation.  The Human Resources
Manager shall present the investigation results to the City Manager who shall
conduct such hearings as he/she deems necessary and within fifteen (15)
calendar days after the hearing, shall inform the employee, in writing, of his
finding and decision. The decision of the City Manager shall be final.

131.37   COMPLAINTS CONCERNING POSITION CLASSIFICATION AND PAY.
   The addition or removal of responsibilities that significantly change job
content, assignment of additional personnel for supervision or any other change
which is permanent in nature shall be sufficient grounds for considering a
reclassification. Any complaints concerning changes in classification or pay
shall be requested in the manner described below.
   (a)   The employee or his/her department head may, in writing to the Human
Resources Manager, formally request a review of the position by June 30 of a
given year. The written request shall specify what aspects of the job
assignment have changed to warrant a reexamination of the position
classification.
   (b)   The employee and his supervisor will be provided a questionnaire for
completion and submittal for evaluation. The questionnaire shall be provided to
the employee within ten working days of the report to the Human Resources
Manager.
   (c)   The employee and his supervisor shall submit the completed
questionnaire to the Human Resources Manager. If the Human Resources Manager
finds the questionnaire to be incomplete, it will be resubmitted to the persons
submitting the document.
   (d)   The Human Resources Manager will meet with the employee and supervisor
to review the questionnaire results and view firsthand the physical aspects of
the position, if necessary.
   (e)   The recommendation of the Human Resources Manager will be presented to
the employee and the supervisor for their review. Comments from the employee
and the supervisor will be forwarded to the Human Resources Manager for
consideration. The Human Resources Manager shall submit his/her findings and
recommendations to the City Manager.
   (f)   The City Manager shall review and infonn the subject employee of the
complaint and the recommendation.
   (g)   The City Manager may make a recommendation to the City Council on a
reclassification, if the City Manager determines that the matter warrants
change. The City Manager shall make this recommendation to City Council in
November of a given year, and any changes in position classification shall
occur at the beginning of the next calendar year.
   (h)   Final notification on Council disposition will be provided to the
appropriate parties. In the event that the employee remains dissatisfied with
the outcome of the appeal, the employee has the option of pursuing his appeal
to the Personnel Board of Appeals or the Civil Service Commission (whichever is
applicable to the employee). Requests for appeal must be made to the Human
Resources Manager, who will make necessary arrangements for a hearing. The
Civil Service Commission or Personnel Board of Appeals, following the conduct
of the hearing, will make a recommendation to the City Manager. The City
Manager’s decision will be final.

131.38   DISCIPLINE.
   In the event of unsatisfactory employee performance, work habits or personal
conduct, the department head shall inform the respective employee promptly and
specifically of the undesirable conditions and shall give counsel and
assistance. If appropriate and justified, a reasonable period of time for
improvement may be allowed before initiating disciplinary action. In some
instances a specific incident may justify severe disciplinary action in and of
itself; however, the action to be taken depends upon the seriousness of the
incident and the whole pattern of the employee’s past performance and conduct.
   (a)   Written Reprimand.  In situations where an oral warning has not
resulted in the expected improvement, or where more severe action is warranted,
written reprimand may be sent to the employee by the department head, and a
copy shall be placed in the employee’s personal records.
   (b)   Suspension or Reduction of Vacation Leave Balance for a Period of Four
(4) Days or Less.  Any FLSA non-exempt employee, except a classified member of
the Police Department or Fire Department, may be suspended without pay for a
period of four (4) working days or less. In such a case, suspension may be made
by the City Manager for reasons of misconduct, negligence, inefficiency,
insubordination, disloyalty, unauthorized absence, or other justifiable reasons
when alternate personnel actions are not appropriate. Employees shall be
furnished an advance written notice at least twenty-four (24) hours before the
effective date of the suspension, containing the nature of the proposed action.
Alternatively, the employee may be suspended with pay for four (4) working days
or less or have vacation leave balance reduced by four (4) working days or less
at the City Manager’s discretion.
         For FLSA exempt employees, the same disciplinary choices will be
available, except that suspensions without pay will be in blocks of one (1) or
more weeks, unless the suspension is for a major safety infraction.
      (1)   If the employee wishes to appeal the suspension or reduction of
vacation leave balance, he must do so in writing to the Human Resources Manager
within twenty-four (24) hours of the receipt of the advance notice. The Human
Resources Manager will present the written appeal to the City Manager. The City
Manager may study the appeal in any manner he chooses and shall decide on the
case. The terms of the suspension or reduction of vacation leave balance shall
not become effective until the City Manager determines the appropriate action.
In all cases the decision of the City Manager shall be final.
      (2)   If no appeal is made by the employee, the suspension or reduction
of vacation leave balance shall take effect on the date specified.
      (3)   Notwithstanding any of the provisions set forth above, if in the
opinion of the department head or his or her designated representative (as set
forth in departmental rules and regulations), an employee’s condition or
actions on the job are endangering the safety of himself or herself or others,
the department head, or his or her designated representative, shall issue an
immediate suspension of the employee for a period not in excess of eight (8)
hours. Before the suspension, the department head or designated representative
shall tell the employee the reason the City is considering suspension and give
him an opportunity, at that time, to be heard. Any immediate suspension shall
be subject to an automatic review by the City Manager within seventy-two (72)
hours of such action, and the department head shall be responsible to provide
written documentation of the conditions and reasons for such action. In the
event that further disciplinary action is taken after the immediate suspension,
the time involved in the immediate suspension shall be credited toward the
further disciplinary action.
   (c)   Suspension, Demotion or Dismissal of Civil Service Employees.  The
suspension, demotion or dismissal of employees covered by the civil service
laws shall be in accordance with Ohio R.C. 124.34 and other civil service laws,
except that the employee shall be entitled to a pre-disciplinary hearing before
the City Manager before any disciplinary action is taken.
   (d)   Suspension in Excess of Four (4) Days, Reduction of Vacation Leave
Balance, Demotion, Dismissal of Employees Not Covered by Civil Service.  The

suspension for a period in excess of four (4) working days, suspension with pay
for a period in excess of four (4) days, reduction of vacation leave balance
for a period in excess of four (4) working days, demotion or dismissal. For
FLSA exempt employees, suspension without pay will be in blocks of one (1) or
more work weeks unless the suspension is for a major safety infraction. Reasons
for such disciplinary action may include, but shall not be limited to:
      (1)   Failure to meet prescribed standards of work, morality and ethics
to an extent that makes an employee unsuitable for any kind of employment in
the City service;
      (2)   Theft or destruction of City property;
      (3)   Incompetency, inefficiency or negligence in the performance of
duty;

advantage; and
      (10)   Incapacity due to mental or physical disability.
   (e)   Procedure for Disciplinary Action.  The City Manager shall first hold
a pre-disciplinary meeting with the employee. If, after such meeting, the City
Manager feels that disciplinary action is warranted, the employee shall be
furnished an advance written notice containing the nature of the proposed
action, the reasons therefor, and the right to answer the charges. This notice
shall be furnished at least one (1) calendar week prior to the proposed
effective date of the action. After receiving notice, but prior to the proposed
effective date of dismissal, the employee may be retained in duty status,
placed on leave, or suspended with or without pay at the discretion of the City
Manager. If the employee fails to respond to the advance notice, the proposed
action of the City Manager shall be effective on the date specified with no
need for further action. Otherwise, the City Manager shall carefully consider
the written appeal of the employee which must be received by the City Manager
within forty-eight (48) hours of the time that the employee received the
advance notice. After considering the employee’s appeal, the City Manager shall
transmit to the employee, at the earliest possible moment, a letter containing
the full decision.
   (f)   Employee Appeal.  If the employee wishes to appeal the decision of the
City Manager, he shall so transmit in writing his appeal to the Board of
Appeals, as provided in Section 6-5 of the City Charter. This appeal must be
made within twenty-four (24) hours of the receipt of the letter containing the
City Manager’s decision. The employee shall then be given at least five (5)
days to prepare his/her argument before appearing before the Board of Appeals.
After the employee’s five (5)-day preparation time, the Board of Appeals shall
consider the appeal within ten (10) days and shall submit its recommendation to
the City Manager. In all cases, the action taken by the City Manager shall be
final.

used to offset salaries, wages, commissions (to the extent that they are
reported on form W-2 or 1099-Misc.) or other compensation.
      (6)   If a taxpayer is engaged in two or more taxable business activities
to be included in the same return, the net loss of one unincorporated business
activity (except any portion of a loss reportable for municipal income tax

   (a)   Each person who engages in business or other activity or whose

subject to the tax imposed by this Tax Code, shall, whether or not a tax be due
thereon, make and file a return on or before April 15 of the following year.

calendar year, the return shall be filed on or before the fifteenth day of the
fourth month following the end of such fiscal year or period.
   The return of an employer or employers, showing the amount of Municipal tax
deducted by said employer or employers from the salaries, wages, commissions or
other compensation of a nonresident employee, and paid by him or her or them to
the Tax Administrator may be accepted as the return required of any nonresident
employee whose sole income, subject to tax under this Tax Code, is such
qualifying wage, commissions, other compensation, and other taxable income.
   The Tax Administrator shall have the authority to provide, by regulation,
that retired and permanently disabled individuals without taxable income and
individuals under eighteen years of age may be exempt from this section.
   (b)   A husband and wife may file either separate returns or a joint return
for Municipal purposes, even though one of the spouses has neither taxable
income nor deductions included on the Municipal return regardless of whether
their federal and state returns were filed separately or jointly. If a joint
city return is made, the tax shall be computed on the aggregate taxable income
and the liability with respect to the tax shall be joint and several.
   (c)   The return shall be filed with the Tax Administrator on a form or
forms furnished by or obtainable upon request from the Tax Administrator; or on
a generic form, if the generic form, when completed and filed, contains all of
the information required to be submitted with the Municipality's prescribed
return and, if the taxpayer or return preparer filing the generic form
otherwise complies with the Tax Code governing the filing of returns.
   (d)   The return shall set forth:
      (1)   The aggregate amounts of qualifying wages, commissions, other
compensation received, allocated, apportioned or set aside, other income
defined by statute as taxable, and gross income from any business, profession
or other activity, less allowable expenses incurred in the acquisition of such

federal or state tax returns and/or schedules, or other information as the Tax
Administrator may require, including a statement that the figures used in the
return are the figures used for Federal income tax adjusted to set forth only
such income as is taxable under the provisions of this chapter.
   (e)   (1)   Any taxpayer that has requested an extension for filing a
federal income tax return may request an extension for the filing of a
Municipal income tax return by filing a copy of the taxpayer's Federal
extension request with the Municipal Tax Division. Any taxpayer not required to
file a federal income tax return may request an extension for filing a
Municipal income tax return in writing. The request for extension must be filed
on or before the original due date for the annual return. If the request is
granted, the extended due date of the municipal income tax return shall be the
last day of the month following the month to which the due date of the Federal
income tax return has been extended.
      (2)   The Tax Administrator may deny a taxpayer's request for extension
if the taxpayer:
         A.   Fails to timely file the request;
         B.   Fails to file a copy of the federal extension request (if
applicable);
         C.   Owes the Municipality any delinquent income tax, penalty,
interest or other charge for the late payment or nonpayment of income tax; or
         D.   Has failed to file any required income tax return, report, or
other related document for a prior tax period.
      (3)   The granting of an extension for filing a Municipal tax return does
not extend the due date as provided in this section for payment of the tax;
hence, penalty and interest may apply to any unpaid tax during the period of
extension at the rate set out by Section
141.10. No penalty shall be assessed in those cases in which the return is
filed and the final tax paid within the extension period provided all other
filing and payment requirements of the Tax Code have been met. Any extension by
the Tax Administrator shall be granted upon the condition that declaration
filing and payment requirements have been fulfilled; however, if, upon further
examination it then becomes evident that declaration filing and payment
requirements have not been fulfilled, penalty and interest may be assessed in
full and in the same manner as though no extension had been granted.
   (f)   Payments With Returns.
      (1)   The taxpayer making a return shall, at the time of the filing
thereof, pay to the Tax Administrator the amount of taxes shown as due.
However, credit shall be allowed for:
         A.   Any portion of the tax so due which shall have been deducted at
the source pursuant to the provisions of Section
141.06;
         B.   Any portion of said tax which shall have been paid by the
taxpayer pursuant to the provisions of Section
141.07; and
         C.   Credit to the extent allowed by Section
141.15 for tax paid to another municipality.
      (2)   Subject to the limitations contained in Section
141.11, any taxpayer who has overpaid the amount of tax to which the
Municipality is entitled under the provisions of this Tax Code may have such
overpayment applied against any subsequent liability hereunder or, at his or
her election indicated on the return, such overpayment (or part thereof) shall
be refunded, provided that no additional taxes or refunds of less than one
dollar ($1.00) shall be collected or refunded.
   (g)   Amended Returns.
      (1)   Where necessary, an amended return shall be filed in order to
report additional income and pay any additional tax due, or claim a refund of
tax overpaid, subject to the requirements and/or limitations contained in
Section
141.11. The Tax Administrator shall provide by regulation the format in which
such amended return shall be filed. A taxpayer may not change the method of
accounting or apportionment of net profits after the due date for filing the
original return.
      (2)   Within three months from the final determination of any Federal tax
liability affecting the taxpayer's Municipal tax liability, such taxpayer shall
make and file an amended Municipal return showing income subject to the
Municipal tax based upon such final determination of federal tax liability and
pay any additional tax shown due thereon or make claim for refund of any
overpayment.
   (h)   Information returns, schedules and statements required to support tax
returns which are incomplete without such information shall be filed within the
time limits set forth for the filing of the tax returns and the failure to file
such information returns, schedules and statements shall be a violation of this
Tax Code. Provided, however, that the taxpayer shall have ten days after
notification by the Tax Administrator, or his or her authorized representative,
to file the items required by this subsection.

141.06   COLLECTION AT SOURCE.
   (a)   Withholding by Employer. Each employer within, or doing business
within, the Municipality who employs one or more persons on a salary, wage,
commission or other compensation basis shall,  at the time of payment thereof,
deduct the tax at the rate provided in Section
141.03  hereof on the qualifying wages due by such employer to each such
employee and shall, on or before the last day of the month following such
withholding, make a return and pay to the Tax Administrator the amount of taxes
so deducted, as follows:
      (1)   The return shall be on a form or forms prescribed by or acceptable
to the Tax Administrator and shall be subject to the Rules and Regulations
prescribed by the Tax Administrator. Such employer shall be liable for the
payment, whether or not such taxes have in fact been withheld.
      (2)   The Tax Administrator may adopt Rules and Regulations establishing
the circumstances under which an employer required to deduct and withhold any
amount under this chapter shall make payment by electronic funds transfer.  The
Tax Administrator shall adopt rules governing the modes of electronic funds
transfer and under what circumstances each mode is acceptable, the content and
format of electronic fund transfers, the coordination of payment by electronic
funds transfer and filing of associated tax reports and returns, and any other
matter that in the opinion of the Tax Administrator facilitates payment by
electronic funds transfer.  The Tax Administrator may grant an exemption to an
employer from the duty to make payment by electronic funds transfer, upon
application, for such exemption by the employer and the employers demonstration
to the Tax Administrator that the requirement to make payment by electronic
funds transfer will impose a substantial hardship upon the employer. The Tax
Administrator may implement means of acknowledging, upon the request of the
taxpayer, receipt of tax remittances made by electronic funds transfer, and may
adopt rules governing acknowledgments. The cost of acknowledging receipt of
electronic remittances shall be paid by the person requesting acknowledgment.
   (b)   An employer is not required to make any withholding with respect to an
individual's disqualifying disposition of an incentive stock option if, at the
time of the disqualifying disposition, the individual is not an employee of the
corporation with respect to whose stock the option has been issued.
   (c)   (1)   An employee is not relieved from liability for a tax by the
failure of the employer to withhold the tax as required by a municipal
corporation or by the employer's exemption from the requirement to withhold the
tax.
      (2)   The failure of an employer to remit to the municipal corporation
the tax withheld relieves the employee from liability for that tax unless the
employee colluded with the employer in connection with the failure to remit the
tax withheld.
   (d)   So long as the taxes withheld by an employer for the Municipality
during the measurement period are less than one thousand dollars ($1,000) per
month, payment may be made quarterly on or before the last day of the month
following the end of each quarter, subject to the approval of the Tax
Administrator. The Tax Administrator may revoke the approval of quarterly
filing and payments whenever the Tax Administrator has reason to believe that
the conditions for granting such authorization have changed, were judged
incorrectly, were not met, or when it is in the best interest of the
Municipality to do so. Notice of withdrawal shall be made in writing and, in
such case, the employer must begin to file in accordance with this section.
   (e)   Employer Considered as Trustee. Each employer in collecting such tax
shall be deemed to hold the same, until payment is made by such employer to the
Municipality, as a trustee for the benefit of the Municipality, and any such
tax collected by such employer from his or her employees shall, until the same
is paid to the Municipality, be deemed a trust fund in the hands of such
employer. Each employer shall be liable for the payment of the tax required to
be deducted and withheld, whether or not such tax, in fact, has been withheld.
   (f)   Any person who is required to withhold tax from qualifying wages shall
pay all such tax to the Municipality in accordance with the provisions of this
section. In the event taxes withheld from the qualifying wages of employees are
not paid to the Municipality in accordance with the provisions of this section,
all officers, members, managers, employees, and trustees having control or
supervision of or charged with the responsibility of filing the return and
making payment are jointly and severally personally liable for the tax not
returned or paid to the Municipality as well as any related interest and
penalties, and are also liable under the provisions of Section
141.12. The dissolution, termination, or bankruptcy of a corporation, limited
liability company, or business trust does not discharge an officer's, member's,
manager's, employee's, or trustee's liability for a failure of the corporation,
limited liability company, or business trust to file returns or pay said taxes.
   (g)   Withholding Return, List of Employees. Each employer shall file a
withholding tax reconciliation showing the sum total of all compensation paid
all employees, the portion of which, (if any) was not subject to withholding
along with an explanation for same, and the portion of which was subject to
withholding, together with the amount of such withholdings remitted. Such
return shall include information concerning each employee from whom the
Municipal tax was withheld, showing the name, address, zip code and Social
Security number of each such employee, the total amount of compensation paid
during the year and the amount of Municipal tax withheld. If the total tax
withheld from any employee included tax withheld and remitted to another
municipality, the amount of same shall be separately shown on the return of
information to the Municipality concerning each employee. The withholding tax
reconciliation shall be filed by each employer on or before February 28
following the end of such calendar year. The Tax Administrator may by
regulation provide for mandatory use of electronic media by employers for the
reporting of annual wage and tax data.
   (h)   In addition to the wage reporting requirements of this section, any
person required by the Internal Revenue Service to report on Form 1099-Misc.

also report such payments to the Municipality when the services were performed
in the Municipality The information may be submitted on a listing, and shall
include the name, address and Social Security number (or Federal Identification
Number), and the amount of the payments made. Federal Form(s) 1099 may be
submitted in lieu of such listing. The information shall be filed annually on
or before February 28 following the end of such calendar year.
   (i)   Domestic Servants. No person shall be required to withhold the tax on
the qualifying wages, commissions, other compensation, and other taxable income
paid domestic servants employed exclusively in or about such person's

resulting from a federal audit, providing an amended return is filed and the

time the tax was due or the return was filed, whichever is later; provided
however, there shall be no period of limitation on an additional assessment in
a case of a return that omits gross income in excess of 25% of that required to
be reported or in the case of filing a false or fraudulent return with intent
to evade the tax, or in the case of failure to file a return. In those cases in
which the Commissioner of Internal Revenue and the taxpayer have executed a
waiver of the federal statute of limitations the period within which an
additional assessment may be made by the Tax Administrator shall be extended
one year from the time of the final determination of the federal tax liability.
   (b)   Taxes erroneously paid shall not be refunded unless a claim for refund

paid to another municipality, a nonrefundable credit shall be allowed against
tax or withholding erroneously paid or withheld to another municipality equal
to the tax or withholding paid with respect to such income or wages.

income or wages, the credit described in this subsection (c) shall be
calculated using the tax rate in effect.

   (d)   Interest shall be allowed and paid on any overpayment by a taxpayer of
any municipal income tax obligation from the date of the overpayment, with the

refunded within ninety days after the final filing date of the annual return or
ninety days after the complete return is filed, whichever is later. For
purposes of computing the payment of interest on overpayments, no amount of tax
for any taxable year shall be treated as having been paid before the date on
which the tax return for that year was due without regard to any extension of
time for filing that return. The interest shall be paid at the rate of interest
prescribed by Ohio R.C. 5703.47.
   (e)   Amounts of less than one dollar ($1.00) shall not be collected or
refunded.

used in this chapter that is not otherwise defined in this chapter is used in a
comparable context in both the laws of the United States relating to Federal
income tax and in Title LVII of the Ohio Revised Code and the use is not
consistent, then the use of the term in the laws of the United States relating

taxable income before net operating losses and special deductions as determined

for the production of income;

Municipal taxable income to zero, with any remaining unused portion of the net
operating loss carried forward to not more than five consecutive taxable years
following the taxable year in which the loss was incurred, but in no case for

of the Municipality in any month of the preceding calendar quarter exceeded two
hundred dollars ($200.00). Payments under paragraph (b)(1)B. hereof shall be
made to the Tax Administrator not later than fifteen days after the last day of
each month.
         C.   Taxes required to be deducted and withheld shall be remitted
semi-monthly to the Tax Administrator if the total taxes deducted and withheld
or required to be deducted on behalf of the Municipality in the preceding
calendar year exceeded eleven thousand nine hundred ninety-nine dollars
($11,999), or if the total amount of taxes deducted and withheld or required to
be deducted and withheld on behalf of the Municipality in any month of the
preceding calendar year exceeded one thousand dollars ($1,000). The payment
under paragraph (b)(1)C. hereof shall be made to the Tax Administrator not
later than one of the following:
            1.   If the taxes were deducted and withheld or required to be
deducted and withheld during the first fifteen days of a month, the third
banking day after the fifteenth day of that month;
            2.   If the taxes were deducted and withheld or required to be
deducted and withheld after the fifteenth day of a month and before the first
day of the immediately following month, the third banking day after the last
day of that month.
         D.   An employer, agent of an employer or other payer is required to
make payment by electronic funds transfer to the Tax Administrator of all taxes
deducted and withheld on behalf of the employee for remittance to the
Municipality if the employer, agent of an employer, or other payer is required
to make payments electronically for the purpose of paying Federal taxes
withheld on payments to employees under section 6302 of the Internal Revenue
Code, 26 C.F.R. 31.6302-1, or any other Federal statute or regulation. The
payment of tax by electronic funds transfer under this subsection does not
affect an employer's, agent's, or other payer's obligation to file any return
as required under this section. Once the threshold for remitting payment
electronically for Federal purposes has been met, any accrued Municipal income
tax withheld from employee qualifying wages earned within the Municipality
shall be remitted to the Municipality at the same time that the Federal tax
withholding payment is due.
   (c)   An employer, agent of an employer, or other payer shall make and file
a return showing the amount of tax withheld by the employer, agent, or other
payer from the qualifying wages of each employee and remitted to the Tax
Administrator. A return filed by an employer, agent, or other payer under this
subsection shall be accepted by the Municipality as the return required of an
employee whose sole income subject to the tax under this chapter is the
qualifying wages reported by the employee's employer, agent of an employer, or
other payer, unless the Municipality requires all resident individual taxpayers
to file a tax return under Section
142.091.
   (d)   An employer, agent of an employer, or other payer is not required to
withhold Municipal income tax with respect to an individual's disqualifying
disposition of an incentive stock option if, at the time of the disqualifying
disposition, the individual is not an employee of either the corporation with
respect to whose stock the option has been issued or of such corporation's
successor entity.
   (e)   (1)   An employee is not relieved from liability for a tax by the
failure of the employer, agent of an employer, or other payer to withhold the
tax as required under this chapter or by the employer's, agent's, or other
payer's exemption from the requirement to withhold the tax.
      (2)   The failure of an employer, agent of an employer, or other payer to
remit to the Municipality the tax withheld relieves the employee from liability
for that tax unless the employee colluded with the employer, agent, or other
payer in connection with the failure to remit the tax withheld.
   (f)   Compensation deferred before June 26, 2003, is not subject to any
municipal corporation income tax or Municipal income tax withholding
requirement to the extent the deferred compensation does not constitute
qualifying wages at the time the deferred compensation is paid or distributed.
   (g)   Each employer, agent of an employer, or other payer required to
withhold taxes is liable for the payment of that amount required to be
withheld, whether or not such taxes have been withheld, and such amount shall
be deemed to be held in trust for the Municipality until such time as the
withheld amount is remitted to the Tax Administrator.
   (h)   On or before the last day of February of each year, an employer shall
file a withholding reconciliation return with the Tax Administrator listing the
names, addresses, and Social Security numbers of all employees from whose
qualifying wages tax was withheld or should have been withheld for the
Municipality during the preceding calendar year, the amount of tax withheld, if
any, from each such employee's qualifying wage, the total amount of qualifying
wages paid to such employee during the preceding calendar year, the name of
every other municipal corporation for which tax was withheld or should have
been withheld from such employee during the preceding calendar year, any other
information required for Federal income tax reporting purposes on Internal
Revenue Service form W-2 or its equivalent form with respect to such employee,
and other information as may be required by the Tax Administrator.
      (1)   In addition to the wage reporting requirements of this section, any
person required by the Internal Revenue Service to report on form 1099-Misc.
payments to individuals not treated as employees for services performed shall
also report such payments to the Municipality when the services were performed
in the Municipality. The information may be submitted on a listing, and shall
include the name, address and Social Security number (or Federal Identification
Number), and the amount of the payments made. Federal form(s) 1099 may be
submitted in lieu of such listing. The information shall be filed annually on
or before February 28 following the end of such calendar year.
   (i)   The officer or the employee of the employer, agent of an employer, or
other payer with control or direct supervision of or charged with the
responsibility for withholding the tax or filing the reports and making
payments as required by this section, shall be personally liable for a failure
to file a report or pay the tax due as required by this section. The
dissolution of an employer, agent of an employer, or other payer does not
discharge the officer's or employee's liability for a failure of the employer,
agent of an employer, or other payer to file returns or pay any tax due.
   (j)   An employer is required to deduct and withhold Municipal income tax on
tips and gratuities received by the employer's employees and constituting
qualifying wages only to the extent that the tips and gratuities are under the
employer's control. For the purposes of this subsection, a tip or gratuity is
under the employer's control if the tip or gratuity is paid by the customer to
the employer for subsequent remittance to the employee, or if the customer pays
the tip or gratuity by credit card, debit card, or other electronic means.
   (k)   A Tax Administrator shall consider any tax withheld by an employer at
the request of an employee when such tax is not otherwise required to be
withheld by this chapter to be tax required to be withheld and remitted for the
purposes of this section.

            If there is not a single municipal corporation in which the
employee spent the greatest number of days in a calendar year performing
services for or on behalf of the employer, but instead there are two or more
municipal corporations in which the employee spent an identical number of days
that is greater than the number of days the employee spent in any other
municipal corporation, the employer shall allocate any of the employee's
qualifying wages subject to paragraph (b)(1)A. hereof among those two or more
municipal corporations. The allocation shall be made using any fair and
reasonable method, including, but not limited to, an equal allocation among
such municipal corporations or an allocation based upon the time spent or sales
made by the employee in each such municipal corporation. A municipal
corporation to which qualifying wages are allocated under this paragraph shall
be the employee's "principal place of work" with respect to those qualifying
wages for the purposes of this section.
            For the purposes of this paragraph, the location at which an
employee spends a particular day shall be deemed in accordance with paragraph
(b)(2) hereof, except that "location" shall be substituted for "municipal
corporation" wherever "municipal corporation" appears in that division.
   (b)   (1)   Subject to subsections (c), (e), (f), and (g) hereof, an
employer is not required to withhold Municipal income tax on qualifying wages
paid to an employee for the performance of personal services in a municipal
corporation that imposes such a tax if the employee performed such services in

            1.   The nature of the services are such that it will require more
than twenty days of actual services to complete the services;
            2.   The agreement between the employer and its customer to perform
services at a location requires the employer to perform actual services at the
location for more than twenty days.
         C.   The employee is a resident of the Municipality and has requested
that the employer withhold tax from the employee's qualifying wages as provided
in Section 142.051.
         D.   The employee is a professional athlete, professional entertainer,
or public figure, and the qualifying wages are paid for the performance of
services in the employee's capacity as a professional athlete, professional
entertainer, or public figure within the Municipality.
      (2)   For the purposes of paragraph (b)(1) hereof, an employee shall be
considered to have spent a day performing services in a municipal corporation
only if the employee spent more time performing services for or on behalf of
the employer in that municipal corporation than in any other municipal
corporation on that day. For the purposes of determining the amount of time an
employee spent in a particular location, the time spent performing one or more
of the following activities shall be considered to have been spent at the
employee's principal place of work:
         A.   Traveling to the location at which the employee will first
perform services for the employer for the day;
         B.   Traveling from a location at which the employee was performing
services for the employer to any other location;
         C.   Traveling from any location to another location in order to pick
up or load, for the purpose of transportation or delivery, property that has
been purchased, sold, assembled, fabricated, repaired, refurbished, processed,
remanufactured, or improved by the employee's employer;
         D.   Transporting or delivering property described in paragraph (b)
(2)C. hereof, provided that, upon delivery of the property, the employee does
not temporarily or permanently affix the property to real estate owned, used,
or controlled by a person other than the employee's employer;
         E.   Traveling from the location at which the employee makes the
employee's final delivery or pick-up for the day to either the employee's
principal place of work or a location at which the employee will not perform
services for the employer.
   (c)   If the principal place of work of an employee is located in a
municipal corporation that imposes an income tax in accordance with this
chapter, the exception from withholding requirements described in paragraph (b)
(1) hereof shall apply only if, with respect to the employee's qualifying wages
described in that paragraph, the employer withholds and remits tax on such
qualifying wages to the municipal corporation in which the employee's principal
place of work is located.
   (d)   (1)   Except as provided in paragraph (d)(2) hereof, if, during a
calendar year, the number of days an employee spends performing personal
services in a municipal corporation exceeds the twenty-day threshold described
in paragraph (b)(1) hereof, the employer shall withhold and remit tax to that
municipal corporation for any subsequent days in that calendar year on which
the employer pays qualifying wages to the employee for personal services
performed in that municipal corporation.
      (2)   An employer required to begin withholding tax for a municipal
corporation under paragraph (d)(1) hereof may elect to withhold tax for that
municipal corporation for the first twenty days on which the employer paid
qualifying wages to the employee for personal services performed in that
municipal corporation.
      (3)   If an employer makes the election described in paragraph (d)(2)
hereof, the taxes withheld and paid by such an employer during those first
twenty days to the municipal corporation in which the employee's principal
place of work is located are refundable to the employee.
   (e)   Without regard to the number of days in a calendar year on which an
employee performs personal services in any municipal corporation, an employer
shall withhold Municipal income tax on all of the employee's qualifying wages
for a taxable year and remit that tax only to the municipal corporation in
which the employer's fixed location is located if the employer qualifies as a
small employer as defined in Section
142.03.  To determine whether an employer qualifies as a small employer for a
taxable year, a Tax Administrator may require the employer to provide the Tax
Administrator with the employer's Federal income tax return for the preceding
taxable year.
   (f)   Paragraph (b)(1) and subsection (d) hereof shall not apply to the
extent that a Tax Administrator and an employer enter into an agreement
regarding the manner in which the employer shall comply with the requirements
of Section
142.051.
   (g)   In the case of a person performing personal services at a petroleum
refinery located in a municipal corporation that imposes a tax on income, an
employer is not required to withhold Municipal income tax on the qualifying
wages of such a person if the person performs those services on twelve or fewer
days in a calendar year, unless the principal place of work of the employer is
located in another municipal corporation in this State that imposes a tax
applying to compensation paid to the person for services performed on those
days and the person is not liable to that other municipal corporation for tax
on the compensation paid for such services. For the purposes of this
subsection, a petroleum refinery is a facility with a standard industrial
classification code facility classification of 2911, petroleum refining.
   Notwithstanding subsection (d) hereof, if, during a calendar year, the
number of days an individual performs personal services at a petroleum refinery
exceeds twelve, the employer shall withhold tax for the municipal corporation
for the first twelve days for which the employer paid qualifying wages to the
individual and for all subsequent days in the calendar year on which the
individual performed services at the refinery.

providing the name, address, and Social Security number of the person from
whose winnings amounts were deducted and withheld, the amount of each such
deduction and withholding during the preceding calendar month, the amount of
the winnings from which each such amount was withheld, the type of casino
gaming that resulted in such winnings, and any other information required by
the Tax Administrator. With this return, the casino operator shall remit
electronically to the Municipality all amounts deducted and withheld during the
preceding month.
      (2)   Annually, on or before the thirty-first day of January, a casino

      (4)   A casino operator that fails to file a return and remit the amounts
deducted and withheld shall be personally liable for the amount withheld and
not remitted. Such personal liability extends to any penalty and interest
imposed for the late filing of a return or the late payment of tax deducted and
withheld.
      (5)   If a casino operator sells the casino facility or otherwise quits
the casino business, the amounts deducted and withheld along with any penalties
and interest thereon are immediately due and payable. The successor shall
withhold an amount of the purchase money that is sufficient to cover the
amounts deducted and withheld along with any penalties and interest thereon
until the predecessor casino operator produces either of the following:
         A.   A receipt from the Tax Administrator showing that the amounts
deducted and withheld and penalties and interest thereon have been paid;
         B.   A certificate from the Tax Administrator indicating that no
amounts are due.
               If the successor fails to withhold purchase money, the successor
is personally liable for the payment of the amounts deducted and withheld and

      (6)   The failure of a casino operator to deduct and withhold the
required amount from a person's winnings does not relieve that person from
liability for the Municipal income tax with respect to those winnings.
   (d)   If a person's prize award from a video lottery terminal is an amount
for which reporting to the Internal Revenue Service is required by section 6041
of the Internal Revenue Code, as amended, the video lottery sales agent shall

other information required by the Tax Administrator. With the return, the video
lottery sales agent shall remit electronically to the Tax Administrator all
amounts deducted and withheld during the preceding month.
      (3)   A video lottery sales agent shall maintain a record of all receipts
issued under subsection (e) hereof and shall make those records available to

      (4)   Annually, on or before the thirty-first day of January, each video
lottery terminal sales agent shall file an annual return electronically with
the Tax Administrator of the municipal corporation in which the facility is
located indicating the total amount deducted and withheld during the preceding
calendar year. The video lottery sales agent shall remit electronically with
the annual return any amount that was deducted and withheld and that was not
previously remitted. If the name, address, or Social Security number of a
person or the amount deducted and withheld with respect to that person was
omitted on a monthly return for that reporting period, that information shall
be indicated on the annual return.
      (5)   Annually, on or before the thirty-first day of January, a video
lottery sales agent shall issue an information return to each person with
respect to whom an amount has been deducted and withheld during the preceding

income tax deducted and withheld from the person's prize award by the video
lottery sales agent during the preceding year. A video lottery sales agent
shall provide to the Tax Administrator of the municipal corporation a copy of
each information return issued under this division. The Tax Administrator may
require that such copies be transmitted electronically.
      (6)   A video lottery sales agent who fails to file a return and remit
the amounts deducted and withheld is personally liable for the amount deducted

deducted and withheld.
   (f)   If a video lottery sales agent ceases to operate video lottery
terminals, the amounts deducted and withheld along with any penalties and
interest thereon are immediately due and payable. The successor of the video

deducted and withheld and penalties and interest thereon have been paid;
      (2)   A certificate from the Tax Administrator indicating that no amounts
are due.
            If the successor fails to withhold purchase money, the successor is
personally liable for the payment of the amounts deducted and withheld and
penalties and interest thereon.
   (g)   The failure of a video lottery sales agent to deduct and withhold the
required amount from a person's prize award does not relieve that person from
liability for the Municipal income tax with respect to that prize award.
   (h)   If a casino operator or lottery sales agent files a return late, fails
to file a return, remits amounts deducted and withheld late, or fails to remit
amounts deducted and withheld as required under this section, the Tax

returns required under this section.

operating loss carryforward equals Municipal taxable income.
      (1)   "Income" for a taxpayer that is not an individual means the net

telephone company that is subject to and required to file reports under Ohio
R.C. Chapter 5745.
   (a)   Net profit from a business or profession conducted both within and

do not fairly represent the extent of a taxpayer's business activity in the
Municipality, the taxpayer may request, or the Tax Administrator of the
Municipality may require, that the taxpayer use, with respect to all or any
portion of the income of the taxpayer, an alternative apportionment method
involving one or more of the following:
         A.   Separate accounting;
         B.   The exclusion of one or more of the factors;
         C.   The inclusion of one or more additional factors that would
provide for a more fair apportionment of the income of the taxpayer to the
Municipality;
         D.   A modification of one or more of the factors.
      (2)   A taxpayer request to use an alternative apportionment method shall
be in writing and shall accompany a tax return, timely filed appeal of an
assessment, or timely filed amended tax return. The taxpayer may use the
requested alternative method unless the Tax Administrator denies the request in
an assessment issued within the period prescribed by Section
142.19(a).
      (3)   A Tax Administrator may require a taxpayer to use an alternative
apportionment method as described in paragraph (b)(1) hereof only by issuing an

alternative apportionment arrangement approved by a Tax Administrator or
otherwise agreed upon by both the Tax Administrator and taxpayer before January
1, 2016.
   (c)   As used in paragraph (a)(2) hereof, wages, salaries, and other

      (2)   Any location at which a trial, appeal, hearing, investigation,
inquiry, review, court-martial, or similar administrative, judicial, or
legislative matter or proceeding is being conducted, provided that the
compensation is paid for services performed for, or on behalf of, the employer
or that the employee's presence at the location directly or indirectly benefits
the employer;
      (3)   Any other location, if the Tax Administrator determines that the
employer directed the employee to perform the services at the other location in
lieu of a location described in paragraph (c)(1) or (c)(2) hereof solely in
order to avoid or reduce the employer's Municipal income tax liability. If a
Tax Administrator makes such a determination, the employer may dispute the
determination by establishing, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the Tax
Administrator's determination was unreasonable.
   (d)   For the purposes of paragraph (a)(3) hereof, receipts from sales and
rentals made and services performed shall be sitused to a municipal corporation
as follows:
      (1)   Gross receipts from the sale of tangible personal property shall be
sitused to the municipal corporation in which the sale originated. For the
purposes of this paragraph, a sale of property originates in a municipal
corporation if, regardless of where title passes, the property meets any of the
following criteria:
         A.   The property is shipped to or delivered within the municipal
corporation from a stock of goods located within the municipal corporation.
         B.   The property is delivered within the municipal corporation from a
location outside the municipal corporation, provided the taxpayer is regularly
engaged through its own employees in the solicitation or promotion of sales
within such municipal corporation and the sales result from such solicitation
or promotion.
         C.   The property is shipped from a place within the municipal
corporation to purchasers outside the municipal corporation, provided that the
taxpayer is not, through its own employees, regularly engaged in the
solicitation or promotion of sales at the place where delivery is made.
      (2)   Gross receipts from the sale of services shall be sitused to the
municipal corporation to the extent that such services are performed in the
municipal corporation.
      (3)   To the extent included in income, gross receipts from the sale of
real property located in the municipal corporation shall be sitused to the
municipal corporation.
      (4)   To the extent included in income, gross receipts from rents and
royalties from real property located in the municipal corporation shall be
sitused to the municipal corporation.
      (5)   Gross receipts from rents and royalties from tangible personal
property shall be sitused to the municipal corporation based upon the extent to
which the tangible personal property is used in the municipal corporation.
   (e)   The net profit received by an individual taxpayer from the rental of
real estate owned directly by the individual or by a disregarded entity owned
by the individual shall be subject to tax only by the municipal corporation in
which the property generating the net profit is located and the municipal
corporation in which the individual taxpayer that receives the net profit
resides.
   A municipal corporation shall allow such taxpayers to elect to use separate
accounting for the purpose of calculating net profit sitused under this
subsection to the municipal corporation in which the property is located.
   (f)   (1)   Except as provided in paragraph (f)(2) hereof, commissions
received by a real estate agent or broker relating to the sale, purchase, or
lease of real estate shall be sitused to the municipal corporation in which the
real estate is located. Net profit reported by the real estate agent or broker
shall be allocated to a municipal corporation based upon the ratio of the
commissions the agent or broker received from the sale, purchase, or lease of
real estate located in the municipal corporation to the commissions received
from the sale, purchase, or lease of real estate everywhere in the taxable
year.
      (2)   An individual who is a resident of a municipal corporation that
imposes a Municipal income tax shall report the individual's net profit from
all real estate activity on the individual's annual tax return for that
municipal corporation. The individual may claim a credit for taxes the
individual paid on such net profit to another municipal corporation to the
extent that such credit is allowed under Section
142.081.
   (g)   If, in computing a taxpayer's adjusted Federal taxable income, the
taxpayer deducted any amount with respect to a stock option granted to an
employee, and if the employee is not required to include in the employee's
income any such amount or a portion thereof because it is exempted from
taxation under Section
142.03(c)(11)L. and (c)(33)A.4., by a municipal corporation to which the
taxpayer has apportioned a portion of its net profit, the taxpayer shall add
the amount that is exempt from taxation to the taxpayer's net profit that was
apportioned to that municipal corporation. In no case shall a taxpayer be
required to add to its net profit that was apportioned to that municipal
corporation any amount other than the amount upon which the employee would be
required to pay tax were the amount related to the stock option not exempted
from taxation.
   This subsection applies solely for the purpose of making an adjustment to
the amount of a taxpayer's net profit that was apportioned to a municipal
corporation under this section.
   (h)   When calculating the ratios described in subsection (a) hereof for the
purposes of that subsection or subsection (b) hereof, the owner of a
disregarded entity shall include in the owner's ratios the property, payroll,
and gross receipts of such disregarded entity.

file a consolidated Municipal income tax return for a taxable year if at least
one member of the affiliated group of corporations is subject to the Municipal
income tax in that taxable year and if the affiliated group of corporations
filed a consolidated Federal income tax return with respect to that taxable
year.
         A.   The election is binding for a five-year period beginning with the
first taxable year of the initial election unless a change in the reporting
method is required under Federal law.
         B.   The election continues to be binding for each subsequent five-

         C.   A taxpayer receives permission from the Tax Administrator. The
Tax Administrator shall approve such a request for good cause shown.
      (2)   An election to discontinue filing consolidated Municipal income tax
returns under this section must be made in the first year following the last
year of a five-year consolidated Municipal income tax return election period in
effect under paragraph (b)(1) hereof.  The election to discontinue filing a
consolidated Municipal income tax return is binding for a five-year period
beginning with the first taxable year of the election.
      (3)   An election made under paragraph (b)(1) or (b)(2) hereof is binding
on all members of the affiliated group of corporations subject to a Municipal
income tax.
   (c)   A taxpayer that is a member of an affiliated group of corporations
that filed a consolidated Federal income tax return for a taxable year shall
file a consolidated Municipal income tax return for that taxable year if the
Tax Administrator determines, by a preponderance of the evidence, that
intercompany transactions have not been conducted at arm's length and that
there has been a distortive shifting of income or expenses with regard to
allocation of net profits to the municipal corporation. A taxpayer that is
required to file a consolidated Municipal income tax return for a taxable year

142.03(c)(1), by substituting "consolidated Federal taxable income" for
"Federal taxable income" wherever "Federal taxable income" appears in that
paragraph and by substituting "an affiliated group of corporation's" for "a C
corporation's" wherever "a C corporation's" appears in that paragraph.
      (2)   No corporation filing a consolidated Municipal income tax return
shall make any adjustment otherwise required under Section
142.03(c)(1) to the extent that the item of income or deduction otherwise
subject to the adjustment has been eliminated or consolidated in the
computation of consolidated Federal taxable income.
      (3)   If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having at least
eighty percent of the value of its ownership interest owned or controlled,
directly or indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is included in
that affiliated group's consolidated Federal taxable income for a taxable year,
the corporation filing a consolidated Municipal income tax return shall do one
of the following with respect to that pass-through entity's net profit or loss
for that taxable year:
         A.   Exclude the pass-through entity's net profit or loss from the
consolidated Federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purpose of making the computations required in Section
142.062, exclude the property, payroll, and gross receipts of the pass-through
entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit sitused to a
municipal corporation. If the entity's net profit or loss is so excluded, the
entity shall be subject to taxation as a separate taxpayer on the basis of the
entity's net profits that would otherwise be included in the consolidated
Federal taxable income of the affiliated group.
         B.   Include the pass-through entity's net profit or loss in the
consolidated Federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purpose of making the computations required in Section
142.062, include the property, payroll, and gross receipts of the pass-through
entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit sitused to a
municipal corporation. If the entity's net profit or loss is so included, the
entity shall not be subject to taxation as a separate taxpayer on the basis of
the entity's net profits that are included in the consolidated Federal taxable
income of the affiliated group.
      (4)   If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having less than
eighty percent of the value of its ownership interest owned or controlled,
directly or indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is included in
that affiliated group's consolidated Federal taxable income for a taxable year,
all of the following shall apply:
         A.   The corporation filing the consolidated Municipal income tax
return shall exclude the pass-through entity's net profit or loss from the
consolidated Federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purposes of making the computations required in Section
142.062, exclude the property, payroll, and gross receipts of the pass-through
entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit sitused to a
municipal corporation;
         B.   The pass-through entity shall be subject to Municipal income
taxation as a separate taxpayer in accordance with this chapter on the basis of
the entity's net profits that would otherwise be included in the consolidated
Federal taxable income of the affiliated group.
   (f)   Corporations filing a consolidated Municipal income tax return shall
make the computations required under Section
142.062 by substituting "consolidated Federal taxable income attributable to"
for "net profit from" wherever "net profit from" appears in that section and by
substituting "affiliated group of corporations" for "taxpayer" wherever
"taxpayer" appears in that section.
   (g)   Each corporation filing a consolidated Municipal income tax return is
jointly and severally liable for any tax, interest, penalties, fines, charges,
or other amounts imposed by a municipal corporation in accordance with this
chapter on the corporation, an affiliated group of which the corporation is a
member for any portion of the taxable year, or any one or more members of such
an affiliated group.
   (h)   Corporations and their affiliates that made an election or entered
into an agreement with a municipal corporation before January 1, 2016, to file
a consolidated or combined tax return with such municipal corporation may

   The Municipality, by ordinance, may grant a refundable or nonrefundable
credit against its tax on income to a taxpayer to foster job creation in the
Municipality. If a credit is granted under this section, it shall be measured

employees of the taxpayer and shall be for a term not exceeding fifteen years.
Before the Municipality passes an ordinance granting a credit, the Municipality
and the taxpayer shall enter into an agreement specifying all the conditions of

not exceeding fifteen years. Before the Municipality passes an ordinance
allowing such a credit, the Municipality and the taxpayer shall enter into an
agreement specifying all the conditions of the credit.

      (2)   "Tax liability" means the total taxes due to a municipal
corporation for the taxable year, after allowing any credit to which the

the current taxable year, on the form prescribed by the Tax Administrator, if
the amount payable as estimated taxes is at least two hundred dollars
($200.00). For the purposes of this section:
         A.   Taxes withheld from qualifying wages shall be considered as paid
to the municipal corporation for which the taxes were withheld in equal amounts
on each payment date. If the taxpayer establishes the dates on which all
amounts were actually withheld, the amounts withheld shall be considered as
paid on the dates on which the amounts were actually withheld.
         B.   An overpayment of tax applied as a credit to a subsequent taxable
year is deemed to be paid on the date of the postmark stamped on the cover in
which the payment is mailed or, if the payment is made by electronic funds
transfer, the date the payment is submitted. As used in this subsection, "date
of the postmark" means, in the event there is more than one date on the cover,
the earliest date imprinted on the cover by the postal service.

taxable year after the taxpayer becomes subject to tax for the first time.
      (4)   Taxpayers reporting on a fiscal year basis shall file a declaration
on or before the fifteenth day of the fourth month after the beginning of each
fiscal year or period.
      (5)   The original declaration or any subsequent amendment may be
increased or decreased on or before any subsequent quarterly payment day as
provided in this section.
   (c)   (1)   The required portion of the tax liability for the taxable year
that shall be paid through estimated taxes made payable to the Municipality or
Tax Administrator, including the application of tax refunds to estimated taxes
and withholding on or before the applicable payment date, shall be as follows:
         A.   On or before the fifteenth day of the fourth month after the
beginning of the taxable year, twenty-two and one-half percent of the tax
liability for the taxable year;
         B.   On or before the fifteenth day of the sixth month after the
beginning of the taxable year, forty-five percent of the tax liability for the
taxable year;
         C.   On or before the fifteenth day of the ninth month after the
beginning of the taxable year, sixty-seven and one-half percent of the tax
liability for the taxable year;
         D.   On or before the fifteenth day of the twelfth month of the
taxable year, ninety percent of the tax liability for the taxable year.
      (2)   A taxpayer may amend a declaration under rules prescribed by the
Tax Administrator. When an amended declaration has been filed, the unpaid
balance shown due on the amended declaration shall be paid in equal
installments on or before the remaining payment dates. The amended declaration
must be filed on the next applicable due date as outlined in paragraphs (c)
(1)A. through D. hereof.
      (3)   On or before the fifteenth day of the fourth month of the year
following that for which the declaration or amended declaration was filed, an
annual return shall be filed and any balance which may be due shall be paid
with the return in accordance with Section
142.091.
         A.   For taxpayers who are individuals, or who are not individuals and
are reporting and filing on a calendar year basis, the annual tax return is due
on the same date as the filing of the Federal tax return, unless extended
pursuant to division (G) of Ohio R.C. 5747.08.
         B.   For taxpayers who are not individuals, and are reporting and
filing on a fiscal year basis or any period other than a calendar year, the
annual return is due on the fifteenth day of the fourth month following the end
of the taxable year or period.
      (4)   An amended declaration is required whenever the taxpayer's
estimated tax liability changes during the taxable year. A change in estimated
tax liability may either increase or decrease the estimated tax liability for
the taxable year.
   (d)   (1)   In the case of any underpayment of any portion of a tax
liability, penalty and interest may be imposed pursuant to Section
142.10 upon the amount of underpayment for the period of underpayment, unless
the underpayment is due to reasonable cause as described in subsection (e)
hereof.  The amount of the underpayment shall be determined as follows:
         A.   For the first payment of estimated taxes each year, twenty-two
and one-half percent of the tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by the

percent of the tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by the date
prescribed for that payment.
      (2)   The period of the underpayment shall run from the day the estimated
payment was required to be made to the date on which the payment is made. For
purposes of this section, a payment of estimated taxes on or before any payment
date shall be considered a payment of any previous underpayment only to the
extent the payment of estimated taxes exceeds the amount of the payment
presently required to be paid to avoid any penalty.
   (e)   An underpayment of any portion of tax liability determined under
subsection (d) hereof shall be due to reasonable cause and the penalty imposed
by this section shall not be added to the taxes for the taxable year if any of
the following apply:
      (1)   The amount of estimated taxes that were paid equals at least ninety
percent of the tax liability for the current taxable year, determined by
annualizing the income received during the year up to the end of the month
immediately preceding the month in which the payment is due.
      (2)   The amount of estimated taxes that were paid equals at least 100
percent of the tax liability shown on the return of the taxpayer for the
preceding taxable year, provided that the immediately preceding taxable year
reflected a period of twelve months and the taxpayer filed a return with the
municipal corporation under Section
142.091 for that year.
      (3)   The taxpayer is an individual who resides in the Municipality but
was not domiciled there on the first day of January of the calendar year that
includes the first day of the taxable year.
   (f)   A Tax Administrator may waive the requirement for filing a declaration
of estimated taxes for any class of taxpayers after finding that the waiver is
reasonable and proper in view of administrative costs and other factors.

142.08   CREDIT FOR TAX PAID.
142.081   CREDIT FOR TAX PAID TO ANOTHER MUNICIPALITY OR JOINT ECONOMIC
DEVELOPMENT DISTRICT.
   (a)   Where a resident of the Municipality is subject to a municipal income
tax in another municipality as well as in this City, he or she shall not pay a
total Municipal income tax on the same income greater than the tax imposed at
the higher rate to which he is subject.
   (b)   Every individual taxpayer who resides in the Municipality who receives
net profits, salaries, wages, commissions or other personal service
compensation for work done or services performed or rendered outside of the
Municipality, and who is liable and has paid to another municipality an income
tax on the same income taxable and taxed under this chapter, shall be allowed a
credit against the tax imposed by this chapter (on the same income to the
extent such income is taxed under this chapter) of the amount so paid by him or
her or on his or her behalf to such other municipality. The credit shall not
exceed the tax imposed by this chapter on such income earned in such other
municipality or municipalities where such tax is paid. The taxpayer must
provide proof of tax paid to another municipality.
   (c)   The Municipality shall grant a credit against the tax imposed by this
chapter to every taxpayer who works in a joint economic development zone
created under Ohio R.C. 715.691 or a joint economic development district
created under Ohio R.C. 715.70, 715.71, or 715.72. The credit shall not exceed
the tax assessed by this chapter on such income earned in such joint economic
development zone or joint economic development district where such tax is paid.
   (d)   A claim for refund or credit under this section shall be made in such
manner as the Tax Administrator may by regulation provide.
(Ord. A-2833.  Passed 10-26-15.)
142.082   REFUNDABLE CREDIT FOR QUALIFYING LOSS.
   (a)   As used in this section:
      (1)   "Nonqualified deferred compensation plan" means a compensation plan
described in section 3121(v)(2)(C) of the Internal Revenue Code.
      (2)   A.   Except as provided in paragraph (a)(2)B. hereof, "qualifying
loss" means the excess, if any, of the total amount of compensation the payment
of which is deferred pursuant to a nonqualified deferred compensation plan over
the total amount of income the taxpayer has recognized for Federal income tax
purposes for all taxable years on a cumulative basis as compensation with
respect to the taxpayer's receipt of money and property attributable to
distributions in connection with the nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
         B.   If, for one or more taxable years, the taxpayer has not paid to
one or more municipal corporations income tax imposed on the entire amount of
compensation the payment of which is deferred pursuant to a nonqualified
deferred compensation plan, then the "qualifying loss" is the product of the
amount resulting from the calculation described in paragraph (a)(2)A. hereof
computed without regard to paragraph (a)(2)B. hereof and a fraction the
numerator of which is the portion of such compensation on which the taxpayer
has paid income tax to one or more municipal corporations and the denominator
of which is the total amount of compensation the payment of which is deferred
pursuant to a nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
         C.   With respect to a nonqualified deferred compensation plan, the
taxpayer sustains a qualifying loss only in the taxable year in which the
taxpayer receives the final distribution of money and property pursuant to that
nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
      (3)   "Qualifying tax rate" means the applicable tax rate for the taxable
year for which the taxpayer paid income tax to a municipal corporation with
respect to any portion of the total amount of compensation the payment of which
is deferred pursuant to a nonqualified deferred compensation plan. If different
tax rates applied for different taxable years, then the "qualifying tax rate"
is a weighted average of those different tax rates. The weighted average shall
be based upon the tax paid to the municipal corporation each year with respect
to the nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
   (b)   (1)   Except as provided in subsection (d) hereof, a refundable credit
shall be allowed against the income tax imposed by a municipal corporation for
each qualifying loss sustained by a taxpayer during the taxable year. The
amount of the credit shall be equal to the product of the qualifying loss and
the qualifying tax rate.
      (2)   A taxpayer shall claim the credit allowed under this section from
each municipal corporation to which the taxpayer paid Municipal income tax with
respect to the nonqualified deferred compensation plan in one or more taxable
years.
      (3)   If a taxpayer has paid tax to more than one municipal corporation
with respect to the nonqualified deferred compensation plan, the amount of the
credit that a taxpayer may claim from each municipal corporation shall be
calculated on the basis of each municipal corporation's proportionate share of
the total municipal corporation income tax paid by the taxpayer to all
municipal corporations with respect to the nonqualified deferred compensation
plan.
      (4)   In no case shall the amount of the credit allowed under this
section exceed the cumulative income tax that a taxpayer has paid to a
municipal corporation for all taxable years with respect to the nonqualified
deferred compensation plan.
   (c)   (1)   For purposes of this section, municipal corporation income tax
that has been withheld with respect to a nonqualified deferred compensation
plan shall be considered to have been paid by the taxpayer with respect to the
nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
      (2)   Any Municipal income tax that has been refunded or otherwise
credited for the benefit of the taxpayer with respect to a nonqualified
deferred compensation plan shall not be considered to have been paid to the
municipal corporation by the taxpayer.
   (d)   The credit allowed under this section is allowed only to the extent
the taxpayer's qualifying loss is attributable to:
      (1)   The insolvency or bankruptcy of the employer who had established
the nonqualified deferred compensation plan; or
      (2)   The employee's failure or inability to satisfy all of the
employer's terms and conditions necessary to receive the nonqualified deferred
compensation.
(Ord. A-2833.  Passed 10-26-15.)
142.083   CREDIT FOR PERSON WORKING IN JOINT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT DISTRICT OR
ZONE.
   A municipality shall grant a credit against its tax on income to a resident
of the Municipality who works in a joint economic development zone created
under Ohio R.C. 715.691 or a joint economic development district created under
Ohio R.C. 715.70, 715.71, or 715.72 to the same extent that it grants a credit
against its tax on income to its residents who are employed in another
municipal corporation, pursuant to Section
142.081.
(Ord. A-2833.  Passed 10-26-15.)
142.084   CREDIT FOR TAX BEYOND STATUTE FOR OBTAINING REFUND.
   (a)   Income tax that has been deposited or paid to the Municipality, but
should have been deposited or paid to another municipal corporation, is
allowable by the Municipality as a refund, but is subject to the three-year
limitation on refunds as provided in Section
142.096.
   (b)   Income tax that should have been deposited or paid to the
Municipality, but was deposited or paid to another municipal corporation, shall
be subject to collection and recovery by the Municipality. To the extent a
refund of such tax or withholding is barred by the limitation on refunds as
provided in Section 142.096, the Municipality will allow a non-refundable
credit equal to the tax or withholding paid to the other municipality against
the income tax the Municipality claims is due. If the Municipality's tax rate
is higher, the tax representing the net difference of the tax rates is also
subject to collection by the Municipality, along with any penalty and interest
accruing during the period of nonpayment.
   (c)   No carryforward of credit will be permitted when the overpayment is
beyond the three-year limitation for refunding of same as provided in Section
142.096.
   (d)   Nothing in this section requires a municipality to allow credit for
tax paid to another municipal corporation if the municipality has reduced
credit for tax paid to another municipal corporation.  Section
142.081 regarding any limitation on credit shall prevail.

   (a)   (1)   An annual return with respect to the income tax levied on
Municipal taxable income by the Municipality shall be completed and filed by
every taxpayer for any taxable year for which the taxpayer is subject to the

      (2)   The Tax Administrator shall accept on behalf of all nonresident
individual taxpayers a return filed by an employer, agent of an employer, or
other payer located in the Municipality under Section 142.051(c) when the
nonresident individual taxpayer's sole income subject to the tax is the
qualifying wages reported by the employer, agent of an employer, or other
payer, and no additional tax is due to the Municipality.
      (3)   All resident individual taxpayers, eighteen years of age and older,
shall file an annual Municipal income tax return with the Municipality,
regardless of income or liability. The Tax Administrator shall have the
authority to provide, by regulation, that retired and permanently disabled
individuals without income and individuals under eighteen years of age may be
exempt from this section.
   (b)   If an individual is deceased, any return or notice required of that
individual shall be completed and filed by that decedent's executor,
administrator, or other person charged with the property of that decedent.
   (c)   If an individual is unable to complete and file a return or notice
required by the Municipality in accordance with this chapter, the return or
notice required of that individual shall be completed and filed by the
individual's duly authorized agent, guardian, conservator, fiduciary, or other
person charged with the care of the person or property of that individual. Such
duly authorized agent, guardian, conservator, fiduciary, or other person
charged with the care of the person or property of that individual shall
provide, with the filing of the return, appropriate documentation to support
that they are authorized to file a return or notice on behalf of the taxpayer.
This notice shall include any legally binding authorizations, and contact
information including name, address, and phone number of the duly authorized
agent, guardian, conservator, fiduciary, or other person.
   (d)   Returns or notices required of an estate or a trust shall be completed

of any of the foregoing to the Tax Administrator unless the Tax Administrator
requests such copies after the return has been filed.
      (3)   A taxpayer that is not an individual is required to include, with
each annual net profit return, amended net profit return, or request for refund
required under this section, copies of only the following documents: the
taxpayer's Internal Revenue Service form 1041, form 1065, form 1120, form 1120-
REIT, form 1120F, or form 1120S, and, with respect to an amended tax return or
refund request, any other documentation necessary to support the refund request
or the adjustments made in the amended return.
      (4)   A taxpayer that is not an individual and that files an annual net
profit return electronically through the Ohio Business Gateway or in some other
manner shall either mail the documents required under this subsection to the
Tax Administrator at the time of filing or, if electronic submission is
available, submit the documents electronically through the Ohio Business
Gateway or a portal provided by Municipality. The Department of Taxation shall
publish a method of electronically submitting the documents required under this
subsection through the Ohio Business Gateway on or before January 1, 2016. The
Department shall transmit all documents submitted electronically under this
subsection to the appropriate Tax Administrator.
      (5)   After a taxpayer files a tax return, the Tax Administrator shall
request, and the taxpayer shall provide, any information, statements, or
documents required by the Municipality to determine and verify the taxpayer's
Municipal income tax liability. The requirements imposed under subsection (f)
hereof apply regardless of whether the taxpayer files on a generic form or on a
form prescribed by the Tax Administrator.
      (6)   Any other documentation, including schedules, other municipal
income tax returns, or other supporting documentation necessary to verify
credits, income, losses, or other pertinent factors on the return shall also be
included to avoid delay in processing, or disallowance by the Tax Administrator
of undocumented credits or losses.
   (g)   (1)   A.   Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, each
individual income tax return required to be filed under this section shall be
completed and filed as required by the Tax Administrator on or before the date
prescribed for the filing of State individual income tax returns under division

notice on forms prescribed by the Tax Administrator or on generic forms,
together with remittance made payable to the Municipality.
         B.   Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, each annual net
profit income tax return required to be filed under this section by a taxpayer

Administrator on or before the fifteenth day of the fourth month following the
end of the taxpayer's taxable year or period. The taxpayer shall complete and
file the return or notice on forms prescribed by the Tax Administrator or on
generic forms, together with remittance made payable to the Municipality or Tax
Administrator.
         C.   In the case of individual income tax return required to be filed
by an individual, and net profit income tax return required to be filed by a
taxpayer who is not an individual, no remittance is required if the amount
shown to be due is ten dollars ($10.00) or less.
      (2)   If the Tax Administrator considers it necessary in order to ensure
the payment of the tax imposed by the Municipality in accordance with this
chapter, the Tax Administrator may require taxpayers to file returns and make
payments otherwise than as provided in this section, including taxpayers not
otherwise required to file annual returns.
      (3)   With respect to taxpayers to whom Section
142.092 applies, to the extent that any provision in this subsection conflicts
with any provision in Section
142.092, the provision in Section
142.092 prevails.
   (h)   (1)   For taxable years beginning after 2015, the Municipality shall
not require a taxpayer to remit tax with respect to net profits if the amount
due is ten dollars ($10.00) or less.
      (2)   Any taxpayer not required to remit tax to the Municipality for a
taxable year pursuant to paragraph (h)(1) hereof shall file with the
Municipality an annual net profit return under paragraph (f)(3) and (f)(4)
hereof.
   (i)   (1)   If any report, claim, statement, or other document required to
be filed, or any payment required to be made, within a prescribed period or on
or before a prescribed date under this chapter is delivered after that period
or that to the Tax Administrator or other municipal official with which the
report, claim, statement, or other document is required to be filed, or to
which the payment is required to be made, the date of the postmark stamped on
the cover in which the report, claim, statement, or other document, or payment
is mailed shall be deemed to be the date of delivery or the date of payment.
"The date of postmark" means, in the event there is more than one date on the
cover, the earliest date imprinted on the cover by the postal service.
      (2)   If a payment under this chapter is made by electronic funds
transfer, the payment shall be considered to be made on the date of the
timestamp assigned by the first electronic system receiving that payment.
   (j)   The amounts withheld for the Municipality by an employer, the agent of
an employer, or other payer as described in Section
142.051 shall be allowed to the recipient of the compensation as credits
against payment of the tax imposed on the recipient unless the amounts withheld
were not remitted to the Municipality and the recipient colluded with the
employer, agent, or other payer in connection with the failure to remit the
amounts withheld.
   (k)   Each return required by the Municipality to be filed in accordance
with this section shall include a box that the taxpayer may check to authorize
another person, including a tax return preparer who prepared the return, to
communicate with the Tax Administrator about matters pertaining to the return.
The return or instructions accompanying the return shall indicate that by
checking the box the taxpayer authorizes the Tax Administrator to contact the
preparer or other person concerning questions that arise during the examination
or other review of the return and authorizes the preparer or other person only
to provide the Tax Administrator with information that is missing from the
return, to contact the Tax Administrator for information about the examination
or other review of the return or the status of the taxpayer's refund or
payments, and to respond to notices about mathematical errors, offsets, or
return preparation that the taxpayer has received from the Tax Administrator
and has shown to the preparer or other person. Authorization by the taxpayer of
another person to communicate with the Tax Administrator about matters
pertaining to the return does not preclude the Tax Administrator from
contacting the taxpayer regarding such matters.
   (l)   The Tax Administrator of the Municipality shall accept for filing a
generic form of any income tax return, report, or document required by the
Municipality in accordance with this chapter, provided that the generic form,
once completed and filed, contains all of the information required by
ordinances, resolutions, or rules adopted by the Municipality or Tax
Administrator, and provided that the taxpayer or tax return preparer filing the
generic form otherwise complies with the provisions of this chapter and of the
Municipality's ordinance or resolution governing the filing of returns,
reports, or documents.
   (m)   When income tax returns, reports, or other documents require the
signature of a tax return preparer, the Tax Administrator shall accept a
facsimile of such a signature in lieu of a manual signature.
   (n)   (1)   As used in this subsection, "worksite location" has the same
meaning as in Section
142.052.
      (2)   A person may notify a Tax Administrator that the person does not
expect to be a taxpayer with respect to the municipal corporation for a taxable
year if both of the following conditions apply:
         A.   The person was required to file a tax return with the municipal
corporation for the immediately preceding taxable year because the person
performed services at a worksite location within the municipal corporation, and
the person has filed all appropriate and required returns and remitted all
applicable income tax and withholding payments as provided by this chapter. The
Tax Administrator is not required to accept an affidavit from a taxpayer who
has not complied with the provisions of this chapter.
         B.   The person no longer provides services in the municipal
corporation, and does not expect to be subject to the municipal corporation's
income tax for the taxable year.
               The person shall provide the notice in a signed affidavit that
briefly explains the person's circumstances, including the location of the
previous worksite location and the last date on which the person performed
services or made any sales within the municipal corporation. The affidavit also
shall include the following statement: "The affiant has no plans to perform any
services within the municipal corporation, make any sales in the municipal
corporation, or otherwise become subject to the tax levied by the municipal
corporation during the taxable year. If the affiant does become subject to the
tax levied by the municipal corporation for the taxable year, the affiant
agrees to be considered a taxpayer and to properly register as a taxpayer with
the municipal corporation, if such a registration is required by the municipal
corporation's resolutions, ordinances, or rules." The person shall sign the
affidavit under penalty of perjury.
         C.   If a person submits an affidavit described in paragraph (n)(2)
hereof, the Tax Administrator shall not require the person to file any tax
return for the taxable year unless the Tax Administrator possesses information
that conflicts with the affidavit or if the circumstances described in the
affidavit change, or the taxpayer has engaged in activity which results in work
being performed, services provided, sales made, or other activity that results
in Municipal taxable income reportable to the Municipality in the taxable year.
It shall be the responsibility of the taxpayer to comply with the provisions of
this chapter relating to the reporting and filing of Municipal taxable income
on an annual Municipal income tax return, even if an affidavit has been filed
with the Tax Administrator for the taxable year. Nothing in subsection (n)
hereof prohibits the Tax Administrator from performing an audit of the person.

142.092   RETURN AND PAYMENT OF TAX; INDIVIDUALS SERVING IN COMBAT ZONE.
   (a)   Each member of the national guard of any state and each member of a
reserve component of the Armed Forces of the United States called to active
duty pursuant to an executive order issued by the President of the United
States or an act of the Congress of the United States, and each civilian
serving as support personnel in a combat zone or contingency operation in
support of the Armed Forces, may apply to the Tax Administrator of the
Municipality for both an extension of time for filing of the return and an
extension of time for payment of taxes required by the Municipality in
accordance with this chapter during the period of the member's or civilian's
duty service and for 180 days thereafter. The application shall be filed on or
before the 180th day after the member's or civilian's duty terminates. An
applicant shall provide such evidence as the Tax Administrator considers
necessary to demonstrate eligibility for the extension.
   (b)   (1)   If the Tax Administrator ascertains that an applicant is
qualified for an extension under this section, the Tax Administrator shall
enter into a contract with the applicant for the payment of the tax in
installments that begin on the 181st day after the applicant's active duty or
service terminates. Except as provided in paragraph (b)(3) hereof, the Tax
Administrator may prescribe such contract terms as the Tax Administrator
considers appropriate.
      (2)   If the Tax Administrator ascertains that an applicant is qualified
for an extension under this section, the applicant shall neither be required to
file any return, report, or other tax document nor be required to pay any tax
otherwise due to the Municipality before the 181st day after the applicant's
active duty or service terminates.
      (3)   Taxes paid pursuant to a contract entered into under paragraph (b)
(1) hereof are not delinquent. The Tax Administrator shall not require any
payments of penalties or interest in connection with those taxes for the
extension period.
   (c)   (1)   Nothing in this subsection denies to any person described in
this subsection the application of subsections (a) and (a) hereof.
      (2)   A.   A qualifying taxpayer who is eligible for an extension under
the Internal Revenue Code shall receive both an extension of time in which to
file any return, report, or other tax document and an extension of time in
which to make any payment of taxes required by the Municipality in accordance
with this chapter. The length of any extension granted under paragraph (c)(2)A.
hereof shall be equal to the length of the corresponding extension that the
taxpayer receives under the Internal Revenue Code. As used in this section,
"qualifying taxpayer" means a member of the national guard or a member of a
reserve component of the Armed Forces of the United States called to active
duty pursuant to either an executive order issued by the President of the
United States or an act of the Congress of the United States, or a civilian
serving as support personnel in a combat zone or contingency operation in
support of the Armed Forces.
         B.   Taxes the payment of which is extended in accordance with
paragraph (c)(2)A. hereof are not delinquent during the extension period. Such
taxes become delinquent on the first day after the expiration of the extension
period if the taxes are not paid prior to that date. The Tax Administrator
shall not require any payment of penalties or interest in connection with those
taxes for the extension period. The Tax Administrator shall not include any
period of extension granted under paragraph (c)(2)A. hereof in calculating the
penalty or interest due on any unpaid tax.
   (d)   For each taxable year to which subsection (a), (b), or (c) hereof
applies to a taxpayer, the provisions of paragraphs (b)(2) and (b)(3) or
subsection (c) hereof, as applicable, apply to the spouse of that taxpayer if
the filing status of the spouse and the taxpayer is married filing jointly for
that year.
(Ord. A-2833.  Passed 10-26-15.)
142.093   USE OF OHIO BUSINESS GATEWAY; TYPES OF FILINGS AUTHORIZED.
   (a)   Any taxpayer subject to Municipal income taxation with respect to the
taxpayer's net profit from a business or profession may file any Municipal
income tax return or, estimated Municipal income tax return, or extension for
filing a Municipal income tax return, and may make payment of amounts shown to
be due on such returns, by using the Ohio Business Gateway.
   (b)   Any employer, agent of an employer, or other payer may report the
amount of Municipal income tax withheld from qualifying wages, and may make
remittance of such amounts, by using the Ohio Business Gateway.
   (c)   Nothing in this section affects the due dates for filing employer
withholding tax returns or deposit of any required tax.
   (d)   The use of the Ohio Business Gateway by municipal corporations,
taxpayers, or other persons does not affect the legal rights of municipalities
or taxpayers as otherwise permitted by law. The State of Ohio shall not be a
party to the administration of Municipal income taxes or to an appeal of a
Municipal income tax matter, except as otherwise specifically provided by law.
   (e)   Nothing in this section shall be construed as limiting or removing the
authority of any municipal corporation to administer, audit, and enforce the
provisions of its Municipal income tax.
(Ord. A-2833.  Passed 10-26-15.)
142.094   EXTENSION OF TIME TO FILE.
   (a)   Any taxpayer that has duly requested an automatic six-month extension
for filing the taxpayer's Federal income tax return shall automatically receive
an extension for the filing of a Municipal income tax return. The extended due
date of the Municipal income tax return shall be the fifteenth day of the tenth
month after the last day of the taxable year to which the return relates.
   (b)   Any taxpayer that qualifies for an automatic Federal extension for a
period other than six months for filing the taxpayer's Federal income tax
return shall automatically receive an extension for the filing of a Municipal
income tax return. The extended due date of the Municipal income tax return
shall be the same as that of the extended Federal income tax return.
   (c)   A taxpayer that has not requested or received a six-month extension
for filing the taxpayer's Federal income tax return may request that the Tax
Administrator grant the taxpayer a six-month extension of the date for filing
the taxpayer's Municipal income tax return. If the request is received by the
Tax Administrator on or before the date the Municipal income tax return is due,
the Tax Administrator shall grant the taxpayer's requested extension.
   (d)   An extension of time to file under this chapter is not an extension of
the time to pay any tax due unless the Tax Administrator grants an extension of
that date.
   (e)   If the State Tax Commissioner extends for all taxpayers the date for
filing State income tax returns under division (G) of Ohio R.C. 5747.08, a
taxpayer shall automatically receive an extension for the filing of a Municipal
income tax return. The extended due date of the Municipal income tax return
shall be the same as the extended due date of the State income tax return.
(Ord. A-2833.  Passed 10-26-15.)
142.095   AMENDED RETURNS.
   (a)   (1)   A taxpayer shall file an amended return with the Tax
Administrator in such form as the Tax Administrator requires if any of the
facts, figures, computations, or attachments required in the taxpayer's annual
return to determine the tax due levied by the Municipality in accordance with
this chapter must be altered.
      (2)   Within sixty days after the final determination of any Federal or
State tax liability affecting the taxpayer's municipal tax liability, that
taxpayer shall make and file an amended municipal return showing income subject
to the Municipal income tax based upon such final determination of Federal or
State tax liability, and pay any additional Municipal income tax shown due
thereon or make a claim for refund of any overpayment, unless the tax or
overpayment is ten dollars ($10.00) or less.
      (3)   If a taxpayer intends to file an amended consolidated Municipal
income tax return, or to amend its type of return from a separate return to a
consolidated return, based on the taxpayer's consolidated Federal income tax
return, the taxpayer shall notify the Tax Administrator before filing the
amended return.
   (b)   (1)   In the case of an underpayment, the amended return shall be
accompanied by payment of any combined additional tax due together with any
penalty and interest thereon. If the combined tax shown to be due is ten
dollars ($10.00) or less, such amount need not accompany the amended return.
Except as provided under paragraph (b)(2) hereof, the amended return shall not
reopen those facts, figures, computations, or attachments from a previously
filed return that are not affected, either directly or indirectly, by the
adjustment to the taxpayer's Federal or State income tax return unless the
applicable statute of limitations for civil actions or prosecutions under
Section
142.19 has not expired for a previously filed return.
      (2)   The additional tax to be paid shall not exceed the amount of tax
that would be due if all facts, figures, computations, and attachments were
reopened.
   (c)   (1)   In the case of an overpayment, a request for refund may be filed
under this subsection within the period prescribed by Section

period prescribed in that paragraph if it otherwise conforms to the
requirements of that paragraph.  If the amount of the refund is ten dollars
($10.00) or less, no refund need be paid by the Municipality to the taxpayer.
Except as set forth in paragraph (c)(2) hereof, a request filed under this
subsection shall claim refund of overpayments resulting from alterations to
only those facts, figures, computations, or attachments required in the
taxpayer's annual return that are affected, either directly or indirectly, by
the adjustment to the taxpayer's Federal or State income tax return unless it
is also filed within the time prescribed in Section 142.096.  Except as set
forth in subsection (c)(2) hereof, the request shall not reopen those facts,
figures, computations, or attachments that are not affected, either directly or
indirectly, by the adjustment to the taxpayer's Federal or State income tax
return.
      (2)   The amount to be refunded shall not exceed the amount of refund
that would be due if all facts, figures, computations, and attachments were
reopened.
(Ord. A-2833.  Passed 10-26-15.)
142.096   REFUNDS.
   (a)   Upon receipt of a request for a refund, the Tax Administrator of the
Municipality, in accordance with this section, shall refund to employers,
agents of employers, other payers, or taxpayers, with respect to any income or
withholding tax levied by the Municipality:
      (1)   Overpayments of more than ten dollars ($10.00);
      (2)   Amounts paid erroneously if the refund requested exceeds ten
dollars ($10.00).
   (b)   (1)   Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, returns setting
forth a request for refund shall be filed with the Tax Administrator, within
three years after the tax was due or paid, whichever is later. Any
documentation that substantiates the taxpayer's claim for a refund must be
included with the return filing. Failure to remit all documentation, including
schedules, other Municipal income tax returns, or other supporting
documentation necessary to verify credits, income, losses or other pertinent
factors on the return will cause delay in processing, and/or disallowance of
undocumented credits or losses.
      (2)   On filing of the refund request, the Tax Administrator shall
determine the amount of refund due and certify such amount to the appropriate
municipal corporation official for payment. Except as provided in paragraph (b)
(3) hereof, the Administrator shall issue an assessment to any taxpayer whose
request for refund is fully or partially denied. The assessment shall state the
amount of the refund that was denied, the reasons for the denial, and
instructions for appealing the assessment.
      (3)   If a Tax Administrator denies in whole or in part a refund request
included within the taxpayer's originally filed annual income tax return, the
Tax Administrator shall notify the taxpayer, in writing, of the amount of the
refund that was denied, the reasons for the denial, and instructions for
requesting an assessment that may be appealed under Section
142.18.
   (c)   A request for a refund that is received after the last day for filing
specified in subsection (b) hereof shall be considered to have been filed in a
timely manner if any of the following situations exist:
      (1)   The request is delivered by the postal service, and the earliest
postal service postmark on the cover in which the request is enclosed is not
later than the last day for filing the request.
      (2)   The request is delivered by the postal service, the only postmark
on the cover in which the request is enclosed was affixed by a private postal
meter, the date of that postmark is not later than the last day for filing the
request, and the request is received within seven days of such last day.
      (3)   The request is delivered by the postal service, no postmark date
was affixed to the cover in which the request is enclosed or the date of the
postmark so affixed is not legible, and the request is received within seven
days of the last day for making the request.
   (d)   Interest shall be allowed and paid on any overpayment by a taxpayer of
any Municipal income tax obligation from the date of the overpayment until the
date of the refund of the overpayment, except that if any overpayment is
refunded within ninety days after the final filing date of the annual return or
ninety days after the completed return is filed, whichever is later, no
interest shall be allowed on the refund. For the purpose of computing the
payment of interest on amounts overpaid, no amount of tax for any taxable year
shall be considered to have been paid before the date on which the return on
which the tax is reported is due, without regard to any extension of time for
filing that return. Interest shall be paid at the interest rate described in
Section
142.10(a)(4).

described in subsection (a) of this section", per annum, on all unpaid income
tax, unpaid estimated income tax, and unpaid withholding tax. This imposition
of interest shall be assessed per month, or fraction of a month.
      (2)   With respect to unpaid income tax and unpaid estimated income tax,
a penalty equal to fifteen percent of the amount not timely paid shall be
imposed.
      (3)   With respect to any unpaid withholding tax, a penalty equal to
fifty percent of the amount not timely paid shall be imposed.
      (4)   With respect to returns other than estimated income tax returns,
the Municipality shall impose a monthly penalty of twenty-five dollars ($25.00)
for each failure to timely file each return, regardless of the liability shown
thereon for each month, or any fraction thereof, during which the return
remains unfiled regardless of the liability shown thereon. The penalty shall
not exceed a total of one hundred fifty dollars ($150.00) in assessed penalty
for each failure to timely file a return.
   (d)   With respect to income taxes, estimated income taxes, withholding
taxes, and returns, the Municipality shall not impose, seek to collect, or
collect any penalty, amount of interest, charges or additional fees not
described in this section.
   (e)   With respect to income taxes, estimated income taxes, withholding
taxes, and returns, the Municipality shall not refund or credit any penalty,
amount of interest, charges, or additional fees that were properly imposed or
collected before January 1, 2016.
   (f)   The Tax Administrator may, in the Tax Administrator's sole discretion,
abate or partially abate penalties or interest imposed under this section when
the Tax Administrator deems such abatement or partial abatement to be
appropriate.  Such abatement or partial abatement shall be properly documented
and maintained on the record of the taxpayer who received benefit of such
abatement or partial abatement.
   (g)   The Municipality may impose on the taxpayer, employer, any agent of
the employer, or any other payer the Municipality's post-judgment collection

142.11   AUDIT.
   (a)   At or before the commencement of an audit, as defined in Section
142.03(c)(3), the Tax Administrator shall provide to the taxpayer a written
description of the roles of the Tax Administrator and of the taxpayer during an
audit and a statement of the taxpayer's rights, including any right to obtain a
refund of an overpayment of tax. At or before the commencement of an audit, the
Tax Administrator shall inform the taxpayer when the audit is considered to
have commenced.
   (b)   Except in cases involving suspected criminal activity, the Tax
Administrator shall conduct an audit of a taxpayer during regular business
hours and after providing reasonable notice to the taxpayer. A taxpayer who is
unable to comply with a proposed time for an audit on the grounds that the
proposed time would cause inconvenience or hardship must offer reasonable
alternative dates for the audit.
   (c)   At all stages of an audit by the Tax Administrator, a taxpayer is
entitled to be assisted or represented by an attorney, accountant, bookkeeper,
or other tax practitioner. The Tax Administrator shall prescribe a form by
which a taxpayer may designate such a person to assist or represent the
taxpayer in the conduct of any proceedings resulting from actions by the Tax
Administrator. If a taxpayer has not submitted such a form, the Tax
Administrator may accept other evidence, as the Tax Administrator considers
appropriate, that a person is the authorized representative of a taxpayer.
   A taxpayer may refuse to answer any questions asked by the person conducting
an audit until the taxpayer has an opportunity to consult with the taxpayer's
attorney, accountant, bookkeeper, or other tax practitioner. This division does
not authorize the practice of law by a person who is not an attorney.
   (d)   A taxpayer may record, electronically or otherwise, the audit
examination.
   (e)   The failure of the Tax Administrator to comply with a provision of
this section shall neither excuse a taxpayer from payment of any taxes owed by
the taxpayer nor cure any procedural defect in a taxpayer's case.
   (f)   If the Tax Administrator fails to substantially comply with the
provisions of this section, the Tax Administrator, upon application by the
taxpayer, shall excuse the taxpayer from penalties and interest arising from
the audit.
(Ord. A-2833.  Passed 10-26-15.)
142.12   ROUNDING.
   A person may round to the nearest whole dollar all amounts the person is
required to enter on any return, report, voucher, or other document required
under this chapter. Any fractional part of a dollar that equals or exceeds
fifty cents ($.50) shall be rounded to the next whole dollar, and any
fractional part of a dollar that is less than fifty cents ($.50) shall be
dropped, rounding down to the nearest whole dollar. If a person chooses to
round amounts entered on a document, the person shall round all amounts entered
on the document.
(Ord. A-2833.  Passed 10-26-15.)
142.13   AUTHORITY AND POWERS OF THE TAX ADMINISTRATOR.

issue orders or subpoenas for the production of books, accounts, papers,
records, documents, and testimony, to take depositions, to apply to a court for
attachment proceedings as for contempt, to approve vouchers for the fees of

penalties and interest thereon, illegally or erroneously imposed or collected,
or for any other reason overpaid, and, in addition, the Tax Administrator may
investigate any claim of overpayment and make a written statement of the Tax
Administrator's findings, and, if the Tax Administrator finds that there has

taxpayer's assigns, or legal representative as provided in this chapter;
   (e)   Exercise the authority provided by law relative to consenting to the

Administrator shall not review, redetermine, or correct any tax finding,

other appropriate tribunal, unless such appeal or application is withdrawn by
the appellant or applicant, is dismissed, or is otherwise final;
   (h)   Destroy any or all returns or other tax documents in the manner
authorized by law;
   (i)   Enter into an agreement with a taxpayer to simplify the withholding

(Ord. A-2833.  Passed 10-26-15.)
142.132   AUTHORITY OF TAX ADMINISTRATOR; COMPROMISE OF CLAIM AND PAYMENT OVER
TIME.
   (a)   As used in this section, "claim" means a claim for an amount payable
to the Municipality that arises pursuant to the Municipal income tax imposed in
accordance with this chapter.
   (b)   The Tax Administrator may do either of the following if such action is
in the best interests of the Municipality:
      (1)   Compromise a claim;
      (2)   Extend for a reasonable period the time for payment of a claim by
agreeing to accept monthly or other periodic payments, upon such terms and
conditions as the Tax Administrator may require.
   (c)   The Tax Administrator's rejection of a compromise or payment-over-time
agreement proposed by a person with respect to a claim shall not be appealable.
   (d)   A compromise or payment-over-time agreement with respect to a claim
shall be binding upon and shall inure to the benefit of only the parties to the
compromise or agreement, and shall not extinguish or otherwise affect the
liability of any other person.
   (e)   (1)   A compromise or payment-over-time agreement with respect to a
claim shall be void if the taxpayer defaults under the compromise or agreement
or if the compromise or agreement was obtained by fraud or by misrepresentation
of a material fact. Any amount that was due before the compromise or agreement
and that is unpaid shall remain due, and any penalties or interest that would
have accrued in the absence of the compromise or agreement shall continue to
accrue and be due.
      (2)   The Tax Administrator shall have sole discretion to determine
whether or not penalty, interest, charges or applicable fees will be assessed
through the duration of any compromise or payment-over-time agreement.
   (f)   The Tax Administrator may require that the taxpayer provide detailed
financial documentation and information, in order to determine whether or not a
payment-over-time agreement will be authorized. The taxpayer's failure to
provide the necessary and required information by the Tax Administrator shall
preclude consideration of a payment-over-time agreement.
(Ord. A-2833.  Passed 10-26-15.)
142.133   AUTHORITY OF TAX ADMINISTRATOR; RIGHT TO EXAMINE.
   (a)   The Tax Administrator, or any authorized agent or employee thereof may
examine the books, papers, records, and Federal and State income tax returns of
any employer, taxpayer, or other person that is subject to, or that the Tax
Administrator believes is subject to, the provisions of this chapter for the
purpose of verifying the accuracy of any return made or, if no return was
filed, to ascertain the tax due under this chapter. Upon written request by the
Tax Administrator or a duly authorized agent or employee thereof, every
employer, taxpayer, or other person subject to this section is required to
furnish the opportunity for the Tax Administrator, authorized agent, or
employee to investigate and examine such books, papers, records, and Federal
and State income tax returns at a reasonable time and place designated in the
request.
   (b)   The records and other documents of any taxpayer, employer, or other
person that is subject to, or that a Tax Administrator believes is subject to,
the provisions of this chapter shall be open to the Tax Administrator's
inspection during business hours and shall be preserved for a period of six
years following the end of the taxable year to which the records or documents
relate, unless the Tax Administrator, in writing, consents to their destruction
within that period, or by order requires that they be kept longer. The Tax
Administrator of a municipal corporation may require any person, by notice
served on that person, to keep such records as the Tax Administrator determines
necessary to show whether or not that person is liable, and the extent of such
liability, for the income tax levied by the Municipality or for the withholding
of such tax.
   (c)   The Tax Administrator may examine under oath any person that the Tax
Administrator reasonably believes has knowledge concerning any income that was
or would have been returned for taxation or any transaction tending to affect
such income. The Tax Administrator may, for this purpose, compel any such
person to attend a hearing or examination and to produce any books, papers,
records, and Federal and State income tax returns in such person's possession
or control. The person may be assisted or represented by an attorney,
accountant, bookkeeper, or other tax practitioner at any such hearing or
examination. This division does not authorize the practice of law by a person
who is not an attorney.
   (d)   No person issued written notice by the Tax Administrator compelling
attendance at a hearing or examination or the production of books, papers,
records, or Federal and State income tax returns under this section shall fail
to comply.
(Ord. A-2833.  Passed 10-26-15.)
142.134   AUTHORITY OF TAX ADMINISTRATOR; REQUIRING IDENTIFYING INFORMATION.
   (a)   The Tax Administrator may require any person filing a tax document
with the Tax Administrator to provide identifying information, which may
include the person's Social Security number, Federal employer identification
number, or other identification number requested by the Tax Administrator. A
person required by the Tax Administrator to provide identifying information
that has experienced any change with respect to that information shall notify
the Tax Administrator of the change before, or upon, filing the next tax
document requiring the identifying information.
   (b)   (1)   If the Tax Administrator makes a request for identifying
information and the Tax Administrator does not receive valid identifying
information within thirty days of making the request, nothing in this chapter
prohibits the Tax Administrator from imposing a penalty upon the person to whom
the request was directed pursuant to Section
142.10, in addition to any applicable penalty described in Section
142.99.
      (2)   If a person required by the Tax Administrator to provide
identifying information does not notify the Tax Administrator of a change with
respect to that information as required under subsection (a) hereof within
thirty days after filing the next tax document requiring such identifying
information, nothing in this chapter prohibits the Tax Administrator from
imposing a penalty pursuant to Section
142.10.
      (3)   The penalties provided for under paragraphs (b)(1) and (b)(2)
hereof may be billed and imposed in the same manner as the tax or fee with
respect to which the identifying information is sought and are in addition to
any applicable criminal penalties described in Section
142.99 for a violation of Section
142.15, and any other penalties that may be imposed by the Tax Administrator by
law.
(Ord. A-2833.  Passed 10-26-15.)
142.14   CONFIDENTIALITY.
   (a)   Any information gained as a result of returns, investigations,
hearings, or verifications required or authorized by Ohio R.C. Chapter 718 or
by the charter or ordinance of the Municipality is confidential, and no person
shall access or disclose such information except in accordance with a proper
judicial order or in connection with the performance of that person's official
duties or the official business of the Municipality as authorized by Ohio R.C.
Chapter 718 or the charter or ordinance authorizing the levy. The Tax
Administrator of the Municipality or a designee thereof may furnish copies of
returns filed or otherwise received under this chapter and other related tax
information to the Internal Revenue Service, the State Tax Commissioner, and
Tax Administrators of other municipal corporations.
   (b)   This section does not prohibit the Municipality from publishing or
disclosing statistics in a form that does not disclose information with respect
to particular taxpayers.
(Ord. A-2833.  Passed 10-26-15.)
142.15   FRAUD.
   No person shall knowingly make, present, aid, or assist in the preparation
or presentation of a false or fraudulent report, return, schedule, statement,
claim, or document authorized or required by municipal corporation ordinance or
State law to be filed with the Tax Administrator, or knowingly procure,
counsel, or advise the preparation or presentation of such report, return,
schedule, statement, claim, or document, or knowingly change, alter, or amend,
or knowingly procure, counsel or advise such change, alteration, or amendment
of the records upon which such report, return, schedule, statement, claim, or
document is based with intent to defraud the Municipality or the Tax
Administrator.
(Ord. A-2833.  Passed 10-26-25.)
142.16   OPINION OF THE TAX ADMINISTRATOR.
   (a)   An "opinion of the Tax Administrator" means an opinion issued under
this section with respect to prospective Municipal income tax liability. It
does not include ordinary correspondence of the Tax Administrator.
   (b)   A taxpayer may submit a written request for an opinion of the Tax
Administrator as to whether or how certain income, source of income, or a
certain activity or transaction will be taxed. The written response of the Tax
Administrator shall be an "opinion of the Tax Administrator" and shall bind the
Tax Administrator, in accordance with subsections (c), (g), and (h) hereof,
provided all of the following conditions are satisfied:
      (1)   The taxpayer's request fully and accurately describes the specific
facts or circumstances relevant to a determination of the taxability of the
income, source of income, activity, or transaction, and, if an activity or
transaction, all parties involved in the activity or transaction are clearly
identified by name, location, or other pertinent facts.
      (2)   The request relates to a tax imposed by the Municipality in
accordance with this chapter.
      (3)   The Tax Administrator's response is signed by the Tax Administrator
and designated as an "opinion of the Tax Administrator."
   (c)   An opinion of the Tax Administrator shall remain in effect and shall
protect the taxpayer for whom the opinion was prepared and who reasonably
relies on it from liability for any taxes, penalty, or interest otherwise
chargeable on the activity or transaction specifically held by the Tax
Administrator's opinion to be taxable in a particular manner or not to be
subject to taxation for any taxable years that may be specified in the opinion,
or until the earliest of the following dates:
      (1)   The effective date of a written revocation by the Tax Administrator
sent to the taxpayer by certified mail, return receipt requested. The effective
date of the revocation shall be the taxpayer's date of receipt or one year
after the issuance of the opinion, whichever is later;
      (2)   The effective date of any amendment or enactment of a relevant
section of the Ohio Revised Code, uncodified State law, or the Municipality's
income tax ordinance that would substantially change the analysis and
conclusion of the opinion of the Tax Administrator;
      (3)   The date on which a court issues an opinion establishing or
changing relevant case law with respect to the Ohio Revised Code, uncodified
State law, or the Municipality's income tax ordinance;
      (4)   If the opinion of the Tax Administrator was based on the
interpretation of Federal law, the effective date of any change in the relevant
Federal statutes or regulations, or the date on which a court issues an opinion
establishing or changing relevant case law with respect to Federal statutes or
regulations;
      (5)   The effective date of any change in the taxpayer's material facts
or circumstances;
      (6)   The effective date of the expiration of the opinion, if specified
in the opinion.
   (d)   (1)   A taxpayer is not relieved of tax liability for any activity or
transaction related to a request for an opinion that contained any
misrepresentation or omission of one or more material facts.
      (2)   If the taxpayer knowingly has misrepresented the pertinent facts or
omitted material facts with intent to defraud the Municipality in order to
obtain a more favorable opinion, the taxpayer may be in violation of Section
142.15.
   (e)   If a Tax Administrator provides written advice under this section, the
opinion shall include a statement that:
      (1)   The tax consequences stated in the opinion may be subject to change
for any of the reasons stated in subsection (c) hereof;
      (2)   It is the duty of the taxpayer to be aware of such changes.
   (f)   A Tax Administrator may refuse to offer an opinion on any request
received under this section.
   (g)   This section binds a Tax Administrator only with respect to opinions
of the Tax Administrator issued on or after January 1, 2016.
   (h)   An opinion of a Tax Administrator binds that Tax Administrator only
with respect to the taxpayer for whom the opinion was prepared and does not
bind the Tax Administrator of any other municipal corporation.
   (i)   A Tax Administrator shall make available the text of all opinions
issued under this section, except those opinions prepared for a taxpayer who
has requested that the text of the opinion remain confidential. In no event
shall the text of an opinion be made available until the Tax Administrator has
removed all information that identifies the taxpayer and any other parties
involved in the activity or transaction.
   (j)   An opinion of the Tax Administrator issued under this section or a
refusal to offer an opinion under subsection (f) hereof may not be appealed.
(Ord. A-2833.  Passed 10-26-15.)
142.17   ASSESSMENT; APPEAL BASED ON PRESUMPTION OF DELIVERY.
   (a)   (1)   The Tax Administrator shall serve an assessment either by
personal service, by certified mail, or by a delivery service authorized under
Ohio R.C. 5703.056.
      (2)   The Tax Administrator may deliver the assessment through
alternative means as provided in this section, including, but not limited to,
delivery by secure electronic mail. Such alternative delivery method must be
authorized by the person subject to the assessment.
      (3)   Once service of the assessment has been made by the Tax
Administrator or other municipal official, or the designee of either, the
person to whom the assessment is directed may protest the ruling of that
assessment by filing an appeal with the Local Board of Tax Review within sixty
days after the receipt of service. The delivery of an assessment of the Tax
Administrator as prescribed in Ohio R.C. 718.18 is prima facie evidence that
delivery is complete and that the assessment is served.
   (b)   (1)   A person may challenge the presumption of delivery and service
as set forth in this subsection.  A person disputing the presumption of
delivery and service under this section bears the burden of proving by a
preponderance of the evidence that the address to which the assessment was sent
was not an address with which the person was associated at the time the Tax
Administrator originally mailed the assessment by certified mail. For the
purposes of this section, a person is associated with an address at the time
the Tax Administrator originally mailed the assessment if, at that time, the
person was residing, receiving legal documents, or conducting business at the
address; or if, before that time, the person had conducted business at the
address and, when the assessment was mailed, the person's agent or the person's
affiliate was conducting business at the address. For the purposes of this
section, a person's affiliate is any other person that, at the time the
assessment was mailed, owned or controlled at least twenty percent, as
determined by voting rights, of the addressee's business.
      (2)   If a person elects to appeal an assessment on the basis described
in paragraph (b)(1) hereof, and if that assessment is subject to collection and
is not otherwise appealable, the person must do so within sixty days after the
initial contact by the Tax Administrator or other municipal official, or the
designee of either, with the person. Nothing in this subsection prevents the
Tax Administrator or other official from entering into a compromise with the
person if the person does not actually file such an appeal with the Local Board
of Tax Review.
         (Ord. A-2833.  Passed 10-26-15.)
142.18   LOCAL BOARD OF TAX REVIEW; APPEAL TO LOCAL BOARD OF TAX REVIEW.
   (a)   (1)   The legislative authority of the Municipality shall maintain a
Local Board of Tax Review to hear appeals as provided in Ohio R.C. Chapter 718.
      (2)   The Local Board of Tax Review shall consist of three members.  The
three members of the Local Board of Tax Review must be domiciled in the
Municipality.  Two members shall be appointed by the legislative authority of
the Municipality, and may not be employees, elected officials, or contractors
with the Municipality at any time during their term or in the five years
immediately preceding the date of appointment. One member shall be appointed by
the top administrative official of the Municipality. This member may be an
employee of the Municipality, but may not be the director of finance or
equivalent officer, or the Tax Administrator or other similar official or an
employee directly involved in municipal tax matters, or any direct subordinate
thereof.
      (3)   The term for members of the Local Board of Tax Review appointed by
the legislative authority of the Municipality shall be two years. There is no
limit on the number of terms that a member may serve should the member be
reappointed by the legislative authority. The board member appointed by the top
administrative official of the Municipality shall serve at the discretion of
the administrative official.
      (4)   Members of the Board of Tax Review appointed by the legislative
authority may be removed by the legislative authority as set forth in Ohio R.C.
718.11(A)(4).
      (5)   A member of the Board who, for any reason, ceases to meet the
qualifications for the position prescribed by this section shall resign
immediately by operation of law.
      (6)   A vacancy in an unexpired term shall be filled in the same manner
as the original appointment within sixty days of when the vacancy was created.
Any member appointed to fill a vacancy occurring prior to the expiration of the
term for which the member's predecessor was appointed shall hold office for the
remainder of such term. No vacancy on the Board shall impair the power and
authority of the remaining members to exercise all the powers of the Board.
      (7)   If a member is temporarily unable to serve on the Board due to a
conflict of interest, illness, absence, or similar reason, the legislative
authority or top administrative official that appointed the member shall
appoint another individual to temporarily serve on the Board in the member's
place. This appointment shall be subject to the same requirements and
limitations as are applicable to the appointment of the member temporarily
unable to serve.
      (8)   No member of the Local Board of Tax Review shall receive
compensation, fee, or reimbursement of expenses for service on the Board.
      (9)   A member of a Local Board of Tax Review shall not be appointed to
or serve on another such board simultaneously.
   (b)   Whenever a Tax Administrator issues an assessment, the Tax
Administrator shall notify the taxpayer in writing at the same time of the
taxpayer's right to appeal the assessment, the manner in which the taxpayer may
appeal the assessment, and the address to which the appeal should be directed,
and to whom the appeal should be directed.
   (c)   Any person who has been issued an assessment may appeal the assessment
to the Board by filing a request with the Board.  The request shall be in
writing, shall specify the reason or reasons why the assessment should be
deemed incorrect or unlawful, and shall be filed within sixty days after the
taxpayer receives the assessment.
   (d)   The Local Board of Tax Review shall schedule a hearing to be held
within sixty days after receiving an appeal of an assessment under subsection
(c) hereof, unless the taxpayer requests additional time to prepare or waives a
hearing. If the taxpayer does not waive the hearing, the taxpayer may appear
before the Board and/or may be represented by an attorney at law, certified
public accountant, or other representative. The Board may allow a hearing to be
continued as jointly agreed to by the parties. In such a case, the hearing must
be completed within 120 days after the first day of the hearing unless the
parties agree otherwise.
   (e)   The Board may affirm, reverse, or modify the Tax Administrator's
assessment or any part of that assessment. The Board shall issue a final
determination on the appeal within ninety days after the Board's final hearing
on the appeal, and send a copy of its final determination by ordinary mail to
all of the parties to the appeal within fifteen days after issuing the final
determination. The taxpayer or the Tax Administrator may appeal the Board's
final determination as provided in Ohio R.C. 5717.011.
   (f)   The Local Board of Tax Review created pursuant to this section shall
adopt rules governing its procedures, including a schedule of related costs,
and shall keep a record of its transactions. The rules governing the Local
Board of Tax Review procedures shall be in writing, and may be amended as
needed by the Local Board of Tax Review. Such records are not public records
available for inspection under Ohio R.C. 149.43.  For this reason, any
documentation, copies of returns or reports, final determinations, or working
papers for each case must be maintained in a secure location under the control
of the Tax Administrator. No member of the Local Board of Tax Review may remove
such documentation, copies of returns or reports, final determinations, or
working papers from the hearing. Hearings requested by a taxpayer before a
Local Board of Tax Review created pursuant to this section are not meetings of
a public body subject to Ohio R.C. 121.22.  For this reason, such hearings
shall not be open to the public, and only those parties to the case may be
present during the hearing.
(Ord. A-2833.  Passed 10-26-15.)
142.19   ACTIONS TO RECOVER; STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS.
   (a)   (1)   A.   Civil actions to recover Municipal income taxes and
penalties and interest on Municipal income taxes shall be brought within the
latter of:
            1.   Three years after the tax was due or the return was filed,
whichever is later; or
            2.   One year after the conclusion of the qualifying deferral
period, if any.
         B.   The time limit described in paragraph (a)(1)A. hereof may be
extended at any time if both the Tax Administrator and the employer, agent of
the employer, other payer, or taxpayer consent in writing to the extension. Any
extension shall also extend for the same period of time the time limit
described in subsection (c) hereof.
      (2)   As used in this section, "qualifying deferral period" means a
period of time beginning and ending as follows:
         A.   Beginning on the date a person who is aggrieved by an assessment
files with a Local Board of Tax Review the request described in Section
142.18.  That date shall not be affected by any subsequent decision, finding,
or holding by any administrative body or court that the Local Board of Tax
Review with which the aggrieved person filed the request did not have
jurisdiction to affirm, reverse, or modify the assessment or any part of that
assessment.
         B.   Ending the later of the sixtieth day after the date on which the
final determination of the Local Board of Tax Review becomes final or, if any
party appeals from the determination of the Local Board of Tax Review, the
sixtieth day after the date on which the final determination of the Local Board
of Tax Review is either ultimately affirmed in whole or in part or ultimately
reversed and no further appeal of either that affirmation, in whole or in part,
or that reversal is available or taken.
   (b)   Prosecutions for an offense made punishable under a resolution or
ordinance imposing an income tax shall be commenced within three years after
the commission of the offense, provided that in the case of fraud, failure to
file a return, or the omission of twenty-five percent or more of income
required to be reported, prosecutions may be commenced within six years after
the commission of the offense.
   (c)   A claim for a refund of Municipal income taxes shall be brought within
the time limitation provided in Section
142.096.
   (d)   (1)   Notwithstanding the fact that an appeal is pending, the
petitioner may pay all or a portion of the assessment that is the subject of
the appeal. The acceptance of a payment by the Municipality does not prejudice 
    any claim for refund upon final determination of the appeal.
      (2)   If upon final determination of the appeal an error in the
assessment is corrected by the Tax Administrator, upon an appeal so filed or
pursuant to a final determination of the Local Board of Tax Review created
under Section
142.18, of the Ohio Board of Tax Appeals, or any court to which the decision of
the Ohio Board of Tax Appeals has been appealed, so that the amount due from
the party assessed under the corrected assessment is less than the amount paid,
there shall be issued to the appellant or to the appellant's assigns or legal
representative a refund in the amount of the overpayment as provided by Section
142.096, with interest on that amount as provided by subsection (d) hereof.
   (e)   No civil action to recover Municipal income tax or related penalties
or interest shall be brought during either of the following time periods:
      (1)   The period during which a taxpayer has a right to appeal the
imposition of that tax or interest or those penalties;
      (2)   The period during which an appeal related to the imposition of that
tax or interest or those penalties is pending.

upon the taxpayer's election, both of the following shall apply:
      (1)   The state tax commissioner shall serve as the sole administrator of
the municipal net profit tax for which the taxpayer as defined in Section
142.81(c) of the Codified Ordinances is liable for the term of the election;
      (2)   The state tax commissioner shall administer the tax pursuant to
Ohio R.C. 718.80 to 718.95, Sections

taxable year in which the election is made and to each subsequent taxable year
until the taxpayer notifies the state tax commissioner and the Municipality of
its termination of the election.
         B.   A notification of termination shall be made, on a form prescribed
by the state tax commissioner, on or before the first day of the third month of
any taxable year.
         C.   Upon a timely and valid termination of the election, the taxpayer

this chapter.
   (c)   The state tax commissioner shall enforce and administer Sections
142.80 to

      (2)   Adopt such rules as the state tax commissioner finds necessary to
carry out those sections;
      (3)   Appoint and employ such personnel as are necessary to carry out the
duties imposed upon the state tax commissioner by those sections.
   (d)   The state tax commissioner shall not be considered a tax

(Ord. A-2921.  Passed 2-12-18.)
142.81   DEFINITIONS.
   If a term used in Sections
142.80 to
142.95 of the Codified Ordinances that is not otherwise defined in this chapter
is used in a comparable context in both the laws of the United States relating
to federal income tax and in Title LVII of the Revised Code and the use is not
consistent, then the use of the term in the laws of the United States relating
to federal income tax shall have control over the use of the term in Title LVII
of the Revised Code, unless the term is defined in Ohio R.C. Chapter 5703, in
which case the definition in that chapter shall control. Any reference in this
chapter to the Internal Revenue Code includes other laws of the United States
related to federal income taxes. If a term is defined in both this section and
Section 142.03, the definition in this section shall control for all uses of
that term in Sections
142.80 to
142.95. As used in Sections
142.80 to
142.95 only:
   (a)   "Municipal taxable income" means income apportioned or sitused to the
municipal corporation under Section
142.82, as applicable, reduced by any pre-2017 net operating loss carryforward
available to the person for the municipal corporation.
   (b)   "Adjusted federal taxable income," for a person required to file as a
C corporation, or for a person that has elected to be taxed as a C corporation
as described in Ohio R.C. 718.01(D)(5) and Section
142.03(c)(23)D. of the Codified Ordinances, means a C corporation's federal
taxable income before net operating losses and special deductions as determined
under the Internal Revenue Code, adjusted as follows:
      (1)   Deduct intangible income to the extent included in federal taxable
income. The deduction shall be allowed regardless of whether the intangible
income relates to assets used in a trade or business or assets held for the
production of income,
      (2)   Add an amount equal to five per cent of intangible income deducted
under division (b)(1) of this section, but excluding that portion of intangible
income directly related to the sale, exchange, or other disposition of property
described in section 1221 of the Internal Revenue Code.
      (3)   Add any losses allowed as a deduction in the computation of federal
taxable income if the losses directly relate to the sale, exchange, or other
disposition of an asset described in section 1221 or 1231 of the Internal
Revenue Code.
      (4)   A.   Except as provided in division (b)(4)B. of this section,
deduct income and gain included in federal taxable income to the extent the
income and gain directly relate to the sale, exchange, or other disposition of
an asset described in section 1221 or 1231 of the Internal Revenue Code.
         B.   Division (b)(4)A. of this section does not apply to the extent
the income or gain is income or gain described in section 1245 or 1250 of the
Internal Revenue Code.
      (5)   Add taxes on or measured by net income allowed as a deduction in
the computation of federal taxable income.
      (6)   In the case of a real estate investment trust or regulated
investment company, add all amounts with respect to dividends to, distributions
to, or amounts set aside for or credited to the benefit of investors and
allowed as a deduction in the computation of federal taxable income.
      (7)   Deduct, to the extent not otherwise deducted or excluded in
computing federal taxable income, any income derived from a transfer agreement
or from the enterprise transferred under that agreement under Ohio R.C.
4313.02.
      (8)   Deduct exempt income to the extent not otherwise deducted or
excluded in computing adjusted federal taxable income.
      (9)   Deduct any net profit of a pass-through entity owned directly or
indirectly by the taxpayer and included in the taxpayer's federal taxable
income unless an affiliated group of corporations includes that net profit in
the group's federal taxable income in accordance with division (e)(3)B. of
Section
142.86 of the Codified Ordinances.
      (10)   Add any loss incurred by a pass-through entity owned directly or
indirectly by the taxpayer and included in the taxpayer's federal taxable
income unless an affiliated group of corporations includes that loss in the
group's federal taxable income in accordance with Section
142.86 (e)(3)B. of the Codified Ordinances.
      If the taxpayer is not a C corporation, is not a disregarded entity that
has made the election described in Section
142.03(47)B. of the Codified Ordinances, and is not a publicly traded
partnership that has made the election described in Section
142.03 (23)D. of the Codified Ordinances, the taxpayer shall compute adjusted
federal taxable income under this section as if the taxpayer were a C
corporation, except guaranteed payments and other similar amounts paid or
accrued to a partner, former partner, shareholder, former shareholder, member,
or former member shall not be allowed as a deductible expense unless such
payments are in consideration for the use of capital and treated as payment of
interest under section 469 of the Internal Revenue Code or United States
treasury regulations. Amounts paid or accrued to a qualified self-employed
retirement plan with respect to a partner, former partner, shareholder, former
shareholder, member, or former member of the taxpayer, amounts paid or accrued
to or for health insurance for a partner, former partner, shareholder, former
shareholder, member, or former member, and amounts paid or accrued to or for
life insurance for a partner, former partner, shareholder, former shareholder,
member, or former member shall not be allowed as a deduction.
      Nothing in division (b) of this section shall be construed as allowing
the taxpayer to add or deduct any amount more than once or shall be construed
as allowing any taxpayer to deduct any amount paid to or accrued for purposes
of federal self-employment tax.
   (c)   "Taxpayer" has the same meaning as in Section
142.03(47) of the Codified Ordinances, except that "taxpayer" does not include
natural persons or entities subject to the tax imposed under Ohio R.C. Chapter
5745. "Taxpayer" may include receivers, assignees, or trustees in bankruptcy
when such persons are required to assume the role of a taxpayer.
   (d)   "Tax return" or "return" means the notifications and reports required
to be filed pursuant to Sections
142.80 to
142.95 of the Codified Ordinances for the purpose of reporting municipal income
taxes, and includes declarations of estimated tax.
   (e)   "Taxable year" means the calendar year or the taxpayer's fiscal year
ending during the calendar year, or fractional part thereof, upon which the
calculation of the taxpayer's adjusted federal taxable income is based pursuant
to this chapter. If a taxpayer's taxable year is changed for federal income tax
purposes, the taxable year for purposes of Sections
142.80 to
142.95 of the Codified Ordinances is changed accordingly but may consist of an
aggregation of more than one taxable year for federal income tax purposes. The
state tax commissioner may prescribe by rule an appropriate period as the
taxable year for a taxpayer that has had a change of its taxable year for
federal income tax purposes, for a taxpayer that has two or more short taxable
years for federal income tax purposes as the result of a change of ownership,
or for a new taxpayer that would otherwise have no taxable year.
   (f)   "Assessment" means a notice of underpayment or nonpayment of a tax
issued pursuant to Section
142.90 of the Codified Ordinances.
(Ord. A-2921.  Passed 2-12-18.)
142.82   APPLICABILITY; TAXABLE SITUS; APPORTIONMENT.
   This section applies to any taxpayer that is engaged in a business or
profession in the Municipality and that has made the election under Section
142.80 of the Codified Ordinances.
   (a)   Except as otherwise provided in division (b) of this section, net
profit from a business or profession conducted both within and without the
boundaries of the Municipality shall be considered as having a taxable situs in
the Municipality for purposes of municipal income taxation in the same
proportion as the average ratio of the following:
      (1)   The average original cost of the real property and tangible
personal property owned or used by the taxpayer in the business or profession
in the Municipality during the taxable period to the average original cost of
all of the real and tangible personal property owned or used by the taxpayer in
the business or profession during the same period, wherever situated.
      As used in the preceding paragraph, tangible personal or real property
shall include property rented or leased by the taxpayer and the value of such
property shall be determined by multiplying the annual rental thereon by eight;
      (2)   Wages, salaries, and other compensation paid during the taxable
period to individuals employed in the business or profession for services
performed in the Municipality to wages, salaries, and other compensation paid
during the same period to individuals employed in the business or profession,
wherever the individual's services are performed, excluding compensation from
which taxes are not required to be withheld under Section
142.052 of the Codified Ordinances.
      (3)   Total gross receipts of the business or profession from sales and
rentals made and services performed during the taxable period in the
Municipality to total gross receipts of the business or profession during the
same period from sales, rentals, and services, wherever made or performed.
   (b)   (1)   If the apportionment factors described in division (a) of this
section do not fairly represent the extent of a taxpayer's business activity in
the Municipality, the taxpayer may request, or the state tax commissioner may
require, that the taxpayer use, with respect to all or any portion of the
income of the taxpayer, an alternative apportionment method involving one or
more of the following:
         A.   Separate accounting;
         B.   The exclusion of one or more of the factors;
         C.   The inclusion of one or more additional factors that would
provide for a more fair apportionment of the income of the taxpayer to the
municipal corporation;
         D.   A modification of one or more of the factors.
      (2)   A taxpayer request to use an alternative apportionment method shall
be in writing and shall accompany a tax return, timely filed appeal of an
assessment, or timely filed amended tax return. The taxpayer may use the
requested alternative method unless the state tax commissioner denies the
request in an assessment issued within the period prescribed by Section
142.90(a) of the Codified Ordinances.
      (3)   The state tax commissioner may require a taxpayer to use an
alternative apportionment method as described in division (b)(1) of this
section only by issuing an assessment to the taxpayer within the period
prescribed by Section
142.90(a) of the Codified Ordinances.
   (c)   As used in division (a)(2) of this section, "wages, salaries, and
other compensation" includes only wages, salaries, or other compensation paid
to an employee for services performed at any of the following locations:
      (1)   A location that is owned, controlled, or used by, rented to, or
under the possession of one of the following:
         A.   The employer;
         B.   A vendor, customer, client, or patient of the employer, or a
related member of such a vendor, customer, client, or patient;
         C.   A vendor, customer, client, or patient of a person described in
division (c)(1)B. of this section, or a related member of such a vendor,
customer, client, or patient.
      (2)   Any location at which a trial, appeal, hearing, investigation,
inquiry, review, court-martial, or similar administrative, judicial, or
legislative matter or proceeding is being conducted, provided that the
compensation is paid for services performed for, or on behalf of, the employer
or that the employee's presence at the location directly or indirectly benefits
the employer;
      (3)   Any other location, if the state tax commissioner determines that
the employer directed the employee to perform the services at the other
location in lieu of a location described in division (c)(1) or (c)(2) of this
section solely in order to avoid or reduce the employer's municipal income tax
liability. If the state tax commissioner makes such a determination, the
employer may dispute the determination by establishing, by a preponderance of
the evidence, that the state tax commissioner's determination was unreasonable.
   (d)   For the purposes of division (a)(3) of this section, receipts from
sales and rentals made and services performed shall be sitused to the
Municipality as follows:
      (1)   Gross receipts from the sale of tangible personal property shall be
sitused to the Municipality only if, regardless of where title passes, the
property meets either of the following criteria;
         A.   The property is shipped to or delivered within the Municipality
from a stock of goods located within the Municipality.
         B.   The property is delivered within the Municipality from a location
outside the Municipality, provided the taxpayer is regularly engaged through
its own employees in the solicitation or promotion of sales within the
Municipality and the sales result from such solicitation or promotion.
      (2)   Gross receipts from the sale of services shall be sitused to the
Municipality to the extent that such services are performed in the
Municipality.
      (3)   To the extent included in income, gross receipts from the sale of
real property located in the Municipality shall be sitused to the Municipality.
      (4)   To the extent included in income, gross receipts from rents and
royalties from real property located in the Municipality shall be sitused to
the Municipality.
      (5)   Gross receipts from rents and royalties from tangible personal
property shall be sitused to the Municipality based upon the extent to which
the tangible personal property is used in the Municipality.
   (e)   Commissions received by a real estate agent or broker relating to the
sale, purchase, or lease of real estate shall be sitused to the Municipality in
which the real estate is located. Net profit reported by the real estate agent
or broker shall be allocated to the Municipality based upon the ratio of the
commissions the agent or broker received from the sale, purchase, or lease of
real estate located in the Municipality to the commissions received from the
sale, purchase, or lease of real estate everywhere in the taxable year.
   (f)   If, in computing a taxpayer's adjusted federal taxable income, the
taxpayer deducted any amount with respect to a stock option granted to an
employee, and if the employee is not required to include in the employee's
income any such amount or a portion thereof because it is exempted from
taxation under Section
142.03(11)L. and (34)A.4. of the Codified Ordinances by the Municipality or
substantially similar provision of the codified ordinances of another municipal
corporation, the taxpayer shall add the amount that is exempt from taxation to
the taxpayer's net profit that was apportioned to the Municipality. In no case
shall a taxpayer be required to add to its net profit that was apportioned to
the Municipality any amount other than the amount upon which the employee would
be required to pay tax were the amount related to the stock option not exempted
from taxation. This division applies solely for the purpose of making an
adjustment to the amount of a taxpayer's net profit that was apportioned to the
Municipality under this section.
   (g)   When calculating the ratios described in division (a) of this section
for the purposes of that division or division (b) of this section, the owner of
a disregarded entity shall include in the owner's ratios the property, payroll,
and gross receipts of such disregarded entity.

disclose such information, except for official purposes, in accordance with a
proper judicial order, or as provided in Ohio R.C. 4123.271 or 5703.21. The

of every taxpayer that made estimated payments that are attributable to the
Municipality and the amount of each such taxpayer's estimated payment.

receives in the performance of its administration of the municipal net profits
tax for taxpayers making the election provided in Section
142.80 of the Codified Ordinances. The tax administrator shall review these
returns and information, as well as the information received pursuant to
divisions (b) and (c) of this section, and has discretion to refer any taxpayer
for audit by the state tax commissioner. Such referral shall be made on a form
prescribed by the commissioner and shall include any information that forms the
basis for the referral.
      (2)   If the state tax commissioner declines to audit a taxpayer referred
by the tax administrator under this section, the Municipality reserves its
right to pursue any and all remedies, whether at law or in equity, to ensure
that the correct tax liability has been calculated and paid by the taxpayer.

   (c)   (Reserved)
   (d)   (1)   A.   Any taxpayer that has duly requested an automatic extension
for filing the taxpayer's federal income tax return shall automatically receive
an extension for the filing of a tax return with the commissioner under this
section. The extended due date of the return shall be the fifteenth day of the
tenth month after the last day of the taxable year to which the return relates.
         B.   A taxpayer that has not requested or received a six-month
extension for filing the taxpayer's federal income tax return may request that
the commissioner grant the taxpayer a six-month extension of the date for
filing the taxpayer's municipal income tax return. If the commissioner receives
the request on or before the date the municipal income tax return is due, the
commissioner shall grant the taxpayer's extension request.
         C.   An extension of time to file under division (d)(1) of this
section is not an extension of the time to pay any tax due unless the state tax

person concerning questions that arise during the examination or other review
of the return and authorizes the preparer or other person only to provide the
commissioner with information that is missing from the return, to contact the
commissioner for information about the examination or other review of the
return or the status of the taxpayer's refund or payments, and to respond to
notices about mathematical errors, offsets, or return preparation that the
taxpayer has received from the commissioner and has shown to the preparer or
other person.
   (f)   When income tax returns or other documents require the signature of a
tax return preparer, the state tax commissioner shall accept a facsimile or
electronic version of such a signature in lieu of a manual signature.

at least one member of the affiliated group of corporations is subject to
municipal income tax in that taxable year and if the affiliated group of
corporations filed a consolidated federal income tax return with respect to
that taxable year. The election is binding for a five-year period beginning
with the first taxable year of the initial election unless a change in the
reporting method is required under federal law. The election continues to be
binding for each subsequent five-year period unless the taxpayer elects to
discontinue filing consolidated tax returns under division (b)(2) of this
section or a taxpayer receives permission from the state tax commissioner. The
state tax commissioner shall approve such a request for good cause shown.
      (2)   An election to discontinue filing consolidated tax returns under
this section must be made on or before the fifteenth day of the fourth month of
the year following the last year of a five-year consolidated tax return
election period in effect under division (b)(1) of this section. The election
to discontinue filing a consolidated tax return is binding for a five-year
period beginning with the first taxable year of the election.
      (3)   An election made under division (b)(1) or (2) of this section is
binding on all members of the affiliated group of corporations subject to a
municipal income tax.
      (4)   When a taxpayer makes the election allowed under Section
142.80 of the Codified Ordinances , a valid election made by the taxpayer under
Section
142.063 (b)(1) or (b)(2) of the Codified Ordinances  is binding upon the state
tax commissioner for the remainder of the five-year period.
      (5)   When an election made under Section
142.80 of the Codified Ordinances  is terminated, a valid election made under
this section is binding upon the tax administrator for the remainder of the
five-year period.
   (c)   A taxpayer that is a member of an affiliated group of corporations
that filed a consolidated federal income tax return for a taxable year shall
file a consolidated tax return for that taxable year if the state tax
commissioner determines, by a preponderance of the evidence, that intercompany
transactions have not been conducted at arm's length and that there has been a
distortive shifting of income or expenses with regard to allocation of net
profits to a municipal corporation. A taxpayer that is required to file a
consolidated tax return for a taxable year shall file a consolidated tax return
for all subsequent taxable years unless the taxpayer requests and receives
written permission from the commissioner to file a separate return or a
taxpayer has experienced a change in circumstances.
   (d)   A taxpayer shall prepare a consolidated tax return in the same manner
as is required under the United States department of treasury regulations that
prescribe procedures for the preparation of the consolidated federal income tax
return required to be filed by the common parent of the affiliated group of
which the taxpayer is a member.
   (e)   (1)   Except as otherwise provided in divisions (e)(2), (e)(3), and
(e)(4) of this section, corporations that file a consolidated tax return shall
compute adjusted federal taxable income, as defined in Section
142.81 of the Codified Ordinances , by substituting "consolidated federal
taxable income" for "federal taxable income" wherever "federal taxable income"
appears in that division and by substituting "an affiliated group of
corporation's" for "a C corporation's" wherever "a C corporation's" appears in
that division.
      (2)   No corporation filing a consolidated tax return shall make any
adjustment otherwise required under Section
142.81(b) of the Codified Ordinances  to the extent that the item of income or
deduction otherwise subject to the adjustment has been eliminated or
consolidated in the computation of consolidated federal taxable income.
      (3)   If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having at least
eighty per cent of the value of its ownership interest owned or controlled,
directly or indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is included in
that affiliated group's consolidated federal taxable income for a taxable year,
the corporation filing a consolidated tax return shall do one of the following
with respect to that pass-through entity's net profit or loss for that taxable
year:
         A.   Exclude the pass-through entity's net profit or loss from the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purpose of making the computations required in Section
142.82 of the Codified Ordinances , exclude the property, payroll, and gross
receipts of the pass-through entity in the computation of the affiliated
group's net profit sitused to a municipal corporation. If the entity's net
profit or loss is so excluded, the entity shall be subject to taxation as a
separate taxpayer on the basis of the entity's net profits that would otherwise
be included in the consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group.
         B.   Include the pass-through entity's net profit or loss in the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purpose of making the computations required in Section
142.82 of the Codified Ordinances , include the property, payroll, and gross
receipts of the pass-through entity in the computation of the affiliated
group's net profit sitused to a municipal corporation. If the entity's net
profit or loss is so included, the entity shall not be subject to taxation as a
separate taxpayer on the basis of the entity's net profits that are included in
the consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group.
      (4)   If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having less than
eighty per cent of the value of its ownership interest owned or controlled,
directly or indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is included in
that affiliated group's consolidated federal taxable income for a taxable year,
all of the following shall apply:
         A.   The corporation filing the consolidated tax return shall exclude
the pass-through entity's net profit or loss from the consolidated federal
taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the purposes of making the
computations required in Section
142.82 of the Codified Ordinances , exclude the property, payroll, and gross
receipts of the pass-through entity in the computation of the affiliated
group's net profit sitused to a municipal corporation;
         B.   The pass-through entity shall be subject to municipal income
taxation as a separate taxpayer in accordance with Sections
142.80 to
142.95 of the Codified Ordinances  on the basis of the entity's net profits
that would otherwise be included in the consolidated federal taxable income of
the affiliated group.
   (f)   Corporations filing a consolidated tax return shall make the
computations required under Section
142.82 of the Codified Ordinances  by substituting "consolidated federal
taxable income attributable to" for "net profit from" wherever "net profit
from" appears in that section and by substituting "affiliated group of
corporations" for "taxpayer" wherever "taxpayer" appears in that section.
   (g)   Each corporation filing a consolidated tax return is jointly and
severally liable for any tax, interest, penalties, fines, charges, or other
amounts applicable under Sections
142.80 to
142.95 of the Codified Ordinances  or Ohio R.C. Chapter 5703 to the
corporation, an affiliated group of which the corporation is a member for any
portion of the taxable year, or any one or more members of such an affiliated
group.
(Ord. A-2921.  Passed 2-12-18.)
142.87   FAILURE TO PAY TAX.
   If a taxpayer that has made the election allowed under Section
142.80 fails to pay any tax as required under Sections
142.80 to
142.95 of the Codified Ordinances , or any portion of that tax, on or before
the date prescribed for its payment, interest shall be assessed, collected, and
paid, in the same manner as the tax, upon such unpaid amount at the rate per
annum prescribed by Ohio R.C. 5703.47 from the date prescribed for its payment
until it is paid or until the date an assessment is issued under Section
142.90 of the Codified Ordinances , whichever occurs first.
(Ord. A-2921.  Passed 2-12-18.)
142.88   DECLARATION OF ESTIMATED TAXES.
   (a)   As used in this section:
      (1)   "Combined tax liability" means the total amount of a taxpayer's
income tax liabilities to all municipal corporations in this state for a
taxable year
      (2)   "Estimated taxes" means the amount that the taxpayer reasonably
estimates to be the taxpayer's combined tax liability for the current taxable
year.
   (b)   (1)   Except as provided in division (b)(4) of this section, every
taxpayer shall make a declaration of estimated taxes for the current taxable
year, on the form prescribed by the state tax commissioner, if the amount
payable as estimated taxes is at least two hundred dollars ($200.00).
      (2)   Except as provided in division (b)(4) of this section, a taxpayer
having a taxable year of less than twelve months shall make a declaration under
rules prescribed by the commissioner.
      (3)   The declaration of estimated taxes shall be filed on or before the
fifteenth day of the fourth month after the beginning of the taxable year or on
or before the fifteenth day of the fourth month after the taxpayer becomes
subject to tax for the first time.
      (4)   The state tax commissioner may waive the requirement for filing a
declaration of estimated taxes for any class of taxpayers after finding that
the waiver is reasonable and proper in view of administrative costs and other
factors.
   (c)   Each taxpayer shall file the declaration of estimated taxes with, and
remit estimated taxes to, the state tax commissioner at the times and in the
amounts prescribed in division (c)(1) of this section. Remitted taxes shall be
made payable to the treasurer of state.
      (1)   The required portion of the combined tax liability for the taxable
year that shall be paid through estimated taxes shall be as follows:
         A.   On or before the fifteenth day of the fourth month after the
beginning of the taxable year, twenty-two and one-half per cent (22.5%) of the
combined tax liability for the taxable year;
         B.   On or before the fifteenth day of the sixth month after the
beginning of the taxable year, forty-five per cent (45%) of the combined tax
liability for the taxable year;
         C.   On or before the fifteenth day of the ninth month after the
beginning of the taxable year, sixty-seven and one-half per cent (67.5%) of the
combined tax liability for the taxable year;
         D.   On or before the fifteenth day of the twelfth month of the
taxable year, ninety per cent (90%) of the combined tax liability for the
taxable year.
      (2)   If the taxpayer determines that its declaration of estimated taxes
will not accurately reflect the taxpayer's tax liability for the taxable year,
the taxpayer shall increase or decrease, as appropriate, its subsequent
payments in equal installments to result in a more accurate payment of
estimated taxes.
      (3)   A.   Each taxpayer shall report on the declaration of estimated
taxes the portion of the remittance that the taxpayer estimates that it owes to
each municipal corporation for the taxable year.
         B.   Upon receiving a payment of estimated taxes under this section,
the commissioner shall immediately forward the payment to the treasurer of
state. The treasurer shall credit the payment in the same manner as in Ohio
R.C. 718.85(B).
   (d)   (1)   In the case of any underpayment of estimated taxes, there shall
be added to the taxes an amount determined at the rate per annum prescribed by
Ohio R.C. 5703.47 upon the amount of underpayment for the period of
underpayment, unless the underpayment is due to reasonable cause as described
in division (e) of this section. The amount of the underpayment shall be
determined as follows:
         A.   For the first payment of estimated taxes each year, twenty-two
and one-half per cent (22.5%) of the combined tax liability, less the amount of
taxes paid by the date prescribed for that payment;
         B.   For the second payment of estimated taxes each year, forty-five
per cent (45%) of the combined tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by
the date prescribed for that payment;
         C.   For the third payment of estimated taxes each year, sixty-seven
and one-half per cent (67.5%) of the combined tax liability, less the amount of
taxes paid by the date prescribed for that payment;
         D.   For the fourth payment of estimated taxes each year, ninety per
cent (90%) of the combined tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by the
date prescribed for that payment.
      (2)   The period of the underpayment shall run from the day the estimated
payment was required to be made to the date on which the payment is made. For
purposes of this section, a payment of estimated taxes on or before any payment
date shall be considered a payment of any previous underpayment only to the
extent the payment of estimated taxes exceeds the amount of the payment
presently due.
      (3)   All amounts collected under this section shall be considered as
taxes collected under Sections
142.80 to
142.95 of the Codified Ordinances  and shall be credited and distributed to
municipal corporations in accordance with Ohio R.C. 718.83.
   (e)   An underpayment of any portion of a combined tax liability shall be
due to reasonable cause
and the penalty imposed by this section shall not be added to the taxes for the
taxable year if any of the following apply:
      (1)   The amount of estimated taxes that were paid equals at least ninety
per cent (90%) of the combined tax liability for the current taxable year,
determined by annualizing the income received during the year up to the end of
the month immediately preceding the month in which the payment is due.
      (2)   The amount of estimated taxes that were paid equals at least one
hundred per cent (100%) of the tax liability shown on the return of the
taxpayer for the preceding taxable year, provided that the immediately
preceding taxable year reflected a period of twelve months and the taxpayer
filed a municipal income tax return for that year.
(Ord. A-2921.  Passed 2-12-18.)
142.89   ADDITIONAL PENALTIES.
   (a)   In addition to any other penalty imposed by Sections
142.80 to
142.95 of the Codified Ordinances  or Ohio R.C. Chapter 5703, the following
penalties shall apply:
      (1)   If a taxpayer required to file a tax return under Sections
142.80 to
142.95 of the Codified Ordinances  fails to make and file the return within the
time prescribed, including any extensions of time granted by the state tax
commissioner, the commissioner may impose a penalty not exceeding twenty-five
dollars ($25.00) per month or fraction of a month, for each month or fraction
of a month elapsing between the due date, including extensions of the due date,
and the date on which the return is filed. The aggregate penalty, per instance,
under this division shall not exceed one hundred fifty dollars ($150.00).
      (2)   If a person required to file a tax return electronically under
Sections
142.80 to
142.95 of the Codified Ordinances  fails to do so, the commissioner may impose
a penalty not to exceed the following:
         A.   For each of the first two failures, five per cent (5%) of the
amount required to be reported on the return;
         B.   For the third and any subsequent failure, ten per cent (10%) of
the amount required to be reported on the return.
      (3)   If a taxpayer that has made the election allowed under Section
142.80 of the Codified Ordinances  fails to timely pay an amount of tax
required to be paid under this chapter, the commissioner may impose a penalty
equal to fifteen per cent (15%) of the amount not timely paid.
      (4)   If a taxpayer files what purports to be a tax return required by
Sections
142.80 to
142.95 of the Codified Ordinances  that does not contain information upon which
the substantial correctness of the return may be judged or contains information
that on its face indicates that the return is substantially incorrect, and the
filing of the return in that manner is due to a position that is frivolous or a
desire that is apparent from the return to delay or impede the administration
of Sections
142.80 to
142.95 of the Codified Ordinances , a penalty of up to five hundred dollars
($500.00) may be imposed.
      (5)   If a taxpayer makes a fraudulent attempt to evade the reporting or
payment of the tax required to be shown on any return required under Sections
142.80 to
142.95 of the Codified Ordinances , a penalty may be imposed not exceeding the
greater of one thousand dollars ($1,000.00) or one hundred per cent (100%) of
the tax required to be shown on the return.
      (6)   If any person makes a false or fraudulent claim for a refund under
Section
142.91 of the Codified Ordinances , a penalty may be imposed not exceeding the
greater of one thousand dollars ($1,000.00) or one hundred per cent (100%) of
the claim. Any penalty imposed under this division, any refund issued on the
claim, and interest on any refund from the date of the refund, may be assessed
under Section 142.90 of the Codified Ordinances  without regard to any time
limitation for the assessment imposed by division (a) of that section.
   (b)   For purposes of this section, the tax required to be shown on a tax
return shall be reduced by the amount of any part of the tax paid on or before
the date, including any extensions of the date, prescribed for filing the
return.
   (c)   Each penalty imposed under this section shall be in addition to any
other penalty imposed under this section. All or part of any penalty imposed
under this section may be abated by the state tax commissioner. The
commissioner may adopt rules governing the imposition and abatement of such
penalties.
   (d)   All amounts collected under this section shall be considered as taxes
collected under Sections
142.80 to
142.95 of the Codified Ordinances  and shall be credited and distributed to
municipal corporations in the same proportion as the underlying tax liability
is required to be distributed to such municipal corporations under Ohio R.C.
718.83.
(Ord. A-2921.  Passed 2-12-18.)
142.90   ASSESSMENTS AGAINST TAXPAYER.
   (a)   (1)   If any taxpayer required to file a return under Sections
142.80 to
142.95 of the Codified Ordinances  fails to file the return within the time
prescribed, files an incorrect return, or fails to remit the full amount of the
tax due for the period covered by the return, the state tax commissioner may
make an assessment against the taxpayer for any deficiency for the period for
which the return or tax is due, based upon any information in the
commissioner's possession.
      (2)   The state tax commissioner shall not make or issue an assessment
against a taxpayer more than three years after the later of the date the return
subject to assessment was required to be filed or the date the return was
filed. Such time limit may be extended if both the taxpayer and the
commissioner consent in writing to the extension. Any such extension shall
extend the three-year time limit in Section
142.91 of the Codified Ordinances  for the same period of time. There shall be
no bar or limit to an assessment against a taxpayer that fails to file a return
subject to assessment as required by Sections
142.80 to
142.95 of the Codified Ordinances , or that files a fraudulent return. The
commissioner shall give the taxpayer assessed written notice of the assessment
as provided in Ohio R.C. 5703.37. With the notice, the commissioner shall
provide instructions on how to petition for reassessment and request a hearing
on the petition.
   (b)   Unless the taxpayer assessed files with the state tax commissioner
within sixty days after service of the notice of assessment, either personally
or by certified mail, a written petition for reassessment signed by the
authorized agent of the taxpayer assessed having knowledge of the facts, the
assessment becomes final, and the amount of the assessment is due and payable
from the taxpayer to the treasurer of state. The petition shall indicate the
taxpayer's objections, but additional objections may be raised in writing if
received by the commissioner prior to the date shown on the final
determination. If the petition has been properly filed, the commissioner shall
proceed under Ohio R.C. 5703.60.
   (c)   After an assessment becomes final, if any portion of the assessment
remains unpaid, including accrued interest, a certified copy of the state tax
commissioner's entry making the assessment final may be filed in the office of
the clerk of the court of common pleas in the county in which the taxpayer has
an office or place of business in this state, the county in which the
taxpayer's statutory agent is located, or Franklin County.
      (1)   Immediately upon the filing of the entry, the clerk shall enter a
judgment against the taxpayer assessed in the amount shown on the entry. The
judgment may be filed by the clerk in a loose-leaf book entitled "special
judgments for municipal income taxes," and shall have the same effect as other
judgments. Execution shall issue upon the judgment upon the request of the
state tax commissioner, and all laws applicable to sales on execution shall
apply to sales made under the judgment.
      (2)   If the assessment is not paid in its entirety within sixty days
after the day the assessment was issued, the portion of the assessment
consisting of tax due shall bear interest at the rate per annum prescribed by
section 5703.47 of the Revised Code from the day the commissioner issues the
assessment until the assessment is paid or until it is certified to the
attorney general for collection under section 131.02 of the Revised Code,
whichever comes first. If the unpaid portion of the assessment is certified to
the attorney general for collection, the entire unpaid portion of the
assessment shall bear interest at the rate per annum prescribed by Ohio R.C.
5703.47 from the date of certification until the date it is paid in its
entirety. Interest shall be paid in the same manner as the tax and may be
collected by issuing an assessment under this section.
   (d)   All money collected under this section shall be credited to the
municipal income tax fund and distributed to the municipal corporation to which
the money is owed based on the assessment issued under this section.
   (e)   If the state tax commissioner believes that collection of the tax will
be jeopardized unless proceedings to collect or secure collection of the tax
are instituted without delay, the commissioner may issue a jeopardy assessment
against the taxpayer liable for the tax. Immediately upon the issuance of the
jeopardy assessment, the commissioner shall file an entry with the clerk of the
court of common pleas in the manner prescribed by division (c) of this section.
Notice of the jeopardy assessment shall be served on the taxpayer assessed or
the taxpayer's legal representative in the manner provided in Ohio R.C. 5703.37
within five days of the filing of the entry with the clerk. The total amount
assessed is immediately due and payable, unless the taxpayer assessed files a
petition for reassessment in accordance with division (b) of this section and
provides security in a form satisfactory to the commissioner and in an amount
sufficient to satisfy the unpaid balance of the assessment. Full or partial
payment of the assessment does not prejudice the commissioner's consideration
of the petition for reassessment.
   (f)   (1)   Notwithstanding the fact that a petition for reassessment is
pending, the taxpayer may pay all or a portion of the assessment that is the
subject of the petition. The acceptance of a payment by the treasurer of state
does not prejudice any claim for refund upon final determination of the
petition.
      (2)   If upon final determination of the petition an error in the
assessment is corrected by the state tax commissioner, upon petition so filed
or pursuant to a decision of the board of tax appeals or any court to which the
determination or decision has been appealed, so that the amount due from the
taxpayer under the corrected assessment is less than the portion paid, there
shall be issued to the taxpayer, its assigns, or legal representative a refund
in the amount of the overpayment as provided by Section
142.91 of the Codified Ordinances , with interest on that amount as provided by
that section.
(Ord. A-2921.  Passed 2-12-18.)
142.91   REFUND APPLICATIONS.
   (a)   An application to refund to a taxpayer the amount of taxes paid on any
illegal, erroneous, or excessive payment of tax under Sections
142.80 to
142.95 of the Codified Ordinances, including assessments, shall be filed with
the state tax commissioner within three years after the date of the illegal,
erroneous, or excessive payment of the tax, or within any additional period
allowed by Section
142.90(a) of the Codified Ordinances. The application shall be filed in the
form prescribed by the state tax commissioner.
   (b)   (1)   On the filing of a refund application, the state tax
commissioner shall determine the amount of refund to which the applicant is
entitled. The amount determined shall be based on the amount overpaid per
return or assessment. If the amount is greater than ten dollars ($10.00) and
not less than that claimed, the commissioner shall certify that amount to the
director of budget and management and the treasurer of state for payment from
the tax refund fund created in Ohio R.C. 5703.052. If the amount is greater
than ten dollars ($10.00) but less than that claimed, the commissioner shall
proceed in accordance with Ohio R.C. 5703.70.
      (2)   Upon issuance of a refund under this section, the commissioner
shall notify each municipal corporation of the amount refunded to the taxpayer
attributable to that municipal corporation, which shall be deducted from the
municipal corporation's next distribution under Ohio R.C. 718.83.
   (c)   Any portion of a refund determined under division (b) of this section
that is not issued within
ninety days after such determination shall bear interest at the rate per annum
prescribed by Ohio R.C. 5703.47 from the ninety-first day after such
determination until the day the refund is paid or credited. On an illegal or
erroneous assessment, interest shall be paid at that rate from the date of
payment on the illegal or erroneous assessment until the day the refund is paid
or credited.
(Ord. A-2921.  Passed 2-12-18.)
142.92   AMENDED RETURNS.
   (a)   If any of the facts, figures, computations, or attachments required in
an annual return filed by a taxpayer that has made the election allowed under
Section
142.80 of the Codified Ordinances  and used to determine the tax due under
Sections
142.80 to
142.95 of the Codified Ordinances  must be altered as the result of an
adjustment to the taxpayer's federal income tax return, whether initiated by
the taxpayer or the Internal Revenue Service, and such alteration affects the
taxpayer's tax liability under those sections, the taxpayer shall file an
amended return with the state tax commissioner in such form as the commissioner
requires. The amended return shall be filed not later than sixty days after the
adjustment is agreed upon or finally determined for federal income tax purposes
or after any federal income tax deficiency or refund, or the abatement or
credit resulting therefrom, has been assessed or paid, whichever occurs first.
If a taxpayer intends to file an amended consolidated municipal income tax
return, or to amend its type of return from a separate return to a consolidated
return, based on the taxpayer's consolidated federal income tax return, the
taxpayer shall notify the commissioner before filing the amended return.
   (b)   In the case of an underpayment, the amended return shall be
accompanied by payment of any combined additional tax due together with any
penalty and interest thereon. An amended return required by this section is a
return subject to assessment under Section
142.90 of the Codified Ordinances for the purpose of assessing any additional
tax due under this section, together with any applicable penalty and interest.
The amended return shall not reopen those facts, figures, computations, or
attachments from a previously filed return no longer subject to assessment that
are not affected, either directly or indirectly, by the adjustment to the
taxpayer's federal tax return.
   (c)   In the case of an overpayment, an application for refund may be filed
under this division within the sixty-day period prescribed for filing the
amended return, even if that period extends beyond the period prescribed in
Section
142.91 of the Codified Ordinances , if the application otherwise conforms to
the requirements of that section. An application filed under this division
shall claim refund of overpayments resulting from alterations to only those
facts, figures, computations, or attachments required in the taxpayer's annual
return that are affected, either directly or indirectly, by the adjustment to
the taxpayer's federal income tax return unless it is also filed within the
time prescribed in Section
142.91 of the Codified Ordinances . The application shall not reopen those
facts, figures, computations, or attachments that are not affected, either
directly or indirectly, by the adjustment to the taxpayer's federal income tax
return.
(Ord. A-2921.  Passed 2-12-18.)
142.93   EXAMINATION OF RECORDS AND OTHER DOCUMENTS AND PERSONS.
   (a)   The state tax commissioner, or any authorized agent or employee
thereof, may examine the books, papers, records, and federal and state income
tax returns of any taxpayer or other person that is subject to Sections
142.80 to
142.95 of the Codified Ordinances  for the purpose of verifying the accuracy of
any return made or, if no return was filed, to ascertain the tax due as
required under those sections. Upon written request by the commissioner or a
duly authorized agent or employee thereof, every taxpayer or other person
subject to this section is required to furnish the opportunity for the
commissioner, authorized agent, or employee to investigate and examine such
books, papers, records, and federal and state income tax returns at a
reasonable time and place designated in the request.
   (b)   The records and other documents of any taxpayer or other person that
is subject to Sections
142.80 to
142.95 of the Codified Ordinances  shall be open to the state tax
commissioner's inspection during business hours and shall be preserved for a
period of six years following the end of the taxable year to which the records
or documents relate, unless the commissioner, in writing, consents to their
destruction within that period, or by order requires that they be kept longer.
The commissioner may require any person, by notice served on that person, to
keep such records as the commissioner determines necessary to show whether or
not that person is liable, and the extent of such liability, for the income tax
levied by a municipal corporation.
   (c)   The state tax commissioner may examine under oath any person that the
commissioner reasonably believes has knowledge concerning any income that was

   (a)   All State routes are hereby designated as through highways, provided
that stop signs, yield signs or traffic control signals are erected at all
intersections with such through highways, except as otherwise provided in this
section. Where two or more State routes that are through highways intersect and
no traffic control signal is in operation,  stop signs  or yield signs  shall
be erected  at one or more entrances thereto by the Ohio Department of
Transportation, except as otherwise provided in this section.
   Whenever the Ohio Director of Transportation determines, on the basis of an
engineering and traffic investigation, that stop signs are necessary to stop
traffic on a through highway for safe and efficient operation, nothing in this
section shall be construed to prevent such installations. When circumstances
warrant, the Director also may omit stop signs on roadways intersecting through
highways under his or her jurisdiction. Before the Director either installs or
removes the stop sign under this subsection, he or she shall give notice, in
writing, of that proposed action to the Municipality at least thirty days
before installing or removing the stop sign.
   (b)   Other streets or highways, or portions thereof, are hereby designated
through highways if they are within the Municipality, if they have a continuous
length of more than one mile between the limits of such street or highway, or
portion thereof, and if they have "stop" or "yield" signs or traffic control
signals at the entrances of the majority of intersecting streets or highways.
For purposes of this section, the limits of such street or highway, or portion
thereof, shall be a Municipal corporation line, the physical terminus of the
street or highway, or any point on such street or highway at which vehicular
traffic thereon is required by regulatory signs to stop or yield to traffic on
the intersecting street, provided that in residence districts, the Municipality
may, by ordinance, designate such street or highway, or portion thereof, not to
be a through street or highway, and thereafter the affected residence district
shall be indicated by official traffic control devices. Where two or more
through highways designated under this subsection intersect and no traffic
control signal is in operation, stop signs or yield signs shall be erected at
one or more entrances thereto by the Ohio Department of Transportation or by
local authority, except as otherwise provided in this section.
   (c)   Stop signs need not be erected at intersections so constructed as to
permit traffic to safely enter a through street or highway without coming to a
stop. Signs shall be erected at such intersections indicating that the operator
of a vehicle shall yield the right of way or merge with all traffic proceeding
on the through street or highway.
   (d)   Council or the authorized local authority may designate additional
through streets or highways and shall erect stop signs, yield signs or traffic
control signals at all streets and highways intersecting such through streets
or highways, or may designate any intersection as a stop or yield intersection
and shall erect like signs at one or more entrances to such intersection.

are permitted to proceed straight through or turn right or left or make a u-
turn movement except as such movement is modified by a lane-use sign, turn
prohibition sign, lane marking, roadway design, separate turn signal
indication, or other traffic control device. Such vehicular traffic, including
vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn movement, shall yield the
right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn
movement to the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching
from the opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard
during the time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the
intersection.
      (2)   Vehicular traffic facing a green arrow signal indication, displayed
alone or in combination with another signal indication, are permitted to
cautiously enter the intersection only to make the movement indicated by such
arrow, or such other movement as is permitted by other indications displayed at
the same time. Such vehicular traffic, including vehicles turning right or left
or making a u-turn movement, shall yield the right-of-way to both of the
following:
         A.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
         B.   Other traffic lawfully using the intersection.
      (3)   A.   Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication,
as provided in R.C. § 4511.14, pedestrians facing a circular green signal
indication are permitted to proceed across the roadway within any marked or
unmarked associated crosswalk. The pedestrian shall yield the right- of-way to

means that a pedestrian facing the signal indication is permitted to start to
cross the roadway in the direction of the signal indication, possibly in
conflict with turning vehicles. The pedestrian shall yield the right-of-way to
vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the walking person
signal indication is first shown.
   (b)   A flashing upraised hand signal indication, which symbolizes “don't
walk”, means that a pedestrian shall not start to cross the roadway in the
direction of the signal indication, but that any pedestrian who has already
started to cross on a steady walking person signal indication shall proceed to
the far side of the traveled way of the street or highway, unless otherwise
directed by a traffic control device to proceed only to the median of a divided
highway or only to some other island or pedestrian refuge area.

than will permit him or her to bring it to a stop within the assured clear
distance ahead.
   (b)   It is prima facie lawful, in the absence of a lower limit declared or
established pursuant to this section by the Director of Transportation or local
authorities, for the operator of a motor vehicle to operate the same at a speed
not exceeding the following:
      (1)   A.   Twenty miles per hour in school zones during school recess and
while children are going to or leaving school during the opening or closing
hours, and when twenty miles per hour school speed limit signs are erected,
except that on controlled- access highways and expressways, if the right-of-way
line fence has been erected without pedestrian opening, the speed shall be
governed by division (b)(4) of this section, and on freeways, if the right-of-
way line fence has been erected without pedestrian opening, the speed shall be
governed by divisions(b)(10) and (b)(11) of this section. The end of every
school zone may be marked by a sign indicating the end of the zone. Nothing in
this section or in the Manual and Specifications for a Uniform System of
Traffic-Control Devices shall be construed to require school zones to be
indicated by signs equipped with flashing or other lights, or giving other
special notice of the hours in which the school zone speed limit is in effect.
         B.   As used in this section, “school” means any school chartered
under Ohio R.C. 3301.16 and any nonchartered school that during the preceding
year filed with the Department of Education in compliance with O.A.C. 3301-35-
08, a copy of the school's report for the parents of the school's pupils
certifying that the school meets State minimum standards for nonchartered,
nontax-supported schools and presents evidence of this filing to the
jurisdiction from which it is requesting the establishment of a school zone. 
“School” also includes a special elementary school that in writing requests the

local authorities for streets and highways under their jurisdiction and that
portion of a State highway under the jurisdiction of the Director of
Transportation or a request from a County Engineer in the case of a school zone
for a special elementary school, the Director may extend the traditional school
zone boundaries. The distances in divisions (b)(1)C.1. through 3. below shall
not exceed 300 feet per approach per direction, and are bounded by whichever of
the following distances or combination thereof the Director approves as most
appropriate:
            1.   The distance encompassed by projecting the school building
lines normal to the fronting highway and extending a distance of 300 feet on
each approach direction;
            2.   The distance encompassed by projecting the school property
lines intersecting the fronting highway and extending a distance of 300 feet on
each approach direction;
            3.   The distance encompassed by the special marking of the
pavement for a principal school pupil crosswalk plus a distance of 300 feet on
each approach direction of the highway.
         D.   Nothing in this section shall be construed to invalidate the
Director's initial action on August 9, 1976, establishing all school zones at
the traditional school zone boundaries defined by projecting school property
lines, except when those boundaries are extended as provided in divisions (b)
(1)A. and (b)(1)C. of this section.
         E.   As used in this division, “crosswalk” has the meaning given that
term in Ohio R.C. 4511.01(LL)(2).
         F.   The Director may, upon request by resolution of the Legislative
Authority and upon submission by the Municipality of such engineering, traffic,
and other information as the Director considers necessary, designate a school
zone on any portion of a State route lying within the Municipality that
includes a crosswalk customarily used by children going to or leaving a school
during recess and opening and closing hours, whenever the distance, as measured
in a straight line, from the school property line nearest the crosswalk to the
nearest point of a crosswalk is no more than 1,320 feet. Such a school zone
shall include the distance encompassed by the crosswalk and extending 300 feet
in each appropriate direction of the State route.

district in which the special elementary school is located indicating the total
number of students enrolled at the school, but otherwise the principal or other
person in charge does not report any other information or data to the
superintendent.

Municipality, except on State routes outside business districts, through
highways outside business districts, and alleys;

occupant restraining device impossible or impractical, provided that the person
operating the vehicle has safely and appropriately restrained the child in
accordance with any recommendations of the physician or chiropractor as noted
on the affidavit.
   (i)   Nothing in this section shall be construed to require any person to
carry with the person the birth certificate of a child to prove the age of the
child, but the production of a valid birth certificate for a child showing that
the child was not of an age to which this section applies is a defense against
any ticket, citation or summons issued for violating this section.

            2.   Upon any highway under the jurisdiction of municipality except
those highways with a condition insufficient to bear the weight of the vehicle
or combination of vehicles as stated in the application.
            3.   Issuance of a special regional heavy hauling permit is subject
to the payment of a fee established by the municipality in accordance with this
section.
         B.   In circumstances where a person is not eligible to receive a
permit under division (a)(1)A. of this section, the municipality, with respect
to highways under its jurisdiction, upon application in writing and for good
cause shown, may issue a special permit in writing authorizing the applicant to
operate or move a vehicle or combination of vehicles of a size or weight of
vehicle or load exceeding the maximum specified in Ohio R.C. 5577.01 through

issued by the Director of Transportation under Ohio R.C. 4513.34 may move the
vehicle or combination of vehicles described in the permit on any highway that
is a part of the state highway system when the movement is partly within and
partly without the corporate limits of the municipality. No local authority
shall require any other permit or license or charge any license fee or other
charge against the holder of a permit for the movement of a vehicle or
combination of vehicles on any highway which is a part of the state highway
system. The Ohio Director of Transportation shall not require the holder of a
permit issued by the municipality to obtain a special permit for the movement
of vehicles or combination of vehicles on highways within the jurisdiction of
the municipality. Permits may be issued for any period of time not to exceed
one year, as the local authority in its discretion determines advisable or for
the duration of any public construction project.
      (3)   A.   The application for a permit issued under this section shall
be in the form that the municipality prescribes. The municipality may prescribe
a permit fee to be imposed and collected when any permit described in this
section is issued. The permit fee may be in an amount sufficient to reimburse
the municipality for the administrative costs incurred in issuing the permit,
and also to cover the cost of normal and expected damage caused to the roadway
or a street or highway structure as the result of the operation of the
nonconforming vehicle or combination of vehicles.
         B.   For the purposes of this section and of rules adopted by the
Director under Ohio R.C. 4513.34, milk transported in bulk by vehicle is deemed
a nondivisible load.
         C.   For purposes of this section and of rules adopted by the Director
under Ohio R.C. 4513.34, three or fewer aluminum coils, transported by a
vehicle, are deemed a nondivisible load. The Director shall adopt rules
establishing requirements for an aluminum coil permit that are substantially
similar to the requirements for a steel coil permit under O.A.C. Chapter 5501:
2-1.
      (4)   The municipality shall issue a special regional heavy hauling
permit under division (a)(1)A. of this section upon application and payment of
the applicable fee. However, the municipality may issue or withhold a special
permit specified in division (a)(1)B. of this section. If a permit is to be
issued, the municipality may limit or prescribe conditions of operation for the
vehicle and may require the posting of a bond or other security conditioned
upon the sufficiency of the permit fee to compensate for damage caused to the
roadway or a street or highway structure. In addition, the municipality, as a
condition of issuance of an overweight permit, may require the applicant to
develop and enter into a mutual agreement with the municipality to compensate
for or to repair excess damage caused to the roadway by travel under the
permit.
      (5)   Every permit issued under this section shall be carried in the
vehicle or combination of vehicles to which it refers and shall be open to
inspection by any police officer or authorized agent of any authority granting
the permit. No person shall violate any of the terms of a permit.
      (6)   The Director of Transportation may debar an applicant from applying
for a special permit under this section upon a finding based on a reasonable
belief that the applicant has done any of the actions specified in Ohio R.C.
4513.34(F).
      (7)   Notice and procedures for debarment shall be as provided in Ohio
R.C. 4513.34(G).
      (8)   A.   No person shall violate the terms of a permit issued under
this section that relate to gross load limits.
         B.   No person shall violate the terms of a permit issued under this
section that relate to axle load by more than 2,000 pounds per axle or group of
axles.
         C.   No person shall violate the terms of a permit issued under this
section that relate to an approved route except upon order of a law enforcement
officer or authorized agent of the issuing authority.
      (9)   A permit issued by the municipality under this section for the
operation of a vehicle or combination of vehicles is valid for the purposes of
the vehicle operation in accordance with the conditions and limitations
specified on the permit. Such a permit is voidable by law enforcement only for
operation of a vehicle or combination of vehicles in violation of the weight,
dimension, or route provisions of the permit. However, a permit is not voidable
for operation in violation of a route provision of a permit if the operation is
upon the order of a law enforcement officer.

vehicle or combination of vehicles by designating the route, hours, speed or
such other restrictions as may be necessary for the preservation of the public
peace, property, health and safety. The City Manager may require the posting of
bond or other security necessary to compensate for any damage to a roadway or
road structure.
      (4)   Violation of any of the limitations, terms or conditions of the
permission granted by the City Manager shall be cause for immediate revocation
or suspension of such permission and denial of request for any future
permission. Such violation shall also subject the violator to the penalty
prescribed in Sections

339.10   WEIGHING VEHICLE; REMOVAL OF EXCESS LOAD.
   Any police officer having reason to believe that the weight of a vehicle and
its load is unlawful may require the driver of the vehicle to stop and submit
to a weighing of it by means of a compact, self- contained, portable sealed
scale specially adapted to determining the wheel loads of vehicles on highways;
a sealed scale permanently installed in a fixed location, having a load-
receiving element specially adapted to determining the wheel loads of highway
vehicles; a sealed scale, permanently installed in a fixed location, having a
load-receiving element specially adapted to determining the combined load of
all wheels on a single axle or on successive axles of a highway vehicle or a
sealed scale adapted to weighing highway vehicles, loaded or unloaded.
   The driver of such vehicle shall, if necessary, be directed to proceed to
the nearest available of such sealed scales to accomplish the weighing,
provided such scales are within three miles of the point where such vehicle is
stopped. Any vehicle stopped in accordance with this section may be held by the
police officer for a reasonable time only to accomplish the weighing as
prescribed by this section. All scales used in determining the lawful weight of
a vehicle and its load shall be annually compared by a municipal, county or
State sealer with the State standards or standards approved by the State, and
such scales shall not be sealed if they do not conform to the State standards
or standards approved by the State.
   At each end by a permanently installed scale, there shall be a straight
approach in the same plane as the platform, of sufficient length and width to
insure the level positioning of vehicles during weight determinations. During
determination of weight by compact, self-contained, portable sealed scales,
they shall be used on terrain of sufficient length and width to accommodate the
entire vehicle being weighed.
   Whenever such officer, upon weighing a vehicle and load, determines that the
weight is unlawful, he may require the driver to stop the vehicle in a suitable
place and remain standing until such portion of the load is removed as is
necessary to reduce the weight of such vehicle to the limit permitted under
Ohio R.C. 5577.01 to 5577.14, inclusive, and this chapter.

another vehicle, such drawbar or other connection shall be of a length such as
will limit the spacing between nearest axles of the respective vehicles to a
distance not in excess of twelve feet and six inches.
   (g)   As used in division (b) of this section, “tandem axle” means two or
more consecutive axles whose centers may be included between parallel
transverse vertical planes spaced more than forty inches but not more than
ninety-six inches apart, extending across the full width of the vehicle.
   (h)   This section does not apply to passenger bus type vehicles operated by
a regional transit authority pursuant to Ohio R.C. 306.30 to 306.54.
   (i)   Either division (b) or (d) of this section applies to the weight of a
vehicle and its load imposed upon any road surface that is not a part of the
interstate system by vehicles with pneumatic tires. As between divisions (b)
and (d) of this section, only the division that yields the highest total gross
vehicle weight limit shall be applied to any such vehicle. Once that division
is determined, only the limits contained in the subdivisions of that division
shall apply to that vehicle.

imprisonment.
      (1)   Arrest or conviction for a violation of subsection (b)(1)(A). or

contained in any application for employment, license, or other right or
privilege, or made in connection with the person’s appearance as a witness.
      (2)   Every fine collected under this division shall be paid by the Clerk

351.05  WILLFULLY LEAVING VEHICLES ON PRIVATE OR PUBLIC PROPERTY.
   (a)   Impounding Abandoned Motor Vehicle on Public Property; Notice;
Disposition.
      (1)   The one having enforcement authority under this Chapter 351 may
order into storage any motor vehicle, including an abandoned junk motor vehicle
as defined in R.C. § 4513.63, that has come into the possession of the City as
the result of the exercise of the enforcement authority granted herein or that
has been left on a public street or other property open to the public for
purposes of vehicular travel, or upon or within the right-of-way of any road or
highway, for 48 hours or longer without notification to City and prior approval
by the City Manager, Police Chief or their designee, of the reasons for leaving
the motor vehicle in such place, except that when such motor vehicle
constitutes an obstruction to traffic, it may be ordered into storage
immediately. The one having enforcement authority hereunder shall designate the
place of storage of any motor vehicle so ordered removed.
      (2)   The one having enforcement authority hereunder shall within a
reasonable time, cause a search to be made of the records of the Bureau of
Motor Vehicles to ascertain the owner and any lienholder of a motor vehicle
ordered into storage; and if known, shall send or cause to be sent notice to
the owner or lienholder at his or her last known address by certified mail with
return receipt requested, that the motor vehicle will be declared a nuisance
and disposed of if not claimed within ten days of the date of mailing of the
notice. The owner or lienholder of the motor vehicle may reclaim it upon
payment of any expenses or charges incurred in its removal and storage, and
presentation of proof of ownership, which may be evidenced by a certificate of
title or memorandum certificate of title to the motor vehicle. If the owner or
lienholder of the motor vehicle reclaims it after a search of the records of
the Bureau has been conducted and after notice has been sent to the owner or
lienholder as described in this section, and the search was conducted by the
owner of the place of storage or the owner's employee, and the notice was sent
to the motor vehicle owner by the owner of the place of storage or the owner's
employee, the owner or lienholder shall pay to the place of storage a
processing fee of $25, in addition to any expenses or charges incurred in the
removal and storage of the vehicle.
      (3)   If the owner or lienholder makes no claim to the motor vehicle
within ten days of the date of mailing the notice, and if the vehicle can be
disposed of at public auction as provided in R.C. § 4513.62, the City, without
charge to any party, shall file with the Clerk of Courts of the county in which
the place of storage is located an affidavit showing compliance with the
requirements of R.C. § 4513.61. Upon presentation of the affidavit, the Clerk,
without charge, shall issue a salvage certificate of title, free and clear of
all liens and encumbrances, to the City of Sidney. If the vehicle is to be
disposed of to a motor vehicle salvage dealer or other facility as provided in
R.C. § 4513.62, the Police Chief or designee shall execute in triplicate an
affidavit, as prescribed by the registrar of motor vehicles, describing the
motor vehicle and the manner in which it was disposed, and that all
requirements of R.C. § 4513.61 have been complied with. The Police Chief, or
designee shall retain the original of the affidavit, and shall furnish two
copies to the motor vehicle salvage dealer or other facility. Upon presentation
of a copy of the affidavit by the motor vehicle salvage, the Clerk of Courts,
within 30 days of the presentation, will issue to such owner a salvage
certificate of title, free and clear of all liens and encumbrances.
      (4)   Whenever a motor vehicle salvage dealer or other facility receives
such an affidavit for the disposal of a motor vehicle as provided in this
section, the dealer or facility is not required to obtain a state certificate
of title to the motor vehicle in the dealer's or facility's own name if the
vehicle is dismantled or destroyed and both copies of the affidavit are
delivered to the Clerk of Courts.
   (b)   Abandonment of Junk Motor Vehicle Prohibited.
      (1)   No person shall willfully leave an abandoned junk motor vehicle, as
defined in R.C. § 4513.63, on private property for more than 72 hours without
the permission of the person having the right to the possession of the
property, or on a public street or other property open to the public for
purposes of vehicular travel or parking, or upon or within the right-of-way of
any road or highway for 48 hours or longer, without notification to the City
Manager, Police Chief, or their designee of the reason for leaving the motor
vehicle in that place and receiving appropriate approval.
      (2)   For purposes of this division (b)(1), the fact that a motor vehicle
has been so left without permission or notification is prima facie evidence of
abandonment.
      (3)   Nothing contained in this section and R.C. §§ 4513.60, 4513.61 and
4513.63 shall invalidate or prevent the enactment of further provisions of
municipal ordinances regulating or prohibiting the abandonment of motor
vehicles on streets, highways, public property or private property within the
municipality.
   (c)   Whoever violates any of the provisions of this section is guilty of a
minor misdemeanor and shall be subject to the penalty provided in Section
307.01 and shall also be assessed any costs incurred by the Municipality in
disposing of a vehicle or abandoned junk motor vehicle, less any money accruing
to the Municipality from such disposal.

charge for towing shall not exceed $150, and the storage charge shall not
exceed $20 per 24-hour period, if the vehicle has a manufacturer’s gross
vehicle weight rating in excess of 10,000 pounds and is a truck, bus or a

private tow-away zone in accordance with division (c)(1) without the consent of
the owner of the property or in violation of any posted parking condition or
regulation, the owner or the owner’s agent may remove, or cause the removal of,
the vehicle, the owner and the operator of the vehicle shall be deemed to have
consented to the removal and storage of the vehicle and to the payment of the
towing and storage charges specified in division (c)(l)A.3. of this section,
and the owner, subject to division (d) of this section, may recover a vehicle
that has been so removed only in accordance with division (f) of this section.
      (3)   If the municipality requires tow trucks and tow truck operators to
be licensed, no owner of private property located within the municipality shall
remove or shall cause the removal and storage of any vehicle pursuant to
division (c)(2) of this section by an unlicensed tow truck or unlicensed tow
truck operator.

parking ticket fines under the conditions set forth in this section. The person
receiving the ticket shall present the ticket to the Chief of Police within
seven calendar days and ask for relief by completing an affidavit form, which
attests that the person driving the violating vehicle was unable to comply with
the parking regulations for one of the following recognized reasons:
      (1)   The person was actively serving on jury duty.
      (2)   The vehicle was being used by a public safety department of the
State or other local government, and the activity that the law enforcement
employee was engaged in prohibited or made it impractical for the movement of
the vehicle to accommodate the City's parking regulations.
      (3)   Permission was provided by the Police Chief for the vehicle to be
parked in the location, due to extraordinary circumstances.
      (4)   The driver was unable to comply with the parking regulations
because of circumstances which were beyond the control of the driver.
Inconvenience to the driver is not a sufficient reason for waiver under this
paragraph.
   (b)   Each request will be subject to investigation by Police Department
personnel to determine the validity of the request. The action of the Chief of
Police does not constitute a voiding of the violation, but it is a waiver of
the fine for said violation.

Municipality has either exclusive or concurrent legislative jurisdiction. 
Where the boundary between this Municipality and another jurisdiction is

Municipality for purposes of this section.
   (d)   When an offense is committed under the laws of this Municipality, and

violation of either section shall be barred unless it is commenced within 25
years after the offense is committed.
   (b)   (1)   Except as otherwise provided in division (b)(2) of this section,
if the period of limitation provided in subsection (a)(1) or (3) hereof has
expired, prosecution shall be commenced for an offense of which an element is
fraud or breach of a fiduciary duty, within one year after discovery of the
offense either by an aggrieved person, or by the aggrieved person’s legal
representative who is not a party to the offense.
      (2)   If the period of limitation provided in division (a)(1) or (a)(3)
of this section has expired, prosecution for a violation of Ohio R.C. 2913.49
shall be commenced within five years after discovery of the offense either by
an aggrieved person or the aggrieved person’s legal representative who is not a
party to the offense.
   (c)   (1)   If the period of limitation provided in subsection (a)(1) or (3)
hereof has expired, prosecution shall be commenced for the following offenses

offense is directly related to the misconduct in office of a public servant, at
any time while that public servant remains a public servant, or within two
years thereafter.
      (2)   As used in this division:
         A.   The phrase “offense is directly related to the misconduct in
office of a public servant” includes, but is not limited to, a violation of
Ohio R.C. 101.71, 101.91, 121.61 or 2921.13, 102.03(F) or (H), 2921.02(A),

involving misconduct in office of a public servant, or a violation of any
municipal ordinance substantially equivalent to those Ohio Revised Code
sections listed in this division (c)(2)A.
         B.   “Public servant” has the same meaning as in Ohio R.C. 2921.01.
   (d)   (1)   If a DNA record made in connection with the criminal

of the determination is within 25 years after the offense is committed,
prosecution of that person for a violation of the section may be commenced
within the longer of 25 years after the offense is committed or five years
after the determination is complete.
      (3)   As used in this division, “DNA record” has the same meaning as in
Ohio R.C. 109.573.
   (e)   An offense is committed when every element of the offense occurs. In
the case of an offense of which an element is a continuing course of conduct,
the period of limitation does not begin to run until such course of conduct or
the accused's accountability for it terminates, whichever occurs first.
   (f)   A prosecution is commenced on the date an indictment is returned or an
information filed, or on the date a lawful arrest without a warrant is made, or
on the date a warrant, summons, citation or other process is issued, whichever
occurs first. A prosecution is not commenced by the return of an indictment or
the filing of an information unless reasonable diligence is exercised to issue
and execute process on the same. A prosecution is not commenced upon issuance
of a warrant, summons, citation or other process, unless reasonable diligence
is exercised to execute the same.
   (g)   The period of limitation shall not run during any time when the corpus
delicti remains undiscovered.
   (h)   The period of limitation shall not run during any time when the
accused purposely avoids prosecution.  Proof that the accused departed this

evidence of the accused’s purpose to avoid prosecution.
   (i)   The period of limitation shall not run during any time a prosecution
against the accused based on the same conduct is pending in this State, even
though the indictment, information or process that commenced the prosecution is
quashed or the proceedings on the indictment, information, or process are set
aside or reversed on appeal.
   (j)   As used in this section, “peace officer” has the same meaning as in
Ohio R.C. 2935.01.
   (k)   The amendments to divisions (a) and (d) of this section apply to a

period of limitations set forth in Ohio R.C. 718.06(B) for violations of the
Municipal income tax ordinance.
501.07   REQUIREMENTS FOR CRIMINAL LIABILITY; VOLUNTARY INTOXICATION.
   (a)   Except as provided in subsection (b) hereof, a person is not guilty of
an offense unless both of the following apply:
      (1)   The person’s liability is based on conduct that includes either a
voluntary act, or an omission to perform an act or duty that the person is
capable of performing;
      (2)   The person has the requisite degree of culpability for each element
as to which a culpable mental state is specified by the section defining the
offense.
   (b)   When the language defining an offense does not specify any degree of
culpability, and plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict criminal
liability for the conduct described in the section, then culpability is not
required for a person to be guilty of the offense. The fact that one division
of a section plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict liability for an
offense defined in that division does not by itself plainly indicate a purpose
to impose strict criminal liability for an offense defined in other divisions
of the section that do not specify a degree of culpability.
   (c)   (1)   When language defining an element of an offense that is related
to knowledge or intent or to which mens rea could fairly be applied neither
specifies culpability nor plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict
liability, the element of the offense is established only if a person acts
recklessly.
      (2)   Division (c)(1) of this section does not apply to offenses defined
in Ohio R.C. Title XLV.
      (3)   Division (c)(1) of this section does not relieve the prosecution of
the burden of proving the culpable mental state required by any definition
incorporated into the offense.
   (d)   Voluntary intoxication may not be taken into consideration in
determining the existence of a mental state that is an element of a criminal
offense.  Voluntary intoxication does not relieve a person of a duty to act if
failure to act constitutes a criminal offense.  Evidence that a person was
voluntarily intoxicated may be admissible to show whether or not the person was
physically capable of performing the act with which the person is charged.
   (e)   As used in this section:
      (1)   Possession is a voluntary act if the possessor knowingly procured
or received the thing possessed, or was aware of the possessor’s control of the
thing possessed for a sufficient time to have ended possession.
      (2)   Reflexes, convulsions, body movements during unconsciousness or
sleep, and body movements that are not otherwise a product of the actor's
volition, are involuntary acts.
      (3)   “Culpability” means purpose, knowledge, recklessness or negligence,
as defined in Section 501.08.
      (4)   “Intoxication” includes, but is not limited to, intoxication
resulting from the ingestion of alcohol, a drug, or alcohol and a drug.
(ORC 2901.21)
501.08   CULPABLE MENTAL STATES.
   (a)   A person acts purposely when it is the person’s specific intention to
cause a certain result, or when the gist of the offense is a prohibition
against conduct of a certain nature, regardless of what the offender intends to
accomplish thereby, it is the offender’s specific intention to engage in
conduct of that nature.
   (b)   A person acts knowingly, regardless of purpose, when the person is
aware that the person’s conduct will probably cause a certain result or will
probably be of a certain nature. A person has knowledge of circumstances when
the person is aware that such circumstances probably exist. When knowledge of
the existence of a particular fact is an element of an offense, such knowledge
is established if a person subjectively believes that there is a high
probability of its existence and fails to make inquiry or acts with a conscious
purpose to avoid learning the fact.
   (c)   A person acts recklessly when, with heedless indifference to the
consequences, the person disregards a substantial and unjustifiable risk that
the person’s conduct is likely to cause a certain result or is likely to be of
a certain nature. A person is reckless with respect to circumstances when, with
heedless indifference to the consequences, the person disregards a substantial
and unjustifiable risk that such circumstances are likely to exist.
   (d)   A person acts negligently when, because of a substantial lapse from
due care, the person fails to perceive or avoid a risk that the person’s
conduct may cause a certain result or may be of a certain nature. A person is
negligent with respect to circumstances when, because of a substantial lapse
from due care, the person fails to perceive or avoid a risk that such
circumstances may exist.
   (e)   When the section defining an offense provides that negligence suffices
to establish an element thereof, then recklessness, knowledge or purpose is
also sufficient culpability for such element. When recklessness suffices to
establish an element of an offense, then knowledge or purpose is also
sufficient culpability for such element. When knowledge suffices to establish
an element of an offense, then purpose is also sufficient culpability for such
element.
(ORC 2901.22)
501.09   ATTEMPT.
   (a)   No person, purposely or knowingly, and when purpose or knowledge is
sufficient culpability for the commission of an offense under this General
Offenses Code, shall engage in conduct which, if successful, would constitute
or result in the offense.
   (b)   It is no defense to a charge under this section that, in retrospect,
commission of the offense which was the object of the attempt was either
factually or legally impossible under the attendant circumstances, if that
offense could have been committed had the attendant circumstances been as the
actor believed them to be.
   (c)   No person who is convicted of committing a specific offense, of
complicity in the commission of an offense, or of conspiracy to commit an
offense, shall be convicted of an attempt to commit the same offense in
violation of this section.
   (d)   It is an affirmative defense to a charge under this section that the
actor abandoned his or her effort to commit the offense or otherwise prevented
its commission, under circumstances manifesting a complete and voluntary
renunciation of his or her criminal purpose.
   (e)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of an attempt to commit an
offense.  An attempt to commit aggravated murder, murder, or an offense for
which the maximum penalty is imprisonment for life is a felony of the first
degree. An attempt to commit a drug abuse offense for which the penalty is
determined by the amount or number of unit doses of the controlled substance
involved in the drug abuse offense is an offense of the same degree as the drug
abuse offense attempted would be if that drug abuse offense had been committed
and had involved an amount or number of unit doses of the controlled substance
that is within the next lower range of controlled substance amounts than was
involved in the attempt. An attempt to commit any other offense is an offense
of the next lesser degree than the offense attempted. In the case of an attempt
to commit an offense not specifically classified, an attempt is a misdemeanor
of the first degree if the offense attempted is a felony, and a misdemeanor of
the fourth degree if the offense attempted is a misdemeanor. An attempt to
commit a minor misdemeanor, or to engage in conspiracy, is not an offense under
this section.
   (f)   As used in this section:
      (1)   “Drug abuse offense” has the same meaning as in Ohio R.C. 2925.01.
      (2)   “Motor vehicle” has the same meaning as in Ohio R.C. 4501.01.
(ORC 2923.02)
501.10   COMPLICITY.
   (a)   No person, acting with the kind of culpability required for the
commission of an offense, shall do any of the following:
      (1)   Solicit or procure another to commit the offense;
      (2)   Aid or abet another in committing the offense;
      (3)   Conspire with another to commit the offense in violation of Ohio
R.C. 2923.01 (Conspiracy);
      (4)   Cause an innocent or irresponsible person to commit the offense.
   (b)   It is no defense to a charge under this section that no person with
whom the accused was in complicity has been convicted as a principal offender.
   (c)   No person shall be convicted of complicity under this section unless
an offense is actually committed, but a person may be convicted of complicity
in an attempt to commit an offense in violation of Section
501.09.
   (d)   If an alleged accomplice of the defendant testifies against the
defendant in a case in which the defendant is charged with complicity in the
commission of or an attempt to commit an offense, an attempt to commit an
offense, or an offense, the court, when it charges the jury, shall state
substantially the following:
   "The testimony of an accomplice does not become inadmissible because of his
or her complicity, moral turpitude or self-interest, but the admitted or
claimed complicity of a witness may affect his or her credibility and make his
or her testimony subject to grave suspicion and require that it be weighed with
great caution.
   It is for you, as jurors, in the light of all the facts presented to you
from the witness stand, to evaluate such testimony and to determine its quality
and worth or its lack of quality and worth."
   (e)   It is an affirmative defense to a charge under this section that,
prior to the commission of or attempt to commit the offense, the actor
terminated his or her complicity under circumstances manifesting a complete and
voluntary renunciation of his or her criminal purpose.
   (f)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of complicity in the
commission of an offense, and shall be prosecuted and punished as if he or she
were the principal offender.  A charge of complicity may be stated in terms of
this section or in terms of the principal offense.

   (a)   An organization may be convicted of an offense under any of the
following circumstances:
      (1)   The offense is a minor misdemeanor committed by an officer, agent
or employee of the organization acting in its behalf and within the scope of
the officer’s, agent’s, or employee’s office or employment, except that if the
section defining the offense designates the officers, agents or employees for
whose conduct the organization is accountable or the circumstances under which
it is accountable, those provisions shall apply.
      (2)   A purpose to impose organizational liability plainly appears in the
section defining the offense, and the offense is committed by an officer, agent
or employee of the organization acting in its behalf and within the scope of
the officer’s, agent’s, or employee’s office or employment, except that if the
section defining the offense designates the officers, agents or employees for
whose conduct the organization is accountable or the circumstances under which
it is accountable, those provisions shall apply.
      (3)   The offense consists of an omission to discharge a specific duty
imposed by law on the organization.
      (4)   If, acting with the kind of culpability otherwise required for the
commission of the offense, its commission was authorized, requested, commanded,
tolerated or performed by the board of directors, trustees, partners or by a
high managerial officer, agent or employee acting in behalf of the organization
and within the scope of such a board’s or person’s office or employment.
   (b)   If strict liability is imposed for the commission of an offense, a
purpose to impose organizational liability shall be presumed, unless the
contrary plainly appears.
   (c)   In a prosecution of an organization for an offense other than one for
which strict liability is imposed, it is a defense that the high managerial
officer, agent or employee having supervisory responsibility over the subject
matter of the offense exercised due diligence to prevent its commission. This
defense is not available if it plainly appears inconsistent with the purpose of
the section defining the offense.
   (d)   As used in this section, “organization” means a corporation for profit
or not for profit, partnership, limited partnership, joint venture,
unincorporated nonprofit association, estate, trust or other commercial or

and any of the following apply:
      (1)   In the name of the organization or in its behalf, he engages in
conduct constituting the offense, or causes another to engage in such conduct,
or tolerates such conduct when it is of a type for which he has direct

offense, a person who lawfully is in that person's residence has no duty to
retreat before using force in self defense, defense of another, or defense of
that person's residence, and a person who lawfully is an occupant of that

501.99   PENALTIES FOR MISDEMEANORS.
   (a)   Considerations in Misdemeanor Sentencing.
      (1)   A court that sentences an offender for a misdemeanor or minor
misdemeanor violation of any provision of the Ohio Revised Code, or of any
municipal ordinance that is substantially equivalent to a misdemeanor or minor
misdemeanor violation of a provision of the Ohio Revised Code, shall be guided
by the overriding purposes of misdemeanor sentencing. The overriding purposes
of misdemeanor sentencing are to protect the public from future crime by the
offender and others and to punish the offender. To achieve those purposes, the
sentencing court shall consider the impact of the offense upon the victim and
the need for changing the offender’s behavior, rehabilitating the defender, and
making restitution to the victim of the offense, the public, or the victim and
the public.
      (2)   A sentence imposed for a misdemeanor or minor misdemeanor violation
of an Ohio Revised Code provision or for a violation of a municipal ordinance
that is subject to division (a)(1) of this section shall be reasonably
calculated to achieve the two overriding purposes of misdemeanor sentencing set
forth in division (a)(1) of this section, commensurate with and not demeaning
to the seriousness of the offender’s conduct and its impact upon the victim,
and consistent with sentences imposed for similar offenses committed by similar
offenders.
      (3)   A court that imposes a sentence upon an offender for a misdemeanor
or minor misdemeanor violation of an Ohio Revised Code provision or for a
violation of a municipal ordinance that is subject to division (a)(1) of this
section shall not base the sentence upon the race, ethnic background, gender,
or religion of the offender.
      (4)   Divisions (a)(1) and (a)(2) of this section shall not apply to any
offense that is disposed of by a traffic violations bureau of any court
pursuant to Traffic Rule 13 and shall not apply to any violation of any
provision of the Ohio Revised Code that is a minor misdemeanor and that is
disposed of without a court appearance. Divisions (a)(1) to (a)(3) of this
section do not affect any penalties established by the Municipality for a
violation of its ordinances that are not substantially equivalent to a
misdemeanor or minor misdemeanor violation of a provision of the Ohio Revised
Code.
(ORC 2929.21)
   (b)   Misdemeanor Jail Terms.
      (1)   Except as provided in Ohio R.C. 2929.22 or 2929.23 or division (b)
(5) or (b)(6) of this section and unless another term is required or authorized
pursuant to law, if the sentencing court imposing a sentence upon an offender
for a misdemeanor elects or is required to impose a jail term on the offender
pursuant to this chapter, the court shall impose a definite jail term that
shall be one of the following:
         A.   For a misdemeanor of the first degree, not more than 180 days;
         B.   For a misdemeanor of the second degree, not more than 90 days;
         C.   For a misdemeanor of the third degree, not more than 60 days;
         D.   For a misdemeanor of the fourth degree, not more than 30 days.
      (2)   A.   A court that sentences an offender to a jail term under
division (b) of this section may permit the offender to serve the sentence in
intermittent confinement or may authorize a limited release of the offender as
provided in division (d)(2) of this section. The court retains jurisdiction
over every offender sentenced to jail to modify the jail sentence imposed at
any time, but the court shall not reduce any mandatory jail term.
         B.   1.   If a prosecutor, as defined in R.C. § 2935.01, has filed a
notice with the court that the prosecutor wants to be notified about a
particular case and if the court is considering modifying the jail sentence of
the offender in that case, the court shall notify the prosecutor that the court
is considering modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case. The
prosecutor may request a hearing regarding the court’s consideration of
modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case, and, if the
prosecutor requests a hearing, the court shall notify the eligible offender of
the hearing.
            2.   If the prosecutor requests a hearing regarding the court’s
consideration of modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case, the
court shall hold the hearing before considering whether or not to release the
offender from the offender’s jail sentence.
      (3)   If a court sentences an offender to a jail term under division (b)
of this section and the court assigns the offender to a County Jail that has
established a County Jail Industry Program pursuant to Ohio R.C. 5147.30, the
court shall specify, as part of the sentence, whether the offender may be
considered for participation in the program. During the offender's term in the
County Jail, the court retains jurisdiction to modify its specification
regarding the offender's participation in the County Jail Industry Program.
      (4)   If a person sentenced to a jail term pursuant to division (b) of
this section, the court may impose as part of the sentence pursuant to Ohio
R.C. 2929.28 a reimbursement sanction, and, if the local detention facility in
which the term is to be served is covered by a policy adopted pursuant to Ohio
R.C. 307.93, 341.14, 341.19, 341.21, 341.23, 753.02, 753.04, 753.16, 2301.56,
or 2947.19 and Ohio R.C. 2929.37, both of the following apply:
         A.   The court shall specify both of the following as part of the
sentence:
            1.   If the person is presented with an itemized bill pursuant to
Ohio R.C. 2929.37 for payment of the costs of confinement, the person is
required to pay the bill in accordance with that section.
            2.   If the person does not dispute the bill described in division
(b)(4)A.1. of this section and does not pay the bill by the times specified in
Ohio R.C. 2929.37, the Clerk of the Court may issue a certificate of judgment
against the person as described in that section.
         B.   The sentence automatically includes any certificate of judgment
issued as described in division (b)(4)A.2. of this section.
      (5)   If an offender who is convicted of or pleads guilty to a violation
of Ohio R.C. 4511.19(B), or any substantially equivalent municipal ordinance,
also is convicted of or also pleads guilty to a specification of the type
described in Ohio R.C. 2941.1414 and if the court imposes a jail term on the
offender for the underlying offense, the court shall impose upon the offender
an additional definite jail term of not more than six months. The additional
jail term shall not be reduced pursuant to any provision of the Ohio Revised
Code. The offender shall serve the additional jail term consecutively to and
prior to the jail term imposed for the underlying offense and consecutively to
any other mandatory term imposed in relation to the offense.
      (6)   A.   If an offender is convicted of or pleads guilty to a
misdemeanor violation of Ohio R.C. 2907.23, 2907.24, 2907.241, or 2907.25, or
any substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, and to a specification of the
type described in Ohio R.C. 2941.1421 and if the court imposes a jail term on
the offender for the misdemeanor violation, the court may impose upon the
offender an additional definite jail term as follows:
            1.   Subject to division (b)(6)A.2. of this section, an additional
definite jail term of not more than 60 days;
            2.   If the offender previously has been convicted of or pleaded
guilty to one or more misdemeanor or felony violations of Ohio R.C. 2907.22,
2907.23, 2907.24, 2907.241, or 2907.25, or any substantially equivalent
municipal ordinance, and also was convicted of or pleaded guilty to a
specification of the type described in Ohio R.C. 2941.1421 regarding one or
more of those violations, an additional definite jail term of not more than 120
days.
         B.   In lieu of imposing an additional definite jail term under
division (b)(6)A. of this section, the court may directly impose on the
offender a sanction that requires the offender to wear a real-time processing,
continual tracking electronic monitoring device during the period of time
specified by the court. The period of time specified by the court shall equal
the duration of an additional jail term that the court could have imposed upon
the offender under division (b)(6)A. of this section. A sanction imposed under
this division shall commence on the date specified by the court, provided that
the sanction shall not commence until after the offender has served the jail
term imposed for the misdemeanor violation of Ohio R.C. 2907.23, 2907.24,
2907.241, or 2907.25, or any substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, and
any residential sanction imposed for the violation under division (d) of this
section or Ohio R.C. 2929.26. A sanction imposed under this division shall be
considered to be a community control sanction for purposes of division (c) or
this section or Ohio R.C. 2929.25, and all provisions of this Code and the Ohio
Revised Code that pertain to community control sanctions shall apply to a
sanction imposed under this division, except to the extent that they would by
their nature be clearly inapplicable. The offender shall pay all costs
associated with a sanction imposed under this division, including the cost of
the use of the monitoring device.
      (7)   If an offender is convicted of or pleads guilty to a misdemeanor
violation of Ohio R.C. 2903.13 and also is convicted of or pleads guilty to a
specification of the type described in Ohio R.C. 2941.1423 that charges that
the victim of the violation was a woman whom the offender knew was pregnant at
the time of the violation, the court shall impose on the offender a mandatory
jail term that is a definite term of at least thirty days.
      (8)   If a court sentences an offender to a jail term under this division
(b), the sentencing court retains jurisdiction over the offender and the jail
term. Upon motion of either party or upon the court’s own motion, the court, in
the court’s sole discretion and as the circumstances warrant, may substitute
one or more community control sanctions under division (d) or (e) of this
section for any jail days that are not mandatory jail days.
(ORC 2929.24)
   (c)   Misdemeanor Community Control Sanctions.
      (1)   A.   Except as provided in Section 666.99 and 698.03 of this Code
or Ohio R.C. 2929.22 and 2929.23 or when a jail term is required by law, in
sentencing an offender for a misdemeanor, other than a minor misdemeanor, the
sentencing court may do either of the following:
            1.   Directly impose a sentence that consists of one or more
community control sanctions authorized by divisions (d), (e), or (f) of this
section. The court may impose any other conditions of release under a community
control sanction that the court considers appropriate. If the court imposes a
jail term upon the offender, the court may impose any community control
sanction or combination of community control sanctions in addition to the jail
term.
            2.   Impose a jail term under division (b) of this section from the
range of jail terms authorized under that division for the offense, suspend all
or a portion of the jail term imposed, and place the offender under a community
control sanction or combination of community control sanctions authorized under
divisions (d), (e), or (f) of this section.
         B.   The duration of all community control sanctions imposed upon an
offender and in effect for an offender at any time shall not exceed five years.
         C.   At sentencing, if a court directly imposes a community control
sanction or combination of community control sanctions pursuant to division (c)
(1)A.1. of this section, the court shall state the duration of the community
control sanctions imposed and shall notify the offender that if any of the
conditions of the community control sanctions are violated the court may do any
of the following:
            1.   Impose a longer time under the same community control sanction
if the total time under all of the offender's community control sanctions does
not exceed the five-year limit specified in division (c)(1)B. of this section;
            2.   Impose a more restrictive community control sanction under
division (d), (e), or (f) of this section, but the court is not required to
impose any particular sanction or sanctions;
            3.   Impose a definite jail term from the range of jail terms
authorized for the offense under division (b) of this section.
      (2)   If a court sentences an offender to any community control sanction
or combination of community control sanctions pursuant to division (c)(1)A.1.
of this section, the sentencing court retains jurisdiction over the offender
and the period of community control for the duration of the period of community
control. Upon the motion of either party or on the court’s own motion, the
court, in the court’s sole discretion and as the circumstances warrant, may
modify the community control sanctions or conditions of release previously
imposed, substitute a community control sanction or condition of release for
another community control sanction or condition of release previously imposed,
or impose an additional community control sanction or condition of release.
      (3)   A.   If a court sentences an offender to any community control
sanction or combination of community control sanctions authorized under
division (d), (e), or (f) of this section, the court shall place the offender
under the general control and supervision of the court or of a department of
probation in the jurisdiction that serves the court for purposes of reporting
to the court a violation of any of the conditions of the sanctions imposed. If
the offender resides in another jurisdiction and a department of probation has
been established to serve the Municipal Court or County Court in that
jurisdiction, the sentencing court may request the Municipal Court or the
County Court to receive the offender into the general control and supervision
of that department of probation for purposes of reporting to the sentencing
court a violation of any of the conditions of the sanctions imposed. The
sentencing court retains jurisdiction over any offender whom it sentences for
the duration of the sanction or sanctions imposed.
         B.   The sentencing court shall require as a condition of any
community control sanction that the offender abide by the law and not leave the
State without the permission of the court or the offender's probation officer.
In the interests of doing justice, rehabilitating the offender, and ensuring
the offender's good behavior, the court may impose additional requirements on
the offender.  The offender's compliance with the additional requirements also
shall be a condition of the community control sanction imposed upon the
offender.
      (4)   A.   If the court imposing sentence upon an offender sentences the
offender to any community control sanction or combination of community control
sanctions authorized under division (d), (e), or (f) of this section, and the
offender violates any of the conditions of the sanctions, the public or private
person or entity that supervises or administers the program or activity that
comprises the sanction shall report the violation directly to the sentencing
court or to the department of probation or probation officer with general
control and supervision over the offender. If the public or private person or
entity reports the violation to the department of probation or probation
officer, the department or officer shall report the violation to the sentencing
court.
         B.   If an offender violates any condition of a community control
sanction, the sentencing court may impose upon the violator one or more of the
following penalties:
            1.   A longer time under the same community control sanction if the
total time under all of the community control sanctions imposed on the violator
does not exceed the five-year limit specified in division (c)(1)B. of this
section;
            2.   A more restrictive community control sanction;
            3.   A combination of community control sanctions, including a jail
term.
         C.   If an offender was acting pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2925.11(B)(2)(b),
or any substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, and in so doing violated
the conditions of a community control sanction based on a minor drug possession
offense, as defined in Ohio R.C. 2925.11, the sentencing court may consider the
offender’s conduct in seeking or obtaining medical assistance for another in
good faith or for self or may consider the offender being the subject of
another person seeking or obtaining medical assistance in accordance with that
division as a mitigating factor before imposing any of the penalties described
in division (c)(4)B. of this section.
         D.   If the court imposes a jail term upon a violator pursuant to
division (c)(4)B. of this section, the total time spent in jail for the
misdemeanor offense and the violation of a condition of the community control
sanction shall not exceed the maximum jail term available for the offense for
which the sanction that was violated was imposed. The court may reduce the
longer period of time that the violator is required to spend under the longer
sanction or the more restrictive sanction imposed under division (c)(4)B. of
this section by all or part of the time the violator successfully spent under
the sanction that was initially imposed.
      (5)   Except as otherwise provided in this division, if an offender, for
a significant period of time, fulfills the conditions of a community control
sanction imposed pursuant to division (d), (e), or (f) of this section in an
exemplary manner, the court may reduce the period of time under the community
control sanction or impose a less restrictive community control sanction.
Fulfilling the conditions of a community control sanction does not relieve the
offender of a duty to make restitution under division (f) of this section.

   (d)   Community Residential Sanction.
      (1)   Except when a mandatory jail term is required by law, the court

misdemeanor offenders;
         B.   If the offender is an eligible offender, as defined in R.C. §
307.932, a term in a community alternative sentencing center or district
community alternative sentencing center established and operated in accordance
with that section, in the circumstances specified in that section, with one of
the conditions of the sanction being that the offender successfully complete
the portion of the sentence to be served in the center.
      (2)   A sentence to a community residential sanction under division (d)
(1)C. of this section shall be in accordance with R.C. § 307.932. In all other
cases, the court that sentences an offender to a community residential sanction
under this division (d) may do either or both of the following:
         A.   Permit the offender to serve the offender's sentence in
intermittent confinement, overnight, on weekends or at any other time or times
that will allow the offender to continue at the offender’s occupation or care
for the offender’s family;
         B.   Authorize the offender to be released so that the offender may
seek or maintain employment, receive education or training, receive treatment,
perform community service, or otherwise fulfill an obligation imposed by law or
by the court. A release pursuant to this division shall be only for the

guilty to a misdemeanor to a community residential sanction as described in
division (d)(1) of this section, at the time of reception and at other times
the person in charge of the operation of the halfway house, community
alternative sentencing center, district community alternative sentencing
center, or other place at which the offender will serve the residential
sanction determines to be appropriate, the person in charge of the operation of
the halfway house, community alternative sentencing center, district community
alternative sentencing center, or other place may cause the convicted offender
to be examined and tested for tuberculosis, HIV infection, hepatitis,
including, but not limited to, hepatitis A, B, and C, and other contagious
diseases. The person in charge of the operation of the halfway house, community
alternative sentencing center, district community alternative sentencing
center, or other place at which the offender will serve the residential
sanction may cause a convicted offender in the halfway house, community
alternative sentencing center, district community alternative sentencing
center, or other place who refuses to be tested or treated for tuberculosis,
HIV infection, hepatitis, including, but not limited to, hepatitis A, B, and C,
or another contagious disease to be tested and treated involuntarily.

person in loco parentis of one or more of those children. This division does
not limit the court in requiring that the offender obtain counseling for any
offense or in any circumstance not specified in this division.
      (2)   If the court imposes a term of community service pursuant to
division (e)(1)C. of this section, the offender may request that the court
modify the sentence to authorize the offender to make a reasonable
contribution, as determined by the court, to the general fund of the county,
municipality, or other local entity that provides funding to the court. The
court may grant the request if the offender demonstrates a change in
circumstances from the date the court imposes the sentence or that the
modification would otherwise be in the interests of justice. If the court
grants the request, the offender shall make a reasonable contribution to the
court, and the clerk of the court shall deposit that contribution into the
general fund of the county, municipality, or other local entity that provides
funding to the court. If more than one entity provides funding to the court,
the clerk shall deposit a percentage of the reasonable contribution equal to
the percentage of funding the entity provides to the court in that entity’s
general fund.
      (3)   In addition to the sanctions authorized under division (e)(1) of
this section, the court imposing a sentence for a misdemeanor, other than a
minor misdemeanor, upon an offender who is not required to serve a mandatory

term of community service in lieu of all or part of a fine. The term of
community service imposed for a minor misdemeanor shall not exceed 30 hours.

any survivor of the victim, in an amount based upon the victim’s economic loss.
The court may not impose restitution as a sanction pursuant to this division if
the offense is a minor misdemeanor or could be disposed of by the Traffic
Violations Bureau serving the court under Traffic Rule 13. If the court
requires restitution, the court shall order that the restitution be made to the
victim in open court or to the adult probation department that serves the
jurisdiction or the clerk of the court on behalf of the victim.
            2.   If the court imposes restitution, the court shall determine
the amount of restitution to be paid by the offender. If the court imposes
restitution, the court may base the amount of restitution it orders on an
amount recommended by the victim, the offender, a presentence investigation
report, estimates or receipts indicating the cost of repairing or replacing
property, and other information, provided that the amount the court orders as
restitution shall not exceed the amount of economic loss suffered by the victim
as a direct and proximate result of the commission of the offense. If the court
decides to impose restitution, the court shall hold an evidentiary hearing on
restitution if the offender, victim, or survivor disputes the amount of
restitution. If the court holds an evidentiary hearing, at the hearing the
victim or survivor has the burden to prove by a preponderance of the evidence
the amount of restitution sought from the offender.
            3.   All restitution payments shall be credited against any
recovery of economic loss in a civil action brought by the victim or any
survivor of the victim against the offender. No person may introduce evidence
of an award of restitution under this section in a civil action for purposes of
imposing liability against an insurer under R.C. § 3937.18.
            4.   If the court imposes restitution, the court may order that the
offender pay a surcharge, of not more than 5% of the amount of the restitution
otherwise ordered, to the entity responsible for collecting and processing
restitution payments.
            5.   The victim or survivor of the victim may request that the
prosecutor in the case file a motion, or the offender may file a motion, for
modification of the payment terms of any restitution ordered. If the court
grants the motion, it may modify the payment terms as it determines
appropriate.
         B.   Fines. A fine of the type described in divisions (f)(1)B.1. and
2. of this section payable to the appropriate entity as required by law:

            2.   The amount of reimbursement under division (f)(1)C.1. of this
section shall not exceed the total amount of reimbursement the offender is able
to pay and shall not exceed the actual cost of the sanctions. The court may
collect any amount of reimbursement the offender is required to pay under that
division. If the court does not order reimbursement under that division,
confinement costs may be assessed pursuant to a repayment policy adopted under
Ohio R.C. 2929.37. In addition, the offender may be required to pay the fees
specified in Ohio R.C. 2929.38 in accordance with that section.
      (2)   A.   If the court determines a hearing is necessary, the court may
hold a hearing to determine whether the offender is able to pay the financial
sanction imposed pursuant to this division (f) or court costs or is likely in
the future to be able to pay the sanction or costs.
         B.   If the court determines that the offender is indigent and unable
to pay the financial sanction or court costs, the court shall consider imposing
and may impose a term  of community service under division (e)(1) of this
section in lieu of imposing a financial sanction or court costs. If the court
does not determine that the offender is indigent, the court may impose a term
of community service under division (e)(1) of this section in lieu of or in
addition to imposing a financial sanction under this division (f) and in
addition to imposing court costs. The court may order community service for a
minor misdemeanor pursuant to division (e)(4) of this section in lieu of or in
addition to imposing a financial sanction under this section and in addition to
imposing court costs. If a person fails to pay a financial sanction or court
costs, the court may order community service in lieu of the financial sanction
or court costs.
      (3)   A.   The offender shall pay reimbursements imposed upon the
offender pursuant to division (f)(1)C. of this section to pay the costs
incurred by a county pursuant to any sanction imposed under division (d), (e),
or (f) of this section or in operating a facility used to confine offenders

Treasurer. The County Treasurer shall deposit the reimbursements in the
County's General Fund. The County shall use the amounts deposited in the fund

section.

division (f), the court imposing sentence upon an offender for misdemeanor
domestic violence or menacing by stalking may impose a fine of not less than
seventy dollars ($70.00) nor more than five hundred dollars ($500.00), which
shall be transmitted to the Treasurer of Ohio to be credited to the address
confidentiality program fund created by Ohio R.C. 111.48.
      (5)   A.   Except as otherwise provided in this division (f)(5), a
financial sanction imposed under division (f)(1) of this section is a judgment
in favor of the state or the political subdivision that operates the court that
imposed the financial sanction, and the offender subject to the financial
sanction is the judgment debtor. A financial sanction of reimbursement imposed
pursuant to division (f)(1)C.1.a. of this section upon an offender is a
judgment in favor of the entity administering the community control sanction,
and the offender subject to the financial sanction is the judgment debtor. A
financial sanction of reimbursement imposed pursuant to division (f)(1)C.1.b.
of this section upon an offender confined in a jail or other residential
facility is a judgment in favor of the entity operating the jail or other
residential facility, and the offender subject to the financial sanction is the
judgment debtor. A financial sanction of restitution imposed pursuant to
division (f)(1)A. of this section is an order in favor of the victim of the
offender’s criminal act that can be collected through a certificate of judgment
as described in division (f)(5)B.1. of this section, through execution as
described in division (f)(5)B.2. of this section or through an order as
described in division (f)(5)B.3. of this section and the offender shall be
considered for purposes of the collection as a judgment debtor
         B.   Once a financial sanction is imposed as a judgment or order under
this division, the victim, private provider, state, or political subdivision
may do any of the following:
            1.   Obtain from the Clerk of the court in which the judgment was
entered a certificate of judgment that shall be in the same manner and form as
a certificate of judgment issued in a civil action;
            2.   Obtain execution of the judgment or order through any
available procedure, including any of the procedures identified in Ohio R.C.
2929.18(D)(1) and (D)(2) or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance;
            3.   Obtain an order for the assignment of wages of the judgment
debtor under Ohio R.C. 1321.33 or a substantially equivalent municipal
ordinance.
      (6)   The civil remedies authorized under division (f)(5) of this section
for the collection of the financial sanction supplement, but do not preclude,
enforcement of the criminal sentence.
      (7)   Each court imposing a financial sanction upon an offender under
this division (f) may designate the Clerk of the Court or another person to
collect the financial sanction. The Clerk, or another person authorized by law
or the court to collect the financial sanction may do the following:
         A.   Enter into contracts with one or more public agencies or private
vendors for the collection of amounts due under the sanction. Before entering
into a contract for the collection of amounts due from an offender pursuant to
any financial sanction imposed pursuant to this division (f), a court shall
comply with Ohio R.C. 307.86 to 307.92.
         B.   Permit payment of all or any portion of the sanction in
installments, by financial transaction device if the court is a County Court or
a Municipal Court operated by a county, or by any other reasonable method, in
any time, and on any terms that the court considers just, except that the
maximum time permitted for payment shall not exceed five years. If the court is
a County Court or a Municipal Court operated by a county, the acceptance of
payments by any financial transaction device shall be governed by the policy
adopted by the Board of County Commissioners of the county pursuant to Ohio
R.C. 301.28. If the court is a Municipal Court not operated by a county, the
Clerk may pay any fee associated with processing an electronic transfer out of
public money or may charge the fee to the offender.
         C.   To defray administrative costs, charge a reasonable fee to an
offender who elects a payment plan rather than a lump sum payment of any
financial sanction.
      (8)   No financial sanction imposed under this division (f) shall
preclude a victim from bringing a civil action against the offender.

of this chapter, a laboratory report from the State Bureau of Criminal
Identification and Investigation or a laboratory operated by another law
enforcement agency and signed by the person performing the analysis, stating
that the substance that is the basis of the alleged offense has been weighed
and analyzed and stating the findings as to the content, weight and identity of
the substance and that it contains any amount of a controlled substance and the
number and description of unit dosages, is prima-facie evidence of the content,
identity and weight or the existence and number of unit dosages of the
substance.  In any criminal prosecution for a violation of Ohio R.C. 2925.041
or a violation of this chapter, Ohio R.C. Chapter 2925 or Ohio R.C. Chapter
3719 that is based on the possession of chemicals sufficient to produce a
compound, mixture, preparation, or substance included in Schedule I, II, III,
IV, or V, a laboratory report from the Bureau or from any laboratory that is
operated or established as described in this division that is signed by the
person performing the analysis, stating that the substances that are the basis
of the alleged offense have been weighed and analyzed and stating the findings
as to the content, weight, and identity of each of the substances, is prima
facie evidence of the content, identity, and weight of the substances.
   Attached to that report shall be a copy of a notarized statement by the
signer of the report giving the name of the signer and stating that the signer
is an employee of the laboratory issuing the report and that performing the
analysis is a part of the signer’s regular duties, and giving an outline of the
signer’s education, training and experience for performing an analysis of
materials included under this section. The signer shall attest that
scientifically accepted tests were performed with due caution and that the
evidence was handled in accordance with established and accepted procedures

   (b)   The prosecuting attorney shall serve a copy of the report on the
attorney of record for the accused, or on the accused if the accused has no
attorney prior to any proceeding in which the report is to be used against the
accused other than at a preliminary hearing or Grand Jury proceeding where the
report may be used without having been previously served upon the accused.
   (c)   The report shall not be prima-facie evidence of the contents, identity
and weight or the existence and number of unit dosages of the substance if the
accused or the accused’s attorney demands the testimony of the person signing
the report, by serving the demand upon the prosecuting attorney within seven
days from the accused or the accused’s attorney's receipt of the report. The
time may be extended by a trial judge in the interests of justice.

analyst appointed by the Court. Such portion shall be a representative sample
of the entire substance that is, or of each of the substances that are, the
basis of the alleged violation and shall be of sufficient size, in the opinion
of the Court, to permit the accused’s analyst to make a thorough scientific
analysis concerning the identity of the substance or substances. The
prosecuting attorney shall provide the accused’s analyst with the sample
portion at least fourteen days prior to trial, unless the trial is to be held
in a Court not of record or unless the accused person is charged with a minor
misdemeanor, in which case the prosecuting attorney shall provide the accused’s
analyst with the sample portion at least three days prior to trial. If the
prosecuting attorney determines that such a sample portion cannot be preserved
and given to the accused’s analyst, the prosecuting attorney shall so inform
the accused person, or his or her attorney. In such a circumstance, the accused
person is entitled, upon written request made to the prosecuting attorney,  to
have the accused’s privately employed or Court appointed analyst  present at an
analysis of the substance that is, or the substances that are, the basis of the
alleged violation, and, upon further written request, to receive copies of all
recorded scientific data that result from the analysis and that can be used by
an analyst in arriving at conclusions, findings or opinions concerning the
identity of the substance or substances subject to the analysis.
   (f)   In addition to the rights provided under subsection (e) hereof, any
person who is accused of a violation of any of the provisions of this chapter
that involves a bulk amount of a controlled substance, or any multiple thereof,
or who is accused of a violation of Section
513.03, other than a minor misdemeanor violation, that involves marihuana, is

the accused person is entitled, upon further written request, to receive copies
of all recorded scientific data that result from the measurement or weighing
and that can be used by an analyst in arriving at conclusions, findings or
opinions concerning the weight, volume or number of unit doses of the substance
subject to the measurement or weighing.

under any provision of law, the court imposing sentence upon an offender who is
convicted of or pleads guilty to a drug abuse offense may order the offender to
pay to the state, municipal, or county law enforcement agencies that handled
the investigation and prosecution all of the costs that the state, municipal
corporation, or county reasonably incurred in having tests performed under this
section or Ohio R.C. 2925.51 or in any other manner on any substance that was
the basis of, or involved in, the offense to determine whether the substance
contained any amount of a controlled substance if the results of the tests
indicate that the substance tested contained any controlled substance. No court
shall order an offender under this section to pay the costs of tests performed
on a substance if the results of the tests do not indicate that the substance
tested contained any controlled substance. The court shall hold a hearing to
determine the amount of costs to be imposed under this section. The court may

   (d)   For any source of sound which emits a pure tone, cyclically varying
sound or repetitive impulsive sound, the limits set forth in Table 3 shall be
reduced by five dBA.
   (e)   Any noise which occurs on property which, according to the Zoning
Code, is being used in a legally nonconforming manner, and which noise relates
to such use, shall be judged as if the property bore a zoning designation under
which the use would be conforming.
   (f)   If the zoning designation of the property on which the source of the
noise is located differs from the zoning designation of the property on which
the noise is measured, the maximum permissible noise level of the more
restrictive zoning designation shall apply.

designee, in addition to any other authority vested in him or her, has the
power, upon presentation of proper credentials, to enter and inspect any
dwelling, multi-family dwelling, building, structure or premises within the
City, as may be necessary to enforce the provisions of this chapter, provided
permission is obtained from the occupant or, in the case of unoccupied
property, from the owner or his or her agent. If such permission is refused, or
is otherwise unobtainable, a search warrant must be obtained upon the showing
of probable cause that a violation of this chapter may exist, before such entry
or inspection is made.

531.06   SPECIAL VARIANCES.
   (a)   The City Manager, or his or her designated representative, shall have
the authority, consistent with this section, to grant special variances.
   (b)   Any person seeking a special variance pursuant to this section shall
file an application with the City Manager or his or her designated
representative. The application shall contain information which demonstrates
that bringing the source of sound or activity for which the special variance is
sought into compliance with this chapter would constitute an unreasonable
hardship on the applicant, on the community or on other persons. Notice of an
application for a special variance shall be given by the City Manager or his or
her representative to persons who frequent the area of the sound or activity
and who may be adversely affected by the granting of the variance. Any
individual who claims to be adversely affected by allowance of the special
variance may file a statement with the City Manager or his or her
representative, containing any information to support his claim.
   (c)   In determining whether to grant or deny the application, the City
Manager or his or her designated representative shall balance the hardship to
the applicant, the community and other persons, of not granting the special
variance, against the adverse impact on the health, safety and welfare of
persons affected, the adverse impact on property affected, and any other
adverse impact of granting the special variance. Applicants for special
variances, and persons contesting special variances, may be required to submit
any information the City Manager or his or her representative may reasonably
require.  In granting or denying an application, the City Manager or his or her
representative shall place on public file a copy of the decision and the
reasons for denying or granting the special variance.
   (d)   Special variances shall be granted by notice to the applicant
containing all necessary conditions, including a time limit on the permitted
activity.  The special variance shall not become effective until all conditions
are agreed to by the applicant.  Noncompliance with any conditions of a special
variance shall terminate it and subject the person holding it to those
provisions of this chapter regulating the source of sound or activity for which
the special variance was granted.
   (e)   Application for extension of time limits specified in special
variances, or for modification of other substantial conditions, shall be
treated like applications for initial special variances.
   (f)   The City Manager or his or her designated representative may issue
guidelines approved by Council defining the procedures to be followed in
applying for a special variance and the criteria to be considered in deciding
whether to grant a special variance.
   (g)   Enforcement of this chapter shall be stayed as to any person filing an
application for a special variance pursuant to this section, until such time as
the application is acted upon by the City Manager or his or her designated
representative.
   (h)   The decision of the City Manager or his or her designated
representative may be appealed by the person denied the special variance or by
any person claiming to be adversely affected by allowance of the special
variance.  Such appeals shall be made to the Zoning Board of Appeals, and
review by the Board shall be de novo.
(Ord. A-1846.  Passed 3-23-92.)

museum piece, manuscript, document, record or other thing which is either
irreplaceable or is replaceable only on the expenditure of substantial time,

its former condition, the amount of physical harm involved is the reasonable
cost of restoring the property.

offense or in a violation of Ohio R.C. 1716.14(A) involving a victim who is an
elderly person or disabled adult, or any substantially similar municipal
ordinance, the value of the property or services involved for the purpose of
determining the value is the aggregate value of all property or services
involved in the offense.
   (b)   (1)   When a series of offenses under Ohio R.C. 2913.02, or a series
of violations of, attempts to commit a violation of, conspiracies to violate,
or complicity in violations of Ohio R.C. 1716.14(A), 2913.02, 2913.03, or
2913.04, 2913.21(B)(1) or (B)(2), or Ohio R.C. 2913.31 or 2913.43 involving a
victim who is an elderly person or disabled adult, or any substantially
equivalent municipal ordinance to any of these offenses, is committed by the
offender in the offender's same employment, capacity or relationship to
another, all of those offenses shall be tried as a single offense. When a
series of offenses under Ohio R.C. 2913.02, or a series of violations of,
attempts to commit a violation of, conspiracies to violate, or complicity in
violations of Ohio R.C. 2913.02 or 2913.43 involving a victim who is an active
duty service member or spouse of an active duty service member, or any
substantially equivalent municipal ordinance to any of these offenses, is
committed by the offender in the offender’s same employment, capacity, or
relationship to another, all of those offenses shall be tried as a single
offense. The value of the property or services involved in the series of
offenses for the purpose of determining the value is the aggregate value of all
property and services involved in all offenses in the series.
      (2)   If an offender commits a series of offenses under Ohio R.C. 2913.02
that involves a common course of conduct to defraud multiple victims, all of
the offenses may be tried as a single offense.  If an offender is being tried
for the commission of a series of violations of, attempts to commit a violation
of, conspiracies to violate, or complicity in violations of Ohio R.C. 1716.14
(A), Ohio R.C. 2913.02, 2913.03, or 2913.04, Ohio R.C. 2913.21(B)(1) or (B)(2),
or Ohio R.C. 2913.31 or 2913.43, whether committed against one victim or more
than one victim, involving a victim who is an elderly person or disabled adult,
or any substantially equivalent municipal ordinance to any of these offenses,
pursuant to a scheme or course of conduct, all of those offenses may be tried
as a single offense.  If an offender is being tried for the commission of a
series of violations of, attempts to commit a violation of, conspiracies to
violate, or complicity in violations of Ohio R.C. 2913.02 or 2913.43, or any
substantially equivalent municipal ordinance to any of these offenses, whether
committed against one victim or more than one victim, involving a victim who is
an active duty service member or spouse of an active duty service member
pursuant to a scheme or course of conduct, all of those offenses may be tried
as a single offense. If the offenses are tried as a single offense, the value
of the property or services involved for the purpose of determining the value
is the aggregate value of all property and services involved in all of the
offenses in the course of conduct.
      (3)   When a series of two or more offenses under Ohio R.C. 2913.40,
2913.48, or 2921.41 is committed by the offender in the offender’s same
employment, capacity, or relationship to another, all of those offenses may be
tried as a single offense.  If the offenses are tried as a single offense, the
value of the property or services involved for the purpose of determining the
value as required by Ohio R.C. 2913.61(A) is the aggregate value of all
property and services involved in all of the offenses in the series of two or
more offenses.
      (4)   In prosecuting a single offense under paragraph (b)(1), (b)(2) or
(b)(3) of this section, it is not necessary to separately allege and prove each
offense in the series.  Rather, it is sufficient to allege and prove that the
offender, within a given span of time, committed one or more theft offenses or
violations of Ohio R.C. 2913.40, 2913.48, or 2921.41 in the offender's same
employment, capacity, or relationship to another as described in paragraph (b)
(1) or (b)(3) of this section, or committed one or more theft offenses that
involve a common course of conduct to defraud multiple victims or a scheme or
course of conduct as described in paragraph (b)(2) of this section. While it is
not necessary to separately allege and prove each offense in the series in
order to prosecute a single offense under division (b)(1), (b)(2), or (b)(3) of
this section, it remains necessary in prosecuting them as a single offense to
prove the aggregate value of the property or services in order to meet the
requisite statutory offense level sought by the prosecution.
   (c)   The following criteria shall be used in determining the value of
property or services involved in a theft offense:
      (1)   The value of an heirloom, memento, collector's item, antique,

value is prima-facie evidence of the value of such instrument.
      (5)   When the property involved is a warehouse receipt, bill of lading,
pawn ticket, claim check or other instrument entitling the holder or bearer to
receive property, the face value or, if there is no face value, the value of
the property covered by the instrument less any payment necessary to receive
the property, is prima-facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (6)   When the property involved is a ticket of admission, ticket for
transportation, coupon, token or other instrument entitling the holder or

established by law, and the offender has been notified prior to the offense of
the rate for the services, either in writing, or orally, or by posting in a
manner reasonably calculated to come to the attention of potential offenders,
the rate contained in the notice is prima-facie evidence of the value of the
services.

of vegetation by taking one or both of the following courses of action:
      (1)   Those properties found to be in violation of Section
553.01 shall have a placard conspicuously placed in the front of the property
for a period of seven days. Said placard shall be of a size, shape, and color
to be clearly visible and shall contain the following information:

placement of the placard, as provided for herein shall serve as the sole and
official notice of violation of Section
553.01.

provided for in Section

than one time during any calendar year. Service of such written notice of
violation shall be deemed to have been affected upon placement of such written
notice of violation into any USPS postal delivery receptacle.

   (a)   Authorization. The City Manager or his/her appointed designee may
authorize, upon request in specific cases, such waiver from the terms of
Section
553.01 as will not be contrary to the public interest where, owing to special
conditions, a literal enforcement of the provisions of Section
553.01 would result in undue hardship or practical difficulty. Waivers from the
regulations of Section
553.01 shall not be granted unless the City Manager or his or her appointed
designee makes specific findings of fact based directly on the particular
evidence presented to his or her. It shall be the applicant's burden to provide
all the information necessary for the City Manager or his or her appointed
designee to make a decision. The owner, or his or her agent, shall file a
request for waiver on forms provided by the City.
   (b)   Waivers shall not be granted on the grounds of convenience or profit,
but only where strict application of the provisions of Section
553.01 will result in undue hardship or practical difficulty. Under no
circumstance shall the City waive the requirements to remove noxious weeds.
   (c)   The City Manager or his/her appointed designee shall not grant a
waiver unless he or she finds the following;
      (1)   That the land is of such shape or size, is affected by such
physical conditions that it is impossible or impractical for the owner to
comply with provisions of chapter;
      (2)   That there are special circumstances or conditions, fully described
in the application applying to the land for which the waiver is sought, which
circumstances or conditions are peculiar to such land and do not apply
generally in the City, that said circumstances or conditions are such that the
strict application of the provisions of this chapter would cause undue
hardship, and that the waiver is the minimum waiver that will accomplish this
purpose;
      (3)   That the granting of the waiver will be in harmony with the general
purpose and intent of this chapter and will not be a nuisance to the
neighborhood or the City or otherwise be detrimental to the public health,
safety and welfare.

   (a)   Required; Exception for Emergency. No person shall make any tunnel,
opening or excavation under any street, sidewalk or other public ground without
first obtaining a permit therefor from the City Manager or his or her
authorized representative for each separate undertaking.  However, any person
maintaining pipes, lines or other underground facilities in or under the
surface of any street, sidewalk or other public ground may proceed with an
opening without a permit when emergency circumstances demand the work be done
immediately, provided the permit could not reasonably and practically have been
obtained beforehand.  The person shall thereafter apply for a permit on the
first regular business day on which the office of the City Manager or his
authorized representative is open for business, and the permit shall be
retroactive to the date the work was begun. In all cases where emergency
openings are necessary, the Police Department shall be notified prior to such
opening.
   (b)   When Paving Less Than Five Years Old. No permit shall be issued by the
City Manager which would allow an excavation or opening in a paved and improved
street surface less than five years old unless the applicant can clearly
demonstrate that public health or safety requires that the proposed work be
permitted or unless an emergency condition exists.
   (c)   Expiration; Extension. Every permit shall expire at the time stated in
the permit. If the work is not complete within the specified time, the
permittee shall, prior to expiration of the permit, request an extension of
time.  If such an extension is necessary, the permittee may be granted
additional time for completion of the work.

      (3)   The name of the person doing the work.
   (b)   Deposit or Bond. An applicant must make an annual deposit or furnish
an annual maintenance bond to cover both the cost of the work and the risk
involved.  If a deposit is made, the amount is based upon the estimated cost of
work to be performed.  However, the minimum amount of the deposit shall be
fifty dollars ($50.00) and is to be paid at the time the permit is received.
   The deposit may be held and used by the City to cover costs of maintaining,
reconditioning and repaving.  The portion of the deposit which is not used
shall be returned to the permittee when the work is completed to the
satisfaction of the City Manager.
   (c)   Application Fee. An applicant must pay to the City Manager an
application fee of one dollar ($1.00).

the permittee at least forty-eight hours before backfilling, regarding the date
and approximate time at which backfilling will begin.
   (c)   The work of final restoration, involving both paving surface and
paving base, shall be performed either directly by the City Street Department
or by the permittee, according to City specifications.  In the event of the
former, the permittee will be billed by the City for the actual cost of the
work.
   (d)   The permittee shall notify the City Manager in writing upon completion
of all work accomplished under provisions of the permit.
   (e)   If any settlement in a restored area occurs within a period of one

corrected by the City and any expense incurred by the City in correcting such
settlement shall be paid by the permittee or recovered from his bond or
deposit, unless the permittee submits proof satisfactory to the City Manager

Any person owning, operating or maintaining a system in the rights-of-way
without a certificate of registration, including persons operating under a

   (e)   Systems in Place Without a Certificate of Registration. Any system or
part of a system found in a right-of-way for which a certificate of
registration has not been obtained shall be deemed to be a nuisance and an
unauthorized use of the rights-of-way. The City may exercise any remedies or
rights it has at law or in equity, including, but not limited to abating the
nuisance; taking possession of the facilities and/or non-complying portion of
such system; and/or prosecuting the violator.
   (f)   Future Uses. In allowing providers and permittees to place facilities
in the rights-of-way, the City shall not be liable for any damages caused
thereby to any provider's facilities that are already in place or that shall be
placed in the rights-of-way unless those damages arise out of the sole
negligence, gross negligence, willful misconduct, or fraud of the City. No
provider is entitled to rely on the provisions of this chapter as creating a
special duty to any provider. In issuing a certificate of registration, the
City shall not be deemed to have waived the defense of governmental immunity,
or any other applicable legal defense.
   (g)   Discontinuance of Operations. Abandoned and Unused Facilities.
      (1)   A provider who has discontinued or is discontinuing its operations
of any system in the City shall:
         A.   Provide information satisfactory to the City that the provider's
obligations for its system in the rights-of-way under this section and any
other sections in the Code have been lawfully assumed by another applicant and/
or provider;
         B.   Submit a written proposal to re-use its facilities in a manner
that promotes the City's goals of providing innovative and economic solutions
to efficiently and economically utilize limited rights-of-way capacity. Such
proposal must be approved by the Public Works Director;
         C.   Submit a written proposal for abandonment of facilities in place
indicating why good engineering practice would support this type of solution.
The Public Works Director must approve said proposal;
         D.   Completely remove all specifically identified portion(s) of its
system in a manner acceptable to the City within a reasonable amount of time if
the City believes that there exists a reasonable justification for such
removal; or
         E.   Submit to the City within a reasonable amount of time and in
accordance with Ohio R.C. 4905.20 and 4905.21, a proposal for transferring
ownership of its facilities to the City. If a provider proceeds under this
clause, the City may, at its option where lawful:
            1.   Purchase the facilities; or
            2.   Unless a valid removal bond has already been posted pursuant
to Section
907.19, require the provider to post a bond in an amount sufficient to
reimburse the City for reasonably anticipated costs to be incurred in removing
the facilities.
      (2)   Facilities of a provider who fail to comply with this section and
which remain unused facilities shall be deemed to be abandoned. Abandoned
facilities are deemed to be a nuisance. The City may exercise any remedies or
rights it has at law or in equity, including, but not limited to:
         A.   Abating the nuisance;
         B.   Taking possession of the facilities and restoring them to a
useable condition subject to a finding of the PUCO pursuant to the requirements
of Ohio R.C. 4905.20 and 4905.21;
         C.   Requiring removal of the facilities by the provider or by the
provider's surety.
      (3)   If the City requires a provider to remove unused facilities in any
rights-of-way, the City shall use reasonable efforts to direct that this
removal occur in conjunction with other scheduled excavations of the rights-of-
way. If the City abates the nuisance it may take all action necessary to
recover its costs and to abate said nuisance, including but not limited to,
those methods set forth in Ohio R.C. 715.261.
   (h)   Nature of Issuance. A certificate of registration shall not convey
equitable or legal title in the rights-of-way. A certificate of registration is
only the nonexclusive, limited right to occupy rights-of-way in the City, for
the limited purposes and for the limited period stated in the certificate of
registration and in accordance with this chapter. For those providers with a
valid gas or electric franchise, the provisions of a certificate of
registration shall be deemed as regulatory in nature and shall not be
interpreted to limit the right to occupy the rights-of-way which may have been
granted by such franchise. The rights to occupy the right-of-way may not be
subdivided or subleased; provided, however, that two or more providers may
collocate facilities in the same area of the rights-of-way so long as each such
provider complies with the provisions of this chapter. Collocating providers
may file a joint application for a right-of-way permit. A certificate of
registration does not excuse a provider from obtaining appropriate access or
pole attachment agreements before co-locating its facilities on facilities of
others, including the City's facilities. A certificate of registration does not
prevent a provider from leasing space in or on the provider's system, so long
as the sharing of facilities does not cause a violation of law, including the
provisions of this chapter. A certificate of registration does not excuse a
provider from complying with any provisions of the Code or other applicable
law.
   (i)   Other Approvals, Permits, and Agreements. In addition to a certificate
of registration, providers shall obtain any and all regulatory approvals,
permits, authorizations, or licenses necessary for the offering or provision of
such services from the appropriate Federal, State and local authorities and
upon the City's reasonable request, shall provide copies of such documents to
the City. Further, a certificate of registration issued pursuant to this
chapter shall not entitle a provider to use, alter, convert to, or interfere
with, the facilities, easements, poles, conduits, lines, pipelines, wires,
fiber, cable or any other real or personal property of any kind whatsoever
under the management or control of the City.

volunteers. Any insurance, self-insurance or similar protection maintained by
the City, its officers, officials, employees, agents or volunteers shall be
excess of the applicant's insurance required herein and shall not contribute
with it;
            5.   That the City shall be notified at least thirty days in
advance of cancellation of, or coverage changes in, the policy. The commercial
general liability insurance policies required by this section shall contain the
following endorsement:
               a.   "It is hereby understood and agreed that this policy may
not be diminished in value, canceled nor the intention not to renew be stated,
until thirty (30) days after receipt by the City, by registered mail, return
receipt requested, of a written notice addressed to the City Manager or her/his
designee of such intent to cancel, diminish or not to renew."
                  Within thirty days after receipt by the City of said notice,
and in no event later than five days prior to said cancellation, the provider
(or applicant) shall obtain and furnish to the City Manager a certificate of
insurance evidencing replacement insurance policies.

liability insurance including products and combined operations coverage to
cover liability, bodily injury, personal injury, and property damage must be
maintained. Coverage must be written on an occurrence basis, with minimum
limits of one million dollars ($1,000,000) per occurrence and three million
dollars ($3,000,000) annual aggregate and including the following provisions or
their equivalent:

for commercial general liability or automobile liability under an umbrella or
excess liability policy. Applicant agrees to endorse the City, its elected and
appointed officials, officers, employees, agents and volunteers as additional
insureds on the umbrella or excess policy, unless the certificate of insurance
states the umbrella or excess policy provides coverage on a "follow form"
basis.
      (3)   Additional insurance: The City reserves the right to require any
other insurance coverage it deems necessary after review of any proposal
submitted by applicant.
      (4)   Self-insurance: Those applicants maintaining a book value in excess
of fifty million dollars ($50,000,000) may submit a statement requesting to
self-insure. If approval to self-insure is granted, applicant shall assure the
City that such self insurance shall provide the City with no less monetary
protection and guarantee than would have been afforded to the City by a third
party insurer providing applicant with the types and amounts of coverage
detailed in this section. This statement shall include:

         D.   The City Manager may modify or waive these requirements if they
are not necessary in determining the sufficiency of the self-insurance. The
City Manager may request applicable and pertinent additional information if it
is necessary in determining the sufficiency of the self-insurance. The
applicant may be required to provide a financial guarantee satisfactory to the
City guaranteeing payment of losses and related investigations, claims
administration, and defense expenses.
      (5)   City's examination of, or failure to request or demand, any
evidence of insurance in accordance with this chapter shall not constitute a
waiver of any requirement of this section and the existence of any insurance
shall not limit applicant's obligations under this chapter.
      (6)   Documentation that applicant or provider maintains standard
workers' compensation coverage as required by law. Similarly, provider shall
require any subcontractor to provide workers' compensation coverage in amounts
required by law for all of the subcontractor's employees.

application and such other information as the applicant may reasonably request
to enable applicant to prospectively obtain such consent.
   (e)   Obligations of a Provider upon Receipt of a Certificate of
Registration. In addition to the other requirements set forth herein and in the
Rules and Regulations each provider shall:
      (1)   Use its best efforts to cooperate with other providers and users of

construction and arboricultural practice (if applicable), including any
appropriate State building codes, safety codes and law and use best efforts to
repair and replace any street, curb or other portion of the rights-of-way, or
facilities located therein, to a condition to be determined by the Public Works
Director to be adequate under current standards and not less than materially

minimizes any inconvenience to the public, the City and other providers, all in
accordance with all applicable provisions of this chapter, any Rules and
Regulations the City may adopt and the Code;
      (5)   Construct, install, operate and maintain its facilities and system

other Federal, State and/or local regulations;
      (6)   Be on notice that removal or trimming of trees within the rights-
of-way of the City requires prior written approval by the Public Works Director
or his/her designee and must be completed by a certified arborist. Any such
tree that is removed without the Public Works Director's written permission
shall be replaced, at the sole expense of the responsible person, with a
healthy tree of a kind approved by the Public Works Director and shall be
replaced inch for inch (i.e. a fifteen inch tree removal may require
replacement with five three inch trees) of a species and at a location approved
by the Public Works Director;
      (7)   Warrant that all worker facilities, conditions and procedures that
are used during construction, installation, operation and maintenance of the
provider's facilities within the rights-of-way shall comply with all applicable

necessary to remove the graffiti and bill the provider for the cost thereof;
      (10)   Use all reasonable efforts to field identify their facilities in
the rights-of-way whenever providers are notified by the City that the City has
determined that such identification is reasonably necessary in order for the
City to begin planning for the construction, paving, maintenance, repairing,
relocating or in any way altering any street or area in the rights-of-way as
defined in this chapter. The City shall notify the providers of the City's date
to begin the process at least thirty days prior to the commencement of said
activities. In field identifying facilities:
         A.   Providers shall identify all facilities that are within the
affected rights-of- way using customary industry and City of Sidney standards,
maps, and distinct identification;
         B.   Facilities will be so marked as to identify the provider
responsible for said facilities;
         C.   Should any such marking interfere with the facilities function,

may grant the provider additional time for good cause.
   (f)    Establishment of Utility Corridors.
      (1)   The Public Works Director may assign specific corridors within the

someday be, located within the rights-of-way.
      (2)   Any provider whose facilities are in the rights-of-way and are in a
position at variance with utility corridors established by the Public Works
Director shall at the time of the next construction of the area, excluding
normal maintenance activities, move such facilities to their assigned position
within the rights-of-way. Existing underground facilities located within a
designated utility corridor shall not be required to relocate into adjacent or
alternative portions of the rights-of-way unless they are in conflict with an
actual or proposed public improvement project. The above requirements may be
waived by the Public Works Director for good cause shown including, but not
limited to, consideration of such factors as: the remaining economic life of
the facilities, public safety, customer service needs, and hardship to the
provider. If a provider is denied a requested waiver from the above
requirements, the provider may appeal the denial of the Public Works Director
to the City Manager.
      (3)   The Public Works Director shall make every good faith attempt to
accommodate all existing and potential users of the rights-of-way as set forth

907.04   REPORTING REQUIREMENTS.
   (a)   Reporting Obligations of Providers. At the time of initial application
and by January 1st of each following year, each provider shall file a
construction and major maintenance plan with the Public Works Director. Such
construction and major maintenance plan shall be provided for all geographical
areas requested by the Public Works Director up to and including the entire
geographical area of the City. It shall be submitted using a format(s) mutually
agreeable to the provider and the City and shall contain the information
determined by the Public Works Director to be necessary to facilitate the
coordination and reduction in the frequency of construction in the rights-of-
way. The construction and major maintenance plan shall include, but not be
limited to, all currently scheduled and/or anticipated construction or
maintenance for the next calendar year; if none are scheduled or anticipated
then the plan should so state. The provider shall use its best efforts in
supplying this information and shall update the construction and major
maintenance plan on file with the Public Works Director whenever there is a
material change in scheduled and/or anticipated construction projects. In an
effort to assist providers with the completion of their annual construction and
major maintenance plan, the Public Works Department on or before November 1st
of each year will send each provider's system representative a descriptive
narrative (and any mapping information reasonably available) for all the
planned right-of-way improvements and/or scheduled maintenance that the City
then currently intends to undertake during the next calendar year.
   (b)   Mapping Data.
      (1)   Upon application for a certificate of registration, or within
thirty days after initial application, a provider shall provide the City with
information regarding the location of its facilities in the rights-of-way in a
format acceptable to the City. In such submission, the provider shall be
required to accurately inform the City of the number of miles (rounded to the
nearest tenth of a mile) of the right-of-way that the provider's system then
currently occupies. Any person owning, operating, or maintaining a system in
the rights-of-way prior to the effective date of this chapter must comply with
this section within ninety days of the effective date. Following that initial
provision of information and upon the reasonable request of the Public Works
Director, which request shall not occur more than once annually, every provider
shall provide to the City all location information for all facilities which it
owns or over which it has control and which are located in any rights-of-way.
All such information as described above shall be provided for the geographical
area (up to and including the entire geographical area of the City) as
requested by the Public Works Director with the specificity then currently
available to the provider in hard copy or in the most advanced format
(including but not limited to, electronic and/or digital format) then currently
being used by provider that is then currently capable of technologically being
read (or readily converted to a readable form) by the City. The mapping data is
only required to be at the "Atlas" level of detail necessary for the City to
reasonably determine the location of the provider's facilities in the rights-
of-way. The provider shall supply the mapping data on paper if the Public Works
Director determines that the format currently being used by the provider is not
capable of being read by the City. Any time after the issuance of a
certification of registration, and upon the reasonable request of the Public
Works Director, a provider shall be required to provide to the City any
additional location information for any facilities which it owns or over which
it has control that are located in any rights-of-way of the City required by
the City. Any and all actual direct, incidental and indirect costs incurred by
the City during the process of reviewing, inputting and/or converting a
provider's mapping information to comport with the City's then current standard
format (whether electronic or otherwise) shall be directly billed to, and must
be timely remitted by, the provider. Failure to pay such mapping costs within
sixty days of receipt of an invoice shall subject an applicant or provider to
revocation of its certificate of registration and the penalties of Section
907.99. Further, each provider that has been issued a certificate of
registration shall accurately inform the City on or before each subsequent
January 1st of the number of miles (rounded up to the nearest mile) of right-
of-way the provider's system then occupied as of the immediately previous
December 1st.
      (2)   The Public Works Director may in the future adopt specifications
and further define the mapping data requirement(s) under this section. In each
instance a provider shall be served with a copy of the specifications by
regular U.S. Mail to the company representative identified in Section
907.03(b)(1)B. provided, however, that failure to actually receive such notice
shall not in any way effect the validity or enforceability of said
specifications.
   (c)   Exemption from Disclosure. A provider shall notify the City if the
provider believes that any specific document or portion of a document being
submitted to the City is exempt from the public records disclosure requirements
of Ohio R.C. 149.43. The notification shall be in writing and indicate the
specific document or portion of a document that the provider believes is exempt
from disclosure. The notification shall include the legal basis for the claimed
exemption, including the applicable statutory reference and any additional
information necessary to make a determination of exemption for each specific
document or portion of a document. If a public records request is made for
documents submitted by a provider, the City will consider the written
notification in making its own independent determination of whether a specific
document or a portion of a document is exempt from the disclosure requirements
of Ohio R.C. 149.43. To the extent permitted by law, the City will endeavor to
use reasonable best efforts to notify the provider of the request prior to
making the document available for inspection or copying.
(Ord. A-2853.  Passed 4-11-16; Ord. A-2963. Passed 4-22-19.)
907.05   COMPENSATION FOR CERTIFICATE OF REGISTRATION.
   (a)   Compensation. As compensation for the City's costs to administer this
chapter, manage, administer and control the rights-of-way and maintain each
certificate of registration issued, every provider or any person operating a
system shall pay registration maintenance fees to the City beginning January 1,
2017. The registration maintenance fee shall be determined and assessed to
providers and other persons operating a system or otherwise using and occupying
the rights-of-way in accordance with the following process and formula:
      (1)   The City by January 31 of each year shall calculate all actual and
incurred costs associated with rights-of-way management, administration and
control for the previous calendar year that the City was not able to reasonably
recover through right-of-way permit fees or other recovery mechanisms provided
for in this chapter.
      (2)   Providers and applicants, as required in Section
907.04(b), shall accurately inform the City upon application for a certificate
of registration and on or before each subsequent January 1 st of the number of
miles (rounded up to the nearest mile) of right-of-way the provider's system
then occupied as of the immediately previous December 1st.
      (3)   The City shall total the entire number of miles of right-of-way
reported as being used or occupied by all providers.
      (4)   The City shall divide the calculated costs referenced in division
(a)(1) of this section by the total number of miles of right-of-way reported as
being used or occupied by all providers as referenced in division (a)(3) of
this section to arrive at a per-mile cost number.
      (5)   The City shall then multiply each Provider's mileage calculation as
referenced in division (a)(2) of this section by the per-mile cost calculation
referenced in division (a)(4) of this section. The product shall be a
provider's then current annual registration maintenance fee.
      (6)   The City shall perform its annual calculation of registration
maintenance fees following receipt of the Providers required January 1 mileage
report. Registration maintenance fees shall be invoiced to providers on or
about February 1 of each calendar year and shall be due thirty days following
receipt.
      (7)   Cable companies operating under non-exclusive cable franchises for
the purposes of providing cable service, and providers of open video system
services, which compensate the City under other mechanisms, shall have the
mileage of the right-of-way they use and/or occupy included in the calculations
described in this section, but shall not be required to contribute to the
recovery of rights-of-way costs as defined by this chapter with the exception
of permit costs.
      (8)   The City shall act, on or about January 31 st of each year, in
accordance with the results of division (a)(6) of this section, to codify a new
annual registration maintenance fee (per mile) by appropriately increasing or
decreasing the previous year's registration maintenance fee (per mile) as then
listed on the schedules. Revised registration maintenance fees shall be
effective upon passage.
   (b)   Timing. Registration maintenance fees shall be paid in full for the
first year of the registration as a condition of the certificate of
registration becoming effective. Fees may be prorated from the effective date
of the certificate of registration to the end of the calendar year if less than
one full year.
   (c)   Taxes and Assessments. To the extent taxes or other assessments are
imposed by taxing authorities on the use of City property as a result of a
provider's use or occupation of the rights-of-way, the provider shall be
responsible for payment of such taxes. Such payments shall be in addition to
any other fees payable pursuant to this chapter and shall not be considered an
offset to, or in lieu of, the fees and charges listed in this chapter. The
registration maintenance fee is not in lieu of any tax, fee, or other
assessment except as specifically provided in this chapter, or as required by
applicable law.
   (d)   Interest on Late Payments. In the event that any registration
maintenance fee is not paid to the City by the date due, the provider shall pay
a monthly late charge of one percent of the unpaid balance for each month or
any portion thereof for which payment is not made.
   (e)   No Accord and Satisfaction. Acceptance by the City of any registration
maintenance fee shall not be construed as an accord that the amount paid is in
fact the correct amount, nor shall such acceptance of such registration
maintenance fee payment be construed as a release of any claim the City may
have for additional sums due and payable.
(Ord. A-2853.  Passed 4-11-16; Ord. A-2963. Passed 4-22-19.)
907.06   OVERSIGHT AND REGULATION.
   (a)   Reports. Upon reasonable request of the Public Works Director, a
provider shall provide the City with a list of any and all material
communications, public reports, petitions, or other filings, either received
from or submitted to any municipal, county, State or Federal agency or official
(and any response thereto submitted by or received by a provider), and any
other information or report reasonably related to a provider's obligations
under this chapter which in any way materially affects the operation of the
system or a provider's representations and warranties set forth herein, but not
including tax returns or other filings which are confidential. Upon request, a
provider shall promptly, but in no case later than thirty business days
following the request, deliver to the City a complete copy of any item on said
list. Upon the request of the City, a provider shall promptly submit to the
City any information or report reasonably related to a provider's obligations
under this chapter, its business and operations with respect to the system or
its operation, in such form and containing such information as the City shall
specify. Such information or report shall be accurate and complete and supplied
within thirty days.
   (b)   Confidentiality. All information submitted to the City that is
considered confidential information, trade secret and/or proprietary
information or information that upon public its disclosure would be highly
likely to place critical portions of the provider's system in real danger of
vandalism, sabotage or an act of terrorism, must be clearly marked as such when
submitted. The City shall exercise all reasonable legal protections so as not
to publicly disclose to any third party such information unless required by
law. The City shall, following receipt of a request for public disclosure of
clearly marked trade secret and/or proprietary information submitted by a
provider, endeavor to use reasonable best efforts to timely place the
provider's system representative on notice that such a request for public
disclosure has been made.
   (c)   Provider's Expense. All reports and records required under this
chapter shall be furnished at the sole expense of the provider.
   (d)   Right of Inspection and Audit. The City's designated representatives
shall have the right to inspect, examine, or audit during normal business hours
and upon reasonable notice to a provider under the circumstances: documents,
records, or other information which pertain to a provider's operation of a
system within the City that are related to its obligations under this chapter.
All such documents shall be made available within the City or in such other
place that the City may agree upon in writing in order to facilitate said
inspection, examination, or audit provided, however, that if such documents are
located outside of the City, then the provider shall pay the reasonable
expenses incurred by the City's designated representative in traveling to such
location. Also, provider shall reimburse the City for at least fifty percent of
the total cost incurred by the City for utilizing a third party to assist with
or conduct an investigation or audit.
   (e)   Rules and Regulations. The Public Works Director may propose and adopt
(and from time to time amend) the Rules and Regulations regarding this chapter
and engineering standards. Prior to the adoption or amendment of the Rules and
Regulations, the Public Works Director shall provide written notice and a copy
of the proposed language of such adoption or amendment, via United States
regular mail, to each provider who holds a then current certificate of
registration. Each provider shall then have thirty days following the date of
the City's mailing to provide written comments regarding the proposed language
to the Public Works Director. At least forty-five days, but not more than sixty
days following the date of the City's mailing, the Public Works Director shall
schedule and hold a meeting, to make available a forum at which all then
current providers may address any questions, concerns and make reasonable
suggestions regarding the proposed new Rules and Regulations to the Public
Works Director. The Public Works Director shall, following said meeting and the
review of the providers' comments and suggestions, adopt or amend the Rules and
Regulations in a manner that best serves the City.

the performance of activities pursuant to such certificate of registration, no
matter how, or to whom, such loss may occur.

907.09   CIVIL FORFEITURES.
   In addition to any other penalties set forth in this chapter and the remedy
of specific performance, which may be enforced in a court of competent
jurisdiction, the Public Works Director may assess an additional penalty of
civil forfeiture for failure to comply with any provision of this chapter. Such
penalty shall be a monetary sum, payable to the City, in the amount of five
hundred dollars ($500.00) per twenty-four hour day of violation and any
subsequent portion of a day less than twenty-four hours in length. Prior to
assessing said penalty, the Public Works Director will provide written notice
to the provider detailing the failure to comply with a specific provision of
this chapter. Such notice shall also indicate that said penalty shall be
assessed in fifteen calendar days subsequent to the date of receipt if
compliance is not achieved. If a provider desires to challenge such penalty,
provider must request a public hearing before the City Manager within ten days
of service of the notice. Such public hearing shall be held within thirty days
of the provider's request. If provider requests such hearing before the City
Manager, such penalty shall be temporarily suspended. However, if, after the
public hearing, the City Manager determines that provider failed to comply with
the specific provision(s) of this chapter referenced in the notice, such
penalty shall be assessed starting with the fifteen calendar days after receipt
of the notice referenced in this section and continuing each day thereafter
until compliance is achieved. The determination of the City Manager shall be

belong to the City with all rights of ownership, including, but not limited to,
the right to connect and use the facilities or to effect a transfer of all
right, title and interest in the facilities to another person for operation;
         B.   Authorize removal of the facilities installed by the provider in,
on, over or under the rights-of-way of the City at provider's cost and expense,
by another person; however, the City shall have no liability for any damage
caused by such action and the provider shall be liable to the City for all
reasonable costs incurred by the City in such action; and
         C.   To the extent consistent with applicable law, any portion of the
provider's facilities in, on, over or under the rights-of-way of the City
designated by the City for removal and not timely removed by the provider shall

associated therewith will be billed to that provider and shall be paid within
thirty days from the date of billing. Upon failure to pay, the City may pursue
all legal and equitable remedies in the event a provider does not pay or the
City may call upon any bond or letter of credit posted by the permittee and

responsible for the cost of repairing any damage to the facilities of another
provider caused during the City's response to an emergency occasioned by that
provider's facilities.

City-owned facilities in the rights-of-way which the provider or its facilities

facilities:
         A.   If the sale or transfer is for the primary benefit of the
provider, the provider must pay the relocation costs;

the provider or permittee must pay the relocation costs unless otherwise agreed
to by the City, the provider or permittee; or

prohibited by a permit. This section is not, as to third parties, a waiver of
any defense or immunity otherwise available to the provider, permittee or to
the City; and the provider or permittee, in defending any action on behalf of

fees and disbursements assumed by the City in connection therewith); and (i)
persons or property, in any way arising out of or through the acts or omissions
of provider or permittee, its subcontractors, agents or employees attributable
to the occupation by the provider or permittee of the rights-of-way, to which
provider's or permittee's negligence shall in any way contribute, and
regardless of whether the City's negligence or the negligence of any other
party shall have contributed to such claim, cause of action, judgment, injury
or damage; and (ii) arising out of any claim for invasion of the right of
privacy, for defamation of person, firm or corporation, or the violation or
infringement of any copyright, trademark, trade name, service mark or patent or
any other right of any person, firm and corporation by the provider, but
excluding claims arising out of or related to City programming; and (iii)
arising out of provider or permittee's failure to comply with the provisions of
law applicable to provider or permittee in its business hereunder.

portion of this chapter for any reason held invalid or unconstitutional by any
court or administrative agency of competent jurisdiction, such portion shall be
deemed a separate, distinct, and independent provision and such holding shall
not affect the validity of the remaining portions thereof. If a regulatory body
or a court of competent jurisdiction should determine by a final, non-
appealable order that any permit, right or any portions of this section are
illegal or unenforceable, then any such permit or right granted or deemed to
exist hereunder shall be considered as a revocable permit with a mutual right
in either party to terminate without cause upon giving sixty days written
notice to the other. The requirements and conditions of such a revocable permit
shall be the same requirements and conditions as set forth in the permit, right
or registration, respectively, except for conditions relating to the term of
the permit and the right of termination. If a permit or right shall be
considered a revocable permit as provided herein, the permittee must
acknowledge the authority of the City to issue such revocable permit and the
power to revoke it.

all lawful powers and rights, regulatory power, or police power, or otherwise
as now are or the same as may be from time to time vested in or reserved to the
City, shall be in full force and effect and subject to the exercise thereof by
the City at any time. A permittee or provider is deemed to acknowledge that its
rights are subject to the regulatory and police powers of the City to adopt and
enforce general ordinances necessary to the safety and welfare of the public
and is deemed to agree to comply with all applicable general Laws and
ordinances enacted by the City pursuant to such powers.

said 120 days or unless:
         A.   Within 120 days after election or appointment, such receiver or
trustee shall have fully complied with all the provisions of the relevant

all defaults thereunder; and
         B.   Said receiver or trustee, within said 120 days, shall have

permittee continues to operate all or any part of the facilities after the
termination, lapse, or revocation of a certificate of registration, such
provider or permittee shall continue to comply with all applicable provisions
of this chapter and other laws throughout the period of such continued
operation, provided that any such continued operation shall in no way be
construed as a renewal or other extension of the certificate of registration,
nor as a limitation on the remedies, if any, available to the City as a result
of such continued operation after the term, including, but not limited to,
damages and restitution. Any conflict between the issuance of a certificate of
registration or of a permit and any other present or future lawful exercise of

   (a)   Not sooner than 45 nor later than 60 days after the end of each
calendar quarter, a video service provider shall pay a video service provider
fee to the City. The fee shall be calculated quarterly by determining the
provider's gross revenue for the preceding calendar quarter as described in
division (b) of this section and multiplying the result by the percentage
specified in division (c)(1) or (2) of this section.
   (b)   Gross revenue shall be computed in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles.
      (1)   Gross revenue shall consist of all of the following revenue for the
calendar quarter that is collected by the provider for video service from all
its subscribers having service addresses within the City:
         A.   Recurring monthly charges for video service;

by multiplying the total net revenue received by the video service provider
under the contract or arrangement by the percentage resulting from dividing the
number of subscribers in the City by the total number of regional or national
subscribers that potentially receive the advertising under the contract or
arrangement.
      (2)   Gross revenue shall not include any of the following:
         A.   Any taxes, fees, or assessments that are collected by the video

expenses of their collection, shall be included in gross revenue in the quarter
collected;
         C.   Late payment charges;
         D.   Maintenance charges;
         E.   Charges for services other than video service, reasonably
identifiable on books or records the video service provider keeps in the
regular course of business or by other reasonable means, that are aggregated or
bundled with amounts billed to video service subscribers, including, but not
limited to, any revenue received by a video service provider or its affiliates
for telecommunications service, information service, or the provision of
directory or internet advertising, including yellow pages, white pages, banner
advertising, and electronic publishing;
         F.   Reimbursement by programmers of marketing costs actually incurred
by the video service provider;
         G.   Any revenue not expressly enumerated in division (b)(1) of this
section.
   (c)   (1)   If in a calendar quarter a franchise fee is payable by a cable
operator under a franchise agreement which is in effect in the City, the
percentage of gross revenue payable in that calendar quarter by the video
service provider to the City shall be the same percentage of gross revenue
payable in that calendar quarter pursuant to that franchise agreement, not to
exceed 5%.
      (2)   Otherwise, the percentage shall be 5% of a video service provider's
gross revenues, as calculated in accordance with this chapter.
   (d)   A video service provider that pays a video service provider fee
pursuant to this section may identify and collect the amount of that fee as a
separate line item on the regular bill of each of its video service subscribers
that has a service address within any portion of the City.
   (e)   (1)   At its sole expense and not more often than once per calendar
year, the City or its designee may conduct an audit for the purpose of
verifying the accuracy of a video service provider's calculation of the video
service provider fees it paid to City in the audit period. For the purpose of
the audit, the video service provider shall make available for inspection, at
the location where such records are kept in the normal course of business,
those records pertaining to its gross revenue as defined in Section 908.02(b).
      (2)   A video service provider shall pay any amounts found to have been
underpaid in the audit within 30 days after notice and shall include interest
on the underpayments. However, payment need not be made in that 30-day period
if the video service provider brings an action under division (e)(3) of this
section.
      (3)   An action by the City or by the video service provider to dispute
the amount of video service provider fee due based on the audit results may be
brought in a court of competent jurisdiction not later than two years following
the end of the quarter to which the disputed amount relates.

collocation configurations are preferred. A preferred location and collocation
configuration should be utilized whenever possible and should only be surpassed
if in the determination of the Assistant City Manager/Public Works Director,
clear and convincing evidence supports such a decision. Cost alone should not
be grounds for such a determination. The order of preference is as follows:
            1.   First, small cell facilities should be collocated on an
existing pole or wireless support structure within a utility easement. If no
such pole or wireless support structure is available then proceed to the next
preference;
            2.   Second, small cell facilities should be collocated on an
existing pole or wireless support structure within an alley. If no such pole or
wireless support structure is available then proceed to the next preference;
            3.   Third, small cell facilities should be collocated on a new
wireless support structure within a utility easement. If no such location is
available then proceed to the next preference;
            4.   Fourth, small cell facilities should be collocated on a new
wireless support structure within an alley. If no such location is available
then proceed to the next preference;
            5.   Fifth, small cell facilities should be collocated on a
wireless support structure currently supporting a small cell facility located
within the City Right-of-Way. If no such wireless support structure is
available then proceed to the next preference;
            6.   Sixth, small cell facilities should be collocated on an
existing pole located within the City Right-of-Way. If no such existing pole is
available then proceed to the next preference;
            7.   Seventh, small cell facilities should be collocated on a new
wireless support structure located within a utility easement. If no such
location is available then proceed to the next preference;
            8.   Eighth, small cell facilities should be collocated on a new
wireless support structure located within an alley. If no such location is
available then proceed to the next preference;
            9.   Ninth, small cell facilities should be collocated on a new
wireless support structure located within the City Right-of-Way.
         B.   Any new wireless support structure shall be located at least 750
feet from any existing small cell facility.
      (3)   Wireless facilities design.
         A.   Wireless support structures shall be subject to the following
design standards:
            1.   Wireless support structures shall be limited to a height not
to exceed forty feet or ten feet above existing pole height, whichever height
is less.
            2.   Wireless support structures shall be capable of supporting at
least two small cell facility operators.
            3.   New wireless support structures shall have the following
design elements:
               a.    Material - aluminum poles;

concrete footing/foundation pier;
               f.    Exception if the neighborhood context would be better
served by a pole of a different material, color, style, or base as determined
by the Assistant City Manager/Public Works Director, then such design elements
may be substituted with an alternate design element. Such determination shall
be based on the following factors:
                  i.    The design features of nearby poles serving in a
similar capacity;
                  ii.    The design features of the existing or proposed
streetscape, district, or site;
                  iii.    The historical context of a district or specific
site;
                  iv.    A desire to camouflage or conceal the pole from view.

on which it is mounted;
               d.    Shall be centered on the vertical axis of the pole to
which it is mounted;
               e.   Be mounted at a distance of at least ten feet measured from
grade to the bottom of the enclosure;
               f.   Be mounted on the side of the pole facing away from nearest
traffic lane's direction of travel unless an alternate mounting orientation, at
the Assistant City Manager/ Public Works Director’s discretion, would be more
appropriate with the surrounding environment and be consistent with the purpose
of this Section.
               Notwithstanding the foregoing, under no circumstances shall a
small cell facility be attached to a decorative pole.
            5.   Such common enclosures shall have the following design
elements:
               a.   Material.  The enclosure material shall be metal, a
composite, or an equivalent material as determined by the Assistant City
Manager/Public Works Director.
               b.   Color.  The enclosure shall match the color of the pole on
which it is mounted.
               c.   Style. The enclosure shall match the style of the pole on
which it is mounted.
               d.   Coordinated design elements.  Common enclosures shall match
the material, color, and style of nearby existing common enclosures when:

structures of similar or matching design.
               e.   Exception.  If the aesthetics and character of the
immediate area are better matched by an enclosure a different material, color,
style, or by deviating from the design of a nearby existing common enclosure as
determined by the Assistant City Manager/Public Works Manager, then such design
elements may be substituted with an alternate design element. Such
determination shall be based on the following factors:
                  i.    The design features of nearby poles serving in a
similar capacity;
                  ii.    The design features of the existing or proposed
streetscape, district, or site;
                  iii.    The historical context of a district or specific
site;
                  iv.    A desire to camouflage or conceal the enclosure from
view.
            6.   All ground mounted equipment shall be placed in an underground
vault. No above grade ground mounted equipment in service of a small cell
facility is permitted unless the following conditions can be satisfied as
determined by the Assistant City Manager/Public Works Director:
               a.    The applicant has submitted clear and convincing evidence
that the equipment cannot feasibly be pole-mounted, placed in an underground
vault, or hidden within or integrated into an existing streetscape element
(i.e. - bus stop shelter). Increased costs alone shall not be a consideration.
If a ground mounted enclosure is approved, the Assistant City Manager/Public
Works Director shall reserve the right to require any of the following
conditions:
                  i.    Concealed enclosure.  All equipment shall be completely
concealed within a metal, composite, or equivalent material enclosure as

inches.
               c.    The vertical cable runs for the connection of power and
other services on all small cell facilities collocated on new wireless support
structure installations shall be concealed within the wireless support
structure. The vertical cable runs for the connection of power and all other
services on all small cell facilities collocated on existing wireless support
structure installations shall be concealed within the wireless support
structure, unless it is determined not to be possible by the Assistant City
Manager/ Public Works Director, The vertical cable runs for the connection of
power and other services on all small cell facilities collocated on power poles
shall be mounted to the surface of the pole within conduit.
               d.    Electric meters, telecommunications demarcation boxes,
grounding equipment, power transfer switches, and cut-off switches shall be
mounted on the same side of the pole as the small cell facilities common
enclosure and shall match the color of the small cell wireless facility and the
color of the pole on which they are mounted. The Assistant City Manager/Public
Works Director may approve an alternate mounting location or color, if in his/
her opinion, the alternate mounting orientation or color would be more
appropriate given the built environment, neighborhood character, overall site
appearance and would promote the purposes of this chapter.
   (c)   Reservation of Right-of-Way. The City reserves the right to Reserve
space for future public safety or transportation uses in the Right-of-Way or on
a wireless support structure or pole owned or operated by the City in a
documented and approved plan in place at the time an application is filed. A
reservation of space shall not preclude placement of a pole or collocation of a
small cell facility. If replacement of the City's pole or wireless support
structure is necessary to accommodate the collocation of the small cell
facility and the future use, the small cell facility operator shall pay for the
replacement of the pole or wireless support structure, and the replaced pole or
wireless support structure must accommodate the future use.

   (f)   Prevention of Line Freeze-Ups.  (EDITOR’S NOTE:  This subsection was
repealed by Ordinance A-1423, passed February 2, 1982.)
   (g)   A monthly payment program is available for residential customers and/
or landlords who prefer such an arrangement for their tenants. In addition, the
City may, at its discretion, assign customers to the monthly payment program,
particularly for those customers who have been delinquent for two or more
quarters over a two-year period or those commercial customers who elect to
participate. The Finance Officer shall provide a procedure to transfer
quarterly customers onto a monthly payment program. Landlords shall notify the
Finance Department, in writing, as to whether they elect to have their tenants
assigned to the monthly payment program or to permit such tenants to determine
their payment method, prior to establishment of an account with the City. If
written notice is not received, it will be presumed that the landlord consents
to the tenant’s preference. Customers on the monthly payment program will be
billed based upon quantities determined by reading the meter there in use
during each month of the year. Tenant-occupied properties participating in the
monthly payment program must be secured by a utility service deposit, as
defined in division (h) below.
   (h)   Utility Service Deposits Required for Tenant-Occupied Properties on
the Monthly Payment Program.
      (1)   Effective January 1, 2019, all utility accounts established for
tenant-occupied properties on the monthly payment program must first be secured
by a deposit of one hundred seventy- five dollars ($175.00).
      (2)   For existing tenant-occupied properties as of January 1, 2019, the
deposit already paid by the tenant will remain at the amount already paid,
unless the tenant becomes delinquent and the account becomes subject to service
disconnection. If the existing tenant becomes delinquent and the account
subject to disconnection, the tenant will be charged the current deposit amount
as described in Section
911.01(h)(1).
      (3)   All monies collected as utility service deposits shall be deposited
in the Water Fund and be used for no purpose other than to offset any unpaid
amounts for water, sewer, storm water, and residential waste services rendered.
Such deposit relieves neither the depositor nor the property owner of the
responsibility for payment for such service in excess of the deposit.
      (4)   All utility service deposits shall remain with the City until the
termination of said utility services with neither express nor imputed payment
of interest on said deposits as retained.
      (5)   Application of deposit to delinquent utility bills:
         A.   In the event that a utility account becomes delinquent, the
deposit may be applied against unpaid water, sewer, storm water, or residential
waste pickup charges and the service will subject to disconnection as provided
in this chapter.
         B.   In the case of disconnection, service will not be reestablished
until the deposit is replenished, and the account is paid in full, including a
turn-on charge, as described in Section
911.10.
      (6)   Refund of deposit upon service termination.  When a customer on the
monthly payment program vacates a property where utility service has been
established, the amount of the final bill will be deducted from the deposit on
reserve, and any remaining deposit will be returned to the tenant or applied to
the tenant’s new account. Any and all charges on the final bill that exceed the
deposit on reserve are still due and payable. Deducting the deposit does not
relieve the depositor nor the property owner of responsibility for payment for
such service in excess of the deposit.

911.011  UNDETECTABLE LEAKS AND PREVENTION OF LINE FREEZE-UPS.
   (a)   Undetectable Leaks.
      (1)   The Finance Department shall have the authority to adjust water
charges where underground water leaks have occurred and have not been detected
for a period of time by the customer and which have been determined to be the
cause of abnormal water usage.
         A.   An undetectable leak shall be a water line leak that occurs in a
customer's piping system beyond the water meter and in which, because it is
located underground, under structures, and is near drains or sewers or porous
material or is otherwise located, a leak develops without becoming apparent to
the customer until a meter reading indicates a water leak is occurring. Leaks
in faucets, toilets and other plumbing fixtures shall not be considered as
undetectable leaks for the purpose of this subsection.
         B.   Prior to an adjustment, the customer shall provide proof that a
leak in the service line or other underground lines did occur and that adequate
repairs have been made.
         C.   Failure by the customer to react to the Finance Department’s
notice that an abnormal usage has been determined by repairing leaks within a
ten day period, following such notice, shall forfeit the customer’s right to
receive an adjustment.
         D.   Any internal leaks within the building that requires the City to
shut the water off at the curb stop or meter pit, shall require the repairs to
be made and shall include the installation of a whole house shut off valve
where the water service enters the building before the water is turned back on.
      (2)   A.   In certain cases customers may request adjustments for leaks
that occur in the internal plumbing when it is clearly shown that the leak was
not detectable for some time or until the Department notice was received.
         B.   Requests for such adjustments shall be made to the Water and
Sewer Review Board and shall be accompanied by letters from the plumber and the
owner explaining in detail the circumstances involved.
      (3)   The Finance Department may adjust those bills mentioned in
subsections (a)(1) and (2) hereof by reducing in half the consumption in cubic
feet above the normal usage for the quarter in which the high bill occurred.
   (b)   Prevention of Line Freeze-Ups.
      (1)   The Finance Department shall have the authority to prepare a list
of those customers who have a usage during winter months which is determined by
the Department to be considerably above the normal water usage, and those
customers shall be notified of the higher than normal usage and those customers
shall be required to verify that the above normal usage was caused by running
water to prevent freezing of lines.
      (2)   The Finance Department shall have the authority to adjust winter
quarter usage, where water has been run to prevent freezing, back to represent
a normal winter consumption based on past usage records or when no prior winter
quarter experience is available, a fair and just pro-rate based on the number
of persons using the service from that account’s service line.
      (3)   The City reserves the right to notify customers who run water to
prevent freezing in cases where practical, to properly protect lines so that
the wasting of water can be prevented. Failure to insulate or protect these
lines from freezing shall be cause to refuse an adjustment in future bills.

913.21   LIMITATIONS ON WASTEWATER STRENGTH.
   (a)   National Categorical Pretreatment Standards. National Categorical
Pretreatment Standards as promulgated by the U.S. EPA pursuant to the Act shall
be met by all dischargers of the regulated industrial categories.
   (b)   State Standards. State standards shall be met by all dischargers who
are subject to such standards.
   (c)   Local Standards. All discharges shall comply with the average and/or
instantaneous concentrations as stated and defined in the most recent revision
of Technical Document No. 001 **, as measured at a point prior to discharge to
the public sewer. When required by the discharger’s permit, the average
concentration shall be determined by obtaining a composite sample of the
wastewater collected over a continuous 24-hour period. The composite sample
shall be either flow proportioned, or if approved by the Director, time
proportioned. When required by the discharger’s permit, the instantaneous
concentration shall be determined by obtaining a grab sample of the wastewater
in accordance with established sampling procedures set forth by the Ohio
Environmental Protection Agency and the United States Environmental Protection
Agency.
   The Utilities Director may impose mass limitations for specific substances
when it is determined that the imposition of mass limitations is necessary
either to protect the treatment works, sludge disposal processes, sludge
disposal options and receiving streams, or to comply with the City’s NPDES
permit. The mass limits may be raised, to allow for expanding operations,
through a petition and application to the Director. Conversely, the Utilities
Director may reduce the mass limits if it is determined that the facilities
operations have decreased enough to warrant a change to the permit limits. The
City reserves the right to impose average concentration limits, for industrial
users, using any one of four methods, described in the EPA’s Guidance Manual on
the Development and Implementation of Local Discharge Limitations Under the
Pretreatment Program, December 1987, that effectively allocate maximum
allowable headworks loadings.
   ** Technical Document No. 001 - Wastewater Discharge Limits: Copies of the
City of Sidney’s average standards are available from the Director upon
request.
   (d)   Dilution. No discharger shall increase the use of potable or process
water in any way for the purpose of diluting a discharge as a partial or
complete substitute for adequate treatment to achieve compliance with the
standards set forth in this chapter.
   (e)   Accidental Discharges. Each discharger shall provide protection from
slug loads, accidental discharge of prohibited or regulated materials or
substances established by this chapter. Where necessary, facilities to prevent
accidental discharge of prohibited materials and slug loads shall be provided
and maintained at the discharger’s cost and expense. Detailed plans; a slug
load discharge control plan, showing facilities and operating procedures, (best
management practices), to provide this protection shall be submitted to the
City for review, and shall be approved by the City before construction of the
facility. Review and approval of such plans and operating procedures by the
City shall not relieve the discharger from the responsibility to modify its
facility as necessary to meet the requirements of this chapter.
   (f)   Provisions for Modifying Standards.
      (1)   The City reserves the right to periodically review and amend this
chapter to assure compliance by the City with applicable Federal and State laws
and regulations.
      (2)   All categorical standards promulgated by the U.S. EPA shall be
included by reference as part of the limitations defined in subsection (a)
hereof.
      (3)   An application for modification of any National Categorical
Pretreatment Standard may be considered for submittal to the Regional
Administrator by the City when:
         A.   The POTW meets the consistent removal criteria defined in 40
C.F.R. 403.7(A); and
         B.   Sufficient data is obtained in accordance with 40 C.F.R. 403.7
(c). All information necessary to apply for a modification must be obtained by
the industrial discharger(s), at no cost to the City.
      (4)   All State and other governmental standards shall be included by
reference as part of the limitations defined in subsection (b) hereof.
      (5)   Any changes to this section shall include a reasonable time
schedule for compliance. Such time schedule shall not exceed two years except
under unusual circumstances and only after the approval of the Utilities
Director.
   (g)   Orders. The City may issue orders to any industrial discharger to
require compliance with any requirements under this chapter, including
applicable categorical standards, other discharge limits and/or reporting
requirements.

      (11)   Disclosure of additional operation and maintenance activities and/
or additional pretreatment if consistent compliance is not being achieved. A
compliance schedule shall be provided in accordance with subsection (d) hereof.
      (12)   Monitoring Waivers: The City may authorize, at its discretion, an
industrial user subject to a categorical pretreatment standard, except for
centralized waste treatment facilities regulated by and defined in 40 C.F.R.
437, to forego sampling of a pollutant regulated by a categorical pretreatment
standard if the industrial user has demonstrated through sampling and other
technical factors that the pollutant is neither present nor expected to be
present in the discharge, or is present only at background levels from intake
water and without any increase in the pollutant due to activities of the
industrial user. This authorization is subject to the following conditions:
         A.   The City may authorize a waiver where a pollutant is determined
to be present solely due to sanitary wastewater discharged from the facility
provided that the sanitary wastewater is not regulated by an applicable
categorical standard and otherwise includes no process wastewater;
         B.   A monitoring waiver is valid only for the duration of the
effective period of the permit or other equivalent individual control
mechanism, but in no case longer than five years. The industrial user shall
submit a new request for the waiver before the waiver can be granted for each
subsequent control mechanism;
         C.   In making a demonstration that a pollutant is not present, the
industrial user shall provide data from at least one sampling of the facility's
process wastewater prior to any treatment present at the facility that is
representative of all wastewater from all processes. The request for a
monitoring waiver shall be signed in accordance with paragraph (F) of rule
3745-3-06 of the Administrative Code, and include the certification statement
in 40 C.F.R. 403.6(a)(2)(ii). Non-detectable sample results may only be used as
a demonstration that a pollutant is not present if the USEPA approved
analytical method from 40 C.F.R. 136 with the lowest method detection limit for
that pollutant was used;
         D.   The City shall include any monitoring waiver as a condition in
the industrial user's control mechanism;
         E.   The reasons supporting any monitoring waiver and any information
submitted by the user in its request for the waiver shall be maintained by the
City for three years after expiration of the waiver;
         F.   Upon approval of the monitoring waiver and revision of the
industrial user's control mechanism by the City, the industrial user shall
certify on each periodic compliance monitoring report required by paragraph (E)
of rule 3745-3-06 of the Administrative Code with the following statement:
            "Based on my inquiry of the person or persons directly responsible
for managing compliance with the pretreatment standards under 40 C.F.R.
[specify applicable national pretreatment standard part or parts], I certify
that, to the best of my knowledge and belief, there has been no increase in the
level of [list pollutant or pollutants] in the wastewaters due to the
activities at the facility since submittal of the last periodic report under
paragraph (E) of rule 3745-3-06 of the Administrative Code."
         G.   In the event that a waived pollutant is found to be present or is
expected to be present based on changes that occur in the industrial user's
operations, the user shall be required to immediately:
            1.   Notify the City in writing; and
            2.   Comply with the monitoring requirements specified in the
POTW's pretreatment program;
         H.   The provision for a monitoring waiver does not relieve the
industrial user of any other certification processes and requirements
established by the City or in categorical pretreatment standards, except as
otherwise specified in the categorical pretreatment standard.
      (13)   All disclosure forms shall be signed by a principal executive
officer of the discharger.
   (c)   Evaluation and Approval. The Utilities Director will evaluate the
completed disclosure forms and data furnished by the discharger and may require
additional information. Within thirty days after full evaluation and acceptance
of the data furnished, the Director shall notify the discharger of the
Director's acceptance thereof.
   (d)   Compliance Schedule. Where additional pretreatment and/or operation
and maintenance activities will be required to comply with this chapter, the
discharger may be required to provide a compliance schedule in accordance with
Section
913.33 (d).

913.23   NUISANCE REMEDIES.
   If any waters or wastes are discharged, or are proposed to be discharged
into the public sewers, which contain the substances or possess the
characteristics enumerated in Section
913.21, and which in the judgment of the Utilities Director may have a
deleterious effect upon the Wastewater Treatment System, or which otherwise
create a hazard to life or constitute a public nuisance, the Director may:
   (a)   Reject the wastes;
   (b)   Require pretreatment to an acceptable condition for discharge to the
public sewers;
   (c)   Require control over the quantities and rates of discharge;
   (d)   Require payment to cover the added cost of handling and treating
wastes as provided m Section
913.235;
   (e)   Issue a “Variance” to the Industrial Discharge Permit to allow for
special treatment that would otherwise be described as a prohibitive discharge
as provided in Section
913.20. In no such case, shall the special treatment cause a detrimental effect
on the sewage works system or the environment. If the Utilities Director
permits the pretreatment or equalization of waste flows, the design and
installation of the plants and equipment shall be subject to the review and
approval of the Director and subject to the requirements of all applicable
codes, ordinances and laws.

                           6,924,853 lbs. raw COD
      (3)   Formulas to compute quarterly surcharges:
         A.   Total Suspended Solids (TSS):
            Quarterly Volume (cu.ft.) x 62.383 1bs. x (TSS ppm value-280 ppm)
            l,000,000 cu.ft.= Excess lbs. of SS
            “TSS” surcharge - (Excess lbs. of TSS) x (TSS unit costs)
         B.   Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD):
            Quarterly Volume (cu.ft.) x 62.383 lb x (COD ppm value -750 ppm)
            1,000,000 cu.ft. = Excess lbs. of COD
            “COD” Surcharge = (Excess lbs. of COD) x (COD unit costs).
      (4)   These charges shall be reviewed every two years and revised as
necessary.

      (3)   Reports of all monitoring. If an industrial user subject to the
reporting requirements described in any Federal Categorical Regulation, or as
described in Section
913.21 (g), monitors any pollutant more frequently than required, the results
of this monitoring shall be included in the semiannual report. If sampling
performed by an industrial user indicates a violation, the user shall notify
the City within 24 hours of becoming aware of the violation. The user shall
also repeat the sampling and analysis and submit to the City the results of the
resampling within 30 days after becoming aware of the violation. However, the
industrial user is not required to resample if:
         A.   The City performs sampling at the industrial user at a frequency
of at least once per month; or
         B.   The City performs sampling at the industrial user between the
time when the user performs its initial sampling and the time when the user
receives the results of this sampling.
         C.   If the City performs the initial sampling and analysis that
indicates a violation, then the City will perform the repeat sampling and
analysis within 30 days of becoming aware of the violation unless it notifies
the user of the violation and requires the user to perform the repeat sampling
and analysis.
      (4)   Notice to City. All industrial users shall notify the Utilities
Director at least 30 days in advance of any significant changes to the user’s
operations or system which might alter the nature, quality, or volume of its
wastewater characteristics of pollutants in their discharge, including the
listed or characteristic hazardous wastes for which the industrial user has
submitted initial notification under 40 C.F.R. 403.12(p).
      (5)   Baseline data reports. Within 180 days following the date of final
promulgation by the U.S. EPA for Categorical Pretreatment Standards, any
discharger subject to the standards shall submit to the Utilities Director a
report indicating the nature and concentration of all prohibited or regulated
substances contained in its discharge. The report shall state whether the
applicable standards or requirements are being met on a consistent basis and,
if not, what additional O & M and/or pretreatment is necessary to bring the
discharger into compliance with the applicable standards or requirements. This
statement shall be signed by an authorized representative of the discharger,
and certified to by a qualified engineer.
      (6)   Additional pretreatment. If additional pretreatment and/or O & M
activities are necessary to comply with the Categorical Standards, a schedule
shall be negotiated in accordance with Section
913.33 (b). The final date on which additional pretreatment and/or O & M
activities are implemented shall be no later than the compliance date
established in the final promulgation of such Categorical Standards.
      (7)   Final status reports. Any discharger subject to a Categorical
Pretreatment Standard shall submit to the City within 90 days after the final
compliance date of such Pretreatment Standard, a report indicating the nature
and concentration of prohibited or regulated substances in the effluent which
are limited by the pretreatment standard and a statement that all applicable
standards or requirements of the pretreatment standard are being met on a
consistent basis. The statement shall be signed by an authorized representative
of the discharger.
      (8)   Periodic compliance reports. Any discharger subject to a
Categorical Pretreatment Standard set forth in this chapter, after the
compliance date of such pretreatment standard, or in the case of a new
discharger, after commencement of the discharge to the City, or subject to
discharge limitations as defined by Section
913.21 (g), shall submit to the City during the months of July and January,
unless required more frequently by the City, a report indicating the nature and
concentration of prohibited or regulated substances in the effluent which are
limited by the Pretreatment Standards hereof. Cost for the monitoring and
analysis shall be borne by the discharger. The Utilities Director for good
cause shown may authorize the submission of such reports on months other than
those specified above.
   (b)   Local Limits. The Utilities Director may require the discharger to
self-monitor its flow and analyze its characteristics, to properly define the
concentration of various pollutants, and to ascertain compliance with the
limits defined in Section
913.21 (c). Cost for all self-monitoring efforts shall be borne by the
discharger.
   (c)   Operating upsets.
      (1)   Any discharger which experiences an upset in operations or causes
the discharge of a slug load, which places the discharger in a temporary state
of noncompliance with this chapter shall immediately inform the Utilities
Director or his or her designee as listed in the discharge permit by telephone.
      (2)   A written follow-up report thereof shall be filed by the discharger
with the Director within five days. The report shall specify:
         A.   Description of the upset, the cause thereof and the upset’s
impact on a discharger’s compliance.
         B.   Duration of noncompliance, including exact dates and times of
noncompliance, and if the non-compliance continues, the time by which
compliance is reasonably expected to occur.
         C.   All steps taken or to be taken to reduce, eliminate and prevent
recurrence of such an upset or other conditions of non-compliance.
      (3)   A documented and verified operating upset may be an affirmative
defense to any enforcement action brought by the City against a discharger for
any noncompliance with this chapter, which arises out of violations alleged to
have occurred during the period of the upset.
      (4)   BMP compliance reporting. Industrial users shall submit
documentation indicating compliance with any and all best management practices
established by Section
913.21(e) to prevent releases and discharges of prohibited substances. Reports
must be received by January 10 and July 10 for the preceding six months, and
submitted to the Industrial Pretreatment Coordinator. Failure to abide by any
best management practices can result in a finding of significant non-
compliance.

913.27   TESTS, MEASUREMENTS AND METERING.
   (a)   Approved Methods. Testing of wastewater should be done in accordance
to the methods prescribed in 40 C.F.R. Part 136 and amendments thereto. Where
40 C.F.R. Part 136 does not contain sampling or analytical techniques for the
pollutant in question, or where the Utilities Director determines that the Part
136 sampling and analytical techniques are inappropriate for the pollutant in
question, sampling and analysis shall be performed by using analytical methods
or other applicable sampling analytical procedures approved by the Director.
Tests shall be determined at the control manhole provided, or upon suitable
samples taken at the control manhole. In the event that no special manhole has
been required, the control manhole shall be considered to the nearest
downstream manhole in the public sewer to the point at which the building sewer
is connected. Sampling shall be carried out by customarily accepted methods to
reflect the effect of constituents upon the sewage works and to determine the
existence of hazards to life, limb and property.
      (1)   Grab samples shall be used for pH, hexavalent chromium, cyanide,
total phenols, oil and grease, sulfide, and volatile organic compounds. For all
other pollutants, 24-hour composite samples shall be obtained through flow-
proportional composite sampling techniques, unless time-proportional composite
sampling or grab sampling is authorized by the City.
      (2)   Using protocols (including appropriate preservation) specified in
40 C.F.R. 136 and appropriate USEPA guidance, multiple grab samples collected
during a 24-hour period may be composited prior to the analysis as follows: for
hexavalent chromium, cyanide, total phenols, and sulfides the samples may be
composited in the laboratory or in the field; for volatile organics and oil and
grease the samples may be composited in the laboratory. Composite samples for
other parameters unaffected by the compositing procedures as documented in
approved USEPA methodologies may be authorized by the control authority, as
appropriate.
   (b)   Waste Sampling. Industrial wastes discharged into the public sewers
shall be subject to periodic inspection and a determination of character and
concentration of such wastes. The determinations shall be made as often as may
be deemed necessary by the Director. Samples shall be collected in such a
manner as to be representative of the composition of the wastes. The sampling
may be accomplished either manually or by the use of mechanical equipment
acceptable to the Director. Installation, operation and maintenance of the
sampling facilities shall be the responsibility of the industrial user
discharging the waste and shall be subject to the approval of the Director or
his or her duly authorized representative at all times. Samples shall be
collected and preserved in accordance with 40 C.F.R. Part 136.
   (c)   Measurement of Flow.
      (1)   When required by the Director a parcel of land, building or
premises discharging wastewater either directly or indirectly shall install a
suitable sewer meter in order to determine the sewer service charge or rental
provided herein at the expense of the industrial user.
      (2)   The type of sewer metering device shall be approved by the
Director. Following approval and installation, such meters may not be removed
without the consent of the Director.
      (3)   The user shall be required to calibrate the meter according to the
manufacturer’s recommendation. The industrial user shall maintain records of
the calibration results and shall provide such documentation to the City as
requested.
      (4)   In the event of a meter failure or inaccuracy, the user shall be
required to report the problem to the Industrial Pretreatment Coordinator
within 24 hours.
         A.   The sewer meter reading will be used as the basis for sewer
volume and surcharge billings.
         B.   In the event of a meter failure, if the sewer meter is repaired
and fully operational within 30 days of the initial notification, the flows for
the quarter in which the meter failed shall be determined by using the average
difference between the water and sewer meter reading for the previous 12
months.
         C.   If the sewer meter is not repaired and fully operational within
30 days of the initial notification, the flows for the quarter in which the
meter failed shall be determined using the water meter readings for said
quarter per Section
915.05.
      (5)   The Utilities Director shall have the authority allow users not
otherwise required, to install sewer flow meters at their request.
      (6)   In the event that the sewer meter shall fail and the user is not a
City water user and the usage cannot be measured by a City water meter, then,
in each such case the amount of water so used shall be otherwise estimated or
determined by the Director by other means, in order to determine the sewer
service charge or rental provided herein.
   (d)   Analysis. Laboratory procedures used for the analysis of industrial
wastes shall be those set forth in 40 C.F.R. Part 136. However, alternative
methods for certain analysis of wastes may be used, subject to mutual agreement
between the Director and the user. Analysis of the wastes shall be made by the
user discharging them, or his or her agent, as designated and required by the
Director. The City may also make its own analysis of wastes, and these
determinations shall be binding as a basis for charges.
   (e)   Limitations on Radioactive Wastes. No user shall discharge, or cause
to be discharge, any radioactive waste into a public sewer, except when the
industrial user is authorized to use radioactive materials by the Ohio
Department of Health or other governmental agency empowered to regulate the use
of radioactive material, and when the industrial user is in compliance with all
rules and regulations of all other applicable regulatory agencies.

   (EDITOR'S NOTE:  Section 913.32 was repealed by Ordinance A-2051, passed
August 26, 1996.)
913.33   ENFORCEMENT.
   The Utilities Director, or any agent designated by him or her from time to
time, shall be responsible to enforce the provisions of this chapter as
follows:
   (a)   If the Director, or his or her designated agent, reasonably believes
that any user has violated any provision of this chapter, the Director shall
serve, or cause to be served upon such user a written notice of violation
identifying the violation. The user may appeal such notice of violation by
written notice setting forth the reason(s) for the appeal and requesting a
hearing as provided in this section, if desired, received by the Director not
later than 15 days after service of the notice of violation upon the user.
   (b)   If the Director, or his or her designated agent, reasonably believes
that any user is in violation of any provision of this chapter, the Director
may serve, or cause to be served, a written administrative order, either
personally or by certified mail, return receipt requested, upon such user. Such
administrative order shall identify the violation, indicate the action
necessary to be taken by the user to achieve compliance with respect to such
violation, and may, in the discretion of the Director, impose an administrative
fine in an amount not to exceed one thousand dollars ($1,000) per day for each
violation during the period of such violation(s). The user may appeal such
administrative order by written notice, setting forth the reason(s) for the
appeal and requesting a hearing as provided in this section, if desired,
received by the Director not later than 15 days after service of the
administrative order upon the user.
   (c)   Upon timely receipt of a written notice of appeal and request for a
hearing as provided in subsections (a) and (b) hereof, or in the absence of
such notice of appeal and request for a hearing, at the discretion of the
Director when there is any failure of timely compliance with an administrative
order, the Director, or his or her designated agent, shall conduct a hearing
not less than three nor more than seven days following receipt by the user of
written notice of the scheduled hearing date. The time for conducting such
hearing may be extended by the Director, or his or her designated agent, in his
or her discretion and for good cause, for a period not to exceed seven days
following the originally scheduled hearing date. In the case of timely appeal
and request for a hearing by the user, such hearing shall be for the purpose of
considering the notice of violation or the administrative order from which the
appeal is taken, including, but not limited to, whether or not a violation has
occurred, the reasonableness of the compliance schedule proposed for correcting
a violation, the reasonableness or appropriateness of an administrative fine,
or extenuating circumstances. In the case of a hearing conducted at the
discretion of the Director when there is any failure of timely compliance with
an administrative order, such hearing shall be for the purpose to permit the
user to show cause why the enforcement action should not be taken and/or the
administrative fine should not be imposed. The hearing shall be conducted in
such a manner and such evidence and information shall be considered as may be
determined to be appropriate under the circumstances in the discretion of the
Director or his or her designated agent. Upon the hearing, the Director, or his
or her designated agent, may sustain, withdraw, or modify, in whole or in part,
the notice of violation or the administrative order which is the subject of
such hearing. The Director, or his or her designated agent, shall serve, or
cause to be served, upon the user a copy of his or her written decision. The

(Ord. A-2494.  Passed 10-23-06.)
918.02   PURPOSE AND OBJECTIVE.
   (a)   It is hereby declared necessary for the protection of the public
health, safety, welfare of the City and its inhabitants to establish a
Stormwater Utility which allocates the cost of providing storm water service to
each user in such a manner that the allocated costs are proportionate to the
benefit of providing storm water service to that user, insofar as those costs
can reasonably be determined.  The revenue received by the City shall be used
by the City for the payment of the cost of the management, maintenance,
operation, repair, monitoring, sampling and survey costs of the storm water
system.  This fee is not related to water and/or sewer service and applies
whether or not the premises are occupied.
   (b)   The Department of Utilities shall (1) promote stormwater management
activities and practices as required by the Ohio EPA NPDES Stormwater Permit;
(2) educate the public on stormwater control; (3) operate and provide
maintenance of the storm sewer system; (4) perform stormwater sampling and
surveys in accordance with the NPDES permit; and (5) manage the funding of the
stormwater maintenance and stormwater monitoring.
(Ord. A-2494.  Passed 10-23-06.)
918.03   STORMWATER UTILITY FUND.
   The revenues received pursuant to this chapter shall be collected by the
Finance Director and shall be deposited into the Stormwater Utility Fund. The
Stormwater Utility Fund shall be used solely for the cost and expense and the
maintenance, operation, repair and capital improvements of the storm sewer
system and for the monitoring, sampling and surveys of the storm sewer system
and waterways.
(Ord. A-2494.  Passed 10-23-06.)
918.04   POWERS AND AUTHORITY.
   (a)   The storm water utility fee set pursuant to this chapter shall be
collected by the Department of Finance, which shall be responsible for the
regulation, collection, rebating and refunding of such storm water charges.
   (b)   The Director of Utilities shall make and enforce such rules and
regulations as deemed necessary for the safe, economical, and efficient
management and protection of the Citys storm water system in accordance with
the OEPA NPDES Stormwater Permit.

   (a)   The owner of each and every lot and/or parcel of land within the City
that contains impervious area which contributes directly or indirectly to the
storm water system of the City shall be jointly and severally liable for
charges resulting from the storm water utility fee. The fact that the City
carries an account in the name of a tenant or other non-owner does not relieve
the owner(s) of liability for stormwater charges for the premises.
   (b)   All properties having impervious area within the City of Sidney will
be assigned an Equivalent Residential Unit (ERU) or a multiple thereof. Each
lot and/or parcel of land within the City with impervious area will have at
least one (1) ERU:
      (1)   All residential properties, as defined in Section
918.01(p), are assigned one (1) ERU.  The flat rate will apply to all
residential properties.
      (2)   All non-residential properties, as defined in Section
918.01(i), are assigned an ERU multiple based upon the individually measured
impervious area (in square feet) of the property divided by 2,752 square feet
(1 ERU) but in no event less than one (1) ERU.  The mathematical calculation
will be to the first decimal place and rounded according to mathematical
convention.
   (c)   The storm water service fee shall be two dollars and ten cents ($2.10)
per Equivalent Residential Unit (ERU) per month comprised as follows:
      (1)   Stormwater Maintenance:         $0.70
      (2)   Stormwater Monitoring:         $0.35
      (3)   Stormwater Capital:            $1.05
      (4)   Total Monthly Stormwater ERU:      $2.10
   (d)   For all nonresidential properties, the total square footage of
impervious area shall be measured by the City based on the records of the
County Recorder or County Auditor; City Engineering Drawings and Plans;
questionnaires completed by the property owners; field measurements or
photogrammetric analysis.
   (e)   All property owners proposed for development after the date of the
adoption of this chapter shall include, on all preliminary and final plan
drawings submitted to the City in connection with the subdivision approval
process, a certification as to the total square footage of impervious surface
area to be located on the property following development.
   (f)   The average square footage of impervious area for residential property
as defined in Section
918.01 and used as the basis of one ERU shall be reevaluated every five (5)
years by the Utilities Director through field measurements or photogrammetric
analysis.

918.06   STORM WATER ONLY ACCOUNTS.
   (a)   Storm water only accounts are defined as properties that do not
utilize water and/or sanitary sewer services but do contain impervious area or
hard surface and contribute directly or indirectly to the City’s storm water
system as determined by the Director of Utilities.

system of the City.  The amount certified shall be a lien on the property
served from the date placed on the list and duplicate and shall be collected
together with real estate taxes by the County Treasurer.
(Ord. A-2494.  Passed 10-23-06.)
918.09   ADJUSTMENTS.
   (a)   In the event the amount of impervious area on a nonresidential
property is decreased or increased above that assigned by the Department of
Utilities, an adjustment may be made to the ERU multiple assigned to the
property to properly reflect the adjusted amount of impervious area. The new
ERU multiple shall be billed from the date on which the Department mails a
notification of the change to the owner of the property.
   (b)   If the Department of Utilities finds that it has been under or over
billing a nonresidential property as a result of the increase in impervious
area, the owner will receive notification from the City that an adjustment is
being made to the property's ERU multiple. In the event that over billing has
occurred, a refund of the difference between the corrected amount and the over-
billed amount shall be credited to the account for a maximum of the previous 12
months. The owner shall not be penalized for the under-billing.
   (c)   In the event that the runoff from a parcel does not drain into any of
the City's drainage watersheds or systems, the parcel shall only be charged the
stormwater monitoring portion of the ERU per Section
918.05(c). Such adjustments shall be made when the owner submits an appeal of
the ERU assignment.
(Ord. A-2494.  Passed 10-23-06; Ord. A-2549.  Passed 1-28-08; Ord. A-2743.

918.10   RIGHT TO APPEAL.
   (a)   A non-residential property owner may challenge the ERU multiple
assigned his property by filing an appeal with the Director of Utilities for
adjustment thereof, stating in writing the grounds for the appeal.  The
Director shall cause appropriate investigation thereof and report the findings
to the property owner.  The Director shall consider the appeal and determine
whether an adjustment of the ERU multiple for any such lot or parcel is
necessary, and adjust such ERU multiple if appropriate.
   (b)   If the property owner is not satisfied with the findings, and
administrative hearing may be requested.  At the hearing, both the property
owner and the Director of Utilities may present evidence to the City Manager. 
After consideration, the City Manager shall issue a written decision to the
parties which shall be the final decision of the Department of Utilities.

(Ord. A-1947.  Passed 3-14-94.)
919.14   STORMWATER MANAGEMENT SYSTEM.
   (a)   Required in Subdivisions and Developments.
      (1)   Every subdivision and land development shall be provided with a
comprehensive stormwater management system which is adequate to serve the area
and which meets the requirements of this chapter, the Stormwater Management
Design Manual and other criteria of the City.  There are two classifications of
stormwater management systems which must exist:
         A.   The initial or minor drainage system shall provide for the
collecting and transporting of runoff water from frequently occurring storms. 
Such system includes watercourses, streets, curbs, gutters, underground storm
sewers, manholes, catch basins and culverts.  This system's purpose is to
lessen or eliminate inconveniences and safety and health hazards associated
with frequent storms. Except where indicated otherwise, design criteria and
requirements of this chapter are directed to the minor drainage system.
         B.   Major drainage system features shall ensure that stormwater
runoff which exceeds the capacity of the minor drainage system has a route to
follow that will not cause any loss of property or any loss of life. It must be
recognized that the major drainage system exists even when it is not planned
and whether or not physical facilities are intelligently located in respect to
it.
   (b)   Classification of Drainageways/Waterways. The following
classifications shall be applied for drainageways/waterways in determining
design and operational capacity:
      (1)   Major drainageways are defined as those with a tributary area in
excess of 351 acres.  Such major drainageways shall be designed so that no
structural damage shall occur when the average recurrence interval of 100 years
is used for hydraulic analysis of the drainageways.  Storm detention channel
construction or other improvements may be necessary to pass the 100-year design
storm through existing downstream sections of the drainageway.
      (2)   Secondary waterways are defined as those with a tributary area
between 100 and 350 acres. Such secondary waterways shall be designed so that
no structural damage shall occur when the average recurrence interval of fifty
years is used for hydraulic analysis of the drainageways.  Storm detention
channel construction or other improvements may be necessary to pass the fifty-
year design storm through existing downstream sections of the drainageway.
      (3)   Minor waterways are defined as those with ninety-nine acres or less
of tributary area.  Such minor drainageways shall be designed so that no
structural damage shall occur when the average recurrence interval of twenty-
five years is used for hydraulic analysis of the drainageways.  Storm 
detention  channel  construction  or other  improvements  may be necessary to
pass the twenty-five year design storm through existing downstream sections of
the drainageway.
   In addition to or in lieu of the above noted standards, the City Engineer
may utilize a water surface profile program, such as HEC-2 (Hydraulic
Engineering Center Software Program, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers), to
determine the appropriate size of system components and to provide the maximum
amount of cost benefit for each area.
   (c)   Stormwater Runoff.
      (1)   Land uses which increase the runoff rate or volume shall be
required to control the discharge rate of runoff prior to its release to off-
site land.  The purposes of this policy are to:
         A.   Permit development without increasing the flooding of other
lands.
         B.   Reduce damage to receiving streams and impairment of their
capacity which may be caused by increases in quantity and rate of water
discharged.
         C.   Establish a basis for design of a storm drainage system on lands
below undeveloped areas which will preserve the rights of property owners and
assure the long-term adequacy of storm drainage systems.
      (2)   Developers are required to design improvements such that after
development, the rate of stormwater runoff leaving the project area at
strategic points is no more than if the project area had remained undeveloped. 
If necessary, detention/retention facilities shall be constructed to assure
that this requirement is met.
      (3)   Where a portion of the project area contains existing development
features, such as buildings, streets, parking lots, sidewalks, driveways, etc.,
and a permit application is made for additional development, the area to be
considered in determining the rate of stormwater runoff shall be only that on
which the additional development is sought.
      (4)   The City Engineer may reduce or waive requirements for an
individual detention/retention basin if a common or regional basin of adequate
design is available, or if the Stormwater Management Utility is reasonably
certain that one will be constructed, and if the major drainage system from the
project area to such common or regional basin is such that the public health,
safety and welfare will not be in jeopardy.
      (5)   Stormwater management systems will be designed for the ultimate use
of the land and shall be capable of conveying runoff originating upstream as
determined by the City Engineer.
   (d)   Acquisition of Easements for Public Facilities on Private Property. In
those case where components of a stormwater management system, designed to be
operated as a public facility, lie outside the public right of way, easements
of sufficient size, as determined by the City Engineer, shall be acquired from
the owner of the property to assure access and maintenance.
   (e)   Detention/Retention Basins.
      (1)   Detention/retention basins serve to capture and, temporarily or on
a long-term basis, store the surface water runoff which results from urban
development. This storage allows for the release of the stormwater runoff at
discharge rates which are acceptable to the receiving waterway.
      (2)   On-site provisions of detention/retention storage shall conform to
the following standards:
         A.   The release rate and volume of storage shall be based on the 100-
year storm interval design for post development conditions and be released at a
five-year storm interval rate for pre-development conditions;
         B.   Recreational use should be maximized where possible and feasible.
(Ord. A-1947.  Passed 3-14-94.)
919.15   PRINCIPLES FOR MINIMIZING EROSION AND SEDIMENTATION; STANDARDS FOR
PREPARATION OF PLANS; CONTENTS OF PLANS.
   (a)   The following principles are effective in minimizing erosion and
sedimentation and shall be included where applicable in plans:

done in such a way that will minimize erosion.  Whenever feasible, natural
vegetation shall be retained, protected and supplemented;
      (2)   Development plans shall preserve salient natural features, keep
grading operations to a minimum and ensure conformity with topography so as to
create the least erosion potential;
      (3)   The smallest practical area of land shall be exposed at any one
time, and the duration of exposure shall be kept to a practical minimum.  The
topsoil shall be preserved and returned to the surface of areas to be re-
vegetated, new topsoil will be provided or the surface shall be covered with
sod;
      (4)   Disturbed soils shall be stabilized as quickly as practical with
temporary vegetation or mulching to protect exposed critical areas during
development;
      (5)   The permanent vegetation and structural erosion control and
drainage measures shall be installed as soon as practical in the development;
      (6)   Provision shall be made to effectively accommodate the increased
stormwater runoff caused by changed soil and surface conditions during and
after development.  Where necessary, detention/retention basins shall be
provided according to the requirements of this chapter and the Stormwater
Management Design Manual; and
      (7)   Sediment in the runoff water shall be trapped by the use of
sediment basins or similar measures until the disturbed area is stabilized.
   (b)   The following standards shall be followed in preparing plans:
      (1)   All lots, tracts or parcels shall be graded to provide proper
drainage away from buildings for disposal of water without ponding, and all
land within a project area shall be graded to drain and dispose of surface
water without ponding, except where approved by the City Engineer.  Each lot
shall be graded such that water from the lot drains to natural streams, swales,
other watercourses or storm sewers.
      (2)   All drainage provisions shall be of such design to adequately
handle the stormwater runoff according to the Stormwater Management Design
Manual;
      (3)   Concentrations of stormwater runoff shall only be permitted in
swales or watercourses;
      (4)   The installation of the specific stormwater management measures
shall be accomplished in accordance with the standards and specifications
contained in the Stormwater Management Design Manual; and
      (5)   During the construction phase, further consultative technical
assistance will be furnished, if necessary, by the City Engineer, who shall
enforce compliance with the approved plans.

regarding plan review and approval are hereby established:
   (a)   The Stormwater Management Utility shall assist all other departments
in the review of plans submitted with applications for permits for development.
   (b)   Where a permit is required, the City Engineer shall review the
application and plan for the proposed permit. If the City Engineer finds the
application and plans in conformance with the provisions of this chapter, the
City Engineer may issue a permit, with such reasonable conditions as the City
Engineer deems necessary to secure the objectives of this chapter.
   (c)   Approved plans, specifications and reports for all site development
shall be retained in their original form or by other means approved by the
Utility.
   (d)   Every permit shall expire by limitation and become null and void if
the work authorized by such permit has not commenced within 180 days, or is not
completed within one year, from the date of issue.  The City Engineer may grant
a reasonable extension of time if the permit holder presents satisfactory
evidence that unusual difficulties have prevented work from being started or
completed within the specified time limits and if written application is made
before the expiration date of the permit.
(Ord. A-1947.  Passed 3-14-94.)
919.20   MAINTENANCE OF APPROVED PLANS AND PERMIT ON JOB SITES; INSPECTIONS;
IMPLEMENTATION OF STOP WORK ORDERS AND ADDITIONAL SAFETY PRECAUTIONS;
CORRECTION OF CONSTRUCTION AND GRADING ACTIVITIES ON SITES WHERE NO PERMIT IS
REQUIRED.
   (a)   An approved plan bearing the City Engineer's stamp of approval shall
be maintained at the site, along with any required permit, during progress of
the work.
   (b)   Inspection and notification procedures and the time allowed to correct
deficiencies shall be established by the City Engineer.
   (c)   The inspector shall inspect the work covered by the plan and permit. 
At any stage of the construction, when conditions are not as stated or shown on
the plan, the inspector may, with the approval of the City Engineer, order
further work stopped until approval is obtained for a revised plan conforming
to the existing conditions.
   (d)   If, at any stage of the work, the inspector determines that the
conditions are such that further work, as authorized by the existing permit, is
likely to imperil any person, property, public way, watercourse or drainage
structure, the inspector may require, as a condition of allowing the work to
proceed, that such reasonable safety precautions be taken as are considered
available to avoid the likelihood of such peril.  Where it appears that storm
damage may result because the grading is not complete, the inspector may, with
the approval of the City Engineer, order work to be stopped and require the
developer to install temporary planting to control erosion, to install
temporary structures or to take such other measures as may be required to
protect adjoining property or the public safety.
   (e)   Where no permit has been required and it is evident that construction
and grading have caused the existing surface drainage in the general area to be
impaired, have created an erosion hazard or have become a source of sediment to
any adjacent land or watercourse, the City Engineer shall:
      (1)   Have the developer verbally notified to take measures necessary to
correct the situation within a specific period of time;
      (2)   Take immediate action, if necessary to protect persons or property
from damage, by causing corrective measures to be taken and charging the
developer for all costs incurred by the City as a result of such action;
      (3)   Have corrective measures performed by other than the developer,
with the incurred expense charged to the developer, if not completed by the
specified time period; or
      (4)   Recommend to the City Manager that the Building Department withhold
the issuance of a certificate of occupancy for all structures on the project
area until all costs incurred by the City have been paid in full by the
developer. 
(Ord. A-1947.  Passed 3-14-94.)
919.21   FEES; BONDS.
   (a)   Fees. Fees for plan review, permits, construction and plan compliance
inspections, as-built plan review and inspections, etc., shall be established
from time to time by Council.
   (b)   Bonds. In order to ensure that emergency or corrective measures may be
taken by the City if the stormwater management measures are not implemented
according to the approved plan and schedule, a performance bond, in an amount
approved by the City Engineer to be sufficient to cover the cost of the
stormwater management measures, shall be required to be filed with the City
Engineer.  The performance bond shall authorize immediate payment to the City
on certification by the City Engineer that necessary emergency or corrective
work must be done or has to be done to ensure proper stormwater management and
sediment control as a result of the landowner's failure to complete or adhere
to the approved plan.
(Ord. A-1947.  Passed 3-14-94.)
919.22   SUSPENSION AND REVOCATION OF PERMIT.
   (a)   Temporary Suspension. In the event that any person holding a permit
issued pursuant to this chapter violates the terms of the permit or conducts
site development in such a manner as to adversely affect the health, safety or
welfare of persons residing or working in the neighborhood of the project area
or property, or whenever any false statement or misrepresentation has been made
upon the application, plans or specifications on which the issuance of the
permit or approval was based, the City Engineer shall temporarily suspend the
permit.
   After a temporary suspension is received, each and every act of proceeding
with any operation for which such permit was issued shall be considered a
violation of this chapter, pending permanent revocation by the City Manager.
   (b)   Procedure for Permit Revocation. No permit shall be permanently
revoked until a hearing is held by the City Manager or his or her designee. 
Written notice of such hearing shall be served on the developer, either
personally or by registered mail, and shall state:
      (1)   The grounds for the complaint or reasons for the revocation, in
clear and concise language; and
      (2)   The time when, and the place where, such public hearing is to be
held.  At any such hearing, the permit holder shall be given an opportunity to
be heard and may call witnesses and present evidence on his or her behalf. 
Upon the conclusion of such hearing, the City Manager or his or designee shall
determine whether or not the permit shall be revoked and shall issue, in
writing, a notice of revocation.  No part of any fee for such revoked permit
shall be returned.
(Ord. A-1947.  Passed 3-14-94.)
919.23   FUNDING.
   Funding for the Stormwater Management Utility shall include, but not be
limited to:

earnings on those revenues, shall be deposited in the Stormwater Utility Fund
and used exclusively for Utility purposes.
(Ord. A-1947.  Passed 3-14-94.)
919.25   CORRECTION OF IMPROPER DRAINAGE; NOTICE; HEARINGS.
   (a)   Whenever the City Engineer finds that a tract of land is inadequately
drained, that there is an obstruction to a culvert or watercourse that
interferes with water naturally flowing therein, or that such culvert, storm
sewer or watercourse is of insufficient capacity to reasonably accommodate the
flow of water, as required by this chapter, the City Engineer shall notify the
owner or person having possession, charge or management of such land to remove
the obstruction or provide adequate drainage.  Such notice shall be served on
such persons by personal delivery, by registered mail at the last known place
of residence or by posting on the premises.
   (b)   The owner shall comply with the City Engineer's orders within the time
specified in the notice, not to be less than thirty days and not to exceed
ninety days.
   (c)   In any case where an improper drainage condition exists beyond the
time specified by the City Engineer in the notice, the City Manager shall
schedule a show-cause hearing, giving the property owner an opportunity to
offer reasons as to why the owner is unwilling or unable to comply with the
orders of the City Engineer.  The owner shall receive notification of the
hearing at least two weeks in advance of the scheduled date.  Such notice shall
be served on such persons by personal delivery, by registered mail at the last
known place of residence or by posting on the premises.
   (d)   Following the show-cause hearing, the City Manager may accept, reject
or modify the order of the City Engineer.  The Manager shall notify the
petitioner, in writing, as to his or her decision on the matter.  Orders for
compliance shall set forth a specific deadline.
   (e)   A copy of the City Manager's decision shall be served upon the owner
or his or her agent, or published in a newspaper of general circulation in the
City for two consecutive weeks.  Once this action has taken place, the owner or
his or her agent shall comply with the order within the time therein specified.
   (f)   Failure of the City to observe or recognize hazardous conditions or to
recommend denial of a permit shall not relieve the developer from the
responsibility for the condition or damage resulting therefrom, and shall not
result in the City, its officers or agents, being responsible for any condition
or damage resulting therefrom.
   (g)   Nothing in this chapter shall be construed as authorizing any person
to maintain a private or public nuisance on his or her property, and compliance
with the provisions of this chapter shall not be a defense in any action to
abate such a nuisance.
(Ord. A-1947.  Passed 3-14-94.)
919.26   FAILURE OR REFUSAL OF OWNER TO CORRECT VIOLATIONS; ABATEMENT BY CITY;
COLLECTION OF COSTS.
   (a)   In the case of the failure or refusal of an owner to comply with the
order provided for in Section
919.25, the work required thereby may be performed by the City or its agents,
and the amount of money so expended shall be recovered from the owner before
any court of competent jurisdiction.  Further, the expenses described in
subsection (b) hereof that constitute the City Manager's time shall be a lien
on such property, which may be enforced by suit in the Court of Common Pleas or
be charged against the real estate in accordance with Ohio R.C. 715.261.
   (b)   The City Engineer shall account for all costs associated with an
emergency or abatement, including, but not limited to, administration,
notification, inspection, serving of papers or documents, legal counsel, force
account labor, enforcement, operational services and outside contracted
services.

   The petition for an appeal shall set forth the interpretation, ruling or
order appealed from, and the related provisions of this chapter or related laws
or ordinances, and shall state wherein the interpretation, ruling or order is
erroneous.  If the appeal is a request for a variance, the petition shall point
out the provision or provisions from which the variance is sought and how the
request satisfies the requirements of Section
919.30.
(Ord. A-1947.  Passed 3-14-94.)
919.30   FINDINGS OF FACT FOR VARIANCES.
   The Stormwater Appeals Board, in hearing requests for a variance filed in
accordance with the provisions of Section
919.28, shall not grant a variance in the application of any of the provisions
of this chapter unless it finds all of the following:
   (a)   That the land is of such shape or size, is affected by such physical
conditions or is subject to such title limitations of record, that it is
impossible or impractical for the subdivider or developer to comply with all of
the provisions of this chapter;
   (b)   That there are special circumstances or conditions, fully described in
the City Engineer's findings, applying to the land for which the variance is
sought, which circumstances or conditions are peculiar to such land and do not
apply generally in the City, that said circumstances or conditions are such
that the strict application of the provisions of this chapter would deprive the
applicant of the reasonable use of such land, and that the variance is the
minimum variance that will accomplish this purpose;
   (c)   That the granting of the variance will be in harmony with the general
purpose and intent of this chapter and will not be injurious to the
neighborhood or the City or otherwise be detrimental to the public health,
safety and welfare;
   (d)   That the condition or situation of the specific piece of property for
which a variance is sought is not of so general or recurrent a nature as to
make reasonably practicable the formulation of a general regulation for such
condition or situation;
   (e)   That the special conditions or circumstances do not result from the
actions of the petitioner; and
   (f)   That no permitted use of lands in other areas of the City is used as a
ground for issuance of such a variance.
(Ord. A-1947.  Passed 3-14-94.)
919.31   AMENDMENTS.
   Whenever public necessity, convenience, general welfare or good stormwater
management practice requires it, an amendment, supplement or change to this
chapter may be considered by Council.
(Ord. A-1947.  Passed 3-14-94.)
919.32   LIABILITY OF CITY FOR FLOODING.
   Floods from stormwater runoff may occasionally occur which exceed the
capacity of storm drainage facilities constructed, operated or maintained by
funds made available under this chapter. This chapter does not imply that
property subject to the fees and charges established herein will always be free
from stormwater flooding or flood damage, or that stormwater systems capable of
handling all storm events can be cost effectively constructed, operated or
maintained, nor shall this chapter create a liability on the part of, or be the
cause of action against, the City or any officer or employee thereof, for any
flood damage that may result from such storms or the runoff thereof, nor does
this chapter purport to reduce the need or the necessity for obtaining flood
insurance.
(Ord. A-1947.  Passed 3-14-94.)
919.33   SEPARABILITY.
   If any section, subsection, sentence, clause or phrase of this chapter is
for any reason held to be invalid or unconstitutional by the decision of any
court of competent jurisdiction, such decision shall not affect the validity of
the remaining portions of this chapter.  Council hereby declares that it would
have passed this chapter, and each section, subsection, sentence, clause and
phrase hereof, irrespective of the fact that any one or more of the sections,
subsections, sentences, clauses or phrases hereof may be declared invalid or
unconstitutional.
(Ord. A-1947.  Passed 3-14-94.)

920.02   PURPOSE OF CHAPTER.
   (a)   The elements which will determine the orderly sanitary sewer growth
environment are:
      (1)   The existing excess sewer capacity of the trunk sewers.
      (2)   The excess pump station and force main capacity.
      (3)   The excess sewer capacity of the Wastewater Treatment Plant.
      (4)   Ohio EPA rules and regulations affecting the sanitary sewers pump
stations and the Wastewater Treatment Plant.
      (5)   The growth environment which must protect the City's existing
sanitary sewer customer.
   (b)   The City's Utilities Department will determine the existing and excess
flows for all sanitary trunk sewers within the City. All sewer flows emanating
from the non-incorporated areas shall enter a currently approved excess
capacity sanitary trunk sewer.
   (c)   The capacity of the existing pump stations can be increased by
changing the pump impeller and/or decreasing the length of the existing force
main.
   (d)   Decreasing the length of the force main involves adding another lift
station somewhere along the existing force main or replacing all or part of the
existing force main with a gravity sanitary sewer.
   (e)   The capacity of the City's Wastewater Treatment Plant is dependent
upon the infiltration and inflow of the sanitary sewer system. The Utilities
Department will monitor and investigate the infiltration and inflow in an
effort to find and remove excess sewer flows. The success of removing this
infiltration and inflow will directly affect the City's ability to accept
excess sewage from the non-incorporated areas.
   (f)   The current or future City sanitary sewer customer located within the
City Corporation Limit shall have priority to the existing excess sewer
capacity, including all sanitary sewers located within the Corporation Limits.
   (g)   Any changes to the sanitary sewer system, including the Wastewater
Treatment Plant, shall be approved by the Ohio EPA before the change is
initiated. In addition, the Utilities Department of the City shall approve any
proposed change to the sanitary sewer system.
   (h)   Other governmental units requesting the City to accept their
wastewater flow shall enter into a legal contract approved by City Council. The
City does not own nor operate a regional wastewater plant.
   (i)   The water distribution system can be computer modeled by the Utilities
Department. The department maintains information relating to the location, size
and pressure of all existing and future water main extensions. Therefore, the
water distribution system is capable of being expanded to all non-incorporated
areas, if justification and physical means are available.

system unless the applicant’s property is annexed into the City Corporation
Limit.
   (b)   The City Council may waive the annexation requirement by entering into
a contract with the applicant. Consideration for waiving annexation involve:
      (1)   A serious safety, health, or environmental threat to the City.
      (2)   Significant economic development which benefits the citizens of
Sidney.
   (c)   Conditions of any contract with an applicant whose property lies
outside the City’s Corporation Limit shall include the applicable surcharge in
effect at the time of the contract and a consent to future annexation. The
requirement to consent to future annexation shall not apply to governmental
applicants.
   (d)   The City Council may permit connection of a County owned sewer
treatment facility to the City’s sanitary sewer without annexation, if
requested by the County Commissioners. The conditions for such sewer service
includes a written agreement between the County and the City specifying the
terms and conditions of the City service including, but not limited to, the

      (1)   The City Manager shall have the authority to reduce the length of a
sanitary sewer or water extension for the following reasons:
         A.   For sanitary sewer: If the extension to the farthest property
line will result in the sanitary sewer becoming less than 32 inches in depth.
         B.   For water mains: If the extension to the farthest property line
will create low pressure (less than 25 psi) that cannot be addressed by water
looping.
         C.   Obstructions: If the presence of obstructions such as a waterway
or railroad would create an undue financial hardship on the developer or
property owner, the City may elect to participate in the construction costs as
provided in Section 920.05 or may limit the length of the utility extension to
the point of the obstruction.
      (2)   The City Manager shall have the authority to permit a property
owner to extend the required water or sanitary sewer main at a later date for

property owner.
         B.   If the subject property is being developed in phases and the
water mains will be extended or looped in subsequent phases of the development.
         C.   Such variance to extend the water main at a later date shall only
be granted if in the opinion of the Fire Chief, the phase being developed can
be adequately protected with the proposed fire flows.
      (3)   If the City Manager permits the property owner to extend the water
main or the sanitary sewer main at a later date, a written agreement shall be
entered into between the City and the property owner containing the following
stipulations:
         A.   If, at a later date, the property is subdivided as provided for
in

the City’s Burial Permission Form must be completed by the owner, or if

   (a)   Per Ohio R.C. 9.15, the City will provide burial or cremation services
for a decedent who qualifies as an indigent.
   (b)   If the identity of the decedent is unknown and the decedent is found
within the City limits, he or she will qualify for indigent services by
Graceland Cemetery. Otherwise, to qualify for indigent services by Graceland
Cemetery, the decedent must meet all of the following criteria:
      (1)   The decedent has insufficient estate (cash, property or assets,
etc.) from which to pay the cost of burial or cremation services;
      (2)   Assistance from the Social Security Administration or Veterans

   (c)   To qualify as an indigent for services by Graceland Cemetery, the
decedent's representative shall sign an Indigent Services Agreement provided by
the City, acknowledging responsibility for services should the decedent or
decedent's representative be found to not be indigent. The decedent's
representative shall then complete and sign an application form provided by the
City which documents and verifies decedent's assets and decedent's
representative's income in order for the City's Finance Officer to determine
whether the decedent qualifies for an indigent cremation. Income sufficiency
will be based on gross income at or below 100% of the Federal Poverty Income
Guidelines.
   (d)   No monument or grave marker shall be placed on an indigent gravesite
unless payment is made, in full, of the City's expenses for indigent services.
(Ord. A-2566.  Passed 5-27-08.)
921.10   OWNERSHIP RIGHTS OF GRAVES, CRYPTS AND NICHES.
   (a)   Cemetery graves, crypts and niches are conveyed by the City to the
owner by a Certificate of Ownership. The Certificate of Ownership grants to the
owner the right to be interred in the grave, crypt or niche. The Certificate of
Ownership does not grant to the owner general property rights, such as the
right to sell or transfer the grave, crypt or niche to another party.
Accordingly, no owner shall sell or convey ownership of his or her grave, crypt
or niche or any part thereof to any other person.
   (b)   The City will refund the original purchase price of a grave, crypt or
niche, without interest, to the owner or the next of kin of a deceased owner
who may desire to return a grave, crypt or niche to the City. A refund to the
next of kin will require proof of the name and address of all next of kin and
the consent by all next of kin to the refund. Following refund of the purchase
price, the City will acquire all ownership rights to the subject grave or
crypt.
   (c)   The right of interment may be transferred by the owner to another
party. The owner must complete the Burial Permission Form and file it with the
Utility Billing office at the City Building prior to the interment of a third
party.
   (d)   In addition, the next of kin of deceased owner will acquire interment
rights in vacant graves, crypts or niches owned by a deceased owner, by the
laws of descent and distribution per Ohio R.C. 2105.06. Thus, a next of kin has
the right to be interred in the lot on a “first come, first serve” basis, until
all of the graves, crypts or niches (owned by a deceased owner) within the lot
are occupied. To qualify for “next of kin” interment rights, the next of kin
must:
      (1)   Complete a Burial Permission Form.
      (2)   The signatures of all next of kin are required.
      (3)   A list of all of the next of kin (i.e. probate documents or the
decedent's obituary) must be provided with the form.
(Ord. A-2566.  Passed 5-27-08.)
921.11   DEFACING MONUMENTS.
   (a)   No person, without privilege to do so, shall knowingly cause harm or
damage to any tomb, monument, gravestone, or similar structure that is used as
a memorial for the dead; to any fence, railing, curb, or other property that is
used to protect, enclose or ornament any place of burial; or to a place of
burial.
   (b)   No person, without privilege to do so, shall knowingly cause physical
harm to a place of burial by breaking and entering into a tomb, crypt, casket,
or other structure that is used as a memorial for the dead or as an enclosure
for the dead.
   (c)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of defacing or damaging

older, on application of the surviving spouse and payment by the applicant of
the costs and expense of disinterment;
      (2)   On order of a probate court issued of the payment by the person who
applied for the order under that division of the costs and expense of
disinterment.
   (b)   No disinterment shall be made pursuant to this section and Ohio R.C.
517.24 if the decedent died of a contagious or infectious disease until a
permit has been issued by the Shelby County Board of Health.
   (c)   Upon disinterment of remains under division (a)(1) or (2) of this
section, the City Manager shall cause to be delivered the disinterred remains
to the applicant surviving spouse or, if the disinterment was pursuant to court
order issued under Ohio R.C. 517.24(B), to the person who applied for the order
under that division.
   (d)   The City Manager or his designee may disinter and, if appropriate, may
reinter any remains buried in the cemetery to correct an interment error in the
cemetery if the City Manager or his designee provides notice of the
disinterment to the decedent’s last known next of kin. The City Manager or his
designee may correct an interment error under this division without a court
order or an application by a person.
   (e)   (1)   A person who is an interested party and who is 18 years of age
or older and of sound mind may apply to the probate court of the county in
which the decedent is buried for an order to prevent the decedent's surviving
spouse from having the remains of the decedent disinterred. An application to
prevent the disinterment of the remains of the decedent shall be in writing,
subscribed and verified by oath, and include all of the following:
         A.   If applicable, a statement that the applicant assumed financial
responsibility for the funeral and burial expenses of the decedent;

responsibility for the funeral and burial expenses of the decedent;
         C.   A statement that the applicant is 18 years of age or older and of
sound mind;
         D.   The relationship of the applicant to the decedent;
         E.   A statement of the applicant's reasons to oppose the disinterment
of the remains of the decedent.
      (2)   An applicant for an order to prevent the disinterment of the
remains of the decedent under division (e) of this section promptly shall give
notice of the filing of the application by certified mail, return receipt
requested, to the decedent's surviving spouse. The notice shall indicate that
the applicant has filed an application for an order to prevent the disinterment
of the remains of the decedent.

1108.01   GENERAL PROVISIONS.
   Statutory authorization.  Article XVIII, Section 3, of the Ohio Constitution
grants municipalities the legal authority to adopt land use and control
measures for promoting the health, safety, and general welfare of its citizens.
Therefore, the City Council does ordain as follows:
   (a)   Findings of Fact. The City has special flood hazard areas that are
subject to periodic inundation which may result in loss of life and property,
health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services,
extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief, and
impairment of the tax base. Additionally, structures that are inadequately
elevated, floodproofed, or otherwise protected from flood damage also
contribute to the flood loss. In order to minimize the threat of such damages
and to achieve the purposes hereinafter set forth, these regulations are
adopted.
   (b)   Statement of Purpose. It is the purpose of these regulations to
promote the public health, safety and general welfare, and to:
      (1)   Protect human life and health;
      (2)   Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control
projects;
      (3)   Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with
flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
      (4)   Minimize prolonged business interruptions;
      (5)   Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water
and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located
in areas of special flood hazard;
      (6)   Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the proper use and
development of areas of special flood hazard so as to protect property and
minimize future flood blight areas;
      (7)   Ensure that those who occupy the areas of special flood hazard
assume responsibility for their actions;
      (8)   Minimize the impact of development on adjacent properties within
and near flood prone areas;
      (9)   Ensure that the flood storage and conveyance functions of the
floodplain are maintained;
      (10)   Minimize the impact of development on the natural, beneficial
values of the floodplain;
      (11)   Prevent floodplain uses that are either hazardous or
environmentally incompatible; and
      (12)   Meet community participation requirements of the National Flood
Insurance Program.
   (c)   Methods of Reducing Flood Loss. In order to accomplish its purposes,
these regulations include methods and provisions for:
      (1)   Restricting or prohibiting uses which are dangerous to health,
safety, and property due to water hazards, or which result in damaging
increases in flood heights or velocities;
      (2)   Requiring that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities
which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction;
      (3)   Controlling the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels,
and natural protective barriers, which help accommodate or channel flood
waters;
      (4)   Controlling filling, grading, dredging, excavating, and other
development which may increase flood damage; and
      (5)   Preventing or regulating the construction of flood barriers which
will unnaturally divert flood waters or which may increase flood hazards in
other areas.
   (d)   Lands to Which These Regulations Apply. These regulations shall apply
to all areas of special flood hazard within the jurisdiction of the City
including any additional areas of special flood hazard annexed by the City.
   (e)   Basis for Establishing the Areas of Special Flood Hazard. For the
purposes of these regulations, the following studies and/or maps are adopted:
      (1)   Flood Insurance Rate Map, Shelby County, Ohio, and Incorporated
Areas and Flood Insurance Study Shelby County, Ohio, and Incorporated Areas
both effective April 2, 2015.
      (2)   Other studies and/or maps, which may be relied upon for
establishment of the flood protection elevation, delineation of the 100-year
floodplain, floodways or delineation of other areas of special flood hazard.
      (3)   Any hydrologic and hydraulic engineering analysis authored by a
registered professional engineer in the State of Ohio which has been approved
by the City of Sidney as required by Section 1108.04(c) Subdivisions and Large
Developments.
         Any revisions to the aforementioned maps and/or studies are hereby
adopted by reference and declared to be a part of these regulations. Such maps
and/or studies are on file at the Office of the City Manager, City Hall, 201 W.
Poplar Street, Sidney, Ohio.
   (f)   Abrogation and Greater Restrictions. These regulations are not
intended to repeal any existing ordinances (resolutions) including subdivision
regulations, zoning or building codes. In the event of a conflict between these
regulations and any other ordinance (resolution), the more restrictive shall be
followed. These regulations shall not impair any deed restriction covenant or
easement but the land subject to such interests shall also be governed by the
regulations.
   (g)   Interpretation. In the interpretation and applications of these
regulations, all provisions shall be:
      (1)   Considered as minimum requirements;
      (2)   Liberally construed in favor of the governing body; and
      (3)   Deemed neither to limit nor repeal any other powers granted under
State statutes. Where a provision of these regulations may be in conflict with
a State or Federal law, such State or Federal law shall take precedence over
these regulations.
   (h)   Warning and Disclaimer of Liability. The degree of flood protection
required by these regulations is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes
and is based on scientific and engineering considerations. Larger floods can
and will occur on rare occasions. Flood heights may be increased by man-made or
natural causes. These regulations do not imply that land outside the areas of
special flood hazard or uses permitted within such areas will be free from
flooding or flood damage. These regulations shall not create liability on the
part of the City, any officer or employee thereof, or the Federal Emergency
Management Agency, for any flood damage that results from reliance on these
regulations or any administrative decision lawfully made hereunder.
   (i)   Severability. Should any section or provision of these regulations be
declared by the courts to be unconstitutional or invalid, such decision shall
not affect the validity of the regulations as a whole, or any part thereof
other than the part so declared to be unconstitutional or invalid.

National Geodetic Vertical Datum of 1929 or the North American Vertical Datum
of 1988, and usually expressed in feet mean sea level (MSL). In Zone AO areas,
the base flood elevation is the natural grade elevation plus the depth number
(from 1 to 3 feet).
   (e)   "Basement" means any area of the building having its flood subgrade
(below ground level) on all sides.
   (f)   "Development" means any manmade change to improved or unimproved real
estate, including but not limited to buildings of other structures, mining,
dredging, filling, grading, paving, excavation or drilling operations or
storage of equipment or materials.
   (g)   "Executive Order 11988 (Floodplain Management)" was issued by
President Carter in 1977. This order requires that no federally assisted
activities be conducted in or have the potential to affect identified special
flood hazard areas, unless there is no practicable alternative.
   (h)   "Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA)" is the agency with the
overall responsibility for administering the National Flood Insurance Program.
   (i)   "Fill" means a deposit of earth material placed by artificial means.
   (j)   "Flood or flooding" means a general and temporary condition of partial
or complete inundation of normally dry land areas from:
      (1)   The overflow of inland or tidal waters, and/or
      (2)   The unusual and rapid accumulation or runoff of surface waters from
any source.
   (k)   "Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM)" means an official map on which the
Federal Emergency Management Agency or the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban
Development has delineated the areas of special flood hazard.
   (l)   "Flood insurance risk zones" means the zone designations on FIRM that
indicate the magnitude of the flood hazard in specific areas of a community.
Following are the zone definitions:
      (1)   Zone A:  Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year
flood; base flood elevations are not determined.
      (2)   Zones A1-30 and Zone AE:  Special flood hazard areas inundated by
the 100-year flood; base flood elevations are determined.
      (3)   Zone AO:  Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year
flood; with flood depths of 1 to 3 feet (usually sheet flow on sloping
terrain); average depths are determined.
      (4)   Zone AH:  Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year
flood; flood depths of 1 to 3 feet (usually areas of ponding); base flood
elevations are determined.
      (5)   Zone A99:  Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year
flood to be protected from the 100-year flood by a Federal flood protection
system under construction; no base flood elevations are determined.
      (6)   Zone B and Zone X (shaded):  Areas of 500-year flood; areas subject
to the 100-year flood with average depths of less than one foot or with
contributing drainage area less than one square mile; and areas protected by
levees from the base flood.
      (7)   Zone C and Zone X (unshaded):  Areas determined to be outside the
500-year floodplain.
   (m)   "Flood Insurance Study (FIS)" means the official report in which the
Federal Emergency Management Agency or the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban
Development has provided flood profiles, floodway boundaries (sometimes shown
on Flood Boundary and Floodway Maps), and the water surface elevations of the
base flood.
   (n)   "Flood protection elevation" means the flood protection elevation, or
FPE, which is the base flood elevation plus one foot of freeboard. In areas
where no base flood elevations exist from any authoritative source, the flood
protection elevation can be historical flood elevations, or base flood
elevations determined and/or approved by the floodplain administrator.
   (o)   "Floodway" means a channel of a river or other watercourse and the
adjacent land areas that have been reserved in order to pass the base flood
discharge. A floodway is typically determined through a hydraulic and
hydrologic engineering analysis such that the cumulative increase in the water
surface elevation of the base flood discharge is no more than a designated
height. In no case shall the designated height be more than one foot at any
point within the community.
   The floodway is an extremely hazardous area, and is usually characterized by
any of the following: Moderate to high velocity flood waters, high potential
for debris and projectile impacts, and moderate to high erosion forces.
   (p)   "Freeboard" means a factor of safety usually expressed in feet above a
flood level for the purposes of floodplain management. Freeboard tends to
compensate for the many unknown factors that could contribute to flood heights
greater than the height calculated for a selected size flood and floodway
conditions, such as wave action, obstructed bridge openings, debris and ice
jams, and the hydrologic effect of urbanization in a watershed.
   (q)   “Historic structure” means any structure that is:
      (1)   Listed individually in the National Register of Historic Places (a
listing maintained by the U.S. Department of Interior) or preliminarily
determined by the Secretary of the Interior as meeting the requirements for
individual listings on the National Register;
      (2)   Certified or preliminarily determined by the Secretary of the
Interior as contributing to the historical significance of a registered
historic district or a district preliminarily determined by the Secretary to
qualify as a registered historic district;
      (3)   Individually listed on the State of Ohio's inventory of historic
places maintained by the Ohio Historic Preservation Office; or
      (4)   Individually listed on the inventory of historic places maintained
by the City whose historic preservation program has been certified by the Ohio
Historic Preservation Office.
   (r)   "Hydrologic and hydraulic engineering analysis" means an analysis
performed by a professional engineer, registered in the State of Ohio, in
accordance with standard engineering practices as accepted by FEMA, used to
determine flood elevations and/or floodway boundaries.
   (s)   "Letter of Map Change (LOMC)" means an official FEMA determination, by
letter, to amend or revise effective Flood Insurance Rate Maps, Flood Boundary
and Floodway Maps, and Flood Insurance Studies, LOMC's are broken down into the
following categories:
      (1)   Letter of Map Amendment (LOMA).  A revision based on technical data
showing that a property was incorrectly included in a designated special flood
hazard area. A LOMA amends the current effective Flood Insurance Rate Map and
establishes that a specific property is not located in a special flood hazard
area.
      (2)   Letter of Map Revision (LOMR).  A revision based on technical data
that, usually due to man-made changes, shows changes to flood zones, flood
elevations, floodplain and floodway delineations, and planimetric features. One
common type of LOMR, a LOMR-F, is a determination concerning whether a
structure or parcel has been elevated by fill above the base flood elevation
and is, therefore, excluded from the special flood hazard area.
      (3)   Conditional Letter of Map Revision (CLOMR).  A formal review and
comment by FEMA as to whether a proposed project complies with the minimum
National Flood Insurance Program floodplain management criteria. A CLOMR does
not amend or revise effective Flood Insurance Rate Maps, Flood Boundary and
Floodway Maps, or Flood Insurance Studies.
   (t)   "Lowest floor" means the lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area
(including basement) of a structure. This definition excludes an "enclosure
below the lowest floor" which is an unfinished or flood resistant enclosure
usable solely for parking of vehicles, building access or storage, in an area
other than a basement area, provided that such enclosure is built in accordance
with the applicable design requirements specified in these regulations for
enclosures below the lowest floor.
   (u)   "Manufactured home" means a structure, transportable in one or more
sections, which is built on a permanent chassis and is designed for use with or
without a permanent foundation when connected to the required utilities.  The
term "manufactured home" does not include a "recreational vehicle". For the
purposes of these regulations, a manufactured home includes manufactured homes
and mobile homes as defined in Ohio R.C. Chapter 3733.
   (v)   "Manufactured home park" means, as specified in the Ohio
Administrative Code 3701-27-01, any tract of land upon which three or more
manufactured homes, used for habitation are parked, either free of charge or
for revenue purposes, and includes any roadway, building, structure, vehicle,
or enclosure used or intended for use as part of the facilities of the park. A
tract of land that is subdivided and the individual lots are not for rent or
rented, but are for sale or sold for the purpose of installation of
manufactured homes on the lots, is not a manufactured home park, even though
three or more manufactured homes are parked thereon, if the roadways are
dedicated to the local government authority.
   (w)   "National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP)" means the NFIP is a Federal
program enabling property owners in participating communities to purchase
insurance protection against losses from flooding. This insurance is designed
to provide an insurance alternative to disaster assistance to meet the
escalating costs of repairing damage to buildings and their contents caused by
floods. Participation in the NFIP is based on an agreement between local
communities and the Federal government that states if a community will adopt
and enforce floodplain management regulations to reduce future flood risks to
all development in special flood hazard areas, the Federal government will make
flood insurance available within the community as a financial protection
against flood loss.
   (x)   "New construction" means structures for which the "start of
construction" commenced on or after the initial effective date of the City
Flood Insurance Rate Map, November 17, 1982, and includes any subsequent
improvements to such structures.
   (y)   "Person" includes any individual or group of individuals, corporation,
partnership, association, or any other entity, including state and local
governments and agencies. An agency is further defined in Ohio R.C. 111.15 as
any governmental entity of the state and includes, but is not limited to, any
board, department, division, commission, bureau, society, council, institution,
state college or university, community college district, technical college
district, or state community college. "Agency" does not include the general
assembly, the controlling board, the adjutant general's department, or any
court.
   (z)   "Recreational vehicle" means a vehicle which is (1) built on a single
chassis, (2) 400 square feet or less when measured at the largest horizontal
projection, (3) designed to be self-propelled or permanently towable by a light
duty truck, and (4) designed primarily not for use as a permanent dwelling but
as temporary living quarters for recreational, camping, travel, or seasonal
use.
   (aa)   "Start of construction" means the date the building permit was
issued, provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction,
rehabilitation, addition, placement, or other improvement was within 180 days
of the permit date. The actual start means either the first placement or
permanent construction of a structure on a site, such as the pouring of slab or
footings, the installation of piles, the construction of columns, or any work
beyond the stage of excavation; or the placement of a manufactured home on a
foundation. Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as
clearing, grading and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets
and/or walkways; nor does it exclude excavation for a basement, footings,
piers, or foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include
the installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or
sheds not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main structure. For a
substantial improvement, the actual start of construction means the first
alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building,
whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of a building.
   (bb)   "Structure" means a walled and roofed building, manufactured home, or
gas or liquid storage tank that is principally above ground.
   (cc)   "Substantial damage" means damage of any origin sustained by a
structure whereby the cost of restoring the structure to its before damaged
condition would equal or exceed fifty percent of the market value of the
structure before the damage occurred.
   (dd)   "Substantial improvement" means any reconstruction, rehabilitation,
addition, or other improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or
exceeds fifty percent of the market value of the structure before the "start of
construction" of the improvement. This term includes structures which have
incurred "substantial damage", regardless of the actual repair work performed.
The term does not, however, include:
      (1)   Any improvement to a structure which is considered "new
construction;"
      (2)   Any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing
violations of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications
which have been identified prior to the application for a development permit by
the local code enforcement official and which are the minimum necessary to
assure safe living conditions; or
      (3)   Any alteration of a "historic structure", provided that the
alteration will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a
"historic structure".
   (ee)   "Variance" means a grant of relief from the standards of these
regulations consistent with the variance conditions herein.
   (ff)   "Violation" means the failure of a structure or other development to
be fully compliant with these regulations.

   (j)   Map Maintenance Activities. To meet National Flood Insurance Program
minimum requirements to have flood data reviewed and approved by FEMA, and to
ensure that the City's flood maps, studies and other data accurately represent
flooding conditions so appropriate floodplain management criteria are based on
current data, the following map maintenance activities are identified:
      (1)   Requirement to submit new technical data.
         A.   For all development proposals that impact floodway delineations
or base flood elevations, the community shall ensure that technical data
reflecting such changes be submitted to FEMA within six months of the date such
information becomes available. These development proposals include:
            1.   Floodway encroachments that increase or decrease base flood
elevations or alter floodway boundaries;
            2.   Fill sites to be used for the placement of proposed structures
where the applicant desires to remove the site from the special flood hazard
area;
            3.   Alteration of watercourses that result in a relocation or
elimination of the special flood hazard area, including the placement of
culverts; and
            4.   Subdivision or large scale development proposals requiring the
establishment of base flood elevations in accordance with Section
1108.04(c).
         B.   It is the responsibility of the applicant to have technical data,
required in accordance with this subsection, prepared in a format required for
a Conditional Letter of Map Revision or Letter of Map Revision, and submitted
to FEMA. Submittal and processing fees for these map revisions shall be the
responsibility of the applicant.
         C.   The Floodplain Administrator shall require a Conditional Letter
of Map Revision prior to the issuance of a floodplain development permit for:
            1.   Proposed floodway encroachments that increase the base flood
elevation; and
            2.   Proposed development which increases the base flood elevation
by more than one foot in areas where FEMA has provided base flood elevations
but no floodway.
         D.   Floodplain development permits issued by the Floodplain
Administrator shall be conditioned upon the applicant obtaining a Letter of Map
Revision from FEMA for any development proposal subject to this subsection.
      (2)   Right to submit new technical data.  The Floodplain Administrator
may request changes to any of the information shown on an effective map that
does not impact floodplain or floodway delineations or base flood elevations,
such as labeling or planimetric details. Such a submission shall include
appropriate supporting documentation made in writing by the City Manager, and
may be submitted at any time.
      (3)   Annexation /detachment.  Upon occurrence, the Floodplain
Administrator shall notify FEMA in writing whenever the boundaries of the City
have been modified by annexation or the community has assumed authority over an
area, or no longer has authority to adopt and enforce floodplain management
regulations for a particular area. In order that the City's Flood Insurance
Rate Map accurately represent the City boundaries, include within such
notification a copy of a map of the City suitable for reproduction, clearly
showing the new corporate limits or the new area for which the City has assumed
or relinquished floodplain management regulatory authority.
   (k)   Data Use and Flood Map Interpretation.  The following guidelines shall
apply to the use and interpretation of maps and other data showing areas of
special flood hazard:
      (1)   In areas where FEMA has not identified special flood hazard areas,
or in FEMA identified special flood hazard areas where base flood elevation and
floodway data have not been identified, the Floodplain Administrator shall
review and reasonably utilize any other flood hazard data available from a
Federal, state, or other source.
      (2)   Base flood elevations and floodway boundaries produced on FEMA
flood maps and studies shall take precedence over base flood elevations and
floodway boundaries by any other source that reflect a reduced floodway width
and/or lower base flood elevations. Other sources of data, showing increased
base flood elevations and/or larger floodway areas than are shown on FEMA flood
maps and studies, shall be reasonably used by the Floodplain Administrator.
      (3)   The Floodplain Administrator shall make interpretations, where
needed, as to the exact location of the flood boundaries and areas of special
flood hazard. A person contesting the determination of the location of the
boundary shall be given a reasonable opportunity to appeal the interpretation
as provided in Section
1108.05.
      (4)   Where a map boundary showing an area of special flood hazard and
field elevations disagree, the base flood elevations or flood protection
elevations (as found on an elevation profile, floodway data table, established
high water marks, etc.) shall prevail.
   (l)   Substantial Damage Determinations. 
      (1)   Damages to structures may result from a variety of causes including
flood, tornado, wind, heavy snow, fire, etc. After such a damage event, the
Floodplain Administrator shall:
         A.   Determine whether damaged structures are located in special flood
hazard areas;
         B.   Conduct substantial damage determinations for damaged structures
located in special flood hazard areas; and
         C.   Make reasonable attempt to notify owners of substantially damaged
structures of the need to obtain a floodplain development permit prior to
repair, rehabilitation, or reconstruction.
      (2)   Additionally, the Floodplain Administrator may implement other
measures to assist with the substantial damage determination and subsequent
repair process. These measures include issuing press releases, public service
announcements, and other public information materials related to the floodplain
development permits and repair of damaged structures; coordinating with other
Federal, state, and local agencies to assist with substantial damage
determinations; providing owners of damaged structures materials and other
information related to the proper repair of damaged structures in special flood
hazard areas; and assist owners of substantially damaged structures with
increased cost of compliance insurance claims.

devices provided that they permit the automatic entry and exit of floodwaters;
      (6)   Manufactured homes shall be affixed to a permanent foundation and
anchored to prevent flotation, collapse or lateral movement of the structure
resulting from hydrodynamic and hydrostatic loads, including the effects of
buoyancy. Methods of anchoring may include, but are not limited to, use of
over-the-top or frame ties to ground anchors.
      (7)   Repair or rehabilitation of historic structures upon a
determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the
structure's continued designation as a historic structure and is the minimum
necessary to preserve the historic character and design of the structure, shall
be exempt from the development standards of division (d) of this section.
   (e)   Nonresidential Structures.
      (1)   New construction and substantial improvement of any commercial,
industrial or other nonresidential structure shall meet the requirements of
subsections (d)(1) through (3) and  (d)(5) through (7) hereof.
      (2)   New construction and substantial improvement of any commercial,
industrial or other nonresidential structure shall either have the lowest
floor, including basement, elevated to or above the level of the flood
protection elevation; or, together with attendant utility and sanitary
facilities, shall meet all of the following standards:
         A.   Be dry floodproofed so that the structure is watertight with
walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water to the level of the
flood protection elevation;
         B.   Have structural components capable of resisting hydrostatic and
hydrodynamic loads and effects of buoyancy; and
         C.   Be certified by a registered professional engineer or architect,
through the use of a Federal Emergency Management Floodproofing Certificate,
that the design and methods of construction are in accordance with paragraphs
(e)(2)A. and B. hereof.
   (f)   Accessory Structures. Relief to the elevation or dry floodproofing
standards may be granted for accessory structures containing no more than 600
square feet. Such structures must meet the following standards:
      (1)   They shall not be used for human habitation;
      (2)   They shall be constructed of flood resistant materials;
      (3)   They shall be constructed and placed on the lot to offer the
minimum resistance to the flow of flood waters;
      (4)   They shall be firmly anchored to prevent flotation;
      (5)   Service facilities such as electrical and heating equipment shall
be elevated or floodproofed to or above the level of the flood protection
elevation; and
      (6)   They shall meet the opening requirements of paragraph (d)(5)C.
hereof.
   (g)   Recreational Vehicles. Recreational vehicles must meet at least one of
the following standards:
      (1)   They shall not be located on sites in special flood hazard areas
for more than 180 days;
      (2)   They must be fully licensed and ready for highway use; or
      (3)   They must meet all standards of subsection (d) hereof.
   (h)   Above Ground Gas or Liquid Storage Tanks. All above ground gas or
liquid storage tanks shall be anchored to prevent flotation or lateral movement
resulting from hydrodynamic and hydrostatic loads.
   (i)   Assurance of Flood Carrying Capacity. Pursuant to the purpose and
methods of reducing flood damage stated in these regulations, the following
additional standards are adopted to assure that the reduction of the flood
carrying capacity of watercourses is minimized:
      (1)   Development in floodways.
         A.   In floodway areas, development shall cause no increase in flood
levels during the occurrence of the base flood discharge. Prior to issuance of
a floodplain development permit, the applicant must submit a hydrologic and
hydraulic analysis, conducted by a registered professional engineer,
demonstrating that the proposed development would not result in any increase in
the base flood elevation; or
         B.   Development in floodway areas causing increases in the base flood
elevation may be permitted provided all of the following are completed by the
applicant:
            1.   Meet the requirements to submit technical data in Section
1108.03(j)(1);
            2.   An evaluation of alternatives which would not result in
increased base flood elevations and an explanation why these alternatives are
not feasible;
            3.   Certification that no structures are located in areas which
would be impacted by the increased base flood elevation;
            4.   Documentation of individual legal notices to all impacted
property owners within and outside the community, explaining the impact of the
proposed action on their property; and
            5.   Concurrence of the City Manager and the Chief Executive
Officer of any other communities impacted by the proposed actions.
      (2)   Development in riverine areas with base flood elevations but no
floodways.
         A.   In riverine special flood hazard areas identified by FEMA where
base flood elevation data are provided but no floodways have been designated,
the cumulative effect of any proposed development, when combined with all other
existing and anticipated development, shall not increase the base flood
elevation more than one foot at any point. Prior to issuance of a floodplain
development permit, the applicant must submit a hydrologic and hydraulic
analysis, conducted by a registered professional engineer, demonstrating that
this standard has been met; or
         B.   Development in riverine special flood hazard areas identified by
FEMA where base flood elevation data are provided but no floodways have been
designated causing more than one foot increase in the base flood elevation may
be permitted provided all of the following are completed by the applicant:
            1.   An evaluation of alternatives which would result in an
increase of one foot or less of the base flood elevation and an explanation why
these alternatives are not feasible; and
            2.   Paragraph (i)(1) hereof.
      (3)   Alterations of a watercourse. For the purpose of these regulations,
a watercourse is altered when any change occurs within its banks. The extent of
the banks shall be established by a field determination of the "bankfull
stage." The field determination of "bankfull stage" shall be based on methods
presented in Chapter 7 of the USDA Forest Service General Technical Report RM-
245, Stream Channel Reference Sites: An Illustrated Guide to Field Technique or
other applicable publication available from a Federal, state, or other
authoritative source. For all proposed developments that alter a watercourse,
the following standards apply:
         A.   The bankfull flood carrying capacity of the altered or relocated
portion of the watercourse shall not be diminished. Prior to the issuance of a
floodplain development permit, the applicant must submit a description of the
extent to which any watercourse will be altered or relocated as a result of the
proposed development, and certification by a registered professional engineer
that the bankfull flood carrying capacity of the watercourse will not be
diminished.
         B.   Adjacent communities, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, and the
Ohio Department of Natural Resources, Division of Water, must be notified prior
to any alteration or relocation of a watercourse. Evidence of such notification
must be submitted to the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
         C.   The applicant shall be responsible for providing the necessary
maintenance for the altered or relocated portion of said watercourse so that
the flood carrying capacity will not be diminished. The Floodplain
Administrator may require the permit holder to enter into an agreement with the
City specifying the maintenance responsibilities. If an agreement is required,
it shall be made a condition of the floodplain development permit.
         D.   The applicant shall meet the requirements to submit technical
data in Section
1108.03(j)(1)C. when an alteration of a watercourse results in the relocation
or elimination of the special flood hazard area, including the placement of
culverts.
(Ord. A-2419.  Passed 1-24-05; Ord. A-2582.  Passed 9-22-08.)
1108.05   APPEALS AND VARIANCES.
   (a)   Powers and Duties. The Zoning Board of Appeals is hereby appointed to
serve as the Appeals Board for these regulations as established by City code.
Records of the Appeals Board shall be kept and filed in the offices of the
Planning and Community Development Department. The Appeals Board shall:
      (1)   Hear and decide appeals where it is alleged there is an error in
any order, requirement, decision or determination made by the Floodplain
Administrator in the administration or enforcement of these regulations.
      (2)   Authorize variances in accordance with subsection (c) hereof.
   (b)   Appeals. Any person affected by any notice and order, or other
official action of the Floodplain Administrator may request and shall be
granted a hearing on the matter before the Appeals Board provided that such
person shall file, within thirty days of the date of such notice and order, or
other official action, a brief statement of the grounds for such hearing or for
the mitigation of any item appearing on any order of the Floodplain
Administrator's decision. Such appeal shall be in writing, signed by the
applicant, and be filed with the Floodplain Administrator. Upon receipt of the
appeal, the Floodplain Administrator shall transmit said notice and all
pertinent information on which the Floodplain Administrator's decision was made
to the Appeals Board.  Upon receipt of the notice of appeal, the Appeals Board
shall fix a reasonable time for the appeal, give notice in writing to parties
in interest, and decide the appeal within a reasonable time after it is
submitted.
   (c)   Variances. Any person believing that the use and development standards
of these regulations would result in unnecessary hardship may file an
application for a variance. The Appeals Board shall have the power to
authorize, in specific cases, such variances from the standards of these
regulations, not inconsistent with Federal regulations, as will not be contrary
to the public interest where, owning to special conditions of the lot or
parcel, a literal enforcement of the provisions of these regulations would
result in unnecessary hardship.
      (1)   Application for a variance.
         A.   Any owner, or agent thereof, of property for which a variance is
sought shall make an application for a variance by filing it with the
Floodplain Administrator, who upon receipt of the variance shall transmit it to
the Appeals Board.
         B.   Such application at a minimum shall contain the following
information: Name, address, and telephone number of the applicant; legal
description of the property; parcel map; description of the existing use;
description of the proposed use; location of the floodplain; description of the
variance sought; and reason for the variance request.
      (2)   Public hearing. At such hearing the applicant shall present such
statements and evidence as the Appeals Board requires. In considering such
variance applications, the Appeals Board shall consider and make findings of
fact on all evaluations, all relevant factors, standards specified in other
sections of these regulations and the following factors:
         A.   The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the
injury of others;
         B.   The danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion
damage;
         C.   The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to
flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner;
         D.   The importance of the services provided by the proposed facility
to the community;
         E.   The availability of alternative locations for the proposed use
which are not subject to flooding or erosion damage;
         F.   The necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where
applicable;
         G.   The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and
anticipated development;
         H.   The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan
and floodplain management program for that area;
         I.   The safety of access to the property in times of flood for
ordinary and emergency vehicles;
         J.   The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise, and
sediment transport of the flood waters and the effects of wave action, if
applicable, expected at the site; and
         K.   The costs of providing governmental services during and after
flood conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities and
facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water systems, and streets and
bridges.
      (3)   Variances shall only be issued upon:
         A.   A showing of good and sufficient cause;
         B.   A determination that failure to grant the variance would result
in exceptional hardship due to the physical characteristics of the property.
Increased cost or inconvenience of meeting the requirements of these
regulations does not constitute an exceptional hardship to the applicant;
         C.   A determination that the granting of a variance will not result
in increased flood heights beyond that which is allowed in these regulations;
additional threats to public safety; extraordinary public expense, nuisances,
fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local laws;
         D.   A determination that the structure or other development is
protected by methods to minimize flood damages; and
         E.   A determination that the variance is the minimum necessary,
considering the flood hazard, to afford relief.
      Upon consideration of the above factors and the purposes of these
regulations, the Appeals Board may attach such conditions to the granting of
variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes of these regulations.
      (4)   Other conditions for variances.
         A.   Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if
any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.
         B.   Generally, variances may be issued for new construction and
substantial improvements to be erected on a lot of one-half acre or less in
size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed
below the base flood level, providing items in paragraph (c)(2) hereof have
been fully considered. As the lot size increases beyond one-half acre, the
technical justification required for issuing the variance increases.
         C.   Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given
written notice that the structure will be permitted to be built with a lowest
floor elevation below the base flood elevation and the cost of flood insurance
will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the reduced lowest
floor elevation.
      (5)   Court review. Those aggrieved by the decision of the Appeals Board
may appeal such decision to the Shelby County Court of Common Pleas, as
provided in Ohio R.C. Chapter 2506.
(Ord. A-2419.  Passed 1-24-05; Ord. 2582.  Passed 9-22-08.)
1108.06   ENFORCEMENT.
   (a)   Compliance Required.
      (1)   No structure or land shall hereafter be located, erected,
constructed, reconstructed, repaired, extended, converted, enlarged or altered
without full compliance with the terms of these regulations and all other
applicable regulations which apply to uses within the jurisdiction of these
regulations, unless specifically exempted from filing for a development permit
as stated in Section
1108.03(i).
      (2)   Failure to obtain a floodplain development permit shall be a
violation of these regulations and shall be punishable in accordance with
Chapter
1155.
      (3)   Floodplain development permits issued on the basis of plans and
applications approved by the Floodplain Administrator authorize only the use,
and arrangement, set forth in such approved plans and applications or
amendments thereto. Use, arrangement, or construction contrary to that
authorized shall be deemed a violation of these regulations and punishable in
accordance with Chapter
1155.
   (b)   Notice of Violation. Whenever the Floodplain Administrator determines
that there has been a violation of any provision of these regulations, he or
she shall give notice of such violation to the person responsible therefore and
order compliance with these regulations as hereinafter provided. Such notice
and order shall:
      (1)   Be put in writing on an appropriate form;
      (2)   Include a list of violations, referring to the section or sections
of these regulations that have been violated, and order remedial action which,
if taken, will effect compliance with the provisions of these regulations;
      (3)   Specify a reasonable time for performance;
      (4)   Advise the owner, operator, or occupant of the right to appeal; and
      (5)   Be served on the owner, occupant, or agent in person. However, this
notice and order shall be deemed to be properly served upon the owner,
occupant, or agent if a copy thereof is sent by registered or certified mail to
the person's last know mailing address, residence, or place of business, and/or
a copy is posted in a conspicuous place in or on the dwelling affected.
   (c)   Violations and Penalties. Violation of the provisions of these
regulations or failure to comply with any of its requirements shall be deemed
to be a strict liability offense, and shall constitute a minor misdemeanor. Any
person who violates these regulations or fails to comply with any of its
requirements shall upon conviction thereof be fined or imprisoned as provided
by the laws of the City. Each day such violation continues shall be considered
a separate offense. Nothing herein contained shall prevent the City from taking
such other lawful action as is necessary to prevent or remedy any violation.
The City shall prosecute any violation of these regulations in accordance with
the penalties stated herein.

1109.01   CONFORMANCE REQUIRED.
   Except as hereinafter specified, no land, building, structure, facility,
sign or premises shall hereafter be used, and no building or part thereof, or
other structure, facility or sign, shall be located, erected, moved,
reconstructed, extended, enlarged or altered except in conformity with this
chapter herein specified for the zoning district in which it is located,
including any applicable supplementary and specific regulations within this
Zoning Code.
(Ord. A-2248.  Passed 4-9-01.)
1109.02   EFFECT OF CODE ON EXISTING IMPROVEMENTS.
   Nothing contained in this Zoning Code shall require any change in the plans,
construction, alteration or intended use of a building, structure, facility, or
sign, the construction of which was actually begun and diligently prosecuted
and had progressed to the point where the foundation was in and completed at
the time of the passage of Ordinance A-83, passed June 22, 1953, and which
entire improvement was completed within one year of the passage of such
ordinance.
(Ord. A-2248.  Passed 4-9-01.)
1109.03   LOT REQUIREMENTS FOR SINGLE-FAMILY DWELLINGS.
   A single-family dwelling may be located on any lot in any district in which
single-family dwellings are permitted, if the lot was a single parcel in single
ownership or a single parcel included in a subdivision of record at the time of
passage of this Zoning Code (Ordinance A-2248, passed April 9, 2001), even
though the lot does not have the minimum lot area or minimum lot width
specified for the district in which it is located, provided that yard spaces
satisfy requirements stipulated for such district or as may be modified under
Section
1107.05.
(Ord. A-2248.  Passed 4-9-01.)
1109.04   EXISTING NONCONFORMING BUILDINGS AND USES.
   (a)   Any building or use existing at the time of the enactment of Ordinance
A-83, passed June 22, 1953, may be continued even though such building or use
does not conform with the provisions of this Zoning Code for the district in
which it is located.
   (b)   It is the intent of this section to permit these nonconformities to
continue until they are removed, but not to encourage their continuance or
survival. Such uses are declared by this section to be incompatible with
permitted uses in the district involved. It is further the intent of this
chapter that nonconformities shall not be enlarged, expanded or extended, or
changed to any other nonconforming use, except as approved by the Zoning Board
of Appeals in accordance with the provisions  specified in appropriate sections
of this chapter.
(Ord. A-2248.  Passed 4-9-01.)
1109.05   EXTENSION OF NONCONFORMING BUILDINGS AND USES.
   (a)   An existing nonconforming use may be hereafter extended throughout
those parts of the building which were manifestly arranged or designed for such
use at the time of the enactment of Ordinance A-83, passed June 22, 1953.
   (b)   No building or premises containing a nonconforming use shall hereafter
be extended unless such extension shall conform to the provisions of Ordinance
A-83, passed June 22, 1953, for the district in which it is located, except as
otherwise provided in Ordinance A-83, and except as provided in subsection (c)
hereof.
   (c)   After due notice and a public hearing, the Board may permit the
extension of a nonconforming building or use upon the lot occupied by such use
of building at the time of enactment of Ordinance -83, passed June 22, 1953, or
on a lot adjoining or directly across an alley, provided such lot was under the
same ownership as the lot in question at the time of the enactment of Ordinance
A-83, and where such extension is a necessary incident to the existing use, and
provided, further, that such extension shall not exceed in all seventy-five
percent of the reproduction value of the existing buildings at the time of the
first extension, and shall in any case be undertaken within ten years after the
enactment of Ordinance A-83. However, such extension may be made on lots
purchased after the enactment of Ordinance A-83, but in such case such
extension shall not exceed fifty percent of the reproduction value of such
buildings at the time of the first extension and shall in any case be
undertaken within ten years after the enactment of Ordinance A-83.
(Ord. A-2248.  Passed 4-9-01.)
1109.06   DISCONTINUANCE; USE CEASED.
   (a)   No building or lot where a nonconforming use has ceased for more than
two years or has been replaced by a use permitted in the district in which such
building or lot is located shall again be devoted to any use not permitted in
such district.
   (b)   If no structural alterations are made other than those necessary for
maintenance, A nonconforming use of the building may be changed to another
nonconforming use of an equal or more appropriate use for the district in which
it is located. Such determinations shall be made by the City Manager via the
Planning Coordinator and may be referred to the Board of Appeals for
interpretation. In addition:
      (1)   Any substitution approved shall only be permitted in parts of the 
building, structure or premises where the previous nonconforming use had
occurred.
      (2)    Whenever a nonconforming use is changed to a more appropriate use,
such use shall not thereafter be reverted to a less appropriate use.
      (3)   Any findings made by the Board of Appeals shall be made in a public
hearing using procedures and requirements which parallel those found in Section
1151.05(a) through (e).
(Ord. A-2248.  Passed 4-9-01.)
1109.07   MOVING NONCONFORMING IMPROVEMENTS AND USES.
   No nonconforming building, structure, facility or sign shall be moved to
another location on the same lot or any other lot unless the entire building,
structure, facility or sign shall thereafter conform to the regulations of the
zoning district in which it will be located after being so moved.  Moreover, no
nonconforming land use shall be relocated, in whole or in part, to any other
location on the same or any other lot unless such use shall thereafter conform
to the regulations of the zoning district in which it is located after being
moved.
(Ord. A-2248.  Passed 4-9-01.)
1109.08   NONCONFORMING USES CREATED BY AMENDMENT.
   The provisions of this chapter apply in the same manner to a use which may
become a nonconforming use due to a later amendment to this Zoning Code.
(Ord. A-2248.  Passed 4-9-01.)
1109.09   RECONSTRUCTION OF DAMAGED IMPROVEMENTS.
   Any nonconforming building, structure, facility or sign damaged more than
seventy-five percent of its then fair market value above the foundations at the
time of the damage by fire, flood, explosion, earthquake, war, riot or act of
God or man shall not be reconstructed and used as before such calamity.  If it
is less than seventy-five percent damaged, it may be reconstructed or used,
provided that such reconstruction or use is accomplished within twelve months
of such calamity.
(Ord. A-2248.  Passed 4-9-01.)

(Ord. A-2248.  Passed 4-9-01.)
1143.02   ENFORCEMENT.
   Whenever it is alleged by a person aggrieved, or, in the opinion of the City
Manager, an existing or proposed new use of land or a structure creates or is
likely to create or otherwise produce dangerous or objectionable elements, the
Board of Appeals shall make a preliminary investigation of the matter and shall
forward its report, together with all preliminary findings and evidence, to the
City Council. In the event that the Board concurs in the allegation or opinion
that there exist or are likely to be created such dangerous or objectionable
elements, it shall request the City Council to authorize the employment of a
competent specialist or testing laboratory for the purpose of determining the
nature and extent of such dangerous or objectionable elements and practicable
means of assuring compliance with the provisions of this chapter. Upon receipt
of the findings and recommendations of such specialist or laboratory, the Board
may approve, partially approve or disapprove the measures recommended therein
and instruct the City Manager to proceed with the enforcement of such measures
in accordance with the provisions of Chapter
1155. The City shall bear the costs of the various tests, consultant fees or
other investigations which are required herein.  However, the owner of the
property under investigation shall reimburse the City for all such expenses in
the case of a proposed new use or in the event that the existing operation or
use of the property is found to be in violation of the provisions of this
chapter by the Board, or, if contested, by a court of competent jurisdiction.
Such reimbursement shall be made within thirty days from the date of the final
Board ruling or court judgment.
(Ord. A-2248.  Passed 4-9-01.)
1143.03   DEFINITIONS.
   As used in this chapter:
   (a)   "Decibel" means a unit of measurement of the intensity of loudness of
sound. Sound level meters are used to measure such intensities and are
calibrated in decibels.
   (b)   "Flash point" means the lowest temperature at which a combustible
liquid under prescribed conditions will give off a flammable vapor which will
burn momentarily using the closed cup method.
   (c)   "Free burning" means a rate of combustion described by a material
which burns actively and easily supports combustion.
   (d)   "Intense burning" means a rate of combustion described by a material
that burns with a high degree of activity and is consumed rapidly.
   (e)   "Moderate burning" means a rate of combustion described by a material
which supports combustion and is consumed slowly as it burns.
   (f)   "Octave band" means a narrow range of sound frequencies which classify
sounds according to pitch. In the octave band analyzer, the audible sound
spectrum is divided into eight octave bands.
   (g)   "Octave band analyzer" means an electrical device used with the sound
level meter that sorts a complex noise or sound into the various octave bands.
   (h)   "Particulate matter" means a finely divided liquid or solid material
which is discharged and carried along in the air. This does not include water
commonly called steam.
   (i)   "Ringelmann number" means the number of the area on the Ringelmann
Chart that most nearly matches the light-obscuring capacity of smoke. The
Ringelmann Chart is described in the U.S. Bureau of Mines Information Circular
6888, on which are illustrated graduated shades of gray for use in estimating
smoke density. Smoke below the density of Ringelmann No. 1 shall be considered
no smoke or Ringelmann O.
   (j)   "Slow burning" or "incombustible" means materials which do not in
themselves constitute an active fuel for the spread of combustion during an
exposure for five minutes to a temperature of 1,200 degrees Fahrenheit.
   (k)   "Smoke" means a suspension of fine particles, excluding water
droplets, in a gaseous plume, which obscures more or less the transmission of
light.
   (l)   "Smoke unit" means the number obtained when the smoke density in
Ringelmann number is multiplied by the time of emission in minutes. For the
purpose of this calculation, a Ringelmann density reading shall be made at
least once a minute during the period of observation, and each reading shall
then be multiplied by the time in minutes during which it is observed. The
various products are then added together to give the total number of smoke
units observed during the entire observation period.
   (m)   "Vibration" means oscillatory motion transmitted through the ground.
(Ord. A-2248.  Passed 4-9-01.)
1143.04   SMOKE.
   For new use, the emission of more than seventy smoke units per hour per
stack and emissions in excess of Ringelmann No. 2 are prohibited, except that
for one hour during any twenty-four hour period this rate may be increased to
eighty smoke units per hour per stack up to and including Ringelmann No. 3 for
the purposes of process purging, soot blowing and fire cleaning. For a use
existing at the time of the adoption of this chapter, the emission of more than

neighborhood commercial uses.
(Ord. A-2248.  Passed 4-9-01.)
1144.01   SUBMISSION OF PRELIMINARY PLAN.
   The owner of a tract of land containing not less than five acres may submit
to the Planning Commission, for its review, a preliminary plan for the use and
development of such tract for a Residential Planned Unit Development, provided
the tract is located in any N, S or R District.
(Ord. A-2248.  Passed 4-9-01.)
1144.02   DUTIES OF PLANNING COMMISSION.
   It shall be the duty of the Planning Commission, within sixty days after the
preliminary plan is submitted, to hold a public hearing thereon and to
investigate and ascertain whether the location, size, layout and other
characteristics of the proposed plan comply with the following conditions:
   (a)   That the proposed project is consonant with the Comprehensive Plan of
the community, and properly provides for the implementation of those features
of such Plan effecting the tract of land in question;
   (b)   That the proposed project will not adversely affect neighboring
property;
   (c)   That the proposed project is at a location where traffic congestion
does not exist at present on the streets to be used in conjunction therewith,
and where undue congestion will not likely be created as a result of the
proposed project;
   (d)   That the plan of the proposed project provides for the integrated and
harmonious design of buildings, for adequate and properly arranged facilities
for internal traffic circulation and off- street parking, for appropriate and
desirable landscaping and for such other facilities and features as may be
necessary to make the proposed project attractive and efficient from the
standpoint of the developer as well as from the standpoint of the adjoining and
surrounding existing and potential developments; and
   (e)   That the proposed project conforms to the requirements and standards
set forth herein.
(Ord. A-2248.  Passed 4-9-01.)

1144.09   LANDSCAPING AND UNUSED AREAS.
   All areas not used for access, buildings, circulation and service shall be
landscaped as may be deemed appropriate by the Planning Commission to make the

1144.14   SUBMISSION OF FINAL PLAN.
   Upon determination by the Planning Commission that the proposed project, as
shown on the preliminary plan thereof, conforms to all of the applicable
provisions of this chapter and other provisions of this Zoning Code, the owner
of the tract of land involved shall prepare and submit a final development plan
which shall incorporate any changes or modifications required by the
Commission. After the receipt of such final plan and the finding that it meets
all of the stipulated requirements, the Commission shall submit such plan to
Council together with its report and recommendations thereon. Council shall

1153, including the holding of a public hearing thereon, and may modify the
plan consistent with the intent and meaning of this chapter.
(Ord. A-2248.  Passed 4-9-01.)
1144.15   CONFORMANCE WITH FINAL PLAN; REVISIONS.
   (a)   Subsequent to the approval of the final development plan by Council,
the lands included within the site area thereof shall not be developed or used
in any manner whatsoever that is not in conformance with the approved plan, and
no building permit or certificate of occupancy shall be issued for any
building, structure or use on the lands except in conformance with the approved
plan.
   (b)   Any change in an approved final development plan desired by the owner
of the tract of land involved shall be submitted to the Planning Commission.
The  Commission shall conduct a public hearing on all proposed revisions to an
approved final development plan and make a determination or finding that at
least one of the following is true:
      (1)   The proposed revision is a minor change, not substantially altering
the overall concept of the Planned Unit Development. Generally, such changes
are limited to small site alterations such as realigning a street, shifting a
setback or slight changes in building designs that do not result in the loss of
open space. Increases of up to ten percent of the total development density and
any decreases in density may be determined by the Commission to be minor
changes. Minor changes shall not involve reductions in required improvements,
such as open space, parking areas, pavement widths, etc.
      (2)   The proposed revision is a major change, which will affect the
general character and overall concept of the Planned Unit Development,
including substantial relocation or redesign of principal or accessory
structures, parking, open space areas and streets. A major change is involved
in density increases in excess of ten percent of the total development density
and/or revisions affecting the land coverage by building, parking and open
space areas.
   (c)   Where the Commission determines that the proposed revision is a minor
change, the proposal may be reviewed as a revised final plan, and action to
approve, modify or deny approval may be taken by the Commission following the
public hearing. Minor changes involving or affecting public improvements shall
be referred to Council for review and action, not requiring a public hearing by
Council.
   (d)   Where the Commission determines that the proposed revision is a major
change, the proposal shall be reviewed as a revised preliminary development
plan as a part of the same public hearing, and the Commission may act to
approve, modify or deny approval for the revised preliminary plan, following
the public hearing. The revised preliminary plan shall be reviewed in the same
manner as the original plan, including final plan review by the Commission and
public hearing review by Council.
   (e)   Upon approval of a revised final development plan as a minor or major
change the original final plan shall be considered void and the revised final
plan shall have the same force and effect as if it were the original plan.
(Ord. A-2248.  Passed 4-9-01.)
1144.16   FAILURE TO COMPLETE PROJECT.
   If the proposed Residential Planned Unit Development has not been completed
within twenty-four months after the effective date of the final approval by
Council, such approval shall become void, and no building permit or certificate
of occupancy shall be issued on the basis of such plan. However, Council, upon
the recommendation of the Planning Commission, may grant more time to the
developer, not to exceed an additional twelve months, for such completion, in
cases where the developer has diligently pursued such project within the
initial twenty-four month period and has shown that the delay was caused by
extenuating and unavoidable circumstances.
(Ord. A-2248.  Passed 4-9-01.)
1144.17   IDENTIFICATION ON ZONE MAP.
   The boundary of any approved Residential Planned Unit Development shall be

(Ord. A-2248.  Passed 4-9-01.)
1145.02   DUTIES OF PLANNING COMMISSION; FINAL PLAN.
   (a)   It shall be the duty of the Planning Commission to hold a public
hearing on the preliminary plan and to investigate and ascertain whether the
plan complies with the following conditions:
      (1)   The location of the Planned Business Center shall be on property
where the establishment of the center is unlikely to entail traffic and parking
difficulties. The Commission shall satisfy itself as to the adequacy of the
thoroughfares to carry the additional traffic engendered by the proposed
development and may request a report and recommendation of the City Engineer;
      (2)   The plan shall present a unified and organized arrangement of
buildings and service facilities, including parking and loading spaces;
      (3)   The plan shall conform to the requirements and standards as set
forth herein; and
      (4)   The plan shall prohibit residential or industrial use of the land,
or any other use which would substantially interfere with the orderly
development or the continuation of the retail business and service uses.
   (b)   Upon determination by the Commission that the preliminary plan meets
these conditions, the proponent shall prepare and submit a final development
plan, which shall incorporate any changes or alterations requested by the
Commission. If the final development plan is found to comply with the
requirements set forth in this chapter, the Commission shall submit such plan,
together with its report and recommendations thereon, to Council. Council shall
process the final development plan in accordance with the provisions of Chapter
1153, including the holding of a public hearing thereon, and may modify the
plan consistent with the intent and meaning of this chapter.
   (c)   After the final development plan has been approved, any subsequent
change in use or any adjustment or rearrangement of buildings, parking area,
loading areas, entrances or exits, heights or yards that may be desired, shall
be submitted in detail to the Commission. The Commission shall review such
changes, adjustments and or rearrangements that may be proposed and submit its
recommendation thereon to Council. Council shall take such action as is
consistent with the requirements, intent and meaning of this chapter.

   The owner of a tract of land containing not less than ten acres may submit
to the Planning Commission, for its review, a preliminary plan for the use and
development of such tract as a Planned Industrial Center, provided that the
tract is located at or near where a proposed industrial area or planned unit
development area is shown on the Future Land Use Map, and, further, provided
that the tract is in a I-1 or I-2 District. In accepting such a plan for
review, the Commission must be satisfied that the proponents of the development
intend to complete the project within two years of such approval.
(Ord. A-2248.  Passed 4-9-01.)
1146.02   DUTIES OF PLANNING COMMISSION; FINAL PLAN.

hearing on the preliminary plan and to investigate and ascertain whether the
plan complies with the following conditions:
      (1)   The location of the Planned Industrial Center shall be on property
where the establishment of the center is unlikely to entail traffic and parking
difficulties. The Commission shall satisfy itself  as  to  the  adequacy  of 
the  thoroughfares  to carry  the  additional  traffic engendered by the

Engineer;
      (2)   The plan shall present a unified and organized arrangement of
buildings and service facilities, including parking and loading/unloading
spaces;
      (3)   The plan shall conform to the requirements and standards set forth
herein; and
      (4)   The plan shall prohibit residential uses of the land, or any other
use which would substantially interfere with the orderly development of the
continuation of industrial uses.
   (b)   Upon determination by the Commission that the preliminary plan meets
these conditions, the proponent shall prepare and submit a final development
plan, which shall incorporate any changes or alterations requested by the
Commission.  If the final development plan is found to comply with the
requirements set forth in this chapter, the Commission shall submit such plan,
together with its report and recommendations thereon, to Council.  Council
shall process the final development plan in accordance with the provisions of
Chapter
1153, including the holding of a public hearing thereon, and may modify the
plan consistent with the intent and meaning of this chapter.
   (c)   After the final development plan has been approved, any subsequent
change in use or any adjustment or rearrangement of buildings, parking areas,
loading areas, entrances or exits, or heights that may be desired, shall be
submitted in detail to the Commission. The Commission shall review such
changes, adjustments and/or rearrangements that may be proposed and submit its
recommendation thereon to Council.  Council shall take such action as is
consistent with the requirements, intent and meaning of this chapter.

1149.08   PORTABLE AND TEMPORARY SIGNS.
   The intent of this section is to recognize the individual or entity who
occasionally desires to display a temporary commercial message in conjunction
with a permitted land use, and to provide the time, place, and manner
limitations allowing certain sign types for these purposes. It is further
intended to recognize the negative affect temporary signs can have on the
attractiveness of a community, including the deterioration of the natural
environment, the clutter temporary signs contribute to the landscape, the
distractions and obstructions this sign type may cause to motorist, and the
hazards that the aforementioned concerns may cause. Thus, this section is
intended to establish regulations that allow portable and temporary signs
without their becoming a nuisance to the community. Portable and temporary
signs shall be permitted as an accessory use to a lawfully established
principal, conditional or nonconforming use conducted on the premise, subject
to the limitations included in this code. All portable and/or temporary signs
shall comply with Section
1149.05 and the following provisions:
   (a)   All electrical work and equipment involved with a portable or
temporary sign shall conform to the National Electric Code (NEC).
   (b)   No sign portable or temporary by intent or design shall be used as a
permanent sign.
   (c)   It shall be the applicant's or owner's responsibility to maintain a
portable or temporary sign in good condition. Signs or banners that are torn,
damaged, faded, or otherwise in a state of disrepair must be immediately
replaced or removed.
   (d)   It shall be the applicant's or owner's responsibility to remove all
portable and temporary signs when the time limit for the sign has expired.
   (e)   Location.
      (1)   Portable and temporary signs shall be permitted on the building
face or in the yard adjacent to any building elevation facing a street, parking
lot, drive through lane, or service drive.
      (2)   Portable and temporary signs shall be permitted only on the same
lot or parcel as the business or activity for which it is displaying
information.
      (3)   No temporary sign shall be placed in the right-of-way or attached
to utility poles, or traffic control signs or devices.
   (f)   Number.
      (1)   Not more than one portable or temporary sign shall be permitted for
each street frontage.
      (2)   A sidewalk sign and a temporary sign shall not be displayed at the
same time.
   (g)   Period of display.
      (1)   Portable and/or temporary signs shall be displayed for no more than
105 days in any calendar year.
      (2)   Temporary signs shall be permitted for an additional period of
thirty-five days per calendar year only if the temporary sign is an attached
sign per Section
1149.08(h).
      (3)   Temporary and/or portable signs may be displayed for a period of
time not to exceed thirty-five consecutive days. A lapse of seven days must
occur before another temporary sign can be displayed.
      (4)   Twenty days per calendar year will be subtracted as a penalty from
a business activity's allotted number of temporary sign display days when that
activity maintains a temporary sign past the expiration date for the permit, or
displays a temporary sign without a permit. If the business activity has fewer
than twenty allotted temporary sign days remaining for the calendar year in
which the penalty is imposed, the balance of those penalty days will be
subtracted form that activity's allotted temporary sign days in the following
calendar year. This penalty is in addition to all other penalties as
established in Section
1155.99.
   (h)   Attached temporary signs or banners are temporary/portable signs that
are attached to a permanent building or structure. Attached temporary signs
shall comply with the following provisions as well as Sections
1149.08(a) through (g).
      (1)   The sign or banners shall be mounted flat against the facade of the
building or structure so that no part of the sign or banner projects more than
four inches from the facade. The banner or sign must be secured, at a minimum
at all four corners.
      (2)   Attached sign or banner size is limited to 10% of the area of the
facade of the building or structure on which it is mounted, with a maximum of
fifty square feet.
      (3)   The mounting location of the banner shall not obstruct any ingress,
egress, fire exits or ventilation openings.
      (4)   Attached temporary signs or banners shall not be mounted on the
roof, eaves, gutter, or overhang.
   (i)   Detached temporary signs or banners are temporary/portable signs that
arc supported by poles, uprights, or braces extending from the ground or from
an object on the ground, or any sign located on the ground, providing that no
part of the sign is attached to any part of a building.
      (1)   The maximum height for a detached (freestanding) portable or
temporary sign shall be six feet.
      (2)   The area of portable or temporary signs shall not exceed fifty
square feet in area per face.

violation of any of the terms of this Zoning Code, the City Manager or his or
her designee shall notify the property owner or lessee in writing thereof to
alter such sign so as to comply with this Zoning Code.
(Ord. A-2248.  Passed 4-9-01.)
1149.11   LIGHTING.
   Any sign illumination shall be so arranged as to confine the illumination to
the sign, avoid glare or other disturbance on adjacent property and shield the
source of illumination. No flashing shall be permitted where such flashing
would interfere with or distract from a traffic control sign or signal or
normal traffic visibility. Such flashing shall not be permitted on portable or
temporary signs.

contrary to the public interest, where, owing special conditions of the land
(such as, an irregular shaped lot; a lot of exceptional topography; or an
exceptionally narrow, shallow or irregular lot, existing and of record at the
time of the passage of this Zoning Code), a literal enforcement of the
provisions of this Zoning Code will result in unnecessary hardship or practical
difficulty.

percent (25%) of maximum height or size regulations for the applicable use.
      (3)   Use variances not authorized.  The provisions for variances within
this Zoning Code shall not be construed to permit variances which shall in
effect amend the use provisions in this Zoning code. Under no circumstances
shall the Board grant a variance to allow a use not permissible under the terms
of this Zoning Code in the zoning district involved, or any use expressly or by
implication prohibited by the terms of this Zoning code in such district.
   (c)   Conditional Uses.  The Board shall grant or deny conditional use
permits, as provided in  Chapter
1147 and Section

Zoning Code or the Zone Map as applied to such property, the Board of Appeals,
upon receipt of a request by such owner, may modify such strict application or
interpret the meaning of this Zoning Code so as to relieve such hardship or
difficulty. However, such modification and interpretation shall remain in

health, safety, convenience, comfort, prosperity or general welfare will be
conserved and substantial justice done. No variance in the application of the
provisions of this Zoning Code shall be made by the Board relating to

written notice thereof to all owners of property located within 200 feet in any
direction of the property affected by the variance application.   
   (d)   Standards for Variance. The Board shall not grant a variance unless it
can, in each specific case, make specific findings of fact directly based upon
the particular evidence presented to it, that support conclusions that:
      (1)   There are exceptional or extraordinary circumstances or conditions
applicable to the property or to the intended use that do not apply generally
to other property or classes of use in the same vicinity and district.
      (2)   Such variance is necessary for the preservation and enjoyment of a
substantial property right possessed by other property in the same vicinity and
district but which is denied to the property in question.
      (3)   The granting of such variance will not be materially detrimental to
the public welfare or injurious to the property or improvements in such
vicinity and district in which the property is located.

modifications, safeguards and restrictions upon the premises benefitted by the
variance as may be necessary to comply with the standards set forth in
subsection (d) hereof to reduce or minimize potential injurious affects of such
variance upon neighboring properties, and to carry out the general purpose and
intent of this Zoning Code.  Such modifications, safeguards and restrictions

place for the public hearing on a conditional use application and shall publish

conditional use unless it can, in each specific case, make specific findings of
fact directly based upon the particular evidence presented to it, that support
conclusions that:
      (1)   The establishment, maintenance or operation of the conditional use
will not be detrimental to or endanger the public health, safety, morals or
general welfare;
      (2)   The conditional use will not be injurious to the use and enjoyment
of other property in the immediate vicinity for the purposes already permitted,
or will not substantially diminish and impair property value within the
neighborhood;
      (3)   The establishment of the conditional use will not impede the normal
and orderly development and improvement of surrounding property for uses
permitted in the district;
      (4)   Adequate utilities, access roads, drainage and other necessary
facilities have been or are being provided;
      (5)   Adequate measures have been or will be taken to provide ingress and
egress so designed to minimize traffic congestion in the public streets; and
      (6)   The conditional use will be located in a district where such use is
permitted and that all requirements set forth in this Zoning Code and
applicable to such conditional use will be met.
   (e)   Additional Conditions. In granting a conditional use, Section
1147.06 of the  Zoning Code permits the Board to impose additional conditions
upon the premises benefitted by the conditional use as may be necessary to
comply with the standards set forth in subsection (d) hereof to reduce or
minimize potential injurious affects of such conditional use upon neighboring
properties, and to carry out the general purpose and intent of this Zoning
Code.
   (f)   Decision on Conditional Use. The concurring vote of at least three
members of the Board in attendance at the public hearing shall be necessary to
grant a conditional use. The Board shall render a written decision containing
relevant findings of fact without unreasonable delay after the close of the
hearing, and in all cases, within forty-five days after the close of the
hearing. 
      (1)   In cases where the board concurs with the written recommendations
and findings of the City Manager or his or her designee, such written
recommendations and findings shall constitute the written decision of the
Board.
      (2)   In cases where the Board's decision differs from the written
recommendation and findings of the City Manager or his or her designee, the
Board shall collectively, draft, approve, and formally submit written
recommendations and findings based on their decision to the secretary of the
board.  Such written recommendations and findings shall be read aloud by the
president of the board at the same meeting in which they are formally
submitted.
   (g)   Period of Validity.  A conditional use granted by the Board shall
terminate at the end of one year from date on which the Board grants the
conditional use, unless within such one year period, a zoning permit is

Protection Agency (OEPA) for approvals as required. Certification of OEPA
approval shall be provided on the plans where applicable. Construction shall
not commence until such approvals are granted. The City Engineer's signature
shall be provided on approved construction plans to verify compliance with the
applicable specifications and the requirements of these regulations.
   (d)   Final Plat Standards.
      (1)   Design Standards.  The subdivider shall observe the following
requirements and principals of land subdivision.
         A.   Plat conformity. The plat shall conform to such plan or plans for
the City, Township and/or County or portions thereof, as shall have been
adopted by the Planning Commission.
         B.   Block lengths. Block lengths, or the distance between street
intersections, shall not be more than 1,200 feet, and block depths optional,
except when the Planning Commission may deem that existing conditions or
special plan provisions warrant a variation from this requirement. If a block
exceeds 1,000 feet in length, the Planning Commission may require that a
Pedestrian Way, for a footpath not less than five (5) feet in width and
improved with a four (4) foot concrete pavement, shall be provided at a
convenient place to extend across the width of the block.
         C.   Lot widths and depths. Lots shall be of such width and depth to
permit conformance with the Zoning Code and other City, Township or County
regulations. No lot depth shall exceed three and one-half times the lot width. 
All lots shall comply with the frontage requirements set forth in subsection
(d)(1) hereof.
         D.   Angle of side lot lines. In all rectangular lots, and so far as
possible in all other lots, side lot lines shall be at right angles or radial
to the streets on which the lots face.
         E.   Access.  Appropriate access to and from any subdivision in the
form of standard City streets with required improvements must be provided by a
developer in instances where development is not located contiguously along an
improved public street right- of-way. No subdivision shall be approved where a
parcel tract or lot having frontage only on the "stub end" of a discontinued or
dead-end street.  Such street must first be extended or reconstructed as a cul-
de-sac in accordance with these Regulations. No subdivision showing reserved
strips controlling the access to public ways will be approved, except where the
control and disposal of land comprising such strips are definitely placed
within the jurisdiction of the City, under conditions meeting the approval of
the Planning Commission.
         F.   Frontage. All lots, parcels or tracts shall have frontage along
an improved public right-of-way, other than an alley, at a length which meets
the lot width or frontage length requirements of the zoning district in which
the site is located. In zoning districts which have no minimum lot width
requirements, frontage length shall equal or exceed the right-of-way width as
required for the type of development found at the subject location. For lots,
parcels or tracts having frontage along the circular terminus of a cul-de-sac,
or along a curve of a right-of-way, a compensatory reduction in frontage length
is permissible to a minimum of fifty percent of the lot width required by
zoning regulations, provided that the minimum lot width required is complied
with at the setback line.
         G.   Setback Lines. Building or setback lines of a depth approved by
the Planning Commission may be established for all lots and shown on the record
plat. All comer lots shall have adequate lot area to accommodate the required
front yard setback along each street frontage.
         H.   Unsubdivided Portion of Plat. Where the plat to be subdivided
includes only part of the tract owned by the subdivider, the Planning
Commission may require topography and a sketch of a tentative future streets
system of the unsubdivided portion.
         I.   Streets. Streets shall conform in effect to the Official
Thoroughfare Plan and other City plans where applicable.  Proposed streets
shall provide for continuation or completion of any existing streets
(constructed or recorded) in adjoining property, at equal or greater width as
determined by the City Engineering standards and specifications, and in similar
alignment, unless variations are recommended by the Planning Commission. The
street pattern shall provide ease of circulation within the subdivision as well
as convenient access to adjoining streets, thoroughfares or unsubdivided land,
as may be required by the Planning Commission. In a case where a street will
eventually be extended beyond the plat but is temporarily dead ended, an
interim turn-around may be required. Streets shall be platted with appropriate
regard for topography, water courses, wooded areas and other natural features
which would lend themselves to attractive treatment.
         Street intersections shall be as nearly at right angles as possible.
Street grades shall not exceed four percent on major streets or thoroughfares,
or ten percent on residential or access streets. The minimum street grade for
any street shall be one- half percent (0.5%), unless otherwise approved by the
City Engineer. Horizontal curvature of streets shall not exceed eight degrees
on thoroughfares and fourteen degrees on minor, through streets, unless
otherwise approved by the City Engineer. Superelevation will be required for
any thoroughfare curve over six degrees unless otherwise approved. Cul-de-sacs
shall not be longer than 600 feet in length unless topography necessitates a
greater length.
         Streets that are extensions of or obviously in alignment with existing
named streets shall bear the names of the existing streets. Street designations
shall be in accordance with Section
103.03 of these Codified Ordinances. The names of new streets shall be subject
to the approval of the Planning Commission and shall not duplicate existing
street names, except as provided above.
         Dedication of half-streets will be prohibited. Where there exists a
dedicated or platted half-street or alley adjacent to the tract to be
subdivided, the other half shall be platted if deemed necessary by the Planning
Commission.
         J.   Alleys. Alleys may be required in business areas and industrial
districts for adequate access to block interiors and for off-street loading and
parking purposes. Dead-end alleys are prohibited.
         K.   Railroads. If a railroad is involved, the subdivision plan should
be so arranged as to permit, where necessary, future grade separations at
highway crossing of the railroads. The railroad should be bordered with a
parallel street at sufficient distance from it to permit deep lots to back up
to the railroad, or form a buffer strip for park, commercial or industrial use.
The subdivision plan also should provide cul-de-sacs at right angles to the
railroad so as to permit lots to back thereon, and be so arranged as to
preserve adequate sight lines for safe traffic crossing.
         L.   Flood plains or flood hazard areas. Where any subdivision is
located in an area subject to periodic floods up to the 100-year level, the
Planning Commission or its authorized representative shall not approve such
plat without verification of compliance with Chapter
1108, "Flood Damage Prevention", of the Codified Ordinances of the City of
Sidney, and with applicable State and Federal regulations. The developer shall
submit all filling, grading and construction plans as required by the City
Engineer and/or the Building Inspector, in order to determine compliance with
the provisions of this Section. In no case shall a subdivision be approved
where development will raise the 100-year flood elevation more than one foot or
where development will result in a principal structure having a "lowest floor"
elevation below the base flood level. All subdivision plats for flood-prone
areas shall plainly identify the 100-year flood elevation for the subject
property and all area with its boundary.
      (2)   Dimensional Standards.
         A.   Streets.  Dimensional Standards for street pavement widths shall
be in accordance with current City Engineering standards and specifications.
All street layouts and dimensional specifications for each development must
meet with the approval of the Planning Commission.
         B.   Alleys. Alleys, where provided, shall have a right-of-way width
of no less than sixteen and one-half feet. Pavement widths shall be in
conformance with current City Engineering standards and specifications.
         C.   Pedestrian Ways.  Pedestrian ways, where provided shall be
platted to a minimum five foot width. Greater width may be required when
necessary for installation of underground utilities and drainage facilities.
Concrete widths shall be approved by the City Engineer.
         D.   Easements. Utility easements five feet in width shall be provided
along each side and rear lot line. An easement ten feet in width shall be
required along lot lines where no easement exists on an adjacent parcel. Such
easements shall be for utility installations and drainage purposes.
      (3)   Required Improvements. All improvements required under these
Regulations shall be constructed in accordance with the specifications, and
under the supervision, of the City Engineer, the Sidney-Shelby County Health
Department, and the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency.
         A.   Streets. All intersecting or cross streets in a subdivision shall
be improved to meet the current City Engineering Standards, on both sides of
the centerline and to the full depth of the corner lots facing the street being
developed unless otherwise approved by the Planning Commission.
         In cases within the corporate limits where a subdivision is proposed
along an existing paved street, and where such street does not meet current
City Engineering Department standards, the developer must improve the portion
of the street adjoining the subdivision by installing curb, gutter, sidewalks,
widening and/or upgrading the street surface and its base and make other
improvements as may be required by the City Engineer. In the event that both
sides of the street are to be included in the subdivision, the entire street
adjoining or traversing the subdivision must be improved in accordance with
standards required by the City Engineer and as specified in Engineering
Department specifications.
         Streets and alleys shall be completed to grades which have been
officially determined or approved by the City Engineer. All streets shall be
graded to the full width of the pavement.
         Adjacent side slopes shall be graded to a slope not steeper than
three-to-one, except as approved by the City Engineer.
         The type and strength of street paving and surfacing shall be
installed as per current City Engineering specifications, and shall be
commensurate with the volume, street classification, character and general
circulation requirements, as determined by the City Engineer. The cost of
materials for the paved surface and its sub-base of an existing street and any
oversizing cost in excess of the owner's required responsibility needed to meet
the dimensional standards for roadways as shown on the City's Thoroughfare
Plan, shall be at the City's expense.  The costs for minimum street width, as
required by these Regulations, including curb, gutter and sidewalk, shall be
the developer's responsibility and at his/her expense (see City Engineering
Standards and Specifications).
         B.   Curbs and Gutter. Curbs and gutters shall be required and of a
type to be approved by the City Engineer.
         C.   Sidewalks.
            1.   Zone District Requirements.
               a.   N, S, R, B. and O Districts.  Sidewalks shall be required
per current City Engineering Standards and installed on both sides of all
streets, including cul-de-sacs.
               b.   I Districts.  Sidewalks shall be required on both sides of
all thoroughfares and collector streets. Sidewalks may be required on other
streets if Planning Commission finds that such sidewalks are necessary for
safety, pedestrian connections or other similar reasons.
            2.   Sidewalks shall be installed adjacent to each lot in the
subdivision by the owner of the lot at the earlier of the following:
               a.   Prior to the issuance of an occupancy permit.
               b.   Within three years of approval of the final plat by City
Council if 75% of the lots within any block frontage are developed with
sidewalks.
               c.   Within five years of approval of the final plat by City
Council.
         D.   Traffic Control and Directional Signs. Traffic control (stop
signs, speed limit signs, etc.) and directional signs (street name signs) shall
be required. The sign type and location shall be approved by the City Engineer.
The City is responsible for all costs associated with materials and
installation.
         E.   Utilities. All utilities shall be installed underground. All
lines and connections thereto shall be made before any pavement course, curb
and gutter, or sidewalks are placed. Trenches will be backfilled with granular
material to meet City specifications.  All utilities shall be specified on
construction plans provided to the City as part of the required submission
material for subdivision review.  Requirements for the installation of
utilities shall be as follows:
            1.   Water Mains. A subdivider shall install water mains according
to City specifications.  The material's cost difference between the minimum
required size of pipe and appurtenances, and oversized pipe required by the
City, will be paid by the City.
            2.   Sanitary Sewers. A subdivider shall install sanitary sewers
according to City specifications. The materials cost difference between the
minimum required size of pipe and appurtenances, and oversized pipe required by
the City, will be paid by the City.  The construction cost difference as
determined by the City Engineer for the minimum depth needed for installation
and the greater depth of installation required by the City, will be paid by the
City.
            3.   Storm Sewers. Storm sewer systems shall be installed by the
developer in accordance with plans approved by the City Engineer and under
inspection by the City Engineering Department.
            4.   Stormwater Management/Erosion Control. Stormwater detention
systems and erosion control measures shall be installed by the developer in
accordance with City Engineering specifications and approval by the City
Engineer.
            5.   Street Lights. Street lights shall be installed at locations
acceptable to the Utility Company and as approved by the City Engineer. Street
lighting installations, materials and performance shall meet the standards and
specifications of the City Engineer and be acceptable to the Utility Company.
The developer is responsible for all costs associated with street light
materials and installation.
         F.   Monuments and Permanent Markers. Permanent markers shall be set
at all exterior subdivision boundary corners and intersection of change, at the
point of curvature and point of tangent of all curves and where the radius of
direction changes. The intent is to identify and establish all lines of the
plat. All monuments or permanent markers shall be placed prior to City
acceptance of improvements. All individual rear lot corners shall be
permanently marked prior to the City issuing building permits. Monument boxes
with permanent markers shall be set at all street intersections and on the
centerlines at the point of intersection if in the paved area of the street or
point of curvature and point of tangent of all curves, or any deflection in the
centerline. Permanent markers shall be concrete not less than three feet long
and at least four inches in diameter, or four inches square and properly marked
with a cross; or an iron pin at least thirty inches long and five-eighths of an
inch in diameter. All monuments and permanent markers shall be set as shown on
the final plat. The size, location and type of material used shall also be
shown. A professional surveyor's affidavit shall be filed in the plat volume
and cross-referenced with the original plat when, for any reason, a monument or
permanent marker must be off-set from the original location or the type of
permanent marker is changed.
         G.   Dedication of Parkland. Each subdivision containing residential
lots shall include land dedicated for recreational and park facilities. The
location of dedicated park land within the subdivision shall be subject to the
approval of City Council, upon recommendation of the Planning Commission and
Recreation Board. In order to determine recreational land requirements for
residential subdivisions, in accordance with the general standard of three
acres per one thousand persons, the following formula shall be used:
            (3/1000) x ( 3* x (Y) = Amount of land to be dedicated
            *= Average # persons per dwelling unit
            Y = # of dwelling units in subdivision
      The following are suggested guidelines for locating parks within
subdivisions:
               (1)   Easily accessible to residential neighborhoods within
minimum road frontage of 50 feet;
               (2)   Located to serve as buffer between incompatible uses;
               (3)   Along stream corridors, but outside the 100-year
floodplain, to ensure that filling the floodplain won't be necessary to provide
recreational facilities;
               (4)   Within wooded areas provided sufficient vacant ground
exists for recreational facilities, without disturbing woods;
               (5)   Within severe sloped areas and ravines, provided
sufficient level ground exists for recreational facilities, without requiring
significant grading.
            1.   Where the developer cannot satisfactorily show the specific
number of dwelling units to be built, the following presumptions will apply:
               a.   Where the property to be developed is zoned R-1, the
presumption is that one dwelling unit per lot will be constructed;
               b.   Where the property to be developed is zoned R-2, the
presumption is that two dwelling units per lot will be constructed;
               c.   Where the property to be developed is zoned R-3, the
presumption is that 21.78 dwelling units per acre will be constructed;
            2.   The City Council, upon recommendation of the Planning
Commission and the Recreation Board, may determine that all or part of the land
proposed to be dedicated is not needed for recreational development. In these
cases, City Council may require the developer to pay a fee in lieu of
dedication of land. The amount of such fee shall be determined using the
following formula:
                  Amount of land to be dedicated x $50,000/acre = Fee
            3.   Where it is determined by City Council that there is
sufficient park and recreational land in the subdivision and is only a small
portion of land is required, a developer may be required to both dedicate land
and pay a fee. This fee is to be determined using the following formula:
                  RLD-ALD = Z
                     CPA x Z = Fee
               CPA = Cost Per Acre = $50,000
               RLD = Required Land Dedication
               ALD = Accepted Land Dedication
               Z = Remaining Land for Which a Fee is Required
               EXAMPLE:
         For a 100 acre development for which three acres of parkland or one
hundred fifty thousand dollars ($150,000) is required. Only one acre of
parkland is accepted; two acres require a fee.
               3 acres required; l acre accepted = 2 acres for fee
               $50,000 x 2 acres = $100,000 fee required.
            4.   All fees shall be computed at Preliminary Plat stage. Payment
of fees may be phased based on the number of lots of the approved final plat as
a percentage of the total lots of the approved preliminary plat. Fees shall be
due prior to the issuance of any building permits.
               EXAMPLE
               112 lot single-family residence subdivision
               Required land dedication = 1 acre
               Required fee in lieu of land dedication = $50,000
               Phase I final plat = 28 lots
               28/112 = .25
               $50,000 x .25 = $12,500
         H.   Street trees. Although not a required improvement, it is
recommended that street trees be planted as part of the subdivision
development. The species of tree shall be approved by the Tree Board and the
location by the City Engineer.
(Ord. A-2137. Passed 8-24-98; Ord. A-2338.  Passed 2-24-03.)
1161.06   SURETY REQUIREMENTS.
   (a)   Within the Corporate Limits.
      (1)   Performance Surety.
         A.   No subdivision shall be considered by Council unless the plans
for all required improvements and the appropriate surety covering the costs of
these improvements are submitted to, and approved by, the City Engineer,
including agreement on costs for utility and street oversizing. This
information must be submitted to the City Engineer by 5:00 p.m. on the
Wednesday prior to the City Council meeting.
         B.   A 100 percent Performance Surety (in a format and amount as
approved by the City Engineer and by the City Solicitor) shall be submitted by
the developer. Such surety shall assure either the performance of the specified
work, or payment of the specified sum to the City if such improvements have not
been installed and completed within one year after the date of the surety's
submission.
         C.   In cases where improvement, such as extra street pavement width
(or others) are determined by the City Engineer to be premature due to a lack
of surrounding development, time limits for installation of the specified
improvements may be extended until future development in the subject area
warrants construction of the required improvements. A cash escrow shall be the
format of the required surety and the City Engineer shall determine when to
execute the surety.
      (2)   Maintenance Surety.
         A.   Once all the required public improvements (as defined in Section
1161.02(b)(15) have been constructed and substantially completed in the
subdivision as determined by the City Engineer or Public Works Director, and
prior to the release of the performance surety, the subdivider shall post with
the City a maintenance surety in the amount of ten percent of the performance
surety.
         B.   No public improvements shall be approved nor shall any building
permits be issued until the subdivider has posted an approved maintenance
surety and this maintenance surety will extend for one year from the actual
date that the final punch list is substantially completed as determined by the
City Engineer or Public Works Director.
         For the purposes of this section, the guidelines for substantially
completed shall be as follows:
            1.   City utilities (water, sewer, storm sewer) have been installed
and approved by the City Engineer and all other underground utilities (gas,
water, telephone, and cable television, etc.) have been installed;
            2.   Curb and gutter has been constructed and approved by the City
Engineer;
            3.   Asphalt has been laid and approved by the City Engineer.
         C.   Acceptance of the public improvements by the City will not take
place until the City releases the maintenance surety and the City Engineer
receives one set of reproducible, record drawings, including all utilities
(i.e., sanitary, gas, water, telephone, electric, storm, cable television,
etc.), drawn at a scale of at least one inch equals twenty feet. Record
drawings, with utilities as located by private utility companies, shall be
stamped by a registered professional engineer or surveyor verifying the
accuracy of the drawings.
         D.   Prior to the release of the maintenance surety by the City, the
developer shall have paid all public improvement fees required by these
Regulations.
(Ord. A-2137. Passed 8-24-98.)
1161.07   WAIVER PROCEDURE.
   (a)   Whenever a tract to be subdivided is of an unusual size or shape or is
adjacent or abutting a natural or man-made feature that strict application of
the requirements contained in these Regulations would result in undue hardship
upon the owner of the tract, the Planning Commission may waive such
requirements so that the subdivider may develop his property in a reasonable
manner.
   (b)   Requests for a waiver of the provisions of these Regulations shall be
made to the Office of the Community Development and Planning three (3) weeks
prior to a regularly scheduled meeting of the Planning Commission. The request
must contain a full explanation of the circumstances surrounding the affected
property. It shall be the developer's burden to provide all the information
necessary for the Commission to decide the waiver request.
(Ord. A-2137. Passed 8-24-98.)
1161.08   ENFORCEMENT AND VIOLATIONS.
   (a)   Conveyance of Unrecorded Lots. It shall be unlawful to sell, trade or
otherwise convey any lot, parcel, tract of land, or portions thereof, subject
to these Regulations without first receiving appropriate City approvals and
unless said, plat or replat is first properly recorded in the Office of the
Shelby County Recorder.
   (b)   Recording Unapproved Plats. It shall be unlawful for a developer,
subdivider, property owner or their agent to cause the recording in any public
office any subdivision plat or replat of land located in the jurisdiction of
these Regulations without first receiving appropriate City approvals and
endorsements on the plat document.
   (c)   Misrepresentation as to Approval of Plans, Construction, or
Inspection. It shall be unlawful for any person, firm or corporation owning,
controlling or representing any addition or subdivision of land within the City
to claim that any or all public improvements required for the said addition for
subdivision of land have been constructed and/or inspected and approved in
accordance with the specifications and requirements of the City, when such
improvements have not been so constructed, inspected or approved.

It shall not be construed as authority to violate, cancel, alter or set aside
any of the provisions of this Building Code or other applicable laws,
ordinances, rules or regulations, nor shall such issuance of a permit prevent
the Building Inspector from thereafter requiring a correction of errors in
plans or in construction, or of violations of this Building Code or of other

party must seek a permanent regular Certificate of Occupancy or vacate the
structure.

   The following standards shall be used to guide decisions on all types of
rehabilitation projects undertaken within the Downtown Design Improvement Area:
   (a)   A property shall be used for its historic purpose or be placed in a
new use which requires minimal change to the defining characteristics of the
building, its site and the environment.
   (b)   The historic character of a property shall be retained and preserved.
The removal of historic materials, or the alteration of features and spaces
that characterize a property, shall be avoided. 
   (c)   Each property shall be recognized as a physical record of its time,
place and use. Changes that create a false sense of historic development, such
as adding conjectural features or architectural elements from other buildings,
shall not be undertaken.
   (d)   Most properties change over time; those changes that have acquired
historic significance in their own right shall be retained and preserved.
   (e)   Distinctive features, finishes and construction techniques, or
examples of craftsmanship that characterize a historic property, shall be
preserved.
   (f)   Deteriorated historic features shall be repaired rather than replaced.
Where the severity of deterioration requires replacement of a distinctive
feature, the new feature shall match the old in design, color, texture and
other visual qualities and, where possible, in materials. Replacement of
missing features shall be substantiated by documentary, physical or pictorial
evidence.
   (g)   Chemical or physical treatments, such as sandblasting, that cause
damage to historic materials, shall not be used. The surface cleaning of
structures, if appropriate, shall be undertaken using the gentlest means
possible.
   (h)   Significant archaeological resources affected by a project shall be
protected and preserved. If such resources must be disturbed, mitigation
measures shall be undertaken.
   (i)   New additions, exterior alterations or related new construction shall
not destroy historic materials that characterize the property. The new work
shall be differentiated from the old and shall be compatible with the massing,
size, scale and architectural features to protect the historic integrity of the
property and its environment.
   (j)   New additions and adjacent or related new construction shall be
undertaken in a manner that, if removed in the future, the essential form and
integrity of the historic property and its environment would be unimpaired.
(Ord. A-1985.  Passed 2-13-95.)
1312.99   PENALTY.
   Whoever violates any of the provisions of this chapter is guilty of a minor
misdemeanor and shall be fined not more than one hundred dollars ($100.00) for
each offense.  A separate offense shall be deemed committed each day during or
on which a violation occurs or continues.

   The term "dangerous building," as used in this chapter, is hereby defined to
mean and include:
   (a)   Any building, shed, fence or other man-made structure which is

provisions of this chapter.
   (b)   When a property owner denies the Building Inspector or his or her duly

warrant pursuant to constitutional guidelines, in order to gain access to such
property.

1315.09   CLOSING OF VACANT STRUCTURES.
   (a)   If a building or part thereof is vacant and the Building Inspector
determines that it is unfit for human occupancy or use and is not in danger of
structural collapse, the Building Inspector shall be permitted to post a
placard on the premises, stating that the building is "Unfit for Human
Occupancy," and order that the structure be closed up so that it does not
become an attractive nuisance to the public.
   (b)   The Building Inspector shall direct that the closing take place within
thirty days, unless emergency conditions warrant a quicker response to address
concern for the building occupants or the general public.  The order shall be
in writing and shall be physically served upon the owner of record of the
building in the manner provided for service of a summons by a court of record.
   (c)   Upon failure of the owner to close up the structure within the time
period specified, the Building Inspector shall have the authority to have the

reciting the existence of the emergency conditions and requiring immediate
vacation of the premises and abatement of the hazardous condition.  The

by the owner, shall be charged against the real estate upon which the structure
is located and shall be a lien upon such real estate.

under all policies exceeds $5,000.00, unless the company is in compliance with
the procedures set forth below.
   (b)   (1)   When the loss agreed to between the named insured or insureds
and the insurance company or companies equals or exceeds 60 percent of the
aggregate limits of liability on all fire policies covering the building or
structure, the insurance company or companies shall transfer from the insurance
proceeds to the Finance Officer of the City of Sidney in the aggregate
$2,000.00 for each $15,000.00 and each fraction of that amount, of a claim.
      (2)   The transfer of proceeds shall be on a prorata basis by all

pursuant to Ohio R.C. Section 715.261.
      (2)   The insurance company or companies shall provide the Finance
Officer with the name and address of the named insured or insureds, whereupon
the Finance Officer shall contact the named insured or insureds and certify
that the proceeds have been received by the Finance Officer and notify them
that the following procedures will be followed:
         (A)   The deposit shall be returned to the named insured or insureds

if the City of Sidney has not incurred any costs for the repairs, removal, or
securing. The deposit shall be returned to the named insured or insureds no
later than 30 days after the Finance Officer receives the required proof. If
the City of Sidney has incurred any costs for repairs, removal, or securing of
the building or other structure, the costs shall be paid from the "Fire Loss
Fund", and if excess deposits remain, the Finance Officer shall transfer, no
later than 60 days after all such costs have been paid, the remaining deposit
to the named insured or insureds. Nothing in this Section shall limit the
ability of the City of Sidney to recover any deficiency under Ohio R.C. Section
715.261.
         (B)   Nothing in this Section shall be construed to prohibit the City
of Sidney and the named insured or insureds from entering into an agreement
that permits the transfer of the "Fire Loss Fund" to the named insured or
insureds if some other reasonable disposition of the damaged property has been
negotiated.
   (d)   Nothing in this Section shall be construed to make an insurance
company liable for any amount in excess of the proceeds payable under its
insurance policy or for any other act performed pursuant to this Section or to
make the City of Sidney or the Finance Officer an insured under a policy of
insurance, or to create an obligation and to pay delinquent property taxes or
unpaid removal liens or expenses other than as provided in this Ordinance.

Section for structure removal liens or removal expenses incurred by the City of
Sidney shall have the full benefit of such payment including any rights of

(Ord. A-2936.  Passed 8-27-18; Ord. A-2975, Passed 8-12-19.)
1329.05   INSPECTIONS.
   The Community Development Department, accompanied by other City officials as
deemed necessary, shall inspect any premises in the City for the purpose of
enforcing and assuring compliance with the provisions of this chapter. Upon
request, an owner may provide access to all interior portions of a vacant
building in order to permit a complete inspection. Nothing contained herein,
however, shall eliminate the need to obtain a valid warrant when legally
required from a court of competent jurisdiction by the Community Development
Director or his or her designee in order to enable such inspection. Said
Official shall be required to obtain a search warrant whenever an owner refuses
to permit a warrantless inspection of the premises. The following shall apply:
   (a)   Residential Vacant Properties.
      (1)   Interior and exterior inspection is required at the start of the
first registration period, and when the property is removed from the vacant
property registration;
      (2)   Interior inspection is required every thirty-six months thereafter;
and
      (3)   Exterior inspection by the Vacant Property Inspector and/or Fire
Inspector is required at a minimum once every six months.
   (b)   Commercial and Industrial.
      (1)   Interior and exterior inspection is required at the start of the
first registration period, and when the property is removed from the vacant
property registration;
      (2)   Interior inspection is required every twelve months thereafter; and
      (3)   Exterior inspection by the Vacant Property Inspector and/or Fire
Inspector is required at a minimum once every six months.
   (c)   Vacant properties will be both internally and externally inspected
upon acquisition of the property by a new owner and prior to an issuance of a

   (d)   Any inspection that is to take place within thirty days of a previous
inspection may or may not be conducted at the discretion of the Community
Development Department and/or Fire Department.
(Ord. A-2936.  Passed 8-27-18; Ord. A-2975, Passed 8-12-19.)
1329.06   DEVELOPMENT PLAN.
   The owner or owner agent of the vacant building may submit a development
plan that shall be reviewed by the Community Development Department. Approval
of a development plan allows a refund of all registration fees paid in
accordance with Section
1329.07(e). The development plan shall include at a minimum the following:
   (a)   Anticipated period of vacancy.
   (b)   A timetable for the anticipated re-occupancy of the property.
   (c)   Rehabilitation plan for the property.
(Ord. A-2936.  Passed 8-27-18; Ord. A-2975, Passed 8-12-19.)
1329.07   FEES.
   The fees shall be reasonably related to the administrative costs for
registering and processing the vacant building registration form and for the
costs incurred by the City in monitoring the vacant building site. The annually
increased fee amounts shall be reasonably related to the costs incurred by the
City for demolition and hazard abatement of, or repairs to, vacant buildings,
as well as the continued administrative costs stated above.
   (a)   But for a valid arms-length transaction, the annual registration fee
for a vacant residential, commercial, or industrial building shall be based on
the duration of time the building has been vacant regardless of a change in
ownership. In the event of a valid arms-length transaction, the new purchaser
would start at the first year registration fee and proceed as described above,
regardless of the status of the seller. A valid "arms-length transaction" is
one between a buyer and seller in which the buyer and seller are independent of
each other, ensuring that all parties in the deal are acting in their own self-
interest, are not subject to any pressure or duress from the other parties, and
are dealing from equal bargaining positions. A valid written contract with
legally sufficient consideration as determined in the sole discretion of owner,
or designee must be provided.
   (b)   The owner of a vacant residential building shall pay an annual fee of
two hundred dollars ($200.00) for the first year the building remains vacant.
For every consecutive year that the building remains vacant, the annual fee
will be assessed at double the previous year's fee amount for a maximum annual
fee equaling the five-year fee of three thousand two hundred dollars
($3,200.00) to be used for the fifth and for all consecutive, subsequent years
of vacancy.
   (c)   The owner of a vacant commercial, four or more residential dwelling
unit building, industrial building and/or mixed use building shall pay an
annual fee of four hundred dollars ($400.00) for the first year the building
remains vacant. For every consecutive year that the building remains vacant,
the annual fee will be assessed at double the previous year's fee amount for a
maximum annual fee equaling the five-year fee of six thousand four hundred
dollars ($6,400.00) to be used for the fifth and for all consecutive,
subsequent years of vacancy.
   (d)   Vacant buildings without an approved Development Plan. The
registration fee shall be paid in full prior to the issuance of any building or
development-related permits. The Community Development Department shall refund
a prorated amount of the vacant property registration fee paid if the subject
building is brought into compliance with standards of federal, state, and local
codes to the satisfaction of the City Manager or designee and reoccupied within
one hundred and eighty (180) days of the required date to register per the
notice. The refund shall be for the amount of the registration fee paid during
the year in which the building was approved for re-occupancy. Registration fees
paid in previous years and/ or any arrearages of registration fees which are
paid in the same year in which the building was approved for re-occupancy shall
not be refunded.
   (e)   Vacant buildings with an approved Development Plan. The registration
fee shall be paid in full prior to the issuance of any building or development-
related permits. The Community Development Department shall refund the vacant
property registration fees paid if the subject building is brought into
compliance with standards of federal, state, and local codes and reoccupied
within the time frame specified in the approved Development Plan. The refund
shall be for the full amount of all registration fees (less any funds used by
the City to maintain the safety and security of the subject building) paid in
the time period after the approval of the Development Plan in accordance with
Section
1329.07.
   (f)   The fee shall be paid in full prior to the issuance of any City of
Sidney permits unless the property is granted an exemption. The fee shall be
prorated and a refund may be issued if the building is no longer deemed vacant
under the provisions of this chapter within 180 days of the required date to
register per the notice.
   (g)   All late fees shall be paid by the owner prior to any transfer of an
ownership interest in the vacant building, and all liens paid hereunder. A hold
may be placed on the transfer or activation of utilities (water and sewer)
until all unpaid fees are paid.
   (h)   If a registration form is filed late, an additional late fee shall be
paid in addition to the annual registration and will be equal to the annual fee
or one thousand dollars ($1,000.00), whichever is less.
   (i)   All liens and late fees shall be assessed and collected in accordance
with Section
1329.04 of the Codified Ordinances of the City of Sidney.
(Ord. A-2936.  Passed 8-27-18; Ord. A-2975, Passed 8-12-19.)
1329.08   EXEMPTIONS.

fifteen consecutive days of receipt of such notice, apply for an exemption by
filing a written application with the Community Development Director who shall
provide a determination within fifteen working days after receipt of all
necessary forms and documents.

valid building permit(s) at the time of initial inspection shall be exempt from

weather conditions shall be exempt from the registration requirement for a

writing to the Community Development Department. This request shall include the
names and addresses of the owner or owners, Hazard Insurance information, and a

or the intent to demolish the building.
   (c)   A vacant property that is under pending action such as bankruptcy,

or the Shelby County Land Reutilization Corporation shall be exempt from
registration.
   (e)   A building that is for sale or lease and listed with a Real Estate

occupied area, excluding crawl spaces and unfinished attics.
   (b)   For family units with split levels which are defined as adjacent
