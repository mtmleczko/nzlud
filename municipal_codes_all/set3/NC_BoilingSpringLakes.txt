PREFACE 
    This Code constitutes a complete recodification of the ordinances of the City of Boiling Spring Lakes, North Carolina, of a general and permanent nature. 
    Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the 1980 Code, as supplemented through August 1988, and ordinances subsequently adopted by the mayor and board of commissioners. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this Code, the reader can locate any section of the 1980 Code, as supplemented, and any subsequent ordinance included herein. 
    The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order and the various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Notes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state law have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this Code. 
Numbering System 
    The numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and local government codes. Each section number consists of two parts separated by a dash. The figure before the dash refers to the chapter number and the figure after the dash refers to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the second section of Chapter 1 is numbered 1-2 and the first section of Chapter 4 is 4-1. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter and at the same time new sections or even whole chapters can be inserted in their proper place by using the decimal system for amendments. For example, if new material consisting of one section that would logically come between sections 3-1 and 3-2 is desired to be added, such new section would be numbered 3-1.5. New chapters may be included in the same manner. If the new material is to be included between Chapters 12 and 13, it will be designated as Chapter 12.5. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject. The next successive number shall be assigned to the new article or division. 
Indices 
    The indices have been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the indices themselves which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which the user is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
    A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up-to-date. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited and the appropriate page or pages affected will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
    Successfully keeping this publication up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. As revised sheets are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
Acknowledgments 
    This publication was under the direct supervision of Alyce A. Whitson, Supervising Editor, and Laura Johnson, Editor, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida. Credit is gratefully given to the other members of the publisher's staff for their sincere interest and able assistance throughout the project. 
    The publisher is most grateful to Elva Jess, City Attorney, and Barbara Cumbee, City Clerk, for their cooperation and assistance during the progress of the work on this publication. It is hoped that their efforts and those of the publisher have resulted in a Code of Ordinances which will make the active law of the city readily accessible to all citizens and which will be a valuable tool in the day-to-day administration of the city's affairs. 
MUNICIPAL CODE CORPORATION 
Tallahassee, Florida  
HISTORY 
    The City of Boiling Spring Lakes derives its name from the Boiling Spring which flows with an incredibly pure stream of water. Boiling Spring Lake is the largest of the fifty lakes within the city. 
    In 1961, the developers of Boiling Spring Lakes happened upon a gushing spring concealed in a wooded ravine. Wishing to beautify the area, a four-foot high brick wall was built to encompass this natural phenomenon. Almost before the masons had completed their work, the spring suddenly stopped running. Within a few hours it burst out in a free full flow some fifteen feet outside the wall. Thousands of people have visited the site, but as yet, no one can account for the strange behavior of the spring. 
    Many years ago the spring was known as Bouncing Log Spring inasmuch as a large chunk of petrified wood was tossed and churned in the water gushing up out of the ground. Eventually, there was no longer a log being bounced around by the upward thrust of groundwater and the name was changed to the Boiling Spring. State geologists have calculated that the spring discharges approximately 43 million gallons of water each day. 
    The entire area seems enchanted with tall pines, oaks and sweet gums hovering over the spring. In the early spring, damsel flies of red, green and blue dart about the area and butterflies of all colors and descriptions flutter in the thickets. Legend has it that long ago Indians would camp around the spring and hold their council meetings at this site on their annual trek to the Atlantic Ocean for oysters, fish and game. They always drank from the spring, believing whomever drank from the spring would always return.

Sec. 1-12. - Supplementation of Code. 
(a)  By contract or by city personnel, supplements to this Code shall be prepared and printed whenever authorized or directed by the board of commissioners. A supplement to the Code shall include all substantive permanent and general parts of ordinances passed by the city council or adopted by initiative and referendum during the period covered by the supplement and all changes made thereby in the Code, and shall also include all amendments to the Charter during the period. The pages of a supplement shall be so numbered that they will fit properly into the Code and will, where necessary, replace pages which have become obsolete or partially obsolete, and the new pages shall be so prepared that, when they have been inserted, the Code will be current through the date of the adoption of the latest ordinance included in the supplement. 
(b)  In preparing a supplement to this Code, all portions of the Code which have been repealed shall be excluded from the Code by the omission thereof from reprinted pages. 
(c)  When preparing a supplement to this Code, the codifier, meaning the person authorized to prepare the supplement, may make formal, nonsubstantive changes in ordinances and parts of ordinances included in the supplement, insofar as it is necessary to do so to embody them into a unified code. For example, the codifier may: 
(1)  Organize the ordinance material into appropriate subdivisions; 
(2)  Provide appropriate catchlines, headings and titles for sections and other subdivisions of the Code printed in the supplement, and make changes in catchlines, headings and titles; 
(3)  Assign appropriate numbers to sections and other subdivisions to be inserted in the Code and, where necessary to accommodate new material, change existing section or other subdivision numbers; 
(4)  Change the words "this ordinance" or words of the same meaning to "this chapter," "this article," "this division," etc., as the case may be, or to "sections ____________ through ____________ ." The inserted section numbers will indicate the sections of the Code which embody the substantive sections of the ordinance incorporated into the Code; and 
(5)  Make other nonsubstantive changes necessary to preserve the original meaning of ordinance sections inserted into the Code; but in no case shall the codifier make any change in the meaning or effect of ordinance material included in the supplement or already embodied in the Code. 
Sec. 1-13. - Altering Code. 
    It shall be unlawful for any person to amend or alter any part or portion of this Code, or to insert or delete any page or portion thereof, or to alter or tamper with this Code in any manner whatsoever which will cause the law of the city to be misrepresented thereby. 
(Code 1980, § 1-4-9) 
Sec. 1-14. - Severability of parts of Code. 
    It is hereby declared to be the intention of the board of commissioners that the sections, paragraphs, sentences, clauses and phrases of this Code are severable and if any phrase, clause, sentence, paragraph or section of this Code shall be declared unconstitutional or otherwise invalid by the valid judgment or decree of any court of competent jurisdiction, the unconstitutionality or invalidity shall not affect any of the remaining phrases, clauses, sentences, paragraphs, and sections of this Code since the same would have been enacted by the board without the incorporation in this Code of an unconstitutional or invalid phrase, clause, sentence, paragraph or section. 
(Code 1980, § 1-4-7) 
Sec. 1-15. - General penalty; continuing violations. 
(a)  Where provided, a violation of specific sections of this ordinance is a misdemeanor or infraction as provided in N.C.G.S. 14-4. The maximum fine, term of imprisonment or infraction penalty is the maximum as set forth in N.C.G.S. 14-4, unless a lesser amount is otherwise specifically provided herein. 
(b)  (1)  Violation of a city ordinance shall subject the offender to a civil penalty to be recovered by the city in a civil action in the nature of debt if said civil penalty is not paid within seventy-two (72) hours after being cited for the violation. The penalty shall be as published in the fee schedule adopted by the board of commissioners and modified from time to time. The city may also recover a civil penalty for violation of the Fire Prevention Code of the State Building Code as authorized by N.C.G.S. 143-139. 
(2)  The provisions of the Code or any other city ordinance may be enforced by any one, all or a combination of the remedies authorized and prescribed by this section or as authorized in N.C.G.S. 160A-175 or other state law. In cases where the North Carolina General Statutes provides other remedies for violation of city ordinance, such remedies shall be in addition to those remedies herein stated. 
(3)  Each day a provision of the Code or an ordinance is violated is a separate offense. There shall be a civil penalty imposed in accordance with the city's fee schedule and modified from time to time as deemed necessary by the board of commissioners for each violation. Each penalty shall accrue daily, starting on the day the violation first occurs and continuing through the day the violation ceases. 
(4)  Civil penalties are due and payable within three (3) business days seventy-two (72) hours after service of a civil citation is complete. Each day's penalty for a continuing offense shall be due and payable within three (3) business days of the day of the offense without further notice or services. The penalties are payable at the City Hall during regular business hours. 
(5)  Service of a civil citation is completed on the day it is personally delivered, or three (3) days after it is mailed, to the following: An offender who is an individual or owner of a sole proprietorship, any general partner of a partnership that is the offender, or is the registered agent, or manager or other person in a supervisory capacity at the local place of business of an offender who is a corporation. The three-day period for mailed service shall begin the day it is placed in the United States Mail, in a properly stamped and addressed envelope, addressed to the appropriate person named above at the offender's first known address. Personal service may be made by any police officer, city manager, code enforcement officer or building inspector. 
(6)  Recovery of overdue civil penalties shall be by a civil action against the offender in the nature of debt. 
(7)  Civil citations for all violations of code provisions and ordinances regulating building, housing, environmental matters, mobile homes, zoning and subdivisions shall be issued by the building inspector. All other civil citations may be issued by any police officer or "appropriate city official" as defined in section 1-2. The penalty provisions for all ordinances and regulations contained in the Code of Ordinances for the city shall be modified to comply with the provisions of this section. 
(c)  In addition to any civil penalties or criminal fines set out in this section, any provision of this Code or any other city ordinance may be enforced by an appropriate equitable remedy issuing from a court of competent jurisdiction. In such case, the general court of justice shall have jurisdiction to issue such orders as may be appropriate, and it shall not be a defense to the application of the city for equitable relief that there is an adequate remedy at law. 
(d)  In addition to any civil penalties or criminal fines set out in this section, any provision of this Code or any other city ordinance that makes a condition unlawful existing upon or use made of real property may be enforced by injunction and order of abatement. The general court of justice shall have jurisdiction to issue such orders. When a violation of such a provision occurs, the city may apply to the appropriate division of the North Carolina General Court of Justice for a mandatory or prohibitory injunction and order of abatement commanding the defendant to correct the unlawful condition upon or cease the unlawful use of the property. The action shall be governed in all respects by the laws and rules governing civil proceedings, including the Rules of Civil Procedure, NCGS 1A, in general and Rule 65 in particular. 
(e)  In addition to an injunction, the court may enter an order of abatement as a part of the judgment in the cause. An order of abatement may direct that: 
(1)  Buildings or other structures on the property be closed, demolished or removed; 
(2)  Fixtures, furniture or other movable property be removed from buildings on the property; 
(3)  Grass and weeds be cut; 
(4)  Improvements or repairs be made; or 
(5)  Any other action be taken that is necessary to bring the property into compliance with this Code or such ordinance. 
If the defendant fails or refuses to comply with an injunction or with an order of abatement within the time allowed by the court, he may be cited for contempt; and the city may execute the order of abatement. The city shall have a lien on the property for the cost of executing an order of abatement in the nature of a mechanic's and materialman's lien. The defendant may secure cancellation of an order of abatement by paying all costs of the proceedings and posting a bond for compliance with the order. The bond shall be given with sureties approved by the Clerk of Superior Court in an amount approved by the judge before whom the matter is heard and shall be conditioned on the defendant's full compliance with the terms of the order of abatement within a time fixed by the judge. Cancellation of an order of abatement shall not suspend or cancel an injunction issued in conjunction therewith. 
(f)  The provisions of this Code and any other city ordinances may be enforced by one (1), all or a combination of the remedies authorized and prescribed by this section. 
(g)  Except as otherwise specifically provided, each day's continuing violation of any provision of this Code or any other city ordinance shall be a separate and distinct offense. 
(h)  Any ordinances adopted by the city council, the violation of which shall incur a penalty, shall be subject to both a civil penalty and/or a criminal penalty. 
(i)  Upon determination of a violation of any section of this Code, the penalty for which is a civil penalty, the city shall cause a warning citation to be issued to the violator, setting out the nature of the violation, the section violated, the date of the violation, and an order to immediately cease the violation or, if the violation is in the nature of an infraction for which an order of abatement would be appropriate in a civil proceeding, stating a reasonable period of time in which the violation must be abated. The warning citation shall specify that a second citation shall incur a civil penalty. 
(j)  Upon failure of the violator to obey the warning citation, a civil citation shall be issued by the appropriate city official and either served directly on the violator or his duly designated agent, or registered agent if a corporation, in person or placed in the United States Mail by first class mail addressed to the last known address of the violator as contained in the records of the city, or obtained from the violator at the time of issuance of the warning citation. The violator shall be deemed to have been served upon the mailing of such citation. The citation shall direct the violator to appear before the city tax collector, located in the City Hall, within seventy-two (72) hours of the date of the citation or alternatively to pay the citation by mail. The violation for which the citation is issued must have been corrected by the time the citation is paid; otherwise, further citations shall be issued. Citations may be issued for each day the offense continues until the prohibited activity is ceased or abated. 
(k)  If the violator fails to respond to a citation within seventy-two (72) hours of its issuance and pay the penalty prescribed in the citation, the city may institute a civil action in the nature of debt in the appropriate division of the North Carolina General Court of Justice for the collection of the penalty.

The inspection department shall inspect all buildings and structures and work therein for which a permit of any kind has been issued as often as necessary in order to determine whether the work complies with the appropriate codes. When deemed necessary by the appropriate inspector, materials and assemblies may be inspected at the point of manufacture or fabrication, or inspections may be made by approved and recognized inspection organizations; provided, no approval shall be based upon reports of such organizations unless the same are in writing and certified by a responsible officer of the organization. All holders of permits, or their agents, shall notify the inspection department and the appropriate inspector at each of the following stages of construction, so that approval may be given before work is continued: 
(1)  Foundation inspection. To be made after trenches are excavated and the necessary reinforcement and forms are in place, and before concrete is placed. Drilled footings, piles and similar types of foundations shall be inspected as installed. 
(2)  Framing inspection. To be made after all structural framing is in place and all roughing in of plumbing, electrical and heating has been installed, after all fire blocking, chimneys, bracing and vents are installed, but before any of the structure is enclosed or covered. Poured-in-place concrete structural elements shall be inspected before each pour of any structural member.

(4)  Final inspection. To be made after building or structure has all doors hung, fixtures set, and is ready for occupancy, but before the building is occupied. 
(b)  Calls for inspection. Requests for inspections may be made to the office of the inspection department or to the appropriate inspector. The inspection department shall make inspections as soon as practicable after request is made therefor, provided the work is ready for inspection at the time the request is made.

All work which has been concealed before the inspection and approval shall be uncovered at the request of the inspector and placed in condition for proper inspection. Approval or rejection of the work shall be furnished by the appropriate inspector in the form of a notice posted on the building or given to the permit holder or his agent. Failure to call for inspections or proceeding without approval at each stage of construction shall be deemed a violation of this chapter. 
(c)  Street or alley lines. Where the applicant for a permit proposes to erect any building or structure on the line of any street, alley or other public place he shall secure a survey of the line of the street, alley or other public place adjacent to the property upon which the building or structure is to be erected before proceeding with construction of the building or structure.

That this section shall also apply to all persons wishing to make improvements to their properties which would result in soil or debris being introduced into any lake within the city. 
(g)  Dock permit. 
(1)  Prior to construction, the appropriate forms (any drawings, site plans, etc.) are submitted to the building inspector. A building permit must be obtained from the building inspector. A fee will be required, set by the board of commissioners, upon recommendation by the city manager. Review and approval must occur before any change or construction can occur. 
(2)  A review by the building inspector is required prior to any action or construction taken by the property owner. Owner shall provide details of dock or pier anchoring system to shore and provide a picture, drawing or other description indicating the colors and materials and sample construction plans showing by notes or detail, all of the structural elements of the structure, including piling embedment, beam sizes, framing, and strapping details. 
(3)  There will be an inspection of all docks on city-owned lakes, once every two (2) years, to ascertain condition, maintenance, esthetics and type of dock. There will be no fee for the inspection, however since docks are located on city-owned property (the lakes), if condition warrants, owner of the dock can be requested to tear down [the dock] and the debris carted away at the owner's expense if the building inspector deems this necessary. A reasonable amount of time will be given if this action is required, however this section authorizes fines, set by the board of commissioners, upon recommendation by the city manager, and shall be levied on a per diem basis due to non-compliance.

(a)  Purpose. As a justifiable exercise of the public powers of the City of Boiling Spring Lakes, North Carolina, the city desires to regulate the use of city parks and reduce opportunities for sex offenders to make use of public spaces for criminal intent, thereby maintaining a parks and recreation system that is meant for the peaceful enjoyment of children and other citizens. 
(b)  Definitions. For the purpose of this section, the following definitions shall apply, unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning. 
    Sex offender means an individual who is registered (or required to be registered) by any state or federal agency as a sex offender, and whose name is (or should be) published on any state or federal registered sex offender listing, including, but not limited to the sex offender registry established in Article 27a of North Carolina General Statutes, Chapter 14. 
    Public park means any publicly owned or maintained land which is designated by the city as a park or recreation facility. Park property shall include all adjacent parking areas, including any off-street parking spaces adjacent to the park. 
    Severability clause. If any court shall determine that any work, clause, phrase, sentence, paragraph or subsection of this article is unconstitutional as worded, the court shall attempt to construct or interpret such unconstitutional provision so as to enable same to be constitutional as so narrowed or construed. If the court cannot so limit or construe such work or provision narrowly so as to render same constitutional, it shall strike or modify only the minimum number of words, phrases, clauses, sentences, or paragraphs as will be absolutely necessary to render the remaining constitutional. In no case shall a subordinate word, clause or phrase render it's attached major section or provision unconstitutional, but instead shall be severed there from entirely, unless such severance renders the remainder wholly meaningless or unconstitutional. 
(c)  General offense. It shall constitute a general offense against the regulations of the City for any person or persons registered with the State of North Carolina and/or any other state or federal agency (or for any person or persons required to register pursuant to the General Statutes of the State of North Carolina and/or any other state or federal requirement) to knowingly enter into or on any public park owned, operated, or maintained by the city. 
(d)  Exemptions. Occasionally, the North Carolina Department of Corrections will bring prisoners to our city parks to perform community service work, such as cleaning and painting, and it is possible that one or more of the prisoners is a convicted sex offender. Due to the fact that these workers are under armed guard, these workers would be allowed in the city parks during performance of community service work. 
(e)  Penalty. Violation of this section may subject the offender to civil penalties that have been established to cover the cost of enforcement of this section in accordance with section 1-15 of this Code. The civil penalty shall be as published in the fee schedule adopted by the board of commissioners and modified from time to time. Each and every entrance into the parks, regardless of the time period involved shall constitute a separate offense under this section.

Section 1.1 Title
This Ordinance is officially titled as Unified Development Ordinance of Boiling Spring Lakes, North Carolina, and shall be known as the Unified Development Ordinance (UDO). The official map designating the various zoning districts shall be titled, City of Boiling Spring Lakes Zoning Map, and shall be known as the Zoning Map.
Section 1.2 Authority
Zoning provisions enacted herein are under the authority of NCGS 160A-381 to 160A-392, which extends to cities the authority to enact regulations which promote the health, safety, morals, or the general welfare of the community. It is further authorized under NCGS 160A-382 which authorizes cities to regulate and restrict the erection, construction, reconstruction, alteration, repair or use of buildings, structures, or land. This section further authorizes the establishment of overlay districts in which additional regulations may be imposed upon properties that lie within the boundary of the district. The statutes also require that all such regulations shall be uniform for each class or type of building throughout each district, but that the regulations in one district may differ from those in other districts.
Subdivision provisions enacted herein are under the authority of NCGS 160A-372 which provide for the coordination of streets within proposed subdivisions with existing or planned street and with other public facilities, the dedication or reservation of recreation areas serving residents of the immediate neighborhood within the subdivision, or alternatively, for the provision of funds to be used to acquire recreation areas serving residents of more than one neighborhood in the immediate area, and for the distribution of population and traffic in a manner that will avoid congestion and overcrowding.
This UDO, which combines zoning and subdivision authority, is further enacted under Section 1 of SL 2005-418, a revision to NCGS 160A-363.
Section 1.3 Purpose
This Unified Development Ordinance is made in accordance with a comprehensive plan and is designed to lessen congestion in the streets; to secure safety from fire, panic, and other dangers; to promote health and the general welfare; to provide adequate light and air; to prevent the overcrowding of land; to avoid undue concentration of population; to facilitate the adequate provision of transportation, water, sewerage, schools, parks and other public requirements; to control development of flood prone areas and regulate stormwater runoff/discharge; to regulate signs; and to establish proceedings for the subdivision of land. The regulations have been made with reasonable consideration, among other things, as to the character of the jurisdiction and its peculiar suitability for particular uses, and with a view to conserving the value of buildings and encouraging the most appropriate use of land throughout the jurisdiction.

Section 1.4 Applicability
1.4.1 Jurisdiction
(A) The regulations set forth in this Ordinance shall apply to all property within the City limits and within the various zoning districts as designated on the official zoning map, as established in Article 5, Zoning Districts.
(B) Except as hereinafter provided, no building or structure shall be erected, moved, altered, or extended, and no land, building, or structure or part thereof shall be occupied or used unless in conformity with the regulations specified for the district in which it is located.
1.4.2 Exemptions
(A) In accordance with NC General Statutes 160A-392, the City of Boiling Spring Lakes UDO applies to state-owned lands only when a building is involved.
Section 1.5 Relationship to Other Ordinances
(A) It is not intended that this Ordinance repeal, abrogate, annul, impair, or interfere with any existing easements, covenants, deed restrictions, agreements, vested rights, or building permits previously adopted or issued pursuant to law and currently effective.
(B) Where any proposed development activity requires approvals or permits from other agencies, including federal, state, or other local agencies, all development approvals or permits issued pursuant to this Ordinance shall be conditional upon the issuance of said approvals or permits and evidence of such shall be provided to the UDO Administrator prior to issuance of a Certificate of Zoning Compliance or Certificate of Occupancy for the proposed development activity.
Section 1.6 Severability
If any section or specific provision or standard of this Ordinance or any regulating district boundary arising from it is found by a court to be invalid for any reason, the decision of the court shall not affect the validity of any other section, provision, standard, or district boundary of these regulations except the provision in question. The other portions of these regulations not affected by the decision of the court shall remain in full force and effect.
Should any section or provision of this Ordinance be decided by a court of competent jurisdiction to be unconstitutional or invalid, such decision shall not affect the validity of the Ordinance as a whole or any part thereof other than the part so declared to be unconstitutional or invalid.
Section 1.7 Interpretation and Conflict
In interpreting and applying the provisions of this Ordinance, they shall be held to be the minimum requirements for the promotion of the public safety, health, convenience, prosperity, and general welfare. When provisions of this Ordinance are in conflict with any other provision or regulation contained herein then the more restrictive provision shall govern.

Section 1.8 Identification of Official Zoning Map
(A) The Zoning Map shall be identified by the signature of the Mayor attested by the City Clerk and bearing the seal of the City under the following words: This is to certify that this is the Official Zoning Map of the Unified Development Ordinance, Boiling Spring Lakes, North Carolina.
(B) If, in accordance with the provisions of this Ordinance, changes are made in district boundaries or other matter portrayed on the Zoning Map, such changes shall be entered on the Zoning Map promptly after the amendment has been approved by the Board of Commissioners, with an entry on the Zoning Map denoting the date of amendment, description of amendment, and signed by the City Clerk.
Section 1.9 Zoning Map Interpretation
Where uncertainty exists as to the boundaries of any district shown on the Official Zoning Map, the UDO Administrator shall employ the following rules of interpretation.
(A) Centerline. Where a boundary line lies within and follows a street or alley right-of-way, a railroad right-of-way, or utility easement, the boundary shall be construed to be in the center of such street or alley right-of-way, railroad right-of-way, or utility easement. If such a street or alley right-of-way, railroad right-of-way, or utility easement forming the boundary between two separate zoning districts is abandoned or removed from dedication, the district boundaries shall be construed as following the centerline of the abandoned or vacated road bed or utility easement
(B) Edge Line. Where a boundary line follows the edge of a street or alley right-of-way, a railroad right-of-way, or utility easement, the boundary shall be construed to be on the edge of such street or alley right-of-way, railroad right-of-way, or utility easement. If such a street or alley right-of-way, railroad right-of-way, or utility easement forming the boundary between two separate zoning districts is abandoned or removed from dedication, the district boundaries shall be construed as following the centerline of the abandoned or vacated road bed or utility easement.
(C) Lot Line. Boundaries indicated as approximately following lot lines shall be construed as following such lot lines. In the event that a district boundary line divides a lot or tract, each part of the lot or tract so divided shall be used in conformity with the regulations established by this Ordinance for the district in which said part is located. A change in lot line shall not be construed to have modified a zoning district boundary.
(D) City Limits. Boundaries indicated as approximately following City limits shall be construed as following the City limits.
(E) Watercourses. Boundaries indicated as approximately following the centerlines of streams, rivers, canals, lakes, or other bodies of water shall be construed to follow such centerlines.

Page 1-5
(F) Extensions. Boundaries indicated as parallel to or extensions of street or alley rights-of- way, utility easements, lot lines, city limits, county lines, or extraterritorial boundaries shall be so construed.
(G) Scaling. In the case where a district boundary does not coincide with any boundary lines as above and no distances are described by specific ordinance; the boundary shall be determined by the use of the scale appearing on the map.
(H) Where the UDO Administrator determines that physical features existing on the ground or actual property lines or other man-made boundary lines used to depict zoning district boundaries, are at variance with those shown on the Official Zoning Map, the UDO Administrator shall have the authority to interpret zoning district boundaries. Appeals of the decision of the UDO Administrator shall be reviewed by the Board of Adjustment.
Section 1.10 Interpreting Permitted Uses
If a use is not specifically listed in any of the districts listed in this Ordinance, then such use shall be regulated as the use determined by the UDO Administrator to be most similar.
Section 1.11 Transitional Provisions
1.11.1 Effective Date
These regulations shall become effective on June 5, 2018 and as subsequently amended.
1.11.2 Violations Continue
Any violation of the previous zoning ordinance or subdivision regulations shall continue to be a violation under this ordinance and any other applicable ordinances, laws, or statutes. Violations of this ordinance shall be subject to the penalties set forth herein, and any other applicable ordinances, laws, or statutes, unless the use, development, construction, or other activity complies with the express terms of this ordinance.

(B) All persons who intend to present evidence to the Board of Adjustment shall be sworn in by the Chairman, any member acting as the Chairman, the clerk or secretary to the board, or any notary public. Persons with religious objections may affirm rather than swear the oath. Any person who, while under oath during a proceeding before the board of adjustment, willfully swears falsely is guilty of a Class 1 misdemeanor.
(C) All findings and conclusions necessary to the issuance or denial of the requested permit or appeal (necessary findings) shall be based upon reliable evidence. Competent evidence (evidence admissible in a court of law) shall be preferred whenever reasonably available, but in no case may necessary findings be based solely upon incompetent evidence unless competent evidence is not reasonably available, the evidence in question appears to be particularly reliable, and the matter at issue is not seriously disputed.

(A) In response to questions or comments by persons appearing at the hearing or to suggestions or recommendations by the Board of Adjustment, the applicant may agree to modify his application, including the plans and specifications submitted.
(B) Unless such modifications are so substantial or extensive that the board cannot reasonably be expected to perceive the nature and impact of the proposed changes without revised plans before it, the board may approve the application with the stipulation that the permit will not be issued until plans reflecting the agreed upon changes are submitted to the UDO Administrator.
Section 3.22 Written Decision

The Board of Commissioners may amend, repeal, supplement or change the text regulations and zoning district lines according to the following procedures:
4.1.1 Application by the Applicant
(A) Initiation of Amendment.

(B) Fee. The fee established in the City's fee schedule shall be paid to the City for each application for an amendment to cover the cost of advertising and other administrative expenses involved.
4.1.2 Application Procedures
Any application for an amendment to the text of this Ordinance or the zoning map shall be filed with the UDO Administrator or other employee designated by the City Manager at least forty-five (45) days prior to the date on which it is to be introduced to the Planning Board.

ADMINISTRATIVE REVIEW PROCESS
Page 4-3
(2) The applicant's interest in the property and the existing and proposed zoning district classification.
(3) A diagram or detailed description of the property proposed for rezoning describing in reasonable detail:
(a) The location of all existing structures on the property.
(b) The existing land uses associated with the property.
(c) The zoning classification of all abutting zoning districts.

(5) A statement of justification regarding the changing conditions in the area or in the City, generally that makes the proposed amendment necessary to the promotion of the public health, safety, and general welfare, or that identifies an obvious error in the zoning map based upon the zoning classification or current land use of surrounding properties.
(6) A statement of justification that substantiates that the proposed amendment would support one (1) or more of the stated objectives of the Land Use Plan and any other officially adopted plan.
(7) A metes and bounds description and map of the proposed zoning district boundary, prepared by a surveyor registered in North Carolina, if the area of the proposed rezoning does not follow existing parcel lines.
4.1.3 Written Recommendations
All proposed amendments to the text of this Ordinance, including amendments to the zoning map, shall be reviewed by the Planning Board and a written recommendation shall be prepared in accordance with NCGS 160A-383. If no written report is received from the Planning Board within forty-five (45) days of referral of the amendment to that board, the Board of Commissioners may proceed in its consideration of the amendment without the Planning Board report. The Planning Board shall advise and comment on whether the proposed amendment is consistent with any comprehensive plan that has been adopted and any other officially adopted plan that is applicable. The Planning Board shall provide a written recommendation to the Board of Commissioners that addresses plan consistency and other matters as deemed appropriate by the Planning Board, but a comment by the Planning Board that a proposed amendment is inconsistent with the comprehensive plan
ARTICLE 4.
ADMINISTRATIVE REVIEW PROCESS
Page 4-4
shall not preclude consideration or approval of the proposed amendment by the Board of Commissioners.
Prior to adopting or rejecting any zoning amendment, the Board of Commissioners shall adopt a statement in accordance with NCGS 160A-383 describing whether its action is consistent with an adopted comprehensive plan and explaining why the board considers the action taken to be reasonable and in the public interest. Amendment to the comprehensive plan shall be necessary if any action taken is specifically inconsistent with the plan. Notification of the comprehensive plan amendment must be in accordance with NCGS 113A-110(e), which requires a public hearing and 30 day review period.
Such consistency statement is not subject to judicial review. A member of the Board of Commissioners shall not vote on any zoning map or text amendment where the outcome of the matter being considered is reasonably likely to have a direct, substantial, and readily identifiable financial impact on the member. Members of appointed boards providing advice to the Board of Commissioners shall not vote on recommendations regarding any zoning map or text amendment where the outcome of the matter being considered is reasonably likely to have a direct, substantial and readily identifiable impact on the member.
4.1.4 Required Public Hearing
A public hearing shall be held by the Board of Commissioners before adoption, amendment, or repeal of any amendment to the text of this Ordinance or the zoning map. Notice of such hearing shall be provided as required or as authorized under NCGS 160A-364 and/or NCGS 160A-384, or as may be from time to time amended. The property will also be posted with a sign indicating a zoning map amendment is pending in accordance with NCGS 160-384(c). Where multiple parcels are included with a proposed zoning map amendment, a posting of each parcel is not required but the City shall post sufficient notices to provide reasonable notice to interested persons. The posting of signs shall be done initially no more than twenty-five (25) days and no less than ten (10) days prior to the date of the public hearing.
Except where an alternative to mail notice is used as provided for under NCGS 160A-384(b), the owner of a property proposed for a zoning change and all property owners located within one hundred (100) feet of a property shall be mailed a notice by first class mail specifying the time, place and subject of the public hearing to be conducted by the Board of Commissioners at least ten (10) and not more than twenty-five (25) days prior to such hearing. Following such hearing, the Board of Commissioners may change the existing zoning classification covered by the application, or any part or parts thereof, to the classification requested, or to a different classification or classifications of the same fundamental character as contained in the notice after considering the debate and discussion occurring at the hearing without the necessity of withdrawal or modification.
Except for a City-initiated zoning map amendment, when an application is filed to
ARTICLE 4.
ADMINISTRATIVE REVIEW PROCESS
Page 4-5
request a zoning map amendment and that application is not made by the owner of the parcel of land to which the amendment would apply, the applicant shall certify to the Board of Commissioners that the owner of the parcel of land as shown on the county tax listing has received actual notice of the proposed amendment and a copy of the notice of public hearing. The person or persons required to provide notice shall certify to the Board of Commissioners that proper notice has been provided in fact, and such certificate shall be deemed conclusive in the absence of fraud.
4.1.5 Resubmittal
Once a zoning amendment or modification has been presented to the Planning Board and the Board of Commissioners for consideration and a public hearing has been held, if the proposed modification has failed to pass, the issue may not be submitted for reconsideration until six (6) months has passed from the date the proposal was denied by the Board of Commissioners. Provided, however, if there has been a zoning change on contiguous or adjacent property, or the expansion of infrastructure that will serve the property within the immediate future, the board may consider a zoning amendment within the six-month period. A change in ownership of the affected land shall not be considered a cause for reapplication.
Section 4.2 Vested Rights Provisions
4.2.1 Purpose
The purpose of this section is to implement the provisions of GS 160A-385.1 pursuant to which a statutory zoning vested right is established upon the approval of a site-specific development plan.
4.2.2 Establishment of a Zoning Vested Right
(A) A hearing to establish a zoning vested right may be requested by any landowner, and such right shall be deemed established upon the valid approval or conditional approval of a site-specific development plan by the Board of Commissioners after normal approval procedures for the specific type of approval have concluded and following notice and public hearing.
(B) The Board of Commissioners may approve a site-specific development plan upon such terms and conditions as may reasonably be necessary to protect the public health, safety and welfare and that follow the requirements set forth in the zoning and subdivision ordinances of the City.
(C) Notwithstanding subsections (A) and (B), approval of a site-specific development plan with the condition that a variance be obtained shall not confer a zoning vested
ARTICLE 4.
ADMINISTRATIVE REVIEW PROCESS
Page 4-6
right unless and until the necessary variance is obtained.
(D) The establishment of a zoning vested right shall not preclude the application of overlay zoning that imposes additional requirements but does not affect the allowable type or intensity of use, or ordinances or regulations that are general in nature and are applicable to all property subject to land-use regulations by the City, including but not limited to, building, fire, plumbing, electrical and mechanical codes. Construction shall comply with the building code in effect on the date of the first inspection, and not the code in effect on the date the vested right is secured. Otherwise applicable new or amended regulations shall become effective with respect to property that is subject to a site-specific development plan upon the expiration or termination of the vested right in accordance with this article.
(E) A zoning vested right is not a personal right, but shall attach to and run with the applicable property. After approval of a site-specific development plan, all successors to the original landowner shall be entitled to exercise such right while applicable.
4.2.3 Approval Procedures and Approval Authority
(A) Except as otherwise provided in this section, an application for site-specific development plan approval shall be processed in accordance with the procedures established by this Ordinance and shall be considered by the designated approval authority for the specific type of zoning or land use permit or approval for which application is made.
(B) In order to obtain a zoning vested right hereunder, the applicant must set forth in writing at the time of the application, on a form to be provided by the City, that the applicant seeks a zoning vested right. All applications for zoning vested rights shall be considered by the Board of Commissioners after normal approval procedures for the specific type of approval have concluded and following notice and a quasi-judicial public hearing irrespective of whether prior approval procedures required such notice and hearing.
(C) Each map, plat, site plan or other document evidencing a site-specific development plan shall contain the following notation: "Approval of this plan pursuant to Section 4.2 of the City of Boiling Spring Lakes Unified Development Ordinance established a zoning vested right under G.S. 160A-385.1. Unless terminated at an earlier date, the zoning vested right shall be valid until (date)."
(D) Following proper approval or conditional approval of a site-specific development plan, nothing in this article shall exempt such a plan from subsequent reviews and approvals to ensure compliance with the terms and conditions of the original
ARTICLE 4.
ADMINISTRATIVE REVIEW PROCESS
Page 4-7
approval, provided that such reviews and approvals are not inconsistent with the original approval.
(E) Nothing in this article shall prohibit the revocation of the original approval or other remedies for failure to comply with applicable terms and conditions of the approval or the zoning ordinance.
4.2.4 Duration
(A) A zoning right that has been vested as provided in this article shall remain vested for a period of two (2) years unless specifically and unambiguously provided otherwise pursuant to subsection (B) or (C). This vesting shall not be extended by any amendments or modification to a site-specific development plan except as provided in this Section.
(B) Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (A), the Board of Commissioners may provide that rights shall be vested for a period exceeding two (2) years but not exceeding five (5) years where warranted in light of all relevant circumstances, including but not limited to, the size of the development, the level of investment, the need for or desirability of the development, economic cycles and market conditions. These determinations shall be in the sound discretion of the approval authority at the time the site-specific development plan is approved.
(C) Notwithstanding the provisions of subsections (A) and (B), a zoning right that has been vested pursuant to this Section for a multi-phased development shall be vested for the entire development with the regulations herein in place at the time a development plan approval is granted for the initial phase of the multi-phased development. A right which has been vested as provided for in this subsection shall remain vested for a period of seven years from the time a development plan approval is granted for the initial phase of the multi-phased development.
(D) Upon issuance of a building permit, the expiration provisions of NCGS 160A-418 and the revocation provisions of NCGS 160A-422 shall apply.
4.2.5 Termination
A zoning right that has been vested as provided in this article shall terminate:
(A) At the end of the applicable vesting period with respect to buildings and uses for which no valid building permit applications have been filed;
(B) With the written consent of the affected landowner;
ARTICLE 4.
ADMINISTRATIVE REVIEW PROCESS
Page 4-8
(C) Upon findings by the UDO Administrator, by ordinance after notice and public hearing, that natural or manmade hazards on or in the immediate vicinity of the property, if uncorrected, would pose a serious threat to the public health, safety and welfare if the project were to proceed as contemplated in the site-specific development plan;
(D) Upon payment to the affected landowner of compensation for all costs, expenses and other losses incurred by the landowner, including but not limited to, all fees paid in consideration of financing, and all architectural, planning, marketing, legal and other consultant's fees incurred after approval by the city, together with interest thereon at the legal rate until paid. Compensation shall not include any diminutive in the value of the property which is caused by such action;
(E) Upon finding by the UDO Administrator, by ordinance after notice and a hearing, that the landowner or his representative intentionally supplied inaccurate information or made material misrepresentations which made a difference in the approval by the approval authority of the site-specific development plan; or
(F) Upon the enactment or promulgation of a state or federal law or regulation that precludes development as contemplated in the site-specific development plan, in which case the approval authority may modify the affected provisions, upon a finding that the change in state or federal law has fundamental effect on the plan, by ordinance after notice and a hearing.
4.2.6 Voluntary Annexation
A petition for annexation filed with the City shall contain a signed statement declaring whether or not any zoning vested right with respect to the properties subject to the petition has been established under GS 160A-385.1 or GS 153A-344.1. A statement that declares that no zoning vested right has been established under GS 160A-385.1 or GS 153A-344.1, or the failure to sign a statement declaring whether or not a zoning vested right has been established, shall be binding on the landowner and any such zoning vested right shall be terminated.
4.2.7 Limitations
Nothing in this article is intended or shall be deemed to create any vested right other than those established pursuant to GS 160A-385.1.
4.2.8 Repealer
In the event that GS 160A-385.1 is repealed, this article shall be deemed repealed and the provisions hereof no longer effective.
ARTICLE 4.

Section 4.3 Temporary Moratoria Procedures
North Carolina General Statute 160A-381(e) explicitly recognizes the authority of cities/towns to adopt temporary moratoria, except for the purpose of developing and adopting new or amended plans or ordinances as to residential uses. The duration of any moratorium shall be reasonable in light of the specific conditions that warrant imposition of the moratorium and may not exceed the period of time necessary to correct, modify, or resolve such conditions. Except in cases of imminent and substantial threat to public health or safety, before adopting an ordinance imposing a development moratorium with a duration of 60 days or any shorter period, the Board of Commissioners shall hold a public hearing and shall publish a notice of the hearing in a newspaper having general circulation in the area not less than seven days before the date set for the hearing. A development moratorium with a duration of 61 days or longer, and any extension of a moratorium so that the total duration is 61 days or longer, is subject to the notice and hearing requirements of G.S. 160A-364. Absent an imminent threat to public health or safety, a development moratorium adopted pursuant to this section shall not apply to any project for which a valid building permit issued pursuant to G.S. 160A-417 is outstanding, to any project for which a conditional use permit application has been accepted, to development set forth in a site-specific or phased development plan approved pursuant to G.S. 160A-385.1, to development for which substantial expenditures have already been made in good faith reliance on a prior valid administrative or quasi-judicial permit or approval, or to preliminary or final subdivision plats that have been accepted for review by the City prior to the call for public hearing to adopt the moratorium. Any preliminary subdivision plat accepted for review by the City prior to the call for public hearing, if subsequently approved, shall be allowed to proceed to final plat approval without being subject to the moratorium.
Any ordinance establishing a development moratorium must expressly include at the time of adoption each of the following:
(A) A clear statement of the problems or conditions necessitating the moratorium and what courses of action, alternative to a moratorium, were considered by the City and why those alternative courses of action were not deemed adequate.
(B) A clear statement of the development approvals subject to the moratorium and how a moratorium on those approvals will address the problems or conditions leading to imposition of the moratorium.
(C) An express date for termination of the moratorium and a statement setting forth why that duration is reasonably necessary to address the problems or conditions leading to imposition of the moratorium.
(D) A clear statement of the actions, and the schedule for those actions, proposed to be
ARTICLE 4.
ADMINISTRATIVE REVIEW PROCESS
Page 4-10
taken by the City during the duration of the moratorium to address the problems or conditions leading to imposition of the moratorium.
No moratorium may be subsequently renewed or extended for any additional period unless the City shall have taken all reasonable and feasible steps proposed to be taken by the City in its ordinance establishing the moratorium to address the problems or conditions leading to imposition of the moratorium and unless new facts and conditions warrant an extension. Any ordinance renewing or extending a development moratorium must expressly include, at the time of adoption, the findings set forth in subdivisions (A) through (D) of this subsection, including what new facts or conditions warrant the extension.
Any person aggrieved by the imposition of a moratorium on development approvals required by law may apply to the appropriate division of the General Court of Justice for an order enjoining the enforcement of the moratorium, and the court shall have jurisdiction to issue that order. Actions brought pursuant to this section shall be set down for immediate hearing, and subsequent proceedings in those actions shall be accorded priority by the trial and appellate courts. In any such action, the City shall have the burden of showing compliance with the procedural requirements of this subsection.
Section 4.4 Appeals, Variances, and Interpretations
4.4.1 Appeals
(A) An appeal from any final order or decision of the UDO Administrator may be taken to the Board of Adjustment by the City or by any person who has standing under NCGS 160A-393(d). An appeal is taken by filing with the City Clerk a written notice of appeal specifying the grounds therefor. A notice of appeal shall be considered filed with the Board of Adjustment when delivered to the City Clerk, who shall enter on it the date and time of filing.
(B) The owner or other party shall have 30 days from receipt of the written notice of the final order or decision of the UDO Administrator within which to file an appeal. Any other person with standing to appeal shall have 30 days from receipt from any source of actual or constructive notice of the decision within which to file an appeal. It shall be conclusively presumed that all persons with standing to appeal have constructive notice of the decision from the date a sign containing the words "Zoning Decision" or "Subdivision Decision" in letters at least six inches high and identifying the means to contact an official for information about the decision is prominently posted on the property that is the subject of the decision, provided the sign remains on the property for at least 10 days. Posting of signs is not the only form of constructive notice. Any such posting shall be the responsibility of the landowner or applicant. Verification of the posting shall be provided to the official who made the decision. Absent an ordinance provision to the contrary, posting of signs shall not be
ARTICLE 4.
ADMINISTRATIVE REVIEW PROCESS
Page 4-11
required.
(C) The UDO Administrator shall transmit to the Board of Adjustment all documents and exhibits constituting the record upon which the action appealed from is taken, and shall also provide a copy of the record to the appellant and to the owner of the property that is the subject of the appeal if the appellant is not the owner.
(D) An appeal stays all actions by the UDO Administrator seeking enforcement of or compliance with the order or decision appealed from, unless the UDO Administrator certifies to the Board of Adjustment in an affidavit that (because of facts stated in the certificate) a stay would, in his opinion, cause imminent peril to life or property or because the violation is transitory in nature, a stay would seriously interfere with enforcement of the ordinance. In that case, proceedings shall not be stayed except by a restraining order, which may be granted by a court. If enforcement proceedings are not stayed, the appellant may file with the UDO Administrator a request for an expedited hearing of the appeal, and the Board of Adjustment shall meet to hear the appeal within 15 days after such a request is filed. Notwithstanding the foregoing, appeals of decisions granting a permit or otherwise affirming that a proposed use of property is consistent with the ordinance shall not stay the further review of an application for permits or permissions to use such property; in these situations the appellant may request and the Board may grant a stay of a final decision of permit applications or building permits affected by the issue being appealed.
(E) The Board of Adjustment may reverse or affirm, wholly or partly, or may modify the order, requirement, decision, or determination appealed from and shall make any order, requirement, decision, or determination that in its opinion ought to be made in the case before it. To this end, the Board shall have all the powers of the officer from whom the appeal is taken.
(F) The UDO Administrator shall be present at the hearing as a witness. The appellant shall not be limited at the hearing to matters stated in the notice of appeal. If any party or the City would be unduly prejudiced by the presentation of matters not presented in the notice of appeal, the Board shall continue the hearing.
4.4.2 Variances
(A) An application for a variance shall be submitted to the Board of Adjustment by filing a copy of the application with the UDO Administrator or City Clerk, who shall enter on it the date and time of filing.
(B) When unnecessary hardships would result from carrying out the strict letter of this Ordinance, the Board of Adjustment shall vary any of the provisions of this Ordinance upon a showing of all of the following:
ARTICLE 4.
ADMINISTRATIVE REVIEW PROCESS
Page 4-12
(1) Unnecessary hardship would result from the strict application of the ordinance. It shall not be necessary to demonstrate that, in the absence of the variance, no reasonable use can be made of the property.
(2) The hardship results from conditions that are peculiar to the property, such as location, size, or topography. Hardships resulting from personal circumstances, as well as hardships resulting from conditions that are common to the neighborhood or the general public, may not be the basis for granting a variance.
(3) The hardship did not result from actions taken by the applicant or the property owner. The act of purchasing property with knowledge that circumstances exist that may justify the granting of a variance shall not be regarded as a self-created hardship.
(4) The requested variance is consistent with the spirit, purpose, and intent of the ordinance, such that public safety is secured, and substantial justice is achieved.
(C) In granting variances, the Board of Adjustment may impose such reasonable conditions as will ensure that the use of the property to which the variance applies will be as compatible as practicable with the surrounding properties, provided that the conditions are reasonably related to the variance..
(D) A variance may be issued for an indefinite duration or for a specified duration only.
(E) The nature of the variance and any conditions attached to it shall be entered on the face of the zoning permit, or the zoning permit may simply note the issuance of the variance and refer to the written record of the variance for further information. All such conditions are enforceable in the same manner as any other applicable requirement of this Ordinance.
(F) No change in permitted uses may be authorized by variance.
4.4.3 Requests to be Heard Expeditiously
The Board of Adjustment shall hear and decide all matters before it as expeditiously as possible, consistent with the need to follow regularly established agenda procedures, provide notice in accordance with Article 3, and obtain the necessary information to make sound decisions.
ARTICLE 4.
ADMINISTRATIVE REVIEW PROCESS
Page 4-13
4.4.4 Burden of Proof in Appeals and Variances
(A) When an appeal is taken to the Board of Adjustment in accordance with Section 4.4.1, the UDO Administrator shall have the initial burden of presenting to the board sufficient evidence and argument to justify the order or decision appealed from. The burden of presenting evidence and argument to the contrary then shifts to the appellant, who shall also have the burden of persuasion.
(B) The burden of presenting evidence sufficient to allow the Board of Adjustment to reach the conclusions set forth in Section 4.4.2(B), as well as the burden of persuasion on those issues, remains with the applicant seeking the variance.
4.4.5 Board Action on Appeals and Variances
(A) With respect to appeals, a motion to reverse, affirm, or modify the order, requirement, decision, or determination appealed from shall include, insofar as practicable, a statement of the specific reasons or findings of facts that support the motion.
(B) Before granting a variance, the board must take a separate vote and vote affirmatively (by a four-fifths majority) on each of the four required findings stated in Section 4.4.2(B). Insofar as practicable, a motion to make an affirmative finding on each of the requirements set forth in Section 4.4.2(B) shall include a statement of the specific reasons or findings of fact supporting such motion.
(C) A motion to deny a variance may be made on the basis that any one or more of the four criteria set forth in Section 4.4.2(B) are not satisfied or that the application is incomplete. Insofar as practicable, such a motion shall include a statement of the specific reasons or findings of fact that support it.
Section 4.5 Enforcement and Penalties
4.5.1 Complaints Regarding Violations
Whenever the UDO administrator receives a written, signed complaint alleging a violation of the Ordinance, he/she shall investigate the complaint, take whatever action is warranted, and inform the complainant in writing what actions will be taken.
4.5.2 Persons Liable
The owner, tenant, or occupant of any building or land or part thereof and any architect, builder, contractor, agent, or other person who participates in, assists, directs, creates, or maintains any situation that is contrary to the requirements of this Ordinance may be held
ARTICLE 4.
ADMINISTRATIVE REVIEW PROCESS
Page 4-14
responsible for the violation and suffer the penalties and be subject to the remedies herein provided.
4.5.3 Procedures upon Discovery of Violations
(A) If the UDO Administrator finds that any provision of this Ordinance is being violated, he/she shall send an initial written notice in accordance with Section 1-15 of the Citys Code of Ordinances to the person responsible for such violation, indicating the nature of the violation and ordering the action necessary to correct it. The initial notice must state that the violation shall be abated within 30 days of receipt of such notice. If mailed, the receipt of notice shall be computed beginning three (3) days after postmark. Such time may be extended by the UDO Administrator if evidence of pursuit of compliance is provided by the persons liable. Such reasons may include scheduling of contractors to abate the violation or similar conflicts in which 30 days does not allow for compliance. In no case shall the person liable be granted an extension of more than 90 days. Additional written notices may be sent at the UDO Administrators discretion.
(B) The final written notice (and the initial written notice may be the final notice) shall state what action the UDO Administrator intends to take if the violation is not corrected and shall advise that the administrators decision or order may be appealed to the Board of Adjustment in accordance with Section4.4.1. All final notices must require a violation be corrected within 15 days of receipt of such notice or a civil penalty may be incurred in accordance with Section 1-15 of the Citys Code of Ordinances to the person responsible for such violation. If mailed, the receipt of notice shall be computed beginning three (3) days after postmark. Each day's continuing violation of any provision of this ordinance shall be a separate and distinct offense.
(C) Notwithstanding the foregoing, in cases when delay would seriously threaten the effective enforcement of the Ordinance or pose a danger to the public health, safety, or welfare, the administrator may seek enforcement without prior written notice by invoking any of the penalties or remedies authorized in Section 4.5.4.
4.5.4 Penalties and Remedies for Violations
(A) Violations of the provisions of this Ordinance or failure to comply with any of its requirements, including violations of any conditions and safeguards established in connection with grants of variances or conditional use permits, shall be punishable by a civil penalty in accordance with the fee schedule as established by the Board of Commissioners and amended from time to time. The minimum fee for any violation not otherwise stated is $50. Civil penalties are due and payable within three (3) business days after service of a civil citation is complete. Each day's penalty for a

Section 5.6 Dimensional Requirements
Section 5.6.1 Required Yards and Building Setback Exceptions
(A) The minimum yards, setbacks, or other open spaces required by this Ordinance for each and every building shall not be encroached upon by a building or considered as meeting the yard and open space requirements of any other building. Required yards and setback distances shall be measured from the property line or street right-of-way line to the nearest portion of any building or structure foundation/footprint, excluding:
(1) For side yard the outermost four feet of any eave, gutter, canopy, or similar fixture.
(2) A deck or patio if no portion of the same extends more than 2 inches above grade, not to extend within five (5) feet of any lot line.
(3) Any structure that is a mere appendage to a building, such as a flagpole or fountain.
(4) Fences.
Section 5.6.2. Through Lots (Double Frontage) and Corner Lots
(A) In the case of through lots (also referred to as double frontage lots), the lot shall be considered to have two front lot lines on each street frontage.
(B) For corner lots, the side having the shortest street frontage is considered the front for setback purposes. The UDO Administrator may waive this requirement and determine the front yard to be on the street front that is in line with the prevailing pattern of front yards on the street in order to be consistent with the established pattern of the street.
Section 5.6.3 Height Limit Exemptions
Except as may otherwise be prohibited by the FAA regulations, the height limitations of this Ordinance shall not apply to public buildings, church spires, belfries, cupolas, and domes not intended for residential purposes, or to monuments, water towers, observation towers, power transmission towers, telecommunication towers, silos, grain elevators, chimneys, smokestacks, derricks, conveyors, flag poles, radio, masts, aerials, and similar structures, provided the structures meet the required State Building Code.
Section 5.6.4 Lot Coverage
(A) In determining the percentage of building coverage permitted on a lot, the ground floor area of the dwelling, roofed porches, carports, garages, accessory buildings, and all impervious surfaces shall be included.
(B) Not more than 30% of total lot area may be covered by impervious surfaces. This percentage may be exceeded with a solution prepared and sealed by a North Carolina Professional Engineer that meets the intent of the Stormwater Ordinance and is approved by the UDO Administrator.

Section 7.17 Traffic Impact Study
7.17.1 Purpose
A traffic impact study shall be required for any non single-family or two-family residential use generating more than 1,500 trips per day, as defined by the American Association of State Highway Officials (AASHTO). The study will enable the City of Boiling Spring Lakes to assess the impact of a proposed development on the highway system when that system is at or near capacity or a safety problem exists. Its purpose is to insure that proposed developments do not adversely affect the highway network and to identify any traffic problems associated with access from the site to the existing transportation network. The purpose of the study is also to identify solutions to potential problems and to present improvements to be incorporated into the proposed development.
7.17.2 Conduct
A traffic impact study shall be prepared by a qualified professional traffic engineer and/or certified transportation planner with previous traffic study experience. The procedures and standards for the traffic impact study are set forth in Section 7.7.5 of this Article. The traffic impact study shall be referred to NCDOT for review and comment.
Prior to the preparation of a traffic impact study, a scoping meeting shall be held, including the planning staff, the applicant, and the preparer of the study. The discussion at this meeting should set the study parameters, including the study area, planned and committed roadway improvements (by NCDOT or others), road links and intersections to be analyzed, preliminary traffic distribution, other planned developments to be considered, traffic growth rate, available data, periods for which analysis is to be performed, and other staff concerns. The qualifications of the preparer may be discussed at or prior to this meeting.
ARTICLE 7. DEVELOPMENT STANDARDS
7-25
7.17.3 Applicability
Except as described below, a traffic impact study shall be required for all development that meet the following criteria:
(A) Conditional Use Permit, Site Plan or Subdivision Plat Required. Estimated traffic generated by the development exceeds 1,500 trips/day.
Developments that produce more than 1,500 trips per day traffic may be exempted from the requirements to prepare and submit a traffic impact study if: (1) a traffic impact study has previously been prepared for this particular project or development, and (2) there is to be no change in land use or density that would increase travel, (3) there is to be no change in access to the external street system, or (4) material is submitted to demonstrate that traffic created by the proposal when adding to existing traffic will not result in a need for transportation improvements. The Board of Adjustment will review material submitted in support of an exemption and will determine from that material whether or not to grant the exemption. All exemptions shall be concurred with by the NCDOT District 3 Office. If an exemption is granted, documentation of the exemption will be submitted as part of the staff recommendation.
7.17.4 Capacity Analysis of the Existing System
An indication of the adequacy of the existing street system is a comparison of traffic volumes versus the ability of the streets to move traffic freely at a desirable speed. The ability of a street to move traffic freely, safely, and efficiently with a minimum delay is controlled primarily by the spacing of major devices utilized. Thus, the ability of a street to move traffic can be increased by restricting parking and turning movements, using proper sign and signal devices, and by the application of other traffic engineering strategies.
Capacity is the maximum number of vehicles which has a reasonable expectation of passing over a given section of roadway, during a given time period under prevailing roadway and traffic conditions. The relationship of traffic volumes to the capacity of the roadway will determine the level of service (LOS) being provided. Six levels of service have been selected for analysis purposes. They are given letter designations from A to F with LOS A representing the best operating conditions and LOS F the worst.
(A) LOS A. Describes primarily free flow conditions. The motorist experiences a high level of physical and psychological comfort. The effects of minor incidents of breakdown are easily absorbed. Even at the maximum density, the average spacing between vehicles is about 528 feet or 26 car lengths.
(B) LOS B. Represents reasonably free flow conditions. The ability to maneuver within the traffic stream is only slightly restricted. The lowest average spacing between vehicles is about 330 feet or 18 car lengths.
ARTICLE 7. DEVELOPMENT STANDARDS
7-26
(C) LOS C. Provides for stable operations, but flows approach the range in which small increases will cause substantial deterioration in service. Freedom to maneuver is noticeably restricted. Minor incidents may still be absorbed, but the local decline in service will be great. Queues may be expected to form behind any significant blockage. Minimum average spacings are in the range of 220 feet or 11 car lengths.
(D) LOS D. Borders on unstable flow. Density begins to deteriorate somewhat more quickly with increasing flow. Small increases in flow can cause substantial deterioration in service. Freedom to maneuver is severely limited, and the driver experiences drastically reduced comfort levels. Minor incidents can be expected to create substantial queuing. At the limit, vehicles are spaced at about 165 feet or nine car lengths.
(E) LOS E. Describes operation at capacity. Operations at this level are extremely unstable, because there are virtually no usable gaps in the traffic system. Any disruption to the traffic stream, such as a vehicle entering from a ramp, or changing lanes, requires the following vehicles to give way to admit the vehicle. This can establish a disruption wave that propagates through the upstream traffic flow. At capacity, the traffic stream has no ability to dissipate any disruption. Any incident can be expected to produce a serious breakdown with extensive queuing. Vehicles are spaced at approximately six car lengths, leaving little room to maneuver.
(F) LOS F. Describes forced or breakdown flow. Such conditions generally exist within queues forming behind breakdown points.
7.17.5 General Requirements and Standards
The traffic impact study shall contain the following information:
(A) General Site Description. The site description shall include the size, location, proposed land uses, number of units and gross square footage by land use, existing land use and zoning, construction staging, and completion date of the proposed land development to the extent known or able to be described at the time the application is prepared. If the development is residential, types of dwelling units and number of bedrooms shall also be included. A brief description of other major existing and proposed land developments within the study area shall be provided. The general site description shall also include probable socio- economic characteristics of potential site users to the extent that they may affect the transportation needs of the site (i.e., number of senior citizens).
(B) Transportation Facilities Description. The description shall contain a full documentation of the proposed internal and existing external transportation system. This description shall include proposed internal vehicular, bicycle, and pedestrian circulation; all proposed ingress and egress locations; all internal roadway widths and rights-of-way, turn lanes, parking conditions, traffic channelizations; and any traffic signals or other intersection control devices at all intersections within the site.
ARTICLE 7. DEVELOPMENT STANDARDS
7-27
The report shall describe the entire external roadway system within the study area. Major intersections in the study area and all intersections or driveways adjacent to or within 800 feet of the site shall be identified and sketched. All existing and proposed public transportation services and facilities within one-mile of the site shall also be documented. Future highway improvements, including proposed construction and traffic signalization, shall be noted. All proposed traffic signals shall be approved by the NCDOT District 3 Office. This information shall be obtained from North Carolinas Transportation Improvement Program and the Boiling Spring Lakes Thoroughfare Plan. Any proposed roadway improvements due to proposed surrounding developments shall also be noted.
(C) Existing Traffic Conditions. Existing traffic conditions shall be documented for all roadways and intersections in the study area. This shall include documentation of traffic accident counts as recorded by the NC Department of Transportation District Engineers Office, City law enforcement, and the NC Highway Patrol. Existing traffic volumes for average daily traffic, peak highway hour(s) traffic, and peak development generated hour(s) traffic, if appropriate, shall be recorded. Manual traffic counts at major intersections in the study area shall be conducted, encompassing the peak highway and development generated hour(s), if appropriate, and documentation shall be included in the report. Existing average daily or peak-hour traffic counts made within one year of the study date may be used subject to the UDO Administrators approval. A volume/capacity analysis based upon existing volumes shall be performed during the peak highway hour(s) and the peak development generated hour(s), if appropriate, for all roadways and major intersections expected to be impacted by development traffic. Levels of service shall be determined for each signalized intersection or roadway segment analyzed above.
This analysis will determine the adequacy of the existing roadway system to serve the current traffic demand. Roadways and/or intersections experiencing levels of service E or F shall be noted as congestion locations (see Section 7.7.4).
(D) Transportation Impact of the Development. Estimation of vehicular trips to result from the proposed development shall be completed for the average weekday, the average daily peak hours of highway travel in the study area, and if appropriate, the peak hour of traffic generation by the development. Vehicular trip generation rates to be used for this calculation shall be obtained from an accepted source such as Trip Generation (Institute of Transportation Engineers, Fourth Edition, 1987 as amended). These development- generated traffic movements, as estimated, and the reference source(s) and methodology followed shall be documented. These generated volumes shall be distributed to the study area and assigned to the existing roadways and intersections throughout the study area. Documentation of all assumptions used in the distribution and assignment phase shall be provided. All average daily traffic link volumes within the study area shall be shown graphically. Peak hour turning movement volumes shall be shown for signalized and other major intersections, including all access points to the
ARTICLE 7. DEVELOPMENT STANDARDS
7-28
development. Pedestrian and bicycle volumes at school crossings and as otherwise applicable shall be reported. Any characteristics of the site that will cause trip generation to vary significantly from average rates available in published sources shall be documented, including such factors as diversion of passer-by traffic, internal capture, staggered work hours, or use of transit.
(E) Analysis of Transportation Impact. The total traffic demand that will result from construction of the proposed development shall be calculated. This demand shall consist of the combination of the existing traffic, traffic generated by the proposed development, and traffic due to other developments and other growth in traffic that would be expected to use the roadway at the time the proposed development is completed. If staging of the proposed development is anticipated, calculations for each stage of completion shall be made. This analysis shall be performed for average weekday traffic, the peak highway hour(s) and, if appropriate, peak development-generated hour(s) for all roadways and major intersections in the study area. Volume/capacity calculations shall be completed for all major intersections. It is usually at these locations that capacity is most restricted.
All access points and pedestrian crossings shall be examined for adequate sight distance and for the necessity of installing traffic signals. The traffic signal evaluation shall compare the projected traffic and pedestrian volumes to the warrants for traffic signal installation.
(F) Conclusions and Recommended Improvements. Levels of service for all roadways and signalized intersections serving 10% or more of peak-hour project traffic shall be reported. All roadways and/or signalized intersections showing a level of service below D in urban or developed areas or below C in rural areas shall be considered deficient, and specific recommendations for the elimination of these problems shall be listed. This listing of recommended improvements shall include, but not be limited to, the following elements: internal circulation design, site access location and design, external roadway and intersection design and improvements, traffic signal installation and operation including signal timing, and transit service improvements. All physical roadway improvements shall be shown on the site plan.
7.17.6 Submission and Implementation

PART IV LANDSCAPING, BUFFERS, AND TREE PROTECTION
Section 7.26 Objective
The governing body and advisory boards of the City of Boiling Spring Lakes recognize the importance of the contribution made to the community by the abundance of trees and vegetation. In fact, the present character of Boiling Spring Lakes is dependent largely upon the existing trees and plantings in both publicly- and privately-owned properties. It is this vegetation that gives the City an aesthetic appeal that contributes to its growth and economic prosperity. As economic growth occurs, the removal of this valued vegetation sometimes results, contributing to a depletion of a most valuable resource. The City feels it is necessary to both conserve and restore those valuable assets and declares the objective of this Ordinance to be as follows:
ARTICLE 7. DEVELOPMENT STANDARDS
7-33
(A) To encourage the conservation of existing trees and vegetation, when practicable;
(B) To provide visual and spatial buffering between adjoining and competing uses;
(C) To enhance the beautification of the City;
(D) To enhance property values and protect public and private investment;
(E) To preserve the identity and environment of the City;
(F) To provide a habitat for living things that might not otherwise occur in an urban environment;
(G) To ensure that planting areas are distributed within developing sites in a manner which will provide shade, buffer noise, and filter glare.
(H) To comply with the requirements of the Red Cockaded Woodpecker Habitat Conservation Plan.
Section 7.27 Applicability
(A) Tree preservation is required for all land, developed or undeveloped, within the City of Boiling Spring Lakes as specified in Section 7.29. No tree shall be removed, regardless of size, except for in compliance with this ordinance.
(B) Landscape plans and installation is required for all new development within the City of Boiling Spring Lakes except for the following:
(1) Single-family and two-family dwellings.
(2) Accessory Structures.
(3) Any enlargement of a principal building by less than 20% of its existing size provided such enlargement will not result in parking improvements.
(4) A change in principal use where such change would not result in a change in lot coverage, parking, or other site characteristics.
(5) The following site areas are required to be addressed in accordance with the provisions of this Section for all non-residential and multi-family uses:
(a) Street Yards
(b) Foundation Planting
ARTICLE 7. DEVELOPMENT STANDARDS
7-34
(c) Vehicular Surface Areas (Parking Lots)
(d) Bufferyards
(e) Screening for Dumpsters and Outdoor Storage Areas
Section 7.28 General Provisions

(B) The owners and their agents shall be responsible for protecting and maintaining all landscape materials in accordance with the landscape plan approved by the City.
(C) Provision for Other Uses. Up to 15% of the area to be landscaped may be covered with surfaces specifically intended to afford intensive use and enjoyment by employees or the public (such as walking paths, bench and table pads, etc.)
(D) It is encouraged that stormwater management systems be integrated into the landscaping plan.
(E) Minimum height and diameter at breast height (DBH = 4.5 feet above ground) at planting for the following planting categories/list shall be as follows:
(1) Canopy Trees. At the time of planting, the tree shall have a minimum 3 inch DBH with a height of 8 to 10 feet. Canopy trees shall be of a species having an average minimum height of 30 feet and a minimum mature crown spread of 20 feet.

(F) The City of Boiling Spring Lakes prefers to maintain existing trees in order to satisfy vegetation requirements and credit may be given for existing trees located between the proposed principle building and the street right-of-way. The retention of viable natural vegetation is encouraged when practicable. No credit shall be given for any tree which is unhealthy. Credit shall be given on a tree per tree basis or one to one ratio.
(G) Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section, nothing shall be planted adjacent to an approved driveway and street connection which would impede vision between a height of 2-1/2 and 10 feet in a triangular area formed by a diagonal line between a point on the driveway perimeter and the curb line or pavement edge of the street, 25 feet from where they intersect.
(H) Trees and Shrubbery in or along Streets and Sidewalks.
(1) Citizens may plant trees in front of their lots and along the sidewalks adjacent to their property under the supervision of the UDO Administrator, but no trees shall be planted in the streets, gutters, or ditches of the City. The UDO Administrator shall notify all persons having trees in front of their lots to have them properly trimmed either by a company engaged in the business of tree trimming or by the property owners themselves following acceptable pruning standards. During normal street right-of-way maintenance by the City, all City employees involved in trimming of trees shall operate under the direction of the UDO Administrator and in accordance with acceptable pruning standards. In addition, all other public service or utility companies shall also follow the guidelines for acceptable pruning standards and shall notify the City prior to maintenance within the jurisdiction.
ARTICLE 7. DEVELOPMENT STANDARDS
7-43
(2) The cutting, trimming, destruction, lopping of branches or mutilation in any manner of trees or shrubbery standing along, in or extending over the street right-of-way of any municipal or state maintained street by any person is hereby prohibited, except when done under the supervision and according to the direction of the UDO Administrator.
Section 7.29 Tree Preservation
(A) The purpose of this section is to protect, preserve, and enhance the forested character and natural resources of the City. The City finds that the presence of trees improves air quality, conserves energy, provides wildlife habitat, reduces soil erosion, enhances storm water retention and drainage, and preserves and enhances property values. The policy of the City is to balance the private property rights of landowners with the public health, safety, and welfare that is promoted by the existence and maintenance of all trees in the city.
(B) U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service restrictions. All applications for cutting or clearing will first be reviewed by the UDO Administrator or his/her designee, to determine if the subject parcel includes any lands identified by USFWS as required habitat for the Red Cockaded Woodpecker. If the property does fall within the designated woodpecker area, the owner/applicant must contact USFWS to obtain authorization to cut any trees or to clear the property.
(C) No tree containing a Red Cockaded Woodpecker nest, regardless of diameter, may be cut without the express written consent of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.
(D) For those properties not located in designated Red Cockaded Woodpecker habitat, and for properties within the woodpecker area that have secured written authorization from USFWS to proceed with tree removal, the following provisions of this section shall apply:
(1) Undeveloped parcels. A parcel of land that does not contain a principal structure or dwelling. Any tree with a DBH of up to and including 7.9 inches may be removed without a permit.
(2) Significant Trees. Any tree at least 24 inches in DBH, and dogwoods, live oaks, and American Hollies at least eight (8) inches DBH, anywhere on the site shall be considered protected, and must be preserved or their removal mitigated as in accordance with Section 7.29(E), regardless of location on the site, unless the trees are shown to be dead, dying or severely damaged or diseased as a result of natural factors.
(3) New construction
ARTICLE 7. DEVELOPMENT STANDARDS

(a) Clearing, fill, grade, and driveway permits must be obtained from the UDO Administrator before any land-disturbing activity commences.
(b) Before a Zoning Permit is issued, an up-to-date tree survey, plot plan, or site plan must be submitted and approved by the UDO Administrator or appropriate approval authority (Planning Board, Board of Adjustment, and/or Board of Commissioners). The plan must show the footprint for the principal structure, septic systems, detached buildings (sheds, garages) driveways, and all trees identified by species greater than 8 inches DBH. Any tree not being used as a Red Cockaded Woodpecker nest may be removed within fifteen (15) feet of the principal structure or the septic system and within five (5) feet of detached buildings (sheds, accessory structures, garages) and driveways subject to the provisions of this section. Significant trees, as defined herein, will require mitigation.
(4) Existing development
(a) Prior to issuance of a Tree Removal Permit, a site or plot plan (hand sketched if necessary) must be submitted showing the show the footprint for the principal structure, septic systems, detached buildings (sheds, garages) driveways, and trees proposed for removal. Any tree not being used as a Red Cockaded Woodpecker nest may be removed within fifteen (15) feet of the principal structure or the septic system and within five (5) feet of detached buildings (sheds, accessory structures, garages) and driveways subject to the provisions of this section. Significant trees, as defined herein, will require mitigation.
(E) Mitigation. The removal of any Significant Tree as defined by this Ordinance, must be mitigated in accordance with the following standards:
(1) The total diameter at breast height (DBH) of all significant trees proposed for removal shall be totaled. The resultant number of DBH inches to be removed must be planted back on the site with an appropriate number of the significant tree species type removed to replace the DBH of those trees removed. Lots with one and two-family dwellings (or proposed for such not as part of a major subdivision) shall only be required to mitigate 25% of the total DBH of significant trees removed. A minimum of one (1) significant tree of the same species removed shall be installed through mitigation.
(3) Any mitigation trees required as a result of the removal of Significant Tree(s) shall not be counted to meet the requirements of the street yard, buffers or interior parking requirements. These trees must be provided in addition to any tree required by this Ordinance.

Section 7.30 Landscaping Plan
(A) Landscaping plans shall contain the information outlined in Appendix B for submittal requirements.
Section 7.31 Street Yards
(A) A street yard shall be provided when adjacent to a street right-of-way, with a minimum depth of 50% of the required front or corner side yard as measured perpendicular to the street right-of-way, provided that no street yard in excess of 15 feet in depth shall be required. Street yards in excess of 5 feet shall not be required in C-1A districts.
(B) Planting requirements. One canopy tree per every 50 linear feet; one understory tree per every 20 linear feet of road frontage; 20 shrubs per 100 linear feet of road frontage. Where overhead utility lines are present, understory trees with a height of less than 30 feet at maturity should be used in place of the canopy tree requirement.
Section 7.32 Vehicular Surface Areas (Parking Lots)
(A) All vehicular surface areas containing more than ten spaces shall be landscaped in accordance with the following minimum standards:
(1) At least nine percent of the gross paved area of a parking facility shall be landscaped and located in the interior. For purposes of this section, interior shall mean the area within the parking facility curb or pavement and extensions that create a common geometric shape such as a square, rectangle-triangle.
(2) Trees and shrubbery planted pursuant to this section shall include at least one canopy tree for every seven parking spaces and a minimum of four shrubs. This requirement shall not be counted towards other landscape requirements contained herein except that retained trees located within the interior of the lot shall be counted towards meeting the minimum requirements.
(3) In support of the above, the following standards shall apply to interior plantings:
(a) All plantings shall be evenly distributed throughout the parking facility.
ARTICLE 7. DEVELOPMENT STANDARDS
7-46
(b) All interior plantings shall be curbed or otherwise physically protected. If not curbed, the interior planting shall be designed to accommodate stormwater.
(c) Consecutive parking spaces shall incorporate landscape peninsulas no more than 15 spaces apart and at least the ends of all parking rows. Peninsulas shall contain at least 100 square feet in area and at least eight feet in width, measured from back of curb/barrier to back of curb/barrier. When an island contains one or more canopy trees, the island must have at least 300 square feet of unpaved space per shade tree.

(B) Shape. The shape of the parcel of land dedicated for recreation and open space shall be sufficiently round or square to be usable for recreational activities such as softball, tennis,
ARTICLE 8.
SUBDIVISION REQUIREMENTS
Page 8-14
croquet, etc. Open space that is provided need not meet this requirement. Moreover, such lands should be linear in shape and so located as to provide for linkage between recreation and park areas, dwelling structures and other open space networks.
(C) Location. The dedicated recreation or park land shall be located so as to reasonably serve the recreation needs of the subdivision for which the dedication was made.
(D) Access. Public access to the dedicated land shall be provided either by adjoining street frontage or public easement at least twenty (20) feet in width.
(E) Usableness. The dedicated land shall be usable for recreation or passive open space; lakes may not be included in computing dedicated land area.
(F) Plans. Municipal and county plans shall be taken into consideration when evaluating land proposals for dedication.
8.11.7 Determination of Dedication
The procedures for determining whether the subdivider is to dedicate land shall be as follows:
(A) At the time of filing a preliminary plat for approval, the owner of the property shall as a part of such filing, indicate whether he desires to dedicate property for park and recreational purposes or provide payment in lieu of dedication as provided herein. If he desires to dedicate land for this purpose he shall designate the area on the preliminary plat as submitted.
(B) Where dedication is required, such dedication shall be shown upon the final plat submitted for approval. Open space covenants for private park or recreational facilities shall be submitted to the City prior to approval of the final plat and shall be recorded contemporaneously with the final plat.
8.11.8 Amount of Land Dedicated
The amount of land required to be dedicated shall be computed on the basis of the following formula:
(A) Area to be dedicated (in acres) = (.01) x (number of dwelling units or lots  whichever is greater)
8.11.9 Payments in Lieu of Dedication
(A) Any subdivider required to dedicate a recreation area pursuant to this Ordinance may, with the approval of the Board of Commissioners, make a payment in lieu of dedication or make a combination of land dedicated and payment.
(B) The payment in lieu of dedication shall be equal to the appraised value of the required acreage of land within the subdivision based on an appraisal prepared by a licensed appraiser and submitted by the developer. If the city disagrees with the
ARTICLE 8.
SUBDIVISION REQUIREMENTS
Page 8-15
submitted appraisal, it may have a second appraisal prepared. If the appraisals are within 15% of each other, the developers appraisal will be utilized to establish value. If the appraisals differ by more than 15%, the value will be based on the average of the two appraisals.
(C) Where a combination of land dedication and payments in lieu are approved, the subdivider shall be given a credit equivalent to the appraised value per acre of land dedicated for recreation purposes. The credit amount shall be determined by multiplying the number of acres to be dedicated by the appraised value per acre.
(D) If the total payment in lieu as determined above is larger than the credit amount, the subdivider shall pay the difference between the two amounts. If the credit amount is larger than the total payment in lieu as determined above, no additional payment in lieu is required. However, the subdivider may not transfer the excess credit from one subdivision to another.
(E) Upon approval by the Board of Commissioners, payment in lieu of dedication shall be made at the time of final subdivision plat approval or within one (1) year of approval of the preliminary subdivision plat, whichever occurs first. All monies received by the City pursuant to these requirements shall be used only for the acquisition and development of recreation, park, and open space sites to serve the residents of the development and the residents of the immediate area within which the development is located.
Section 8.12 Reservation of School Sites
When a preliminary subdivision plat is submitted for approval, in which according to the Comprehensive Plan a school site should be reserved, the Planning Board shall notify the County board of education that the subdivision has been submitted for approval and that under the ordinance a school site may be reserved therein. In reviewing the subdivision and giving approval thereto, the Planning Board shall consult the board of education in determining the exact size and location of any school site to be reserved therein. Before the preliminary plat of the subdivision is approved, the board of education shall determine whether or not it wishes to have a school site reserved in the subdivision. If the board of education wishes to have a school site reserved in the subdivision, the subdivision as finally approved shall reserve a school site of a size and location agreeable to the board of education and the Planning Board. The board of education shall then have eighteen (18) months beginning on the date of final plat approval of the subdivision within which to acquire the site. If the board of education has not either purchased or begun proceeding to acquire the site within eighteen (18) months after the subdivision is finally approved, the subdivider shall be immediately notified that he may proceed with the disposition of the land in question in accordance with the subdivision procedures and provisions of this Ordinance.

(M) Streets shall be laid out so as to intersect as nearly as possible at right angles, and no street shall intersect any other street at an angle less than 60 degrees. Intersections which cannot be aligned should be separated by a minimum length of 200 feet between survey center lines.
(N) Property lines at street intersections shall be round with a minimum radius of 20 feet. At an angle of intersection of less than 75 degrees, a greater radius may be required. Where a street intersects a highway, the design standards of the NCDOT, Division of Highways shall apply.
(O) Alternative street designs may be approved by the UDO Administrator with plans and street specifications prepared by a licensed professional engineer and reviewed by the appropriate TRC member(s). In no case shall right-of-way widths be less than 26 feet and pavement widths less than 20 feet.
Section 8.18 Street Standards  Private Streets
(A) Any private street within an attached dwelling or multi-family development must meet the design standards for public streets.
(B) Any private street within a minor residential subdivision must have a minimum right of way width of twenty (20) feet which includes the travel way and associated drainage facilities. Any underground utilities may be located within the road right of way or a separate utility right of way. NOTE: A private street within a minor residential subdivision may be required to provide a right of way of fifty (50) feet if the land and lots are arranged to allow the potential conversion of the road to a public road. If the lot arrangement, surrounding development pattern, zoning, and existing City plans indicate conversion is unlikely, the UDO Administrator may allow a private road to reduce the right of way width to no less than twenty (20) feet. Future development will not be permitted to use the private street and will be required to upgrade such to the public street standards outlined herein. For this reason, it is encouraged that a minimum fifty (50) right of way be provided.
(C) Lots for single family detached dwellings may be created with access to a private street provided that:
(1) No more than four (4) lots may have their sole access to the private street;
(2) A new private street shall not be an extension of any existing public or private street; and
(3) A new private street shall not be aligned with an existing public road in such a way as

may interfere with any planned extension of the public road.
(D) The intent of this subsection is primarily to allow the creation of not more than four (4) lots with frontage on a private street for single-family development. Therefore, the City may not approve any project served by a private street authorized by this subsection in which one (1) or more of the lots thereby created is intended for:
(1) Two-family or multi-family residential use, or
(2) Any other residential use or nonresidential use that would tend to generate more traffic than that customarily generated by four (4) single-family residences.
(E) To ensure that the intent of this subsection is not subverted, the UDO Administrator may, among other possible options, require that the approved plans show the types and locations of buildings on each lot or that restrictive covenants limiting the use of the subdivided property in accordance with this section be recorded before final plat approval.
(F) No final plat that shows lots served by private streets may be recorded unless the final plat contains the following notation: Further subdivision of any lot shown on this plat as served by a private street may be prohibited by the City of Boiling Spring Lakes Unified Development Ordinance.
(G) The recorded plat of any development that includes a private street shall clearly state that such road is a private street and must be accompanied by a private street maintenance agreement that is also recorded.

Section 9.6 Conditional Use Permit
9.6.1 Purpose and Applicability
This Ordinance provides for a number of uses to be located by right in each general zoning district subject to the use meeting certain area, height, yard, and off-street parking and loading requirements. In addition to these uses, this Ordinance allows some uses to be allowed in these districts on a conditional basis subject to issuance of a conditional use permit by the Board of Adjustment. The purpose of having the uses being conditional is to ensure that they would be compatible with surrounding development and in keeping with the purposes of the general zoning district in which they are located and would meet other criteria as set forth in this section.
9.6.2 Application Requirements
In the course of evaluating the proposed conditional use, the Board of Adjustment may request additional information from the applicant. A request for any additional information may stay any further consideration of the application by the Board of Adjustment.
No application shall be deemed complete unless it contains or is accompanied by all items listed in in the submission requirements in Appendix B for the respective plan type  Plot Plan, Minor Site Plan, or Major Site Plan  as provided herein. The application shall be subject to the thresholds establishing the applicability for each plan type as provided in this Article.
9.6.3 Review Process
(A) The UDO Administrator and Technical Review Committee shall review the conditional use permit plot/site plan for compliance with the UDO. The UDO Administrator may circulate the plan to relevant government agencies and officials for comments and recommendations.
(B) The TRC may, in its review, suggest reasonable conditions to the location, nature, and extent of the proposed use and its relationship to surrounding properties, parking areas, driveways, pedestrian and vehicular circulation systems, screening and landscaping, timing of development, hours of operation, and any other conditions the TRC may find appropriate. The conditions may include dedication of any rights-of-way or easements for streets, water, sewer, or other public utilities necessary to serve the proposed development.
(C) The TRC shall forward its comments to the Board of Adjustment.
9.6.4 Board of Adjustment Action
(A) Conditional use permit cases are quasi-judicial, and all witnesses are to be sworn in.
(B) Once the TRC has reviewed the proposed plan, the Board of Adjustment shall hold a hearing to consider the application. A quorum of the Board of Adjustment is required
ARTICLE 9.
DEVELOPMENT REVIEW PROCESS
Page 9-8
for this hearing. Notice of the hearing shall be subject to the requirements provided in Section 3.20.
(C) In approving an application for a conditional use permit, the Board of Adjustment may attach fair and reasonable conditions to the approval. The petitioner will have a reasonable opportunity to consider and respond to any additional requirements prior to approval or denial by the Board of Adjustment. In no instance shall any of these conditions be less restrictive than any requirements which would pertain to that particular development found elsewhere in a similar zoning district.
(D) The applicant has the burden of producing competent, material and substantial evidence tending to establish the facts and conditions which subsection 9.6.4(E) requires.
(E) The Board of Adjustment shall issue a conditional use permit if it has evaluated an application through a quasi-judicial process and determined that:
(1) The proposed use will have either a minimal effect or positive effect on the public health or safety.
(2) The use meets all required conditions and specifications of the UDO.
(3) The proposed use will have no material adverse effect on the value of adjoining or abutting properties unless the use is a public necessity.
(4) The proposed use is in harmony with the City Land Use Plan and/or other plans adopted by the Board of Commissioners.
(5) Adequate measures have been or will be taken to provide ingress and egress so designated as to minimize traffic congestion in the public streets.
9.6.5 Effect of Approval
If an application for a conditional use permit is approved by the Board of Adjustment, the owner of the property shall have the ability to develop the use in accordance with the stipulations contained in the conditional use permit.
9.6.6 Binding Effect
Any conditional use permit so authorized shall be binding to the property included in the permit unless subsequently changed or amended by the Board of Adjustment.
9.6.7 Change in Conditional Use Permit
Any request to materially change the conditional use permit once it has been issued shall constitute initiation of a new review procedure as provided herein.

(B) These flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains causing increases in flood heights and velocities and by the occupancy in flood prone areas of uses vulnerable to floods or other hazards.
11.1.3 Statement of Purpose
It is the purpose of this ordinance to promote public health, safety, and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions within flood prone areas by provisions designed to:
(A) Restrict or prohibit uses that are dangerous to health, safety, and property due to water or erosion hazards or that result in damaging increases in erosion, flood heights or velocities.
(B) Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities that serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction.
(C) Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural protective barriers, which are involved in the accommodation of floodwaters.

Section 12.1 Purpose
There are existing uses of land, structures, lots of record, signs, and site features (e.g., off-street parking, sidewalks, landscaping, lighting, signs, etc.) that were lawfully established before the effective date of this Ordinance or a subsequent amendment thereto, that now do not conform to standards and requirements of this Ordinance. Such uses, structures, lots, signs and site features are collectively referred to as nonconformities. The purpose and intent of this article is to allow nonconformities to continue to exist, but to regulate and limit their continued existence and expansion so as to bring them into conformity to the extent that is reasonably practicable.
12.1.1 Continuation  Minor Repairs and Maintenance Encouraged
(A) Continuation. Nonconformities are allowed to continue in accordance with the requirements of this article.
(B) Maintenance Allowed. Nonconformities are allowed and encouraged to receive minor repairs and routine maintenance that are necessary to maintain the nonconformity and its surroundings in a safe condition and to protect against health hazards.
(C) Strengthening Allowed. Nothing in this Ordinance shall prevent the strengthening or restoration to a safe or lawful condition of any part of any building or structure declared unsafe or unlawful by a duly authorized City official.
(D) Change of ownership/tenancy. No change of title or possession or right to possession of property involved with a nonconformity shall be construed to prevent the continuance of such nonconformity.
Section 12.2 Nonconforming Lots of Record
The City of Boiling Spring Lakes has many nonconforming lots of record. These lots were created prior to a change in the minimum lot size for the subdivision of land  primarily due to the need to provide larger lots for on-site septic systems. Because they are considered to be nonconforming does not render them unbuildable nor insinuate a loss of value. Simply, the conditions for which subdivision of land occurred in the past is no longer the same. These nonconforming lots  which do not meet the minimum lot size or lot width requirements for the zoning district in which they are located  are subject to the provisions below. These lots are primarily in residentially zoned areas of the City. NOTE: Please contact the Citys Zoning and Inspections department for specific questions about nonconforming lots.
12.2.1 Continuation
(A) Lots with Contiguous Frontage in One Ownership. When two or more adjoining lots with contiguous frontage are under common ownership, each less than 10,500 square feet, and the lots are nonconforming in terms of width or area, such lots shall be combined for development purposes to create one or more lots, each of which conforms to the applicable dimensional requirements of the district.
(B) Single Lot of Record in a Residential District. When a lot in a residential zoning district has an area or width which does not conform to the dimensional requirements of the
ARTICLE 12. NONCONFORMITIES
Page 12-3
district where it is located, but was of record as of the effective date of this ordinance, any use permitted in the zoning district within which the lot is located may be constructed, subject to compliance with setback standards and all other requirements of this ordinance.
(C) Single Lot of Record in a Nonresidential District. When a lot in a nonresidential district has an area or width which does not conform to the dimensional requirements of the district where it is located, but was of record as of the effective date of this ordinance, then development on the lot may be permitted, subject to compliance with all required setbacks, and all other applicable development and design standards.
Section 12.3 Nonconforming Uses
The lawful use of building or premises existing at the time of the adoption of this Ordinance may be continued although such use does not conform with the provisions of this Ordinance, and such a building may be reconstructed or structurally altered and nonconforming uses therein changed subject to the following regulations:
(A) Conversion. No nonconforming use shall be changed to another nonconforming use unless the use is determined by the UDO Administrator to be of equal or less intensity or density. A nonconforming use must continue to occupy the same lot or plot of land. In determining whether a nonconforming use is of equal or less intensity or density, the UDO Administrator shall consider:
(1) Anticipated traffic of each use
(2) Parking requirements of each use
(3) Anticipated number of persons on the premises of each use at a time of peak demand;
(4) The number of dwelling units
(5) Off-site impacts of each use, such as noise, glare, dust, vibration, or smoke.
(B) Extension and enlargement. A nonconforming use may be extended throughout any portion of a completed building that, when the use was made nonconforming by this Ordinance, was manifestly designed or arranged to accommodate such use. A nonconforming use may not be extended to additional buildings, new buildings, or to land outside the original building.
(C) The structural alterations made in a nonconforming use shall not result in enlargement unless the use therein is changed to a conforming use; provided, however, that nonconforming uses damaged by fire, explosion, tornado, earthquake, hurricane or similar uncontrollable cause, may be repaired or rebuilt within one hundred eighty (180) days of the date of such damage, but not thereafter.
(E) If a nonconforming use of land ceases for more than one hundred eighty (180) days, any further use of the land, building, or premises shall be of a use permitted within the zoning district for which it is located. This shall be construed to be mean that where a residential or nonresidential use in unoccupied for a period of more than one hundred eighty (180), then any further use of the premise shall be in accordance with the uses permitted within the zoning district for which it is located.
ARTICLE 12. NONCONFORMITIES
Page 12-4
Section 12.4 Nonconforming Structures
Where a lawful principal or accessory structure exists at the effective date of this Ordinance that could not be built under the terms of this Ordinance by reason of restrictions on area, lot coverage, height, yards or other characteristics of the structure or its location on the lot, such structure may be continued so long as it remains otherwise lawful, subject to the following provisions.
12.4.1 Replacement
(A) Residential Development. Nonconforming residential development subject to damage by fire, explosion, tornado, earthquake, hurricane or similar uncontrollable cause may be reconstructed in the same location and with the same footprint as existed prior to damage. In no instance shall replacement of a nonconforming residential structure increase the nonconformity or result in a larger structure than existed prior to damage.
(B) Nonresidential Development
(1) After Damage in Excess of 50 Percent of Building Value. In the event of damage by fire or other causes to an extent exceeding 50 percent of its building value prior to such damage, as established by the applicable County tax listing, reconstruction of a nonconforming structure shall be permitted only in compliance with the applicable dimensional requirements of this Ordinance.
(2) After Damage Less Than 50 Percent of Building Value. In the event of damage by fire or other causes to an extent not exceeding 50 percent of its building value prior to such damage, as established by the applicable County tax listing, reconstruction of a nonconforming structure shall be permitted, provided it is constructed:
(a) In accordance with a previously approved site plan or building permit, as applicable.
(b) In the same location and up to the same dimensions as originally existed.
(c) In compliance with the current dimensional requirements.
12.4.2 Enlargement and Relocation
(A) No such structure may be enlarged or altered in a way which increases its nonconformity.
(B) Should such a structure be moved for any reason for any distance whatever, it shall hereafter conform to the regulations for the district in which it is located after it is moved.
ARTICLE 12. NONCONFORMITIES

Section 12.5 Nonconforming Sites
(A) For purposes of this section, the term nonconforming site features includes the following:
(1) Nonconforming off-street parking
(2) Nonconforming sidewalks
(3) Nonconforming landscaping
(4) Nonconforming perimeter buffers
(5) Nonconforming screening walls or fences
(6) Nonconforming lighting.
(B) If an application is filed for a building permit (including mechanical, electrical, HVAC, or other typical permit) for the remodeling or expansion of a structure and the development site contains one or more nonconforming site features identified in Subsection (A) above, and the value of the proposed improvements totals at least 25 percent of the assessed value of the existing structure, the applicant shall be required to address the nonconforming site feature as provided in this section.
(C) For purposes of determining if upgrading of nonconforming site features is required by this subsection, the cost of the remodeling shall be as shown on the approved building permit application. Assessed value shall be based on the most recently available Brunswick County tax records.
12.5.1 Remodeling of Buildings or Structures
If a building permit is required for interior or exterior remodeling of the building or structure, the remodeling or redevelopment shall require correction of existing on-site nonconforming off-street parking, landscaping, perimeter buffer, screening, and signage in accordance with this section.
(A) 25 Percent or Less of Structure Value. Remodeling in any continuous one-year period that costs 25 percent or less of the current assessed value of the structure shall not require any correction to nonconforming site aspects.
(B) More Than 25 Percent but Less Than 75 Percent of Structure Value. Remodeling in any continuous one-year period that costs more than 25 percent but less than 75 percent of the current assessed value of the structure shall require that a corresponding percentage of the off-street parking, landscaping, perimeter buffer, screening, and signage standards of this Ordinance be installed or upgraded on the site, until the site achieves 100 percent compliance. Sidewalk installation, if applicable, is not required.
(1) Example: A hypothetical building is required to provide at least 40 off-street parking spaces, but the building site only includes 20 spaces. If the building is
ARTICLE 12. NONCONFORMITIES
Page 12-6
remodeled such that the cost of remodeling equals 30 percent of the buildings assessed value, the remodeling project must add 12 parking spaces (30% x 40 required spaces). This increases the developments degree of compliance with off-street parking standards from 50 percent (20 of 40 required spaces) to 80 percent (32 of 40 required spaces).
(C) 75 Percent or More of Structure Value. Remodeling projects that cost 75 percent or more of the current assessed value of the structure shall require 100 percent compliance with the off-street parking, sidewalk, landscaping, perimeter buffer, screening, and signage standards of this Ordinance.
(D) Five or Fewer Additional Parking Spaces. When five or fewer additional off-street parking spaces are required under this subsection as a result of a remodeling project, such additional off-street parking is not required to be installed.
12.5.2 Additions or Expansions
Additions and expansions to structures on nonconforming sites shall require correction of existing on-site nonconforming off-street parking, landscaping, perimeter buffer, screening, and signage standards in accordance with this section.
(A) Expansion of 50 Percent or Less of Gross Square Footage Over One Year. Expansions in any continuous one-year period, which result in a 50 percent or less increase in the gross square footage of the existing structure (measured at the beginning of the one-year period), require that a corresponding percentage of the off-street parking, landscaping, perimeter buffer, screening, and signage standards of this Ordinance be installed or upgraded on the site, until the site achieves 100 percent compliance. Sidewalk installation, if applicable, is not required.
(1) Example: if the addition is 25 percent of the area of the existing structure and the site contains only 50 percent of the required landscaping, 25 percent of the required landscaping for the entire site must be provided, thereby bringing the landscaping on the site to 75 percent of the total required. Existing landscaping on the site shall be retained or replaced but shall not count toward the required percentage of new landscaping.
(B) Expansion of Greater Than 50 Percent of Gross Square Footage Over One Year. Expansions over any continuous one-year period, which result in a greater than 50 percent increase of the gross square footage of the existing structure (measured at the beginning of the one-year period), require the entire property to meet all of the off-street parking, sidewalk, landscaping, perimeter buffer, screening, and signage standards of this Ordinance.
Section 12.6 Nonconforming Signs
Signs which were in existence prior to the effective date of this ordinance, which do not conform to the provisions of this article are declared nonconforming signs. It is the intent of this section to recognize that the eventual elimination, as expeditiously and fairly as possible, of
ARTICLE 12. NONCONFORMITIES
Page 12-7
nonconforming signs is as much a subject of health, safety and welfare as is the prohibition of new signs that would violate the provisions of this article. It is also the intent of this section that any elimination of nonconforming signs shall be effected so as to avoid any unreasonable invasion of established property rights.
12.6.1 General Nonconforming Sign Provisions.
(A) Any nonconforming sign may be continued in operation and maintenance after the effective date of this ordinance, provided that nonconforming signs shall not be:
(1) Changed to or replaced with another nonconforming sign, including changing the sign face (except on changeable copy signs).
(2) Structurally altered so as to extend their useful life.
(3) Expanded.
(4) Relocated.
(5) Reestablished after damage or destruction of more than 50 percent of the value at the time of such damage or destruction.
(6) Modified in any way that would increase the degree of nonconformity of such sign.
(7) Except in the case of expansion, this shall not prevent repairing or restoring to a safe condition any part of a sign or sign structure of normal maintenance operations performed on a sign or sign structure.
Section 12.7 Nonconformance Created by Change in Zoning Boundaries or Regulations
Any nonconformance created by a change in district boundaries or ordinance regulations after the effective date of this ordinance shall also be governed by the provisions of this Ordinance.
