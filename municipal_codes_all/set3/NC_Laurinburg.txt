PREFACE 
    This Code constitutes a recodification of the general and permanent ordinances of the City of Laurinburg, North Carolina. 
    Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the 1987 Code, as supplemented through June 19, 2001, and ordinances subsequently adopted by the city council. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this Code, the reader can locate any section of the 1987 Code, as supplemented, and any subsequent ordinance included herein. 
    The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order, and the various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Notes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state law have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this Code. 
Chapter and Section Numbering System 
    The chapter and section numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and local government codes. Each section number consists of two parts separated by a dash. The figure before the dash refers to the chapter number, and the figure after the dash refers to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the second section of chapter 1 is numbered 1-2, and the first section of chapter 6 is 6-1. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter, and at the same time new sections can be inserted in their proper place by using the decimal system for amendments. For example, if new material consisting of one section that would logically come between sections 6-1 and 6-2 is desired to be added, such new section would be numbered 6-1.5. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject. The next successive number shall be assigned to the new article or division. New chapters may be included by using one of the reserved chapter numbers. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. 
Page Numbering System 
    The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the volume. The number to the right of the colon represents the number of the page in that portion. In the case of a chapter of the Code, the number to the left of the colon indicates the number of the chapter. In the case of an appendix to the Code, the letter immediately to the left of the colon indicates the letter of the appendix. The following are typical parts of codes of ordinances, which may or may not appear in this Code at this time, and their corresponding prefixes:

Indexes 
    The indexes have been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the indexes themselves which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which the user is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
    A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up-to-date. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited, and the affected page or pages will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
    Keeping this publication up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. As revised pages are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
Acknowledgments 
    This publication was under the direct supervision of Jan Shekitka, Senior Code Attorney, and Leesa Hampton, Editor, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida. Credit is gratefully given to the other members of the publisher's staff for their sincere interest and able assistance throughout the project. 
    The publisher is most grateful to Dolores Hammond, City Clerk and J. Robert Gordon, City Attorney, for their cooperation and assistance during the progress of the work on this publication. It is hoped that their efforts and those of the publisher have resulted in a Code of Ordinances which will make the active law of the city readily accessible to all citizens and which will be a valuable tool in the day-to-day administration of the city's affairs.

(5)  Make other nonsubstantive changes necessary to preserve the original meaning of ordinance sections inserted into the Code, but in no case shall the codifier make any change in the meaning or effect of ordinance material included in the supplement or already embodied in the Code.

In such case, the general court of justice has jurisdiction under G.S. 160A-175 to issue such orders as may be appropriate, and it is declared by that section that it shall not be a defense to the application of the city for such equitable relief that there is an adequate remedy at law.

No permit for such work shall be issued until the commission approves the certificate of appropriateness. The certificate of appropriateness for such work is required whether or not a building permit or other permit is required. 
As specified in G.S. 160A-400.9(f) the requirement for a certificate of appropriateness is applicable to construction, alteration, moving and demolition by the State of North Carolina, its political subdivisions, agencies and instrumentalities, provided however they shall not apply to interiors of buildings or structures owned by the State of North Carolina.

Prior to the designation of any local historic landmarks, the commission shall prepare and adopt guidelines, not inconsistent with Part 3 Article 19 of Chapter 160A of the North Carolina General Statutes, for altering, restoring, moving, or demolishing property designated as landmarks. These guidelines shall ensure, insofar as possible, that changes in designated landmarks are in harmony with the special character of the landmark. 
(c)  Certain changes not prohibited. Nothing in this division shall be construed to prevent the ordinary maintenance or repair of any exterior architectural feature of a designated landmark that does not involve a change in design, materials, or outer appearance thereof; the ordinary maintenance or repair of streets, sidewalks, pavement markings, street signs, or traffic signs; the construction, reconstruction, alteration, restoration or demolition of any such feature that the building inspector shall certify is required by the public safety because of an unsafe or dangerous condition. Nothing in this division shall be construed to prevent the maintenance, or in the event of an emergency, the immediate restoration of any existing aboveground utility structure without approval of the commission. 
(d)  Minor works. After adoption of detailed standards by the preservation commission of detailed standards, the building inspector may review and approve applications for a certificate of appropriateness or of minor works as defined specified in the standards. 
(e)  Appeals. An appeal may be taken to the board of adjustment from the commission's action in granting or denying any certificate, which appeals (1) may be taken by any aggrieved party, (2) shall be taken within times prescribed by the historic preservation commission by general rule, and (3) shall be in the nature of certiorari. Any appeal from the board of adjustment's decision in any such case shall be heard by the superior court of the county in which the municipality is located. 
(Ord. No. O-2006-15, § 3, 10-24-2006) 
Sec. 2-163. - Enforcement and remedies. 
    The city building inspector shall enforce compliance with the terms of the certificate of appropriateness. Failure to comply with the certificate shall be a violation that is punishable in the same manner as a violation of the Unified Development Ordinance. 
    In case any landmark is about to be demolished, whether as a result of deliberate neglect or otherwise, materially altered, remodeled, removed or destroyed except in compliance with this division, the commission, the city council, or any other aggrieved party may institute any action or proceeding to prevent such unlawful action. 
(Ord. No. O-2006-15, § 4, 10-24-2006) 
Sec. 2-164. - Demolition delay. 
(a)  An application for a certificate of appropriateness authorizing demolition, removal, or destruction of a landmark may not be denied except as provided in subsection 2-164(c). However, the effective date of such a certificate may be delayed up to 365 days from the date of approval. The period of delay may be reduced if the commission finds that the owner would suffer extreme hardship or be permanently deprived of all beneficial use or return from such property by virtue of the delay. 
If the commission has voted to recommend designation of a property as a landmark, and final designation has not been made by the city council, the demolition or destruction of any building, site, or structure located on the property of the proposed landmark or in the proposed district may be delayed by the commission for a period of up to 180 days or until the city council takes final action on the designation, whichever occurs first. 
(b)  The city council may enact an ordinance to prevent the demolition by neglect of any designated landmark. Such ordinance shall provide appropriate safeguards to protect property owners from undue hardship. 
(c)  An application for a certificate of appropriateness authorizing the demolition of a designated landmark determined by the state historic preservation officer as having statewide significance as defined in the criteria of the National Register of Historic Places may be denied except where the commission finds that the owner would suffer extreme hardship or be permanently deprived of all beneficial use or return from such property by virtue of the denial.

To such end, the board shall have all the powers of the building inspector, but the concurring vote of four members of the board shall be necessary to reverse or modify any decision or order of the building inspector. The board shall also have power in passing appeals, when practical difficulties or unnecessary hardships would result from carrying out the strict letter of this article, to adapt the application of this article to the necessities of the case so that the spirit of this article shall be observed, public safety and welfare secured and substantial justice done.

Cross reference- Definitions generally, § 1-2. 
Sec. 36-32. - Purpose. 
(a)  The city finds that the development of cable television and communications systems has the potential of having great benefit and impact upon the people of the city. Because of the complex and rapidly changing technology associated with cable television, the city further finds that the public convenience, safety and general welfare can best be served by establishing regulatory powers which should be vested in the city or such persons as the city shall designate. It is the intent of this article and subsequent amendments to provide for and specify the means to attain the best possible public interest and public purpose in these matters and any franchise issued pursuant to this article shall be deemed to include this finding as an integral part thereof. 
(b)  It is further recognized that cable communications systems have the capacity to provide not only entertainment and information services to the city's residents, but can provide a variety of broadband, interactive communications services to institutions and individuals. Many of these services involve city agencies and other public institutions, by providing governmental, educational or health care communications. 
(c)  For such purposes, the following goals underlie the regulations contained in this article: 
(1)  Communications services should be provided to the maximum number of city residents. 
(2)  The system should be capable of accommodating both the present and reasonably foreseeable future communications needs of the city. 
(3)  The system should be improved and upgraded during the franchise term so that the new facilities necessary for the operation of the system shall be integrated, to the maximum extent possible, with existing facilities. 
(4)  The communications system authorized by this article shall be responsive to the needs and interests of the local community, and shall provide the widest possible diversity of information sources and services to the public. 
(Code 1987, § 6.5-21) 
Sec. 36-33. - Public notice. 
    Minimum public notice of any public meeting relating to this article or the franchise shall be by: 
(1)  Publication in a newspaper of general circulation in the area at least seven days prior to the meeting; 
(2)  Posting at city hall; 
(3)  Announcement on at least one local origination channel of the grantee's cable communications system between the hours of 11:00 a.m. and 9:00 p.m. for five consecutive days prior to the meeting.

(Code 1987, § 6.5-25) 
Secs. 36-35-36-60. - Reserved. 
DIVISION 2. - GRANT OF FRANCHISE 

Sec. 36-61. - Obligation; terms and conditions; conflicts. 
(a)  If the city shall grant to the grantee a nonexclusive, revocable franchise to construct, operate and maintain a cable communications system within the city, such franchise shall constitute both a right and an obligation to provide the services of a cable communications system as regulated by the provisions of this article and the franchise. The franchise shall include such provisions of the grantee's application for a franchise that are finally negotiated and accepted by the city and grantee. 
(b)  The franchise shall be granted under the terms and conditions contained in this division, consistent with the city's Charter and/or other applicable statutory requirements. In the event of conflict between the terms and conditions of this article and the franchise, or the terms and conditions on which the city can grant a franchise, this article or the laws of the state shall control. 
(c)  Any franchise granted by the city is hereby made subject to the general article provisions in effect, provided that any ordinance which is made effective or which is amended after the grant of a franchise shall not diminish the rights or increase the obligations of the grantee under such franchise. Nothing in the franchise shall be deemed to waive the requirements of the various codes and ordinances of the city regarding permits, fees to be paid or manner of construction. 
(Code 1987, § 6.5-41) 
Sec. 36-62. - Franchise area. 
    The franchise area shall be the entire city, or portions thereof, for which a franchise is granted. 
(Code 1987, § 6.5-42) 
Sec. 36-63. - Service area. 
(a)  The grantee shall offer full cable television service to all areas of the city which are within the corporate limits of the city as of the effective date of the franchise, in accordance with the timetable specified in the franchise. 
(b)  For new dwelling units within the corporate limits of the city, including all territories annexed by the city, the grantee shall extend full cable service within six months of the request in an area with a density equivalent to at least 20 dwelling units per mile. 
(c)  In other areas with less than 20 residential dwelling units per proposed mile, the grantee shall offer a cost sharing arrangement with residents. A dwelling unit will be counted for such purpose if its lot fronts a street. The cost sharing arrangement shall consist of the following: 
(1)  Upon the request of a subscriber desiring service, the grantee shall prepare, at its cost, an engineering survey and cost analysis to determine the cost of the plant extension required to provide service to the subscriber from the closest point on the cable system. 
(2)  The cost of construction shall be allocated based on the following formula: 
If a request for extension of service into a residential area requires the construction of a cable plant which does not pass at least 20 potential subscribers per mile, the grantee and subscribers will each bear their proportionate share of construction costs. For example, if there are ten dwelling units per mile, the grantee's share will equal 10/20 or one-half of the construction cost. The remaining cost will be shared equally by each subscriber. Such line extension formula shall also be applied to a portion of a mile meeting proportionate density requirements. For example, if there are ten dwelling units per one-half mile, the grantee shall construct the plant. Such cost sharing plan would be utilized if there were less than the proportionate share of dwelling units per the portion of a mile needed to reach the dwelling units. 
(3)  Subscribers utilizing the cost sharing plan for extensions shall be reimbursed pro rata for their contribution, or a proportional share thereof, should additional subscribers to the respective network extension request cable television service. In such case, the pro rata shares shall be recalculated and each new subscriber shall pay the new pro rata share, and all prior subscribers shall receive pro rata refunds. At such time as there are 20 potential subscribers per mile, the subscribers shall receive their pro rata share of construction costs. In any event, at the end of one year from the completion of a project, the subscribers are no longer eligible for refunds, and the amounts paid in construction costs will be credited to the plant account of the grantee. 
(4)  The average cost of line extension shall be recalculated annually and based upon the current costs for labor and materials at that time. 
(Code 1987, § 6.5-43) 
Sec. 36-64. - Use of public rights-of-way. 
    For the purpose of operating and maintaining a cable communications system in the city, the grantee may erect, install, construct, repair, replace, reconstruct and retain in, on, over, under, upon, across and along the public streets and ways within the city such wires, cables, conductors, ducts, conduits, vaults, manholes, amplifiers, appliances, pedestals, attachments and other property and equipment as are necessary to the operation of the cable communications systems; provided, however, that the grantee complies with all design, construction, safety and performance provisions contained in this article, the franchise and other applicable local ordinances and, provided that the cable communications system does not interfere with city streets or utilities. 
(Code 1987, § 6.5-44) 
Sec. 36-65. - Use of city's facilities. 
    At the city's option, the city may require a grantee to utilize city owned conduit or other facilities for any portion of its cable communications system. The consideration for the use of the city's conduit or other facilities shall be as stated in the franchise. A reasonable fee for the use of city facilities shall be established in the franchise and may be adjusted at the periodic performance evaluations. Such fee shall be substantially the same for all noncity users of city facilities. 
(Code 1987, § 6.5-45) 
Sec. 36-66. - Use of grantee's facilities. 
    No poles shall be erected by the grantee without prior approval of the city with regard to location, height, type and any other pertinent aspect, and such approval will not be unreasonably withheld. However, no location of any pole of the grantee shall be a vested right and such poles shall be removed or modified by the grantee, at its own expense, whenever the city determines that the public convenience would be enhanced thereby. The grantee shall utilize existing poles and conduits, where possible. The city shall have the right, during the life of the franchise, upon payment of make-ready costs to install and maintain free of charge upon the poles owned by the grantee, any wire and pole fixtures that do not unreasonably interfere with the cable system operations of the grantee. 
(Code 1987, § 6.5-46) 
Sec. 36-67. - Franchise required. 
    No cable communications system shall be allowed to occupy or use the streets of the city or be allowed to operate without a franchise. At the minimum, the franchise shall contain representations by the grantee that it: 
(1)  Accepts and agrees to all of the provisions of this article, and any supplementary specifications, as to construction, operation or maintenance of the system, which may be included in the franchise. 
(2)  Has examined all of the provisions of this article and waives any claims that any provision of this article is unlawful. 
(3)  Recognizes the right of the city to make reasonable amendments to this article or to negotiate amendments to the franchise during the term of the franchise, provided that no such change shall compromise the grantee's ability to satisfactorily perform its obligations or shall increase its obligations or diminish the grantee's rights under this article or the franchise, unless additional authority is granted to the city by federal law or rule. The city shall reasonably exercise such authority. If, under such authority, the grantee's fiscal obligations are increased beyond the obligations required for normal operations, the grantee shall be allowed to increase its rates proportionately. It further recognizes and agrees that the city shall in no way be bound to renew the franchise at the end of any franchise term, except as provided by applicable law. 
(4)  Acknowledges that its rights under this article are subject to the police power of the city to adopt and enforce general ordinances necessary to the safety and welfare of the public; and it agrees to comply with all applicable general laws enacted by the city pursuant to such power. 
(Code 1987, § 6.5-47) 
Sec. 36-68. - Term of franchise. 
    The term of any franchise granted pursuant to this division shall be stated in the franchise. 
(Code 1987, § 6.5-48) 
Sec. 36-69. - Franchise nonexclusive. 
    The franchise discussed in this division is nonexclusive. The city specifically reserves the right to grant at any time such additional franchises for a cable communications system as it deems appropriate. As allowed by law, all franchises granted by the city shall contain similar terms and conditions. 
(Code 1987, § 6.5-49) 
Sec. 36-70. - Time allotted for performance of material acts. 
    Whenever this article and/or the franchise agreement shall set forth any time for a material act to be performed by or on behalf of the grantee, such time shall be deemed of the essence and any failure of the grantee to perform such act within the time allotted shall always be sufficient ground for the city to invoke an appropriate penalty pursuant to section 36-77 or 36-121, liquidated damages specified in the franchise and subject to force majeure. 
(Code 1987, § 6.5-50) 
Sec. 36-71. - Law governs. 
    In any controversy or dispute under this article, the law of the state shall apply. 
(Code 1987, § 6.5-51) 
Sec. 36-72. - Severability. 
    If any material provision contained in this article (referred to in this section as the "invalid provision") is determined by final order of a court having appropriate jurisdiction to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect (referred to in this section as the "invalidity determination"), such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability shall not affect any other provision of this article, but this article shall be reformed and construed as if such invalid provision had never been contained in this article, provided that the parties shall exert their best efforts to reform such invalid provision to be valid, legal and enforceable to the maximum extent permitted consistent with the invalidity determination. 
(Code 1987, § 6.5-52) 
Sec. 36-73. - Transfer of ownership or control. 
(a)  Subject to the definition of the term "transfer of franchise" in section 36-31, any franchise granted under this division cannot, in any event, be sold, transferred, leased, assigned or disposed of, including, but not limited to, by force or voluntary sale, merger, consolidation, receivership or other means, without the prior consent of the city, and then only under such conditions as the city may establish. 
(b)  The grantee shall promptly notify the city of any actual or proposed change in, transfer or exchange of, stock, or acquisition by any other party of control of the grantee. As used in this subsection, the term "control" is not limited to major stockholders, but includes actual working control, in whatever manner exercised. A rebuttable presumption that a transfer of control has occurred shall arise upon the disposal by the grantee, directly or indirectly, by gift, assignment, exchange or transfer of stock, voluntary sale, merger, consolidation or otherwise, of 15 percent or more, at one time, of the ownership or controlling interest in the system, or 25 percent cumulatively over the term of the franchise of such interests to a corporation, partnership, limited partnership, trust or association, or person or group of persons acting in concert; provided, however, that: 
(1)  If the persons who presently control the grantee, including affiliated trusts and the estates of any such persons and members of the family of any such persons, remain in control of the grantee, there shall not be, or be deemed to be, any change, transfer or acquisition of control; 
(2)  Purchases and sales over a securities exchange or in the over-the-counter market, or those over which persons now in control of the grantee have no control shall not be, or be deemed to be, a change, transfer or acquisition of control; and 
(3)  No grant, transfer or assignment to a lending institution by persons now in control of the grantee as security for any indebtedness or other obligation shall be, or be deemed to be, a change, transfer or acquisition of control. 
(c)  Subject to the provisions of the definition of the term "transfer of franchise" in section 36-31 and subsections (a) and (b) of this section, every change, transfer or acquisition of control of the grantee shall make the franchise subject to cancellation unless and until the city shall have consented to such change, transfer or acquisition of control, which consent will not be unreasonably withheld by the city. For the purpose of determining whether it shall consent to such change, transfer or acquisition of control, the city may inquire into the legal, financial, character, technical and other public interest qualifications of the prospective controlling party, and the grantee shall assist the city in any such inquiry. Failure to provide all information requested by the city as part of such inquiry shall be grounds for denial of the proposed change, transfer or acquisition of control. 
(d)  The city agrees that any financial institution having a pledge of the franchise or its assets for the advancement of money for the construction, operation and/or acquisition of the franchise shall have the right to notify the city that it, or its designees satisfactory to the city, will take control and operate the cable television system. Further, such financial institution shall also submit a plan for such operation that will ensure continued service and compliance with all franchise obligations during the term the financial institution exercises control over the system. The financial institution shall not exercise control over the system for a period exceeding one year, unless such period of time is extended by the city at its reasonable discretion, and during such period of time it shall have the right to petition for transfer of the franchise to another grantee. After consideration of the legal, financial, character, technical and other public interest qualifications of the applicant, if the city finds that such qualifications are satisfactory, the city will transfer and assign the rights and obligations of such franchise as in the public interest. The consent of the city to such transfer shall not be unreasonably withheld. 
(e)  As in the grant of any franchise under this division, the consent or approval of the city to any transfer of the grantee clearly shall not constitute a waiver or release of the rights of the city in and to the public way, and any transfer shall, by its terms, be expressly subject to the terms and conditions of this article and the franchise. 
(f)  In the absence of extraordinary circumstances, the city will not approve any transfer or assignment of the franchise prior to completion of construction of the proposed system. 
(g)  The city reserves the right to be advised of the purchase price of any transfer or assignment of the cable system. Any assignee to this article or the franchise expressly agrees that any negotiated sale value, which the city, in the exercise of its reasonable discretion, deems unreasonable, will not be considered in the rate base for any subsequent request for rate increases, if applicable, subject to such assignee's rights under applicable law. The grantee may dispute the determination of the city in an appropriate forum. 
(h)  Any approval by the city of transfer of ownership or control shall be contingent upon the prospective controlling party becoming a signatory to the franchise. 
(i)  The city council reserves the right of first negotiation to purchase the cable system from the grantee at such time that the grantee decides to place such system on the market for sale, independent of other systems. Such right of first negotiation shall continue for a 90-day period, commencing with the date the grantee notifies the city of its intention to place the system on the market. The city and the grantee shall conduct such negotiations in good faith to determine the fair market value of the cable system. There shall be no obligation to reach an agreement, and if no agreement is reached by the end of such 90-day period, neither the grantee, nor the city shall have any obligation to the other with respect to the right of first negotiation. The grantee is precluded from selling the cable system to a party other than the city for a price materially the same as the price offered by the city for a period of six months subsequent to such 90-day period. 
(Code 1987, § 6.5-53) 
Sec. 36-74. - Franchise renewal; system ownership. 
(a)  Upon completion of the term of any franchise granted under this division, the city may, in its sole discretion, grant or deny renewal of the franchise of the grantee in accordance with the provisions of the cable act. 
(b)  The grantee shall own the cable communications system, but shall have no property right in the public rights-of-way upon the completion of the franchise term. 
(Code 1987, § 6.5-54) 
Sec. 36-75. - Police powers. 
    Any conflict between the provisions of this article or the franchise and any other present or future lawful exercise of the city's police powers shall be resolved in favor of the city's police powers, except that any such exercise that is not of general application in the jurisdiction or applies exclusively to the grantee or cable communications systems which contains provisions inconsistent with this article shall prevail only if, upon such exercise, the city finds an emergency exists constituting a danger to health, safety, property or general welfare and such exercise is mandated by law. 
(Code 1987, § 6.5-55) 
Sec. 36-76. - Franchise fees. 
(a)  Because the city finds that the: 
(1)  Streets of the county, state and city to be used by the grantee in the operation of its system within the boundaries of the franchise area are valuable public properties acquired and maintained by the county, state and city at great expense to its taxpayers; 
(2)  Grant to the grantee to use such streets is a valuable property right without which the grantee would be required to invest substantial capital in right-of-way costs and acquisitions; and 
(3)  Administration of this article or the franchise imposes upon the city additional regulatory responsibility and expense; 
the grantee of any franchise under this division shall pay a franchise fee to the city in an amount as designated in the franchise, but in no event less than an amount equal to five percent of the gross annual revenues, or the maximum amount permitted under applicable federal, state or local law, if such maximum is greater than five percent. The annual franchise payment shall be in addition to any other fee, such as fees due for liquidated damages, ad valorem taxes, street assessments, utility taxes, etc., and commence accruing as of the effective date of the franchise. The city shall be furnished a certified statement of such payment by a certified public accountant or financial officer of the grantee, reflecting the total amounts of annual gross revenues and such charges and computations for the period covered by the payment. 
(b)  The payment shall be in addition to any other tax or payment, such as fees due for liquidated damages, ad valorem taxes, street assessments, utility taxes, etc., owed to the government or other taxing jurisdiction by the grantee. Payment of the franchise fee made by grantee to the city shall not be considered in the nature of a tax, but shall be in addition to any and all taxes which are or may be required to be paid by any federal, state or local law. 
(c)  No acceptance of any payment by the city shall be construed as a release or as an accord and satisfaction of any claim the city may have for further or additional sums payable as a franchise fee under this division or for the performance of any other obligation of the grantee. 
(d)  If any franchise payment or recomputed amount is not made on or before the dates specified in this section, as additional compensation, the grantee shall pay an interest charge, computed from such due date, at the annual rate equal to the commercial prime interest rate of the city's designated primary depository bank during the period that such unpaid amount is owed. 
(e)  The franchise fee and any other costs or damages assessed shall be payable annually to the city. The grantee shall file a complete and accurate verified statement of all gross revenue within the city during the period for which such annual payment is made, and such payment shall be made to the city not later than 45 days after the close of the grantee's fiscal year. 
(f)  The city shall have the right to inspect the grantee's income records related to the gross annual revenues of the cable communications system and the right to audit and to recompute any amounts determined to be payable under this article. Audits shall be at the expense of the grantee, if any such audit finds that the grantee has underpaid the franchise fee by five percent or more. Any additional amount due to the city as a result of the audit shall be paid within 30 days following written notice to the grantee by the city, which notice shall include a copy of the audit report.

Sec. 36-77. - Forfeiture or revocation. 
(a)  Grounds for revocation . Subject to the procedures set forth in subsection (d) of this section, the city reserves the right to revoke any franchise granted under this division and rescind all rights and privileges associated with the franchise in the following circumstances, each of which shall represent a default and breach under this article and the franchise grant: 
(1)  If the grantee shall default in the performance of any of the material obligations under this article, the franchise or documents referenced in the franchise, or other contracts entered into by and between the city and the grantee. 
(2)  If the grantee shall fail to provide or maintain in full force and effect the liability and indemnification coverage or the performance bond as required in this article. 
(3)  If the grantee shall violate any material orders or rulings of this article, the franchise or Federal Communications Commission, or other regulatory body expressly having jurisdiction over the grantee relative to this article or the franchise. 
(4)  If the grantee attempts to evade any of the provisions of this article or the franchise, or practices any fraud or deceit upon the city or cable subscribers. 
(5)  If the grantee's construction schedule is delayed later than the schedule contained in the franchise or beyond any extended date set by the city. 
(6)  If the grantee becomes insolvent, unable or unwilling to pay its debts or is adjudged bankrupt. 
(7)  Failure to restore service after 96 consecutive hours of interrupted service, except when approval of such interruption is obtained from the city.

(10)  Failure to provide subscribers or users with adequate service in accordance with this article and the franchise. 
(b)  Effect of circumstances beyond control of grantee. The grantee shall not be declared at fault or be subject to any sanction under any provision of this article in any case in which performance of any such provision is prevented for reasons beyond the grantee's control. A fault shall not be deemed to be beyond the grantee's control if committed by a corporation or other business entity in which the grantee holds a controlling interest, whether held directly or indirectly. 
(c)  Performance of obligations by grantee. Pending litigation or any appeal to any regulatory body or court having jurisdiction over the grantee shall not excuse the grantee from the performance of its obligations under this article or the franchise. Failure of the grantee to perform such obligations because of pending litigation or petition may result in forfeiture or revocation of the franchise pursuant to the provisions of this section. 
(d)  Procedure prior to revocation. 
(1)  The city shall make written demand that the grantee comply with any requirement, limitation, term, condition, rule or regulation or correct any action deemed cause for revocation. If the failure, refusal or neglect of the grantee continues for a period of 45 days following such written demand, the city shall place its request for termination of the franchise upon a regular or special council meeting agenda. The city shall cause to be served upon such grantee, at least seven days prior to the date of such council meeting, a written notice of the intent to request such termination, and the time and place of the meeting, notice of which shall be published by the city clerk at least once, seven days before such meeting, in a newspaper of general circulation within the city. 
(2)  The council shall hear any persons interested in such matter, and shall determine, in its reasonable discretion, whether or not any failure, refusal or neglect by the grantee was with just cause. 
(3)  If such failure, refusal or neglect by the grantee was with just cause, the council shall direct the grantee to comply within such time and manner, and upon such terms and conditions, as are reasonable. 
(4)  If the council shall determine such failure, refusal or neglect by the grantee was without just cause, then the council shall, by resolution, declare that the franchise of the grantee shall be terminated and bond forfeited unless there shall be compliance by the grantee within 45 days. 
(e)  Disposition of facilities. If a franchise expires in the absence of renewal for an additional term of years, is revoked or otherwise terminated, the city may, in its sole discretion, do any of the following: 
(1)  Purchase the system under the procedures set forth in section 36-82. 
(2)  Effect a transfer of ownership of the system to another party;

In the instance of nonrenewal, any such acquisition or transfer shall be at fair market value, determined on the basis of the cable system valued as a going concern, but with no value allocated to the franchise itself. If the franchise is revoked for cause, the acquisition or transfer shall be at an equitable price. The city shall notify the grantee, in writing, within 30 days of its intent to acquire the system on its behalf or effectuate the ownership of the system to another person. The purchase price shall be based upon the value of the system, determined pursuant to this section. 
(2)  Date of valuation. The date of valuation shall be no earlier than the day following the date of expiration or termination and no later than the date the city makes a fair and reasonable offer for the system or the date of transfer of ownership, whichever occurs first. 
(3)  System valuation. The value of the cable system shall be determined by a qualified appraiser appointed by the city. The appraiser shall determine the current worth of the assets, pursuant to subsection (a)(1) of this section. Under no circumstances shall the value under this section be less than the book value of the assets less the accumulated depreciation. No value shall be assigned to the franchise in the instance of nonrenewal, and particularly no value shall be allowed for any increase in value arising out of any expectation or cable communications system's revenues beyond the forfeiture and termination date or expiration date, whichever is sooner. 
(4)  Intent to purchase. Upon receipt of notice of the city's intent to purchase the system at the value established in subsection (a)(3) of this section, the grantee shall have 30 days within which to accept the valuation as the purchase price of the system. If the purchase price is not acceptable, the parties shall have 120 days in which to negotiate an acceptable purchase price. 
(5)  Transfer to city. Upon exercise of the right to purchase option, and the payment of the agreed upon sum by the city and its service of official notice of such action upon the grantee, the grantee shall immediately transfer to the city possession and title to all facilities and property, real and personal, of the cable communications system, free from any and all liens and encumbrances not agreed to be assumed by the city in lieu of a portion of the purchase price as set forth in subsection (a)(3) of this section, and the grantee shall execute such warranty, deeds or other instruments of conveyance to the city as shall be necessary for such purpose. 
(6)  Arbitration. If the city and grantee are unable to agree upon the value of the cable communications system within the time limits set forth in subsection (a)(4) of this section, either party may require, by written notice to the other, that the value of the cable communications system be submitted to arbitration in the following manner: 
a.  Within 15 days after such written notice, the city and the grantee shall each select an arbitrator, both of whom shall be a disinterested person with reasonable knowledge and experience relative to the subject to be arbitrated. The two selected arbitrators shall immediately thereafter select a third arbitrator who shall likewise be a disinterested person having reasonable knowledge and experience relative to the subject to be arbitrated. If the two arbitrators are unable to pick a third arbitrator, the third arbitrator shall be appointed by the National Arbitration Board. 
b.  Within 30 days after appointment of all arbitrators and upon ten days' written notice to the parties, the panel of arbitrators shall commence a hearing on the issue of valuation and shall receive all relevant information from the parties. The arbitrators shall have timely access to all of the grantee's records related to determining the value of the cable communications system. 
c.  The hearing shall be recorded and may be transcribed at the request of either party. All hearing proceedings, debates and deliberations shall be open to the public and at such times and places as contained in the notice or as thereafter publicly stated, except that if two arbitrators agree, debates and deliberations may be held in closed session. 
d.  The value of the system, as determined by the arbitration panel, shall be the fair market value, determined on the basis of the cable system valued as a going concern and in the event of nonrenewal with no value allocated to the franchise itself. Under no circumstances shall the value established by the arbitration panel be less than the net book value of the assets, nor greater than the current replacement cost of the system as determined by the appraiser appointed under subsection (a)(3) of this section. 
e.  Within 30 days after the close of the hearing, the panel of arbitrators shall prepare findings and a decision agreed upon by a majority of the panel, which shall be filed with the city and served by mail upon the grantee. The decision of the panel regarding the value of the system shall be final and binding upon the parties. Should there be no majority decision, the proceedings shall become null and void and shall be started anew, unless the parties extend, by mutual agreement, the time which the panel of arbitrators has to make a decision. 
f.  Either party may seek judicial relief in the following circumstances: 
1.  A party fails to select an arbitrator; 
2.  The arbitrators fail to select a third arbitrator; 
3.  One or more arbitrators is unqualified; 
4.  Designated time limits have been exceeded;

h.  The expenses of the arbitrators shall be borne by the appointing parties, and the expenses of the third arbitrator and the expenses incurred by the panel as a whole shall be borne equally by the parties. 
(7)  Notification. Upon receipt of the decision of the arbitration panel, the city shall have 30 days in which to notify the grantee of its intent to exercise its option to purchase the system. The purchase price shall be the value of the system as determined by the arbitration panel.

DIVISION 2. - WATER CONSERVATION ORDINANCE 

Sec. 40-134. - Declaration. 
    Whenever the water supply of the city's public water system is low and/or declining due to conditions which may adversely affect the continued availability of water for human consumption, sanitation, health and fire protection, it may become necessary to declare a water shortage and implement conservation requirements under the standards set forth below. 
(Ord. No. O-2005-05, § 2, 7-19-2005) 
Sec. 40-135. - Definitions. 
    For the purpose of this division, the following terms, words and phrases and their derivations shall have the meaning given herein. The word "shall" is always mandatory and not merely discretionary. 
    City is the City of Laurinburg. 
    Customer is a person in whose name a water connection is made and to whom a bill is issued, whether such connection is inside or outside the corporate limits of the city. 
    Person is any person, firm, partnership, association, corporation, company, limited liability company, professional association or organization of any kind. The term person shall also include customers. 
    Water is raw or treated water from the city's water supply system. 
(Ord. No. O-2005-05, § 2, 7-19-2005) 
Sec. 40-136. - General. 
    A water shortage shall be declared to exist when the reserve supply of water available to the city shall have reached the point where customers cannot be supplied with water to protect their health and safety without substantially curtailing the water demand. A water shortage shall also be declared to exist when production, transmission and storage facilities are incapable of meeting all daily water demands without substantially curtailing water demand. 
(Ord. No. O-2005-05, § 2, 7-19-2005) 
Sec. 40-137. - Notice to general public of water shortage. 
(a)  In the event that a water shortage within the city water supply of any of the degrees of severity hereinafter set forth threatens the health and safety of the citizens, as determined by the city manager in consultation with the director of the water treatment plant, the city manager is authorized and empowered, after communication to the mayor and the city council, to give notice to the general public of the existence of such state and the severity thereof. In order to protect the health and safety of the persons supplied water by the city, the city manager may place into effect the restrictive provisions hereinafter authorized by the execution of an executive order. Notice of such executive order shall be given by public press announcement, and the order shall become effective 24 hours following the press announcement. 
(b)  Once a stage of water restriction is declared, the director of the water treatment plant shall review the number of days of water supply available to the city at least once every seven days. A declared stage shall remain in effect for a minimum of 30 days; provided, however, that if conditions as listed in section 40-138(a) warrant a more restrictive level may be enacted immediately. At the end of 30 days and following the periodic supply review, the director of the water treatment plant shall notify the city manager of the city's system capacity and operational time of the water treatment plant in light of the criteria set out in subsection 40-138(a), and the city manager shall declare the appropriate stage of restriction, if any, to be in effect. 
(c)  In addition to the other powers contained in this division, the city manager, when notified by the director of the water treatment plant that there is a serious and immediate threat to the city's water system because of reduced water quality, treatment capacity, treated supply recovery time or any other imminent condition, may temporarily impose restrictions on automated and manual sprinkling. Such restrictions may include, among others, limitations on methods of sprinkling, the hours and days, and whether such sprinkling may occur at all. In such event, the notice provisions contained in section 40-137(a) shall apply and the enforcement provisions of section 40-140 through 40-144 shall be applicable. The city manager, or city council, may terminate, by written notice, such restrictions when the threat has been abated. Any violation of this subsection by a customer shall be treated as a stage II level B violation for the purposes of imposing civil penalties. 
(Ord. No. O-2005-05, § 2, 7-19-2005) 
Sec. 40-138. - Compliance required in the event of a water shortage. 
(a)  In the event the city manager shall sign an executive order and issue the notice described in section 40-137, it shall be unlawful for any person to use or permit the use of water from the city's water system for any of the purposes hereinafter set forth until such time that this article is amended or repealed or until the city manager has declared such provisions no longer to be in effect. In exercising this authority, considerations shall be given to the following criteria: groundwater supplies and draw down rates (well pumping ability), capabilities of the water production, distribution and storage system, outlook for precipitation, daily water use patterns and the availability of water from other sources. 
(b)  To the extent that compliance will not endanger the health of the patients or residents of the institution, hospitals, nursing homes and health care facilities shall comply with all restrictions imposed on residential and non-residential customers as may be applicable to each individual institution. Furthermore, each hospital, nursing home and health care facility shall survey its water usage patterns and requirements and implement such additional conservation measures as may be possible without endangering the health of its patients or residents in order to achieve a further reduction in the institution's water usage. 
(Ord. No. O-2005-05, § 2, 7-19-2005) 
Sec. 40-139. - Restrictions applicable to various levels of available capacity.

(2)  The size and slope of the building sewer shall be subject to the approval of the superintendent. Whenever possible, the building sewer shall be brought to the building at an elevation below the basement floor. In all buildings in which any building drain is too low to permit gravity flow to the public sewer, sanitary wastewater carried by such building drain shall be lifted by a means approved by the superintendent and discharged to the building sewer. No building sewer shall be laid parallel to or within five feet of any bearing wall, which might thereby be weakened. The depth shall be sufficient to afford protection from frost. The building sewer shall be laid at uniform grade and in straight alignment, insofar as possible. Changes in direction shall be made only with properly curved pipe and fittings. 
(3)  All excavations required for the installation of a building sewer shall be open trench work unless otherwise approved by the superintendent. Pipe laying and backfill shall be performed in accordance with ASTM specification C12-19, except that no backfill shall be placed until the work has been inspected. 
(4)  All joints and connections shall be made gastight and watertight. 
(5)  Cast iron pipe joints shall be firmly packed with oakum or hemp and filled with molten lead, federal specification QQ-L-156, not less than one inch deep. Lead shall be run in one pouring and caulked tight. No paint, varnish or other coating shall be permitted on the jointing material until after the joint has been tested and approved. All joints in vitrified clay pipe shall be factory made compression joints as described under ASTM specification C-425, Type 3. 
(6)  Material for hot poured joints shall not soften sufficiently to destroy the effectiveness of the joint when subjected to a temperature of 160 degrees Fahrenheit, nor be soluble in any of the wastes carried by the drainage system. The joint shall first be caulked tight with jute, hemp or similar approved material. 
(7)  Other jointing materials and methods may be used if approved by the superintendent subject to the North Carolina Building Code, Volume II, Plumbing. 
(8)  The connection of the building sewer into the public sanitary sewer shall be made at the Y branch, if such branch is available at a suitable location. If the public sewer is 12 inches in diameter or less and no properly located Y branch is available, the owner shall, at his expense, install a Y branch in the public sewer at the location specified by the superintendent. 
(9)  Where the public sewer is greater than 12 inches in diameter and no properly located Y branch is available, a neat hole may be cut into the public sewer to receive the building sewer, with entry in the downstream direction at an angle of about 45 degrees. A 45-degree ell may be used to make such connection, with the spigot end cut so as not to extend past the inner surface of the public sewer. The invert of the building sewer at the point of connection shall be at the same or higher elevation than the invert of the public sewer. A smooth, neat joint shall be made and the connection made secure and watertight by encasement in concrete. Special fittings may be used for the connection only when approved by the superintendent.

(a)  Any user who commences the discharge of hazardous waste shall notify the POTW, the EPA Regional Waste Management Division Director, and state hazardous waste authorities, in writing, of any discharge into the POTW of a substance which, if otherwise disposed of, would be a hazardous waste under 40 CFR Part 261. Such notification must include the name of the hazardous waste as set forth in 40 CFR Part 261, the EPA hazardous waste number, and the type of discharge (continuous, batch, or other). If the user discharges more than 100 kilograms of such waste per calendar month to the POTW, the notification also shall contain the following information to the extent such information is known and readily available to the user: an identification of the hazardous constituents contained in the wastes, an estimation of the mass and concentration of such constituents in the wastestream discharge during the calendar month, and an estimation of the mass and concentration of such constituents in the wastestream expected to be discharged during the following 12 months. All notifications must take place no later than 180 days before the discharge commences. The user shall not begin the discharge until receiving written approval from the city. Any notification under this paragraph need be submitted only once for each hazardous waste discharge. However, notifications of changed conditions must be submitted under section 40-265 of this division. The notification requirement in this section does not apply to pollutants already reported by users subject to categorical pretreatment standards under the self-monitoring requirements of sections 40-261, 40-263, and 40-264 of this division. 
(b)  Dischargers are exempt from the requirements of paragraph (a), above, during a calendar month in which they discharge no more than 15 kilograms of hazardous wastes, unless the wastes are acute hazardous wastes as specific in 40 CFR 261.30(d) and 261.33(e). Discharge of more than 15 kilograms of nonacute hazardous wastes in a calendar month, or of any quantity of acute hazardous wastes as specified in 40 CFR 261.30(d) and 261.33(e), requires a one-time notification. Subsequent months during which the user discharges more than such quantities of any hazardous waste do not require additional notification. 
(c)  In the case of any new regulation under section 3001 of RCRA identifying additional characteristics of hazardous waste or listing any additional substance as a hazardous waste, the user must notify the director of treatment plants, the EPA Regional Waste Management Waste Division Director, and state hazardous waste authorities of the discharge of such substance within 90 days of the effective date of such regulations. 
(d)  In the case of any notification made under this section, the user shall certify that it has a program in place to reduce the volume and toxicity of hazardous wastes generated to the degree it has determined to be economically practical. 
(e)  This provision does not create a right to discharge any substance not otherwise permitted to be discharged by this division, a permit issued thereunder, or any applicable federal or state law.

Persons or occupants of premises where wastewater is created or discharged shall allow the city, approval authority and EPA or their representative ready access at all reasonable times to all parts of the premises for the purposes of inspection, sampling, records examination and copying or in the performance of any of their duties. The city, approval authority and EPA shall have the right to set up on the user's property such devices as are necessary to conduct sampling, inspection, compliance monitoring and/or metering operations. Where a user has security measures in force which would require proper identification and clearance before entry into their premises, the user shall make necessary arrangements with their security guards so that upon presentation of suitable identification, personnel from the city, approval authority and EPA will be permitted to enter, without delay, for the purposes of performing their specific responsibilities. Denial of the city's, approval authority's, or EPA's access to the user's premises shall be a violation of this division. Unreasonable delays may constitute denial of access. 
(Ord. No. O-2014-14, § 1(Att. A, § 6.2), 7-22-2014) 
Sec. 40-278. - Search warrants. 
    If the city, approval authority, or EPA has been refused access to a building, structure, or property, or any part thereof, and is able to demonstrate probable cause to believe that there may be a violation of this division, or that there is a need to inspect and/or sample as part of a routine inspection and sampling program of the city designed to verify compliance with this division or any permit or order issued hereunder, or to protect the overall public health, safety and welfare of the community, then the city, approval authority, or EPA may seek issuance of a search warrant from the court having jurisdiction within the city.

Subdivision VII. - Enforcement 

Sec. 40-281. - Administrative remedies. 
(a)  Notification of violation. Whenever the director of treatment plants finds that any industrial user has violated or is violating this division, wastewater permit, or any prohibition, limitation or requirements contained therein or any other pretreatment requirement the director of treatment plants may serve upon such a person a written notice stating the nature of the violation. Within 30 days from the date of this notice, an explanation for the violation and a plan for the satisfactory correction thereof shall be submitted to the city by the user. Submission of this plan does not relieve the discharger of liability for any violations occurring before or after receipt of the notice of violation. 
(b)  Consent orders. The director of treatment plants is hereby empowered to enter into consent orders, assurances of voluntary compliance, or other similar documents establishing an agreement with the person responsible for the noncompliance. Such orders will include specific action to be taken by the discharger to correct the noncompliance within a time period also specified by the order. Consent orders shall have the same force and effect as an administrative order issued pursuant to section 40-281(d), below. 
(c)  Show cause hearing. The director of treatment plants may order any industrial user who causes or is responsible for an unauthorized discharge, has violated this division or is in noncompliance with a wastewater discharge permit to show cause why a proposed enforcement action should not be taken. In the event the director of treatment plants determines that a show cause order should be issued, a notice shall be served on the user specifying the time and place for the hearing, the proposed enforcement action, the reasons for such action, and a request that the user show cause why this proposed enforcement action should not be taken. The notice of the hearing shall be served personally or by registered or certified mail (return receipt requested) at least ten days before the hearing. Service may be made on any agent or officer of a corporation. 
The director of treatment plants shall review the evidence presented at the hearing and determine whether the proposed enforcement action is appropriate. 
A show cause hearing under this section is not a prerequisite to the assessment of a civil penalty under section 40-282 nor is any action or inaction taken by the POTW director under this section subject to an administrative appeal under subdivision VIII. 
(d)  Administrative orders. When the director of treatment plants finds that an industrial user has violated or continues to violate this division, permits or orders issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment requirement the director of treatment plants may issue an order to cease and desist all such violations and direct those persons in noncompliance to do any of the following: 
(1)  Immediately comply with all requirements; 
(2)  Comply in accordance with a compliance time schedule set forth in the order; 
(3)  Take appropriate remedial or preventive action in the event of a continuing or threatened violation; 
(4)  Disconnect unless adequate treatment facilities, devices or other related appurtenances are installed and properly operated within a specified time period. 
(e)  Emergency suspensions. The director of treatment plants may suspend the wastewater treatment service and/or wastewater permit when such suspension is necessary in order to stop an actual or threatened discharge which presents or may present an imminent or substantial endangerment to the health or welfare of persons or the environment, interferes with the POTW or causes the POTW to violate any condition of its NPDES or non-discharge permit. 
Any user notified of a suspension of the wastewater treatment service and/or the wastewater permit shall immediately stop or eliminate the contribution. A hearing will be held within 15 days of the notice of suspension to determine whether the suspension may be lifted or the user's waste discharge permit terminated.

Editor's note- The provisions contained in Art. I, Ord. No. 549, relative to the franchise for Community Antenna, Inc., were deleted as superseded by Ord. No. O-1991-25 pursuant to § III of such ordinance. The deleted provisions, as set out in Ord. No. 549, were adopted Nov. 16, 1976. 

Section I. - Grant of franchise. 
A.  Grantee is hereby granted for itself and its successors and assignors, subject to the terms and conditions of this franchise and the Cable Communications Ordinance, appendix A, article I, of the Laurinburg Municipal Code (hereafter referred to as "cable ordinance"), the right, privilege, and authority to construct, operate, maintain, and reconstruct a cable communications system within the streets, alleys, and public ways of the city. Grantee shall provide a modern, state-of-the-art, and uniform city-wide cable communications system to the residents and institutions of the city in accordance with and as described in this franchise. 
B.  The franchise is subject to the cable ordinance. Nothing in this franchise shall be deemed to waive the requirements of the various codes and ordinances of the city regarding permits, fees to be paid, or manner of construction. 
C.  For the purpose of operating and maintaining a cable communications system in the city, grantee may erect, install, construct, repair, replace, reconstruct, and retain in, on, over, under, or upon, across and along the public streets, alleys, and ways within the city such wires, cables, conductors, ducts, conduits, vaults, manholes, amplifiers, appliances, pedestals, attachments, and other property and equipment as are necessary and appurtenant to the operation of the cable communications system in conformance with the city's specifications. Prior to any construction or relocation, however, grantee shall file plans with the appropriate city agencies and utility companies and receive any necessary approval before proceeding. Such city approvals shall not be unreasonably withheld. 
Section II. - Right of city to issue franchise. 
    Grantee acknowledges and accepts the legal right of the city to issue this franchise. 
Section III. - Effective date of franchise, effect upon existing franchise. 
    The effective date of the franchise shall be the date of execution of the franchise and, immediately upon the taking effect of this franchise, the prior franchise granted to grantee, on November 16, 1976, by the passage of Ordinance No. 549 shall be superseded and of no further force and effect; provided, however, vested rights relating to billings and the city's rights to accrued franchise fees shall not be affected thereby; and provided, further, that any criminal proceedings commenced under or pursuant to said franchise shall in no manner be affected. 
Section IV. - Term. 
    The term of the franchise shall be for a period of 15 years from the effective date of this franchise, unless sooner terminated as provided in the cable ordinance, at which time it shall expire and be of no further force and effect. 
Section V. - Franchise nonexclusive. 
    Consistent with the requirements of the cable ordinance, this franchise shall not be construed as any limitation upon the right of the city to grant to other persons rights, privileges, or authorities similar to the rights, privileges, and authorities herein set forth, in the same or other streets, alleys, or other public ways or public places. The city specifically reserves the right to grant at any time during the term of this franchise or renewal thereof, if any, such additional franchises for a cable communications system as it deems appropriate. 
    The city agrees that any grant of additional franchises by the city shall cover the entire corporate limits of the city and shall not be on material terms and conditions (including without limitation the franchise fee) more favorable to the grantee of any such additional franchise than those which are set forth herein. 
Section VI. - Incorporation of the cable ordinance by reference and resolution of conflicts. 
    All terms, conditions and provisions of the cable ordinance of the Laurinburg Municipal Code shall be deemed to be embodied in this franchise, and the express terms of said chapter 6.5, Article II, shall prevail over conflicting or inconsistent provisions of this franchise. 
Section VII. - Definitions. 
    All definitions set forth in section III [section 6.5-23] of the cable ordinance pertain to this franchise and shall be relevant to the purposes and meaning of this franchise. 
Section VIII. - Service area. 
    Grantee shall offer full cable television service to all areas of the city which shall be the corporate limits of the city as of the effective date of this franchise. Within 90 days of the effective date of this franchise, grantee shall complete construction to the residences on Sterling Circle, Berwick Drive, and Knox Court. 
    For new dwelling units within the corporate limits of the city, including all territories thereafter annexed by the city, grantee shall extend full cable service within six months of request in an area with a density equivalent to at least 20 dwelling units per mile. 
    In other areas with less than 20 residential dwelling units per proposed mile, grantee shall offer a cost-sharing arrangement with residents. A dwelling unit will be counted for this purpose if its lot fronts a street. The cost-sharing arrangement shall consist of the following. 
1.  On the request of a subscriber desiring service, grantee shall prepare, at its cost, an engineering survey and cost analysis to determine the cost of the plant extension required to provide service to the subscriber from the closest point on the cable system. 
2.  The cost of construction shall be allocated based on the following formula: If a request for extension of service into a residential area requires the construction of cable plant which does not pass at least 20 potential subscribers per mile, grantee and subscribers will each bear their proportionate share of construction costs. For example, if there are ten dwelling units per mile, grantee's share will equal 10/20 or one-half of the construction cost. The remaining cost will be shared equally by each subscriber. This line extension formula shall also be applied to a portion of a mile meeting proportionate density requirements. For example, if there are ten dwelling units per one-half mile, the grantee shall construct the plant. The cost sharing plan described above would be utilized if there were less than the proportionate share of dwelling units per the portion of a mile needed to reach the dwelling units. 
3.  Should additional subscribers request cable television service, subscribers utilizing the cost-sharing plan for extensions shall be reimbursed prorata for their contribution or a proportional share thereof. In such case, the prorata shares shall be recalculated and each new subscriber shall pay the new prorata share, and all prior subscribers shall receive prorata refunds. At such time as there are said 20 potential subscribers per mile, the subscribers shall receive their pro-rata share of construction costs. In any event, at the end of one year from the completion of a project, the subscribers are no longer eligible for refunds, and the amounts paid in construction costs will be credited to the plant account of grantee. 
4.  The average cost of line extension shall be recalculated annually and based upon then-current costs for labor and materials. 
Section IX. - System and capacity. 
A.  System rebuild. The parties understand and agree that grantee shall construct a 72 channel, 550 MHz cable system. The rebuilt system will have pay-per-view capability upon completion of the rebuild. Grantee shall adhere to the following schedule for the rebuild: 
1.  Grantee will complete the mapping phase of the rebuild within three months of the effective date of the franchise. 
2.  Within three months of the completion of the mapping phase described above, grantee will complete the design phase of the system rebuild (utilizing the maps prepared in the first phase described above). The city shall have the authority to approve the technical plans to assure signal quality to subscribers. Such approval shall be given within 30 days and shall be based on the system design's ability to meet the requirements of this franchise and the ordinance. Should the city not approve of the technical plans, grantee shall revise the plans in accordance with city suggestions and shall submit them for city approval within 45 days. 
3.  Subsequent to the completion of phases 1 and 2 above, grantee will commence the actual construction of the new system, which construction phase will be completed over an eighteen-month period. 
4.  Conversion of subscribers to this system, including drop replacement, as specified in appendix A and incorporated by reference, testing, and replacement, shall be completed 25 months from the effective date of the franchise. Home wiring shall be replaced as needed and shall be subject to subscriber permission to perform such work.

C.  [Construction manual.] Grantee shall construct the system in accordance with or in a manner of equivalent quality to grantee's construction manual which shall be provided to the city prior to the construction of the system. Such construction manual shall be substantially similar to prevailing industry practices. 
D.  [Compliance required]. In constructing, operating and maintaining the system, grantee shall at all times comply with this franchise, the cable ordinance and all applicable laws. 
E.  [Equipment]. Equipment used for the distribution system, headend and reception facilities shall be of good and durable quality and be serviced and repaired on a regular basis and shall at all times be of equal or better quality than the equipment listed in appendix B attached hereto and incorporated by reference. In cases of equipment replacement not covered above, equipment shall be of sufficient quality to meet the technical specifications in this franchise and the ordinance. 
F.  Converters. Grantee shall study converter technology during the rebuild process. 30 days prior to the completion of the rebuild, grantee shall report to the city on the current state of converter technology and the converter or other technology (interdiction) that grantee proposes to use in Laurinburg. The converter or other technology that shall be made available to all subscribers in Laurinburg, shall be state-of-the-art and shall have, at minimum, the following capabilities; parental control; pay-per-view, pay-per-channel; favorite channel recall; VCR programming capabilities; and wireless remote control. In addition, to the extent technically and economically feasible, the converter or other technology shall be user friendly. The converter or technology shall be available within eight months of the completion of the rebuild. 
G.  [Construction of system.] Grantee shall, to the extent feasible, construct the system and install equipment which permits the full utilization of cable-ready television receivers by subscribers, where possible. 
H.  Emergency alert. Grantee shall provide an all channel audio emergency alert system for use by the city. Emergency messages can be initiated from any touch tone phone with an access code. Persons to be provided with access codes shall be selected by the city.

K.  Remote controls. Grantee shall make wireless remote control units available to subscribers. Grantee may provide remote control units to subscribers as part of its package of services. 
L.  Parental control devices. Grantee shall provide all subscribers that request it with parental control devices so that parents can lock out channels that they desire to have such control over. Such devices shall block both the video and the audio portion of such channels to the extent that both are unintelligible. Parental control devices shall be provided free of charge to those subscribers who already have a converter such as that referred to in section IX(f). Subscribers who request parental control and who do not already utilize converters equipped with such capability shall pay the prevailing converter charge for such converters but no extra charge for parental control devices. The grantee may make a one-time reasonable charge for the installation of the parental control devices in cases where the grantee must send an employee to a subscriber's home. 
M.  Minimum interference.

ARTICLE 1. PURPOSE AND APPLICABILITY
SECTION 1.1 SHORT TITLE.
This Ordinance shall be known and may be cited as theLaurinburg Unified Development Ordinance
(UDO) . This Ordinance is designed to serve as a land development regulatory document which
combines traditional zoning provisions, subdivision regulations, flood damage prevention
regulations, and street and utility standards. The principal objectives of the Laurinburg Unified
Development Ordinance are to (1) assist in the implementation of the citys land development plan,
(2) provide a flexible means to administer land development regulations, and (3) expedite the land
development permit review process.
SECTION 1.2 AUTHORITY.
Zoning provisions enacted herein are under the authority of North Carolina General Statute (NCGS)
160A-381 to 160A-392, which extends to towns/cities the authority to enact regulations which
promote the health, safety, morals, or the general welfare of the community. It is further
authorized under NCGS 160A-382 which authorizes cities to regulate and restrict the erection,
construction, reconstruction, alteration, repair or use of buildings, structures, or land. This section
further authorizes the establishment of overlay districts in which additional regulations may be
imposed upon properties that lie within the boundary of the district. The statutes also require that
all such regulations shall be uniform for each class or type of building throughout each district, but
that the regulations in one district may differ from those in other districts.
Subdivision provisions enacted herein are under the authority of NCGS 160A-372 which provide for
the coordination of streets within proposed subdivisions with existing or planned street and with
other public facilities, the dedication or reservation or recreation areas serving residents of the
immediate neighborhood within the subdivision, or alternatively, for the provision of funds to be
used to acquire recreation areas serving residents of more than one neighborhood in the immediate
area, and for the distribution of population and traffic in a manner that will avoid congestion and
overcrowding.
This UDO, which combines zoning and subdivision authority, is further enacted under Section 1 of
SL 2005-418, a revision to NCGS 160A-363.
SECTION 1.3 APPLICABILITY.
1.3.1. This Ordinance shall be effective throughout the citys planning jurisdiction. The citys
planning jurisdiction comprises the area within the corporate boundaries of the city as well as the
area described in that ordinance adopted by the City Council which establishes the citys
extraterritorial jurisdiction. Such planning jurisdiction may be modified from time to time in
accordance with NCGS 160A-360.
April 21, 2015 Page 1-2 Article 1

approved or exempted site specific plans shall be conducted in accordance with the
requirements of the previous Unified Development Ordinance.
1.3.4.2. In accordance with NCGS 160A-392, the City of Laurinburg UDO applies to stateowned
lands only when a building is involved.

 The division of land into parcels greater than ten acres where no street
right-of-way dedication is involved.
 The public acquisition by purchase of strips of land for the widening or
opening of streets or for public transportation system corridors.
 The division of a tract in single ownership whose entire area is no greater
than two acres into not more than three lots, where no street right-of-way
dedication is involved and where the resultant lots are equal to or exceed
the standards of the municipality, as shown in its subdivision regulations.
SECTION 1.4 SEVERABILITY.
If any section or specific provision or standard of this Ordinance or any regulating district boundary
arising from it is found by a court to be invalid for any reason, the decision of the court shall not
affect the validity of any other section, provision, standard, or district boundary of these regulations

Administrator shall be responsible for interpretation and shall look to the Ordinance for guidance.
Responsibility for interpretation by the UDO Administrator shall be limited to standards, regulations
and requirements of the UDO, but shall not be construed to include interpretation of any technical
codes adopted by reference in the UDO, and shall not be construed as overriding the responsibilities
given to any commission, board, building inspector, or city officials named in other sections or
articles of the UDO.
2.3.2. Permitted Uses.
If a use is not specifically listed in any of the districts listed in this Ordinance, then the UDO
Administrator shall have the authority to interpret in which district the use, if any, should be
permitted. If the UDO Administrator rejects a proposal for a use that is not clearly disallowed in
a particular district, then the UDO Administrator shall:
2.3.2.1. Ensure that the citizen is provided with a copy of the interpretation in writing.

ARTICLE 2. GENERAL REGULATIONS
2.3.3. Lots Divided by District Lines.
2.3.3.1. Whenever a single lot two acres or less in size is located within two or more
different zoning districts, the district regulations applicable to the district within which the
larger portion of the lot lies shall apply to the entire lot.
2.3.3.2. Whenever a single lot greater than two acres in size is located within two or more
different zoning districts, then:
2.3.3.2.1. If each portion of the lot located within a separate district is equal to or
greater than the minimum lot size for that district, then each portion of the lot shall
be subject to all regulations applicable to the district in which it is located.
2.3.3.2.2. If any portion of the lot located within a separate district is smaller than
the minimum lot size for that district, then such smaller portion shall be regarded
as if it were in the same zoning district as the nearest portion to which it is attached.
2.3.3.3. This section applies only to lots created on or before the effective date of this
Ordinance unless the Board of Adjustment, in a proceeding under Section 4.4.3. to
determine district boundaries, concludes that a lot established after the effective date of this
section was not created to bring additional lot area within a more intensive zoning district,
or otherwise to take unfair or unwarranted advantage of the provisions of this section.

entry on the official zoning map denoting the date of amendment, description of amendment, and

ARTICLE 2. GENERAL REGULATIONS
2.4.4. Regardless of the existence of purported copies of the official zoning map which may from

the City Clerk, shall be the final authority as to the zoning status of land and water areas, buildings,
and other structures in the city.
2.4.5. In the event the official zoning map becomes damaged, destroyed, lost, or difficult to
interpret, the City Council may by resolution adopt a new official zoning map which shall supersede
the prior zoning map. The new official zoning map may correct drafting errors or other errors or
omissions in the prior official zoning map, but no correction shall have the effect of amending the
original official zoning map, or any subsequent amendment thereof. The new official zoning map
shall be identified by the signature of the Mayor attested by the City Clerk, and bearing the seal of
the City under the following words: This is to certify that this Official Zoning Map supersedes and
replaces the Official Zoning Map adopted (date of adoption of map being replaced), as part of the
Unified Development Ordinance, Laurinburg, North Carolina.

Where uncertainty exists with respect to the boundaries of any district shown on the Zoning Map,
the following rules shall apply:
2.5.1. Use of Property Lines.
Where district boundaries are indicated as approximately following street lines, alley lines, and lot
lines, such lines shall be construed to be such boundaries. Where streets, highways, railroads,
water courses, and similar areas with width are indicated as the district boundary, the actual district
boundary line shall be the centerline of such area.
2.5.2. Use of the Scale.
In unsubdivided property or where a zone boundary divides a lot, the location of such boundary,
unless the same is indicated by dimensions shall be determined by use of the scale appearing on
the map.
2.5.3. Vacated or Abandoned Streets.
Where any street or alley is hereafter officially vacated or abandoned, the zoning regulations
applicable to each parcel of abutting property shall apply to the centerline of such abandoned street
or alley.

ARTICLE 4. LEGISLATIVE/QUASI-JUDICIAL PROCEDURES
SECTION 4.1 AMENDMENT/REZONING PROCEDURES.
4.1.1. Procedure.
The City Council may amend, supplement, or change the text of this Ordinance and zoning map
following review and recommendation of the Planning Board according to the procedures
established in this Article.
4.1.2. Action by Applicant.
The following action shall be taken by the applicant:
4.1.2.1. Proposed changes or amendments may be initiated by the City Council, Planning
Board, or by one or more interested parties.
4.1.2.2. An application for any change or amendment shall contain a description and
statement of the present and proposed zoning regulation or district boundary to be applied,
the names and addresses of the applicant, the owner of the parcel of land involved in the
change if different from the applicant, and all adjacent property owners as shown on the
Scotland County tax listing. One (1) hard copy and one (1) electronic copy of such
application shall be filed with the UDO Administrator not later than thirty (30) calendar days
prior to the Planning Board meeting at which the application is to be considered.
The UDO Administrator shall not accept an application for rezoning on the same property
more than once in a twelve-month period unless the following conditions exist:
4.1.2.2.1. Materially changed conditions;
4.1.2.2.2. Clerical error was the basis for the denial of the previous rezoning
request;
4.1.2.2.3. Newly discovered evidence of adverse impact of the current zoning
which by due diligence could not have been discovered in time for the earlier
hearing; or
4.1.2.2.4. Substantially changed rezoning request.
The twelve-month period shall commence on the date a rezoning request is denied by the
City Council.
4.1.2.3. When a proposed amendment is initiated by individuals or parties other than the
City Council or Planning Board, a fee established by the City Council shall be paid to the city
for each application for an amendment to cover the necessary administrative costs and
advertising.
April 21, 2015 Page 4-2 Article 4
ARTICLE 4. LEGISLATIVE/QUASI-JUDICIAL PROCEDURES
If the UDO Administrator determines that the development for which a rezoning is
requested will have or may have substantial impact on surrounding properties, he may
require that the applicant conduct an informational meeting prior to Planning Board
consideration to discuss the impacts of the proposed rezoning with the adjoining property
owners. The purpose of the information meeting is to involve those property owners most
likely impacted by a proposed project in the early steps of the development process.
Consequently, the information meeting should be held prior to the public hearing date
established for the rezoning request.
4.1.3. Action by the Planning Board.
The Planning Board shall advise and comment on whether the proposed text amendment or map
amendment is consistent with the adopted comprehensive plan and any other applicable officially
adopted plans. The Planning Board shall provide a written recommendation with staff report to
the City Council that addresses plan consistency and other matters as deemed appropriate by the
Planning Board, but a comment by the Planning Board that a proposed amendment is inconsistent
with the comprehensive plan shall not preclude consideration or approval of the proposed
amendment by the City Council. The statement of consistency must specifically state why the
proposed amendment is consistent or inconsistent with the Comprehensive Plan. In its
deliberations, the Planning Board shall provide the public an opportunity to comment on
consistency with the Comprehensive Plan. (Amended 6/21/2016)
4.1.4. Action by the City Council.
Action to consider a rezoning petition, including the scheduling of a public hearing, will be at the
discretion of the City Council.
4.1.4.1. Notice and Public Hearings - Zoning Text Amendment. No amendment
shall be adopted by the City Council until after public notice and hearing. Notice of such
a public hearing shall be published once a week for two successive calendar weeks in a
local newspaper of general circulation in the city.
4.1.4.2. Notice and Public Hearings - Zoning Map Amendment.
4.1.4.2.1. In any case where the City Council will consider a change in the zoning
classification of a parcel of land, notice of the proposed petition or application shall
be mailed by first class mail to the owner of that parcel of land and all abutting
property owners as shown on the Scotland County tax listing at the last addresses
listed for such property owners on the Scotland County tax abstracts. The party
applying for the change in zoning classification shall submit, with the request for
rezoning, a list of the names of the owners, their addresses and the tax parcel
numbers of the property involved in the change and all properties any portion of
which is within two hundred (200) feet of the property to be considered for
rezoning, as shown on the Scotland County tax listing. The application shall be
considered incomplete without such material.
April 21, 2015 Page 4-3 Article 4
ARTICLE 4. LEGISLATIVE/QUASI-JUDICIAL PROCEDURES
4.1.4.2.2. At least ten but no more than 25 calendar days prior to the date of the
meeting at which the City Council will consider the request for rezoning, the City
Clerk shall mail a letter of notification in the supplied envelopes containing a
description of the request and the time, date and location of the public hearing.
Additionally, the site proposed for rezoning or an adjacent public right-of-way shall
be posted with a notice of the public hearing not less than ten calendar days prior
to the City Council meeting at which the rezoning is to be considered. When
multiple parcels are included in a proposed zoning map amendment, a posting of
each individual site is not required, but the city shall post sufficient notices to
provide reasonable notice to interested persons. The City Clerk shall certify to the
City Council that such notices have been made and such certification shall be
deemed conclusive in the absence of fraud.
4.1.4.2.3. The first class mail notice required under subsections 4.1.4.2.1 and
4.1.4.2.2 of this section shall not be required if the zoning map amendment directly
affects more than 50 properties, owned by a total of at least 50 different property
owners, and the city elects to use the expanded published notice. In this instance,
the city may elect to either make the mailed notice provided for in this section or
may as an alternative elect to publish a notice of the hearing as required by NCGS
160A-364, but provided that each advertisement shall not be less than one-half of
a newspaper page in size. The advertisement shall only be effective for property
owners who reside in the area of general circulation of the newspaper which
publishes the notice. Property owners who reside outside of the newspaper
circulation area, according to the address listed on the most recent Scotland County
property tax listing for the affected property, shall be notified according to the
provisions of subsections 4.1.4.2.1 and 4.1.4.2.2.
4.1.4.3. Recommendations of Planning Board. Before an item is placed on the
consent agenda to schedule a public hearing, the Planning Board's recommendation and
staff report on each proposed zoning amendment must be received by the City Council.
If no recommendation is received from the Planning Board within 60 days from the date
when submitted to the Planning Board, the petitioner may take the proposal to the City
Council without a recommendation from the Planning Board. However, the Planning Board
may request the City Council to delay final action on the amendment until such time as the
Planning Board can present its recommendations. (Amended 6/21/2016)
4.1.4.3.1. After receiving a recommendation from the Planning Board on a
proposed amendment, the City Council may proceed to vote on the proposed
ordinance, refer it to a committee for further study, or take any other action
consistent with its usual rules of procedure.
4.1.4.3.2. The City Council is not required to take final action on a proposed
amendment within any specific period of time, but it should proceed as
expeditiously as practicable on petitions for amendments since inordinate delays can
result in the petitioner incurring unnecessary costs.
April 21, 2015 Page 4-4 Article 4
ARTICLE 4. LEGISLATIVE/QUASI-JUDICIAL PROCEDURES
4.1.4.3.3. No member of the City Council shall vote on any zoning map
amendment or text amendment where the outcome of the matter being considered
is reasonably likely to have a direct, substantial and readily identifiable financial
impact on the member.
4.1.4.3.4. Prior to adopting or rejecting any zoning amendment, the City Council
shall adopt a statement describing whether the action is consistent with the adopted
comprehensive plan and any other applicable officially adopted plans and explaining
why the City Council considers the action taken to be reasonable and in the public
interest. The statement of consistency must specifically state why the proposed
amendment is consistent or inconsistent with the Comprehensive Plan. The
Planning Board and staff recommendations must be recorded in the City Council
minutes of the meeting at which Council action was taken. (Amended 6/21/2016)
4.1.4.3.5. The City Council shall adopt a statement of reasonableness for all small
scale re-zonings as defined by the state statutes.
4.1.4.3.6. In deciding whether to adopt a proposed amendment to this Ordinance,
the central issue before the City Council is whether the proposed amendment
advance the public health, safety, or welfare. All other issues are irrelevant and all
information related to other issues at the public hearing may be declared irrelevant
by the Mayor and excluded. When considering proposed map amendments:
4.1.4.3.6.1. The City Council shall not consider any representations made
by the petitioner that, if the change is granted, the rezoned property will be
used for only one of the possible range of uses permitted in the requested
classification. Rather, the City Council shall consider whether the entire
range of permitted uses in the requested classification is more appropriate
than the range of uses in the existing classification.
4.1.4.3.6.2. The City Council shall not regard as controlling any
advantages or disadvantages to the individual requesting the change, but
shall consider the impact of the proposed change on the public at large.
4.1.4.4. Citizen Comments. Zoning ordinances may from time to time be amended,
supplemented, changed, modified, or repealed. If any resident or property owner in the
town submits a written statement regarding a proposed amendment, modification, or
repeal to a zoning ordinance to the Clerk to the Board at least two business days prior to
the proposed vote on such change, the Clerk to the Board shall deliver such written
statement to the City Council. If the proposed change is the subject of a quasi-judicial
proceeding under NCGS 160A-388, the Clerk shall provide only the names and addresses
of the individuals providing written comment, and the provision of such names and
addresses to all members of the Council shall not disqualify any member of the Council
from voting. (Amended 6/21/2016)
April 21, 2015 Page 4-5 Article 4
ARTICLE 4. LEGISLATIVE/QUASI-JUDICIAL PROCEDURES
4.1.4.5. Statement of Consistency. Prior to adopting or rejecting any zoning text
and/or map amendment, the City Council shall adopt a statement describing whether its
action is consistent with an adopted comprehensive plan and explaining why the City
Council considers the action taken to be reasonable and in the public interest. This
statement is not subject to judicial review.
4.1.5. Withdrawal of Application.
An applicant may withdraw his or her application at any time by written notice to the UDO
Administrator and may resubmit at a subsequent date in compliance with the submittal schedule
contained herein.

development plan by the City Council in accordance with the provisions outlined in this
section. A right which has been vested as provided for in this section shall, as a general rule,
remain valid for two (2) years and shall attach to and run with the land. The two (2) years may
be extended up to five (5) years where warranted in light of all relevant circumstances, including,
but not limited to, the size and phasing of development, the level of investment, the need for the
development, economic cycles, and market conditions. These determinations shall be in the sound
discretion of the city.

and phrases defined in this subsection shall have the meaning indicated when used in this section.

4.2.2.3. Site-Specific Development Plan. A site-specific development plan which has
been submitted to the City of Laurinburg by a landowner describing in detail the type and
intensity of use for a specific parcel or parcels of property. Such plan shall be in the form

required by Section 4.5.2 and Section 5.6.4. All site-specific development plans shall be
approved by the City Council.
April 21, 2015 Page 4-6 Article 4
ARTICLE 4. LEGISLATIVE/QUASI-JUDICIAL PROCEDURES
4.2.2.4. Vested Right. The right to undertake and complete the development and use
of property under the terms and conditions of an approved site specific development plan.
4.2.3. A vested right shall be deemed established upon the effective date of approval by the City
Council of a site-specific development plan. Following the approval of a site-specific development
plan, the UDO Administrator shall issue a vested right certificate to the landowner which indicates
the duration of the vesting period, the conditions, if any, imposed on the approval of the sitespecific
development plan, and any other information determined by the UDO Administrator to be
necessary to administer the vested right.
4.2.4. A vested right shall confer upon the landowner the right to undertake and complete the
development and use of the property as delineated in the approved site-specific development plan.
The City Council may approve a site-specific development plan upon such terms and conditions as
may be determined necessary to protect the public health, safety, and welfare. Failure to comply
with the approved terms and conditions shall result in a forfeiture of vested rights.
4.2.5. Approval by the City Council of a site-specific development plan shall follow the procedural
requirements for the issuance of a conditional use permit as outlined in Section 4.5. Changes in
or modifications to an approved site-specific development plan shall be made only with the
concurrence of the City Council in accordance with the provisions of Section 4.5.8.
4.2.6. A vested right obtained under this section runs with the land and is valid for two (2) years
from the effective date of approval by the City Council of a site-specific development plan. A
vested right shall not be extended by any amendments or modifications to an approved sitespecific
development plan unless expressly provided for by the City Council. A vested right shall
expire at the end of two (2) years if no building permit applications have been filed with the city
to construct the use or uses proposed in the approved site-specific development plan. If building
permits are issued, the provisions of GS 160A-418 and GS 160A-422 shall apply, except that a
building permit shall not expire or be revoked because of the lack of progress during the two-year
vesting period.

4.2.7.2. Upon findings, by ordinance after notice and a public hearing, that natural or
man-made hazards in the immediate vicinity of the property, if uncorrected, would pose a
serious threat to the public health, safety, and welfare if the project were to proceed as
contemplated in the site-specific development plan;
April 21, 2015 Page 4-7 Article 4
ARTICLE 4. LEGISLATIVE/QUASI-JUDICIAL PROCEDURES

expenses, and other losses incurred by the landowner, including, but not limited to, all fees
paid in consideration of financing, and all architectural, planning, marketing, legal, and
other consultants fees incurred after approval by the city, together with interest thereon
at the legal rate until paid. Compensation shall not include any diminution in the value of
the property which is caused by such action;
4.2.7.4. Upon findings, by ordinance after notice and a public hearing, that the landowner
or his representative intentionally supplied inaccurate information or made material
misrepresentations which made a difference in the approval by the city of the site-specific
development plan; or
4.2.7.5. Upon the enactment or promulgation of a state or federal law or regulation which
precludes development as contemplated in the site-specific development plan, in which
case the city may modify the affected provisions, upon a finding that the change in state
or federal law has a fundamental effect on the plan, by ordinance after notice and a public
hearing.
4.2.8. The establishment of a vested right shall not preclude the application of overlay zoning
which imposes additional requirements but does not affect the allowable type or intensity of use,
or ordinances or regulations which are general in nature and are applicable to all property subject
to land use regulation by the city, including, but not limited to, building, fire, plumbing, electrical,
and mechanical codes.
4.2.9. Notwithstanding any provisions of this section, the establishment of a vested right shall not
preclude, change, or impair the authority of the city to enforce provisions of this Ordinance
governing nonconforming situations or uses.
4.2.10. A vested right obtained under this section is not a personal right, but shall attach to and
run with the applicable property. After approval of a site-specific development plan, all successors
to the original landowner shall be entitled to exercise such vested rights.
4.2.11. The city shall not require a landowner to waive his vested rights as a condition of
developmental approval.

ARTICLE 4. LEGISLATIVE/QUASI-JUDICIAL PROCEDURES
SECTION 4.4 APPEALS, VARIANCES, AND INTERPRETATIONS.
4.4.1. Appeals.
4.4.1.1. Any person who has standing under GS 160A-393(d) or the city may appeal a
decision to the Board of Adjustment. An appeal is taken by filing a notice of appeal with
the City Clerk. The notice of appeal shall state the grounds for the appeal. A notice of
appeal shall be considered filed with the City Clerk when delivered to the City Hall, and the
date and time of filing shall be entered on the notice by the city staff.
4.4.1.2. The official who made the decision shall give written notice to the owner of the
property that is the subject of the decision and to the party who sought the decision, if
different from the owner. The written notice shall be delivered by personal delivery,
electronic mail, or by first-class mail.
4.4.1.3. The owner or other party shall have thirty (30) days from receipt of the written
notice within which to file an appeal. Any other person with standing to appeal shall have
thirty (30) days from receipt from any source of actual or constructive notice of the decision
within which to file an appeal.
4.4.1.4. It shall be conclusively presumed that all persons with standing to appeal have
constructive notice of the decision from the date a sign containing the words Zoning
Decision or Subdivision Decision in letters at least six inches high and identifying the
means to contact an official for information about the decision is prominently posted on the
property for at least ten (10) days. Posting of signs is not the only form of constructive
notice. Any such posting shall be the responsibility of the landowner or applicant.
Verification of the posting shall be provided to the official who made the decision. Absent
an ordinance provision to the contrary, posting of signs shall not be required.
4.4.1.5. The official who made the decision shall transmit to the Board of Adjustment all
documents and exhibits constituting the record upon which the action appealed from is
taken. The official shall also provide a copy of the record to the appellant and to the owner
of the property that is the subject of the appeal if the appellant is not the owner.
4.4.1.6. An appeal of a notice of violation or other enforcement order stays enforcement
of the action appealed from unless the official who made the decision certifies to the Board
of Adjustment after notice of appeal has been filed that because of the facts stated in an
affidavit, a stay would cause immediate peril to life or property or because the violation is
transitory in nature, a stay would seriously interfere with enforcement of the Ordinance.
In that case, enforcement proceedings shall not be stayed except by a restraining order
which may be granted by a court. If enforcement proceedings are not stayed, the
appellant may file with the official a request for an expedited hearing of the appeal, and the
Board of Adjustment shall meet to hear the appeal within fifteen (15) days after such a
April 21, 2015 Page 4-9 Article 4
ARTICLE 4. LEGISLATIVE/QUASI-JUDICIAL PROCEDURES
request is filed. Notwithstanding the foregoing, appeals of decisions granting permit or
otherwise affirming that a proposed use of property is consistent with the Ordinance shall
not stay the further review of an application for permits or permissions to use such
property; in these situations, the appellant may request and the Board of Adjustment may
grant a stay of a final decision of permit applications or building permits affected by the
issue being appealed.
4.4.1.7. Subject to the provisions of subsection 4.4.1.6., the Board of Adjustment shall
hear and decide the appeal within a reasonable time.
4.4.1.8. The official who made the decision shall be present at the hearing as a witness.
The appellant shall not be limited at the hearing to matters stated in the notice of appeal.
If any party or the city would be unduly prejudiced by the presentation of matters not
presented in the notice of appeal, the Board of Adjustment shall continue the hearing. The
Board of Adjustment may reverse or affirm (wholly or partly) or may modify the decision
appealed from and shall make any order, requirement, decision, or determination that
ought to be made. The Board of Adjustment shall have all the powers of the official who
made the decision.
4.4.1.9. When hearing an appeal pursuant to GS 160A-400.9(e) or any other appeal in
the nature of certiorari, the hearing shall be based on the record below and the scope of
review shall be as provided in GS 160A-393(k).
4.4.1.10. The parties of an appeal that has been made under this subsection may agree
to mediation or other forms of alternative dispute resolution. The Ordinance may set
standards and procedures to facilitate and manage such voluntary alternative dispute
resolution.
4.4.2. Variances.
4.4.2.1. An application for a variance shall be submitted to the Board of Adjustment by
filing a copy of the application with the UDO Administrator. Applications shall be handled
in the same manner as applications for permits.
4.4.2.2. When unnecessary hardships would result from carrying out the strict letter of
the UDO, the Board of Adjustment shall vary any of the provisions of the Ordinance upon
a showing of all of the following:
4.4.2.2.1. Unnecessary hardship would result from the strict application of the
Ordinance. It shall not be necessary to demonstrate that, in the absence of the
variance, no reasonable use can be made of the property.
April 21, 2015 Page 4-10 Article 4
ARTICLE 4. LEGISLATIVE/QUASI-JUDICIAL PROCEDURES
4.4.2.2.2. The hardship results from conditions that are peculiar to the property,
such as location, size, or topography. Hardships resulting from personal
circumstances, as well as hardships resulting from conditions that are common to
the neighborhood or the general public, may not be the basis for granting a
variance.
4.4.2.2.3. The hardship did not result from actions taken by the applicant or the
property owner. The act of purchasing property with knowledge that circumstances
exist that may justify the granting of a variance shall not be regarded as a selfcreated
hardship.
4.4.2.2.4. The requested variance is consistent with the spirit, purpose, and intent
of the Ordinance, such that public safety is secured and substantial justice is
achieved.
4.4.2.3. No change in permitted uses may be authorized by variance. Appropriate
conditions may be imposed on any variance, provided that the conditions are reasonably
related to the variance. Any other ordinance that regulates land use or development may
provide for variances consistent with the provisions of this subsection.
4.4.2.4. The nature of the variance and any conditions attached to it shall be entered on
the face of the zoning permit, or the zoning permit may simply note the issuance of the
variance and refer to the written record of the variance for further information. All such
conditions are enforceable in the same manner as any other applicable requirement of this
Ordinance.
4.4.3. Interpretations.
4.4.3.1. The Board of Adjustment is authorized to interpret the zoning map and to act
upon disputed questions of lot lines or district boundary lines and similar questions. If such
questions arise in the context of an appeal from a decision of the UDO Administrator, they
shall be handled as provided in Section 4.4.1.
4.4.3.2. An application for a map interpretation shall be submitted to the Board of
Adjustment by filing an appeal form with UDO Administrator. The application shall contain
sufficient information to enable the Board of Adjustment to make the necessary
interpretation.
4.4.3.3. Where uncertainty exists as to the boundaries of districts as shown on the Official
Zoning Map, the rules of interpretation as specified in Section 2.5 shall be applied. Where
uncertainties continue to exist after application of the above rules, appeal may be taken to
the Board of Adjustment as provided in Section 4.4.1 of this Ordinance.
April 21, 2015 Page 4-11 Article 4
ARTICLE 4. LEGISLATIVE/QUASI-JUDICIAL PROCEDURES
4.4.3.4. Interpretations of the location of floodway and floodplain boundary lines may be
made by the UDO Administrator as provided in Article 9, Part VIII.

As provided in Article 3, the Planning Board, City Council, and Board of Adjustment (as applicable)
shall hear and decide all applications, appeals, variance requests, and requests for interpretations,

established agenda procedures, provide notice in accordance with Section 4.4.6, and obtain the
necessary information to make sound decisions.
4.4.5. Hearing Required on Appeals, Variances, and Interpretations.

persons interested in the outcome of the appeal or application shall be given an opportunity
to present evidence and arguments. All persons presenting evidence or arguments shall
be sworn in prior to the presentation of any evidence or arguments. The oath may be
administered by the Chairperson, any member acting as Chairperson, or the Clerk to the
Board.
4.4.5.3. The Board of Adjustment may place reasonable and equitable limitations on the
presentation of evidence and arguments and the cross-examination of witnesses so that the
matter at issue may be heard and decided without undue delay.
4.4.5.4. The Board of Adjustment may continue the hearing until a subsequent meeting
and may keep the hearing open to take additional information up to the point a final
decision is made. No further notice of a continued hearing need be published unless a

4.4.5.5. The required application fee and all supporting materials must be received by the
UDO Administrator before an application is considered complete and a hearing scheduled.
4.4.6. Notice of Hearing.
The UDO Administrator shall give notice of any hearing required by Section 4.4.5 as follows:
4.4.6.1. Notice of hearings conducted pursuant to this section shall be mailed to the
person or entity whose appeal, application, or request is the subject of the hearing; to the

hearing.
4.4.6.3. The notice required by this section shall state the date, time, and place of the

a brief description of the action requested or proposed.
4.4.7. Burden of Proof in Appeals and Variances.

ARTICLE 4. LEGISLATIVE/QUASI-JUDICIAL PROCEDURES
any matter coming before the Board. Any person who, while under oath during a
proceeding before the decision-making board, willfully swears falsely is guilty of a Class 1
misdemeanor. (Amended 6/21/2016)
4.4.9.3. All findings and conclusions necessary to the issuance or denial of the requested
permit or appeal (necessary findings) shall be based upon competent, material, and
substantial evidence. The term competent evidence, as used in this subsection, shall not
preclude reliance by the decision-making board on evidence that would not be admissible
under the rules of evidence as applied in the trial division of the General Court of Justice
if (1) the evidence was submitted without objection or (2) the evidence appears to be
sufficiently trustworthy and was admitted under such circumstances that it was reasonable
for the decision-making board to rely upon it. The term competent evidence, as used in
this subsection, shall not be deemed to include the opinion testimony of lay witnesses as
to any of the following:
4.4.9.3.1. The use of property in a particular way would affect the value of other
property.
4.4.9.3.2. The increase in vehicular traffic resulting from a proposed development

inadmissible in a court of law.
4.4.9.7. If a member of the decision-making board has prior or specialized knowledge
about a case, that knowledge should be disclosed to the rest of the decision-making board
and parties at the beginning of the hearing. (Amended 6/21/2016)
4.4.9.8. The decision-making board through the Chairperson, or in the Chairpersons
absence, anyone acting as the Chairperson may subpoena witnesses and compel the
production of evidence. To request issuance of a subpoena, persons with standing under
GS 160A-393(d) may make a written request to the Chairperson explaining why it is
necessary for certain witnesses or evidence to be compelled. The Chairperson shall issue
requested subpoenas he or she determines to be relevant, reasonable in nature and scope,
and not oppressive. The Chairperson shall rule on any motion to quash or modify a
April 21, 2015 Page 4-14 Article 4
ARTICLE 4. LEGISLATIVE/QUASI-JUDICIAL PROCEDURES
subpoena. Decisions regarding subpoenas made by the Chairperson may be appealed to
the full decision-making board. If a person fails or refuses to obey a subpoena issued
pursuant to this subsection, the decision-making board or the party seeking the subpoena
may apply to the General Court of Justice for an order requiring that its subpoena be
obeyed, and the court shall have jurisdiction to issue these orders after notice to all
property parties. (Amended 6/21/2016)
4.4.10. Modification of Application at Hearing.
4.4.10.1. In response to questions or comments made in sworn testimony at the hearing,
the applicant may agree to modify his application, including the plans and specifications
submitted.
4.4.10.2. Unless such modifications are so substantial or extensive that the decisionmaking
board cannot reasonably be expected to perceive the nature and impact of the
proposed changes without revised plans before it, the decision-making board may approve
the application with the stipulation that the permit will not be issued until plans reflecting
the agreed upon changes are submitted to the UDO Administrator. (Amended 6/21/2016)
4.4.11. Record.
4.4.11.1. A record shall be made of all hearings required by Section 4.4.5 and such
recordings shall be kept as provided by state law. Minutes shall also be kept of all such
proceedings. A transcript may be made, but is not required. (Amended 6/21/2016)
4.4.11.2. Whenever practicable, all documentary evidence, including any exhibits,
presented at a hearing as well as all other types of physical evidence shall be made a part
of the record of the proceedings and shall be kept by the city in accordance with NCGS
160A-393(I). (Amended 6/21/2016)
4.4.12. Quasi-Judicial Decision.
The Board shall determine contested facts and make its decision within a reasonable time. Every
quasi-judicial decision shall be based upon competent, material, and substantial evidence in the
record. Each quasi-judicial decision shall be reduced to writing and reflect the Boards
determination of contested facts and their application to the applicable standards. The written
decision shall be signed by the Chair or other duly authorized member of the Board. A quasijudicial
decision is effective upon filing the written decision within the Clerk to the Board or such
other office or official as this Ordinance species. The decision of the Board shall be delivered by
personal delivery, electronic mail, or by first-class mail to the applicant, property owner, and to any
person who has submitted a written request for a copy, prior to the date the decision becomes
effective. The person required to provide notice shall certify that proper notice has been made.

SECTION 4.5 CONDITIONAL USE PERMITS.
4.5.1. Purpose and Applicability.
This Ordinance provides for a number of uses to be located by right in each general zoning district
subject to the use meeting certain area, height, yard, and off-street parking and loading
requirements. In addition to these uses, this Ordinance allows some uses to be allowed in these
districts as a conditional use subject to issuance of a conditional use permit by the City Council
upon recommendation of the Planning Board. City Council consideration of conditional use permits
are quasi-judicial decisions. The purpose of having the uses being conditional is to ensure that
they would be compatible with surrounding development and in keeping with the purposes of the
general zoning district in which they are located and would meet other criteria as set forth in this
section. All conditional use permits require some form of a site plan as outlined in Section 5.6.4.
(Amended 6/21/2016)
4.5.2. Application Process/Completeness.
4.5.2.1. The deadline for which a conditional use permit application shall be filed with the
UDO Administrator is twenty (20) calendar days prior to the meeting at which the
application will be heard. Permit application forms shall be provided by the UDO
Administrator. In the course of evaluating the proposed conditional use, the Planning
Board or City Council may request additional information from the applicant. A request for
any additional information may stay any further consideration of the application by the
Planning Board or City Council.
4.5.2.2. No application shall be deemed complete unless it contains or is accompanied by
a site plan drawn to scale which complies with the requirements contained in Section 5.6.4
and a fee, in accordance with a fee schedule approved by the City Council for the submittal
of conditional use permit applications.
4.5.2.3. One (1) hard copy of the application, and all attachments and maps, for a
conditional use permit shall be submitted to the UDO Administrator.
4.5.3. Planning Board Review and Comment.
4.5.3.1. The Planning Board may, in its review, suggest reasonable conditions to the
location, nature, and extent of the proposed use and its relationship to surrounding
properties, parking areas, driveways, pedestrian and vehicular circulation systems,
screening and landscaping, timing of development, and any other conditions the Planning
Board may find appropriate. The conditions may include dedication of any rights-of-way
or easements for streets, water, sewer, or other public utilities necessary to serve the
proposed development.
April 21, 2015 Page 4-16 Article 4
ARTICLE 4. LEGISLATIVE/QUASI-JUDICIAL PROCEDURES
4.5.3.2. The Planning Board shall forward its recommendation to the City Council within
45 days of reviewing the application. If a recommendation is not made within 45 days, the
application shall be forwarded to the City Council without a recommendation from the
Planning Board.
4.5.3.3. All comments prepared by the Planning Board shall be submitted by a Planning
Board representative to the City Council as testimony at the public hearing required by this
section. This representative of the Planning Board shall be subject to the same scrutiny as
other witnesses. Review of the conditional use application by the Planning Board shall not
be a quasi-judicial procedure. The Planning Board shall include in its comments a
statement as to the consistency of the application with the citys currently adopted
Comprehensive Plan. Comments of the Planning Board may be considered with other
evidence submitted at the public hearing. (Amended 6/21/2016)
4.5.4. City Council Action.
4.5.4.1. City Council consideration of conditional use permits are quasi-judicial decisions
approved by a simple majority vote. Quasi-judicial decisions must be conducted in
accordance with Sections 4.4.9 through 4.4.12. For the purposes of this section, vacant
positions on the City Council and members who are disqualified from voting on a quasijudicial
matter shall not be considered members of the Council for calculation of the
requisite majority if there are no qualified alternates available to take the place of such
members.
4.5.4.2. Once the comments of the Planning Board have been made, or the 45-day period
elapses without a recommendation, the City Council shall hold a public hearing to consider
the application at its next regularly scheduled meeting. A quorum of the City Council is
required for this hearing. Notice of the public hearing shall be as specified in Section 4.4.6.
(Amended 6/21/2016)
4.5.4.3. In approving an application for a conditional use permit in accordance with the
principles, conditions, safeguards, and procedures specified herein, the City Council may
impose reasonable and appropriate conditions and safeguards upon the approval. The
petitioner will have a reasonable opportunity to consider and respond to any additional
requirements prior to approval or denial by the City Council. Conditions and safeguards
imposed under this subsection shall not include requirements for which the city does not
have authority under statute to regulate nor requirements for which the courts have held
to be unenforceable if imposed directly by the city. (Amended 6/21/2016)
4.5.4.4. The applicant has the burden of producing competent, material and substantial
evidence tending to establish the facts and conditions which subsection 4.5.4.5 below

not be detrimental to or endanger the public health, safety, or general welfare.
4.5.4.5.2. The conditional use will not be injurious to the use and enjoyment of
other property in the immediate vicinity for the purposes already permitted, nor
diminish or impair property values within the neighborhood.
4.5.4.5.3. The establishment of the conditional use will not impede the normal
and orderly development and improvement of the surrounding property for uses
permitted in the district.
4.5.4.5.4. The exterior architectural appeal and functional plan of any proposed
structure will not be so at variance with either the exterior architectural appeal and
functional plan of the structures already constructed or in the course of construction
in the immediate neighborhood or the character of the applicable district, as to
cause a substantial depreciation in the property values within the neighborhood.
4.5.4.5.5. Adequate utilities, access roads, drainage, parking, or necessary
facilities have been or are being provided.
4.5.4.5.6. Adequate measures have been or will be taken to provide ingress and

4.5.4.5.7. The conditional use shall, in all other respects, conform to all the
applicable regulations of the district in which it is located.
4.5.4.5.8. Public access shall be provided in accordance with the
recommendations of the citys land use plan and access plan or the present amount

ARTICLE 4. LEGISLATIVE/QUASI-JUDICIAL PROCEDURES
which conditional uses are granted, the City Council shall require guarantees as specified
in Section 5.7.4.7.1.1 or 5.7.4.7.1.2 to ensure compliance with the conditional use permit
conditions. The reasons/justifications for conditions must be stated/tied to Section 4.5.4.5.
(Amended 6/21/2016)
4.5.4.7. In the event that a rezoning is sought in conjunction with a conditional use
permit, such deliberation would be legislative in nature and not part of the quasi-judicial
process.
4.5.5. Effect of Approval.
If an application for a conditional use permit is approved by the City Council, the owner of the
property shall have the ability to develop the use in accordance with the stipulations contained in

4.5.6. Binding Effect.
Any conditional use permit so authorized shall be binding to the property included in the permit

4.5.9.1.2. Will not injure the value of adjoining or abutting property;
April 21, 2015 Page 4-19 Article 4
ARTICLE 4. LEGISLATIVE/QUASI-JUDICIAL PROCEDURES
4.5.9.1.3. Will be in harmony with the existing development and uses within the
area in which it is to be located; and
4.5.9.1.4. Will be in conformity with the land use plan, thoroughfare plan, or other
plan officially adopted by the City Council.
4.5.9.2. The City Council may not attach additional conditions that modify or alter the
specific requirements set forth in this Ordinance unless the development in question

enforceable in the same manner and to the same extent as any other applicable
requirements of this Ordinance.
4.5.10. Implementation of Conditional Use Permit.

a period not to exceed six months by the UDO Administrator. No further extension shall be added
except on approval of the City Council. If such use or business is discontinued for a period of 12
months, the conditional use permit shall expire. Any expiration as noted or any violation of the
conditions stated on the permit shall be considered unlawful and the applicant will be required to
submit a new conditional use application to the appropriate agencies for consideration and the
previously approved conditional use permit shall become null and void.

alteration, excavation, demolition, or similar work on any development authorized by such
April 21, 2015 Page 4-20 Article 4
ARTICLE 4. LEGISLATIVE/QUASI-JUDICIAL PROCEDURES
permits has been completed on the site. With respect to phased development, this
requirement shall apply only to the first phase.
4.6.2. If after some physical alteration to land or structures begins and such work is discontinued
for a period of six (6) months, then the zoning or conditional use permit authorizing such work
shall immediately expire. However, expiration of the permit shall not affect the provisions of
Section 4.7.
4.6.3. The permit-issuing authority may extend for a period up to six (6) months the date when
a zoning or conditional use permit would otherwise expire pursuant to subsections 4.6.1 or 4.6.2
if it concludes that (i) the permit has not yet expired, (ii) the permit recipient has proceeded with
due diligence and in good faith, and (iii) conditions have not changed so substantially as to warrant
a new application. Successive extensions may be granted for periods up to six (6) months (for a
total period not to exceed two (2) years) upon the same findings. All such extensions may be
granted without resort to the formal processes and fees required for a new permit.
4.6.4. For purposes of this section, the conditional use permit within the jurisdiction of the board

delivery is accomplished when the permit is hand delivered or mailed to the permit
applicant; or
4.6.4.2. The UDO Administrator notifies the permit applicant that the application has been
approved and that all that remains before a fully executed permit can be delivered is for
the applicant to take certain specified actions, such as having the permit executed by the
property owner so it can be recorded if required.

shall be applicable to permits issued prior to the date this section becomes effective.
4.6.6. Conditional use permits shall expire at the end of the two-year vesting period established
in accordance with Section 4.2, Vested Right.
SECTION 4.7 EFFECT OF PERMIT ON SUCCESSORS AND ASSIGNS.
4.7.1. Zoning and conditional use permits authorize the permittee to make use of land and
structures in a particular way. Such permits are transferable. However, so long as the land or
structures or any portion thereof covered under a permit continues to be used for the purposes for
which the permit was granted, then:
April 21, 2015 Page 4-21 Article 4
ARTICLE 4. LEGISLATIVE/QUASI-JUDICIAL PROCEDURES
4.7.1.1. No person (including successors or assigns of the person who obtained the
permit) may make use of the land or structures covered under such permit for the purposes
authorized in the permit except in accordance with all the terms and requirements of that
permit; and
4.7.1.2. The terms and requirements of the permit apply to and restrict the use of land
or structures covered under the permit, not only with respect to all persons having any
interest in the property at the time the permit was obtained, but also with respect to
persons who subsequently obtain any interest in all or part of the covered property and
wish to use it for or in connection with purposes other than those for which the permit was
originally issued, so long as the persons who subsequently obtain an interest in the
property had actual or record notice (as provided in subsection 4.7.2) of the existence of
the permit at the time they acquired their interest.

ARTICLE 5. DEVELOPMENT REVIEW PROCESS
SECTION 5.1 APPLICABILITY.
5.1.1. The purpose of this Article is to establish an orderly process to develop land within the City
of Laurinburg. It is also the intent of this Article to provide a clear and comprehensible
development process that is fair and equitable to all interests including the petitioners, affected
neighbors, city staff, related agencies, the Planning Board, and the City Council. Approved plans
shall be the guiding documents for final approval and permitting.
5.1.2. The development review process applies to all development actions within the planning
jurisdiction except for existing individual lots for single-family detached residential and two-family
residential (duplex) development. The provisions of this Article shall be applicable for all Minor and
Major Subdivisions and Minor and Major Site Plans. The UDO Administrator may waive the required
development review process only in the following cases when he determines that the submission
of a development plan in accordance with this Article would serve no useful purpose:
5.1.2.1. Accessory structures.
5.1.2.2. Any enlargement of a principal building by less than 20% of its existing size
provided such enlargement will not result in parking or landscaping improvements.
5.1.2.3. A change in principal use where such change would not result in a change in lot
coverage, parking, or other site characteristics.
5.1.3. If a permit applicant submits a permit application for any type of development and a rule
or ordinance changes between the time the permit application was submitted and a permit decision
is made, the permit applicant may choose which version of the rule or ordinance will apply to the
permit. (Amended 6/21/2016)
5.1.4. The city may enter into a development agreement with a developer for the development
of property as provided in this section for developable property of any size, including property that
is subject to an executed brownfields agreement pursuant to Part 5 of Article 9 of Chapter 130A
of the NC General Statutes. Development agreements shall be of a reasonable term specified in

minor and major site plans. The Sketch Plan shall meet the requirements of Section 5.2.3. The
UDO Administrator will advise the applicant of all applicable city regulations and policies, suggest
development alternatives, application procedures, and fees (see Section 2.8). The pre-application
meeting is a non-binding and informal review of a development proposal intended to provide
information to the applicant on the procedures and policies of the City of Laurinburg and does not
confer upon the applicant any development rights. The UDO Administrator may submit a Sketch

or authorized staff reviewer into the development plan before submittal. The sketch plan is only
a courtesy intended to inform the applicant of the approval criteria prior to submittal of the
development plan; furthermore, sketch plan review does not constitute approval of the
development plan and may not be substituted for any required approvals.
5.2.3. Three copies of the sketch plan, drawn to scale, shall be submitted, including the following:

5.6.6. Inspections and Certificates of Occupancy.
No new building, or part thereof, shall be occupied, and no addition or enlargement of any existing
building shall be occupied, and no existing building after being altered or moved shall be occupied,
and no change of use shall be made in any existing building or part thereof, until the Building
Inspector has issued a Certificate of Occupancy.
A certificate of occupancy shall be applied for subsequent to or concurrent with the application for
a certificate of zoning compliance and shall be issued within five (5) business days after the erection
or structural alteration of such building or part shall have been completed in conformity with the
provisions of this Ordinance. A temporary certificate of occupancy for a portion of a structure may
be issued for a portion or portions of a building which may safely be occupied prior to final
completion and occupancy of the entire building or for other temporary uses. A certificate of
occupancy shall not be issued unless the proposed use of a building or land conforms to the
applicable provisions of this Ordinance. If the certificate of occupancy is denied, the Building
Inspector shall state in writing the reasons for refusal and the applicant shall be notified of the
refusal. A record of all certificates shall be kept on file in the office of the Building Inspector for a
period of time in accordance with the NC Department of Cultural Resources requirements
(NCGS 132-8) and copies shall be furnished on request to any persons having a proprietary or
tenancy interest in the building or land involved.
For all developments, excluding single-family residential uses, prior to the issuance of a certificate
of occupancy by the Building Inspector, a final zoning inspection shall be conducted to ensure that
the approved plan has been followed and all required improvements have been installed to city
standards. The City Council must have accepted all publicly dedicated improvements contingent
upon the recordation of the final plat or provision of performance guarantees approved by the City
Council as specified in Section 5.7.4.7.
For Major Sites Plans, an as-built survey and as-built construction drawings shall be submitted to
the UDO Administrator by the developer upon completion of the building foundation(s) to ensure
that setbacks and building orientation match the approved site plan. If the survey shows that the
placement of the building is incorrect, then the UDO Administrator shall issue a stop-work order and
all construction shall be halted until the problem is remedied.

SECTION 5.7 SUBDIVISION PROCEDURES.
5.7.1. Subdivision Exceptions.
This section shall be applicable to all subdivisions except those which are exempt in accordance
with Section 1.3, page 1-2. The City Council may authorize exceptions for subdivisions from any
portion of this Ordinance when, in its opinion, undue hardship may result from their strict
compliance. In granting an exception, the City Council shall hold a quasi-judicial public hearing and
make the findings required herein, taking into account the nature of the proposed subdivision, the
existing use of land in the vicinity, the number of persons to reside or work in the proposed
subdivision and the probable effect of the proposed subdivision upon traffic conditions in the
vicinity. No relief shall be granted unless it is found:
5.7.1.1. That there are special circumstances or conditions affecting said property such
that the strict application of the provisions of this Ordinance would deprive the applicant of
the reasonable use of his land; and
5.7.1.2. That the relief is necessary for the preservation and enjoyment of a substantial
property right of the petitioner; and
5.7.1.3. That the circumstances giving rise to the need for the relief are peculiar to the
subdivision and are not generally characteristic of other subdivisions in the jurisdiction of
this Ordinance; and
5.7.1.4. That the granting of the relief will not be detrimental to the public health, safety,
and welfare or injurious to other property in the area in which said property is situated.
Every decision of the City Council pertaining to the granting of subdivision exceptions shall be
subject to review by the Superior Court Division of the General Courts of Justice of the State of
North Carolina by proceedings in the nature of certiorari. Any petition for review by the Superior
Court shall be duly verified and filed with the Clerk of Superior Court within 30 days after the
decision of the City Council is filed in the office of the UDO Administrator, or after a written copy
thereof is delivered to every aggrieved party who has filed a written request for such copy with the
UDO Administrator at the time of the City Councils hearing of the case, whichever is later.
5.7.2. Pre-Application Meeting and Sketch Plan.
The applicant shall schedule a pre-application meeting with the UDO Administrator to review a
Sketch Plan of the proposed subdivision in accordance with Section 5.2. The UDO Administrator
will determine if the subdivision constitutes a Major or Minor Subdivision, in accordance with the
definitions in Appendix A, and advise the applicant of all applicable city regulations and policies,
application procedures, and fees.

informally review the proposal.
5.7.3.2. After this initial review has been completed, the subdivider or his authorized
representative shall prepare a final plat as specified in Section 9.48 and submit it to the
UDO Administrator. At the time of submission, the subdivider shall pay to the city an
application fee as established by the City Council in accordance with Section 2.8. Refer to
Section 9.49 for plat requirements.

of the preliminary plat to the UDO Administrator at least 14 days prior to a regular
meeting of the Planning Board. During this period, the UDO Administrator shall
evaluate the plan to determine whether or not it meets the requirements of this
Ordinance. The UDO Administrator may receive comments from other persons or
agencies before making its final recommendations.
5.7.4.1.3. After the UDO Administrator determines that the preliminary plat meets
the requirements of this Ordinance, it shall be submitted to the Planning Board for

notice on the site proposed for subdivision or on an adjacent public street or
highway right-of-way at least ten days prior to the Planning Board meeting. The
Planning Board shall forward its recommendation to the City Council within 45 days
after first consideration by them. If the Planning Board fails to act within the 45-day
period, the subdivider may appeal directly to the City Council. The City Council shall

authorized agent shall pay the city an application fee as established by the City
Council in accordance with Section 2.8. Refer to Section 9.49 for plat requirements.
5.7.4.2.2. Within 24 months after approval of the preliminary plat by the City

installed as called for in the approved preliminary plat or a surety bond or similar
financial instrument has been approved by the City Council, in accordance with
Section 5.7.4.7 for the subdivision. The UDO Administrator shall determine whether
or not the final plat substantially agrees with the approved preliminary plan. If
substantial differences exist, the UDO Administrator may deny the final plat and
require that a new preliminary plat be submitted. If the plat substantially agrees
with the preliminary plat, the UDO Administrator shall approve the final plat within
thirty (30) days after first consideration, if the City Council has accepted the publicly
dedicated improvements or approved a performance bond. Only after the final plat
has been approved and recorded at the Scotland County Register of Deeds office
shall any lots be transferred or conveyed. The plat must be recorded within 30 days
after approval.

ARTICLE 5. DEVELOPMENT REVIEW PROCESS
5.7.4.3. Time Limitation/Approval of Preliminary Plat. Preliminary plat approval
shall be valid for two (2) years unless a greater time period is granted through a Vested
Rights request. If final plat approval has not been obtained within said two (2) year period,
preliminary plat approval shall become void. A new preliminary plat shall be required to be
submitted and such plat shall be in conformity with all current and applicable standards in
this Ordinance. Notwithstanding, the developer may submit a request to the UDO
Administrator for a time extension for up to one (1) year for final plat submittal. Said
request must be submitted to the UDO Administrator prior to the original plat expiration
date. No more than one (1) such extension may be granted by the UDO Administrator per
subdivision. The developer may submit a final plat for only a portion of the subdivision
given preliminary plat approval. Said submission shall extend the expiration date for the
remaining portion(s) of the subdivision for an additional two (2) years past the date of said
final plat approval.
5.7.4.4. As-Built Drawing Submittal. Prior to final plat approval or release of
performance guarantees, As-Built Drawings shall be submitted and administratively
approved. The preliminary plat may be altered by no more than 10% of the total
subdivision area due to issues discovered during the As-Built Drawing process. If changes
to more than 10% of the total subdivision area result, a new preliminary plat shall be
submitted and reviewed.
5.7.4.5. Property Owners Association Covenants Review. Prior to approval of any
final plat for a major subdivision, the UDO Administrator shall review the covenants of the
Property Owners Association to ensure compliance with city requirements. The covenants
shall include provisions for the ownership and maintenance of private streets. The UDO
Administrator may refer the covenants to the City Attorney for review.
5.7.4.6. Improvement Plans Approved Prior to Construction. All plans and
specifications for site improvements, including but not limited to grading, drainage,
sidewalks, utilities (water and sewer), and street improvements shall be inspected and
approved by the city prior to construction.
5.7.4.7. Performance Guarantees. In lieu of requiring the completion, installation and
dedication of all improvements prior to final plat approval, the City of Laurinburg may enter
into an agreement with the subdivider whereby the subdivider shall agree to complete any
remaining required improvements as specified by the approved preliminary plat for that
portion of the subdivision to be shown on the final plat within a mutually agreed upon
specified time period not to exceed one (1) year. Once agreed upon by both parties and
the security required herein is provided, the final plat may be approved by the City Council,
if all other requirements of this Ordinance are met. The city shall require a certified cost
estimate from a licensed contractor or engineer for the cost of completion of such
improvements.
April 21, 2015 Page 5-19 Article 5
ARTICLE 5. DEVELOPMENT REVIEW PROCESS
5.7.4.7.1. The subdivider shall provide one of the following Performance
Guarantees, elected at the subdividers discretion, in lieu of installation:
5.7.4.7.1.1. Surety bond issued by any company authorized to do business
in this State.
5.7.4.7.1.2. Letter of credit issued by any financial institution licensed to
do business in this State.
5.7.4.7.1.3. Other form of guarantee that provides equivalent security to
a surety bond or letter of credit. (Amended 6/21/2016)
5.7.4.7.2. The performance guarantee shall be returned or released, as
appropriate, in a timely manner upon the acknowledgment by the city that the
improvements for which the performance guarantee is being required are complete.
If the improvements are not complete and the current performance guarantee is
expiring, the performance guarantee shall be extended, or a new performance
guarantee issued, for an additional period until such required improvements are
complete. A developer shall demonstrate reasonable, good faith progress toward
completion of the required improvements that are the subject of the performance
guarantee or any extension. The form of any extension shall remain at the election
of the developer. (Amended 6/21/2016)
5.7.4.7.3. The amount of the performance guarantee shall not exceed one
hundred twenty-five percent (125%) of the reasonably estimated cost of completion
at the time the performance guarantee is issued. Any extension of the performance
guarantee necessary to complete required improvements shall not exceed one
hundred twenty-five percent (125%) of the reasonably estimated cost of completion
of the remaining incomplete improvements still outstanding at the time the
extension is obtained. (Amended 6/21/2016)
5.7.4.7.4. The performance guarantee shall only be used for completion of the
required improvements and not for repairs or maintenance after completion.
(Amended 6/21/2016)
5.7.4.7.5. The city may release a portion of any security posted as the
improvements are completed and recommended for approval by the UDO
Administrator. Within thirty (30) days after receiving the UDO Administrators
recommendation, the City Council shall approve or not approve said improvements.

any security posted.
April 21, 2015 Page 5-20 Article 5
ARTICLE 5. DEVELOPMENT REVIEW PROCESS
5.7.4.7.6. For subdivisions which are underwritten or constructed with federal
funds and for which the specifications for facilities or improvements are equal to or
of a higher standard than those required by the city, the bond-posting requirement
may be waived and the final plat approved prior to completion of facilities or
improvements.
5.7.4.8. Transfer of Lots in Unapproved Subdivision Plats. Any person who, being
the owner or agent of the owner of any land located within the jurisdiction of the city,
thereafter subdivides his land in violation of applicable city ordinances or transfers or sells
land by reference to, exhibition of, or any other use of a plat showing a subdivision of the
land before the plat has been properly approved under applicable city ordinances and
recorded in the office of the Scotland County Register of Deeds, shall be guilty of a Class
1 misdemeanor. The description by metes and bounds in the instrument of transfer or
other document used in the process of selling or transferring land shall not exempt the
transaction from this penalty. The city may bring an action for injunction of any illegal
subdivision, transfer, conveyance, or sale of land, and the court shall, upon appropriate
findings, issue an injunction and order requiring the offending party to comply with the
subdivision ordinance. Building permits required pursuant to NCGS 160A-417 may be
denied for lots that have been illegally subdivided. In addition to other remedies, the city
may institute any appropriate action or proceedings to prevent the unlawful subdivision of
land, to restrain, correct, or abate the violation, or to prevent any illegal act or conduct.
5.7.5. Procedure for Plat Recordation.
After the effective date of this Ordinance, no subdivision plat of land within the citys jurisdiction
shall be filed or recorded until it has been submitted to and approved by the appropriate agencies,
and until this approval is entered in writing on the face of the plat by the chairperson or head of
that agency. All publicly dedicated improvements must be accepted by the City Council contingent
upon final plat recordation or acceptance of an approved performance bond.
A plat shall not be filed or recorded by the Scotland County Register of Deeds of any subdivision
located within the citys jurisdiction that has not been approved in accordance with this Ordinance,
nor shall the Clerk of Superior Court order or direct the recording of a plat if the recording would
be in conflict with the requirements of this Ordinance.
5.7.6. Issuance of Permits and Conveyance of Subdivision Lots.
Zoning permits and building permits may be issued by the City of Laurinburg for the erection of any
building on any lot within a proposed subdivision prior to the final plat of said subdivision being
approved in a manner as prescribed by this Ordinance and recorded at the Register of Deeds office,
provided an improvements permit has been issued by the Scotland County Health Department, if
required. A certificate of occupancy may not be issued until the final plat has been
approved and recorded.
April 21, 2015 Page 5-21 Article 5
ARTICLE 5. DEVELOPMENT REVIEW PROCESS
After the effective date of this Ordinance, it shall be illegal for any person being the owner or agent
of the owner of any land located within the territorial jurisdiction of this Ordinance, to subdivide his
land in violation of this Ordinance or to transfer or sell land by reference to, exhibition of, or any
other use of a plat showing a subdivision of the land before the plat has been properly approved
under the terms of this Ordinance.
The description by metes and bounds in the instrument of transfer or other document used in the
process of selling or transferring land shall not exempt the transaction from this penalty. The City
Council, through its attorney or other official so designated, may enjoin an illegal subdivision,
transfer or sale of land by action for injunction. Further, violators of this Ordinance shall be subject,
upon conviction, to fine and/or imprisonment as provided by NCGS 14-4. Civil penalties may be
issued in accordance with Section 1.5.
5.7.7. School Site Reservation.
If the City Council and the Scotland County Board of Education have jointly determined the specific
location and size of any school sites to be reserved in accordance with the City of Laurinburg
Comprehensive Plan, staff shall immediately notify the Board of Education in writing whenever a
sketch plan for a subdivision is submitted which includes all or part of a school site to be reserved.
The Board of Education shall promptly decide whether it still wishes the site to be reserved. If the
Board of Education does wish to reserve the site, the subdivision shall not be approved without
such reservation. The Board of Education shall then have 18 months beginning on the date of final
approval of the subdivision within which to acquire the site by purchase or by initiating
condemnation proceedings. If the Board of Education has not purchased or begun proceedings to
condemn the site within 18 months, the developer may treat the land as freed of the reservation.

ARTICLE 6. ZONING DISTRICTS
SECTION 6.1 ESTABLISHMENT OF ZONING DISTRICTS.
In accordance with the requirements of NCGS 160A-382 that zoning regulation be by districts, the
City of Laurinburg, as shown on the Zoning Map, is hereby divided into districts which shall be
governed by all of the uniform use and dimensional requirements of this Ordinance. In the
creation of the respective districts, careful consideration is given to the peculiar suitability of each
and every district for the particular regulations applied thereto, and the necessary, proper, and
comprehensive groupings and arrangements of various uses and densities of population in
accordance with a well considered comprehensive plan for the physical development of the area.
The purposes of establishing the zoning districts are:
 To implement adopted plans;
 To promote public health, safety, and general welfare;
 To provide for orderly growth and development;
 To provide for the efficient use of resources;
 To facilitate the adequate provision of services.
SECTION 6.2 INTERPRETATION.
6.2.1. Zoning districts have uses specified as permitted by right, conditional uses, and uses
permitted with supplemental regulations. Detailed use tables are provided in Section 6.5 showing
the uses allowed in each district. The following describes the processes of each of the categories
that the uses are subject to:
 Permitted by Right: Administrative review and approval subject to district
provisions and other applicable requirements only.
 Permitted with Supplemental Regulations: Administrative review and approval
subject to district provisions, other applicable requirements, and supplemental
regulations outlined in Article 7.
 Conditional Uses: Planning Board review and recommendation, City Council
review and approval of Conditional Use Permit subject to district provisions, other
applicable requirements, and conditions of approval as specified in Section 4.5.
Some Conditional Uses may also be subject to supplemental regulations outlined in
Article 7.
6.2.2. If a use cannot be interpreted by the UDO Administrator for inclusion in the Table of Uses
and Activities (Section 6.5) as provided for in 6.2.1, that use shall be prohibited. Section 6.5 (Table
of Uses and Activities) shall not be interpreted to allow a use in one zoning district when the use
in question is more closely related to another specified use that is permissible in other zoning
districts.
April 21, 2015 Page 6-2 Article 6
ARTICLE 6. ZONING DISTRICTS
6.2.3. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing provisions, the following uses are

any highly combustible or explosive materials in violation of the citys fire prevention code.
6.2.3.2. Stockyards, slaughterhouses, rendering plants.
6.2.3.3. Use of a travel trailer as a temporary or permanent residence. Situations that do
not comply with this subsection on the effective date of this Ordinance are required to
conform within one year.

Federal statutes.
SECTION 6.3 PRIMARY ZONING DISTRICTS.
For the purposes of this Ordinance, the City of Laurinburg, North Carolina is hereby divided into
the following primary zoning districts:
6.3.1. RA-20 MH Residential District.
The RA-20 MH district is established as a district in which the principal use of land is for lowdensity,

April 21, 2015 Page 6-3 Article 6
ARTICLE 6. ZONING DISTRICTS
6.3.5. R-6 MH Residential District.
The R-6 MH district is established to allow a variety of single-family residences (including
manufactured homes), two-family residences, and multi-family residences at a medium density

retail land uses. In addition, a variety of residential uses, ranging in density from approximately
7 dwelling units per acre to 12 dwelling units per acre are permitted within the OI district. The
major objectives of this district are to (1) encourage land uses which serve as an adequate buffer
between intensive non-residential uses and residential uses; (2) provide aesthetic controls and
dimensional requirements to ensure compatible office and service development with surrounding
residential uses; and (3) encourage a mixture of medium-density residential uses with offices and
services.
6.3.7. CB Central Business District.
The CB district is established as a district in which to accommodate a wide variety of commercial
activities (particularly those that are pedestrian-oriented) in an intensive development pattern in
the citys central business district. The regulations of this district are intended to (1) preserve the
general character and integrity of the current development in the central business district; (2)
encourage land uses which provide for a multi-purpose central business district including retail,
offices, services, entertainment, and living space; (3) encourage land uses which do not require
large amounts of outdoor use areas; (4) encourage common or shared off-street parking; and (5)
encourage the continued use of land for governmental activities.
6.3.8 GB General Business District.
The GB district is established as a district in which to accommodate highway-oriented retail and
commercial service businesses which generally have as their market area the entire city and
surrounding area. The major objectives of this district are to (1) encourage planned commercial
and office parks; (2) discourage small lot development on major highways; (3) encourage vehicular
access from service drives and other local commercial streets rather than directly from arterial
streets; and (4) provide a location for major shopping facilities and land uses requiring large
outdoor spaces.
6.3.9. I Industrial District.
The I district is established as a district in which to allow primarily light manufacturing, assembly,
research, warehousing, and intensive commercial uses. The regulations of this district are intended
to (1) encourage light manufacturing and intensive commercial uses as well as accessory land uses
incidental to and in support of manufacturing uses; (2) exclude heavy industry, hazardous waste
management facilities, major retail, and residences as acceptable land uses; and (3) preserve
locations that are best suited for industrial development. Land uses in the I district are limited to
those determined to be compatible with the character of the community.

ARTICLE 6. ZONING DISTRICTS
SECTION 6.4 OVERLAY DISTRICTS ESTABLISHED.
6.4.1. One special control overlay district is hereby established: FHO (Flood Hazard Overlay). This
special control overlay district is intended to be superimposed over the underlying general zoning
district and the land so encumbered may be used in a manner permitted in the underlying district
only if and to the extent such use is also permitted in the applicable overlay district.
6.4.2. The FHO district is established as an overlay district of all general zoning districts for the
purpose of protecting people and property from the hazards of flooding. The flood hazard districts
are further described in Article 9, Part VIII of this Ordinance.

SECTION 6.6 NOTES TO THE TABLE OF USES AND ACTIVITIES.
6.6.1. Permissible Uses Not Requiring Permits
Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Ordinance, no zoning or conditional use permit is
necessary for the following uses:
6.6.1.1. Streets.
6.6.1.2. Electric power, telephone, telegraph, cable television, gas, water, and sewer
lines, wires, or pipes, together with supporting poles or structures, located within a public
right-of-way or easement.
6.6.1.3. Neighborhood utility facilities located within a public right-of-way with the
permission of the owner (state or city) of the right-of-way or easement.
An encroachment agreement, however, shall be obtained from the Engineering Office of the City
of Laurinburg prior to the commencement of utility work within a city-owned right-of-way or
easement.
6.6.2. Change in Use
6.6.2.1. A substantial change in use of property occurs whenever the essential character
or nature of the activity conducted on a lot changes. This occurs whenever:
6.6.2.1.1. The change involves a change from one principal use category to
another.
6.6.2.1.2. If the original use is a planned residential development, the relative
proportions of different types of dwelling units change.
6.6.2.1.3. If there is only one business or enterprise conducted on the lot, that
business or enterprise moves out and a different type of enterprise moves in. For
example, if there is only one building on a lot and a florist shop that is the sole
tenant of that building moves out and is replaced by a a clothing store, that
constitutes a change in use even though both tenants fall within the Retail Sales
and Services classification. However, if the florist shop were replaced by another
florist shop, that would not constitute a change in use since the type of business or
enterprise would not have changed. Moreover, if the florist shop moved out of a
rented space in a shopping center and was replaced by a clothing store, that would
not constitute a change in use since there is more than one business on the lot and
the essential character of the activity conducted on that lot (shopping center) has
not changed.
April 21, 2015 Page 6-19 Article 6
ARTICLE 6. ZONING DISTRICTS
6.6.2.2. A mere change in the status of property from unoccupied ro occupied or vice
versa does not constitute a change in use. Whether a change in use occurs shall be
determined by comparing the two active uses of the property without regard to any
intervening period during which the property may have been unoccupied, unless the
property has remained unoccupied for more than 180 consecutive days or has been
abandoned.
6.6.2.3. A mere change in ownership of a business or enterprise or a change in the name
shall not be regarded as a change in use.

ARTICLE 6. ZONING DISTRICTS
SECTION 6.8 NOTES TO THE TABLE OF AREA, YARD, AND HEIGHT REQUIREMENTS.
6.8.1. Minimum Lot Size
The minimum lot sizes set forth in Section 6.7 are permissible only if and to the extent that
adequate water and sewer facilities are or can be made available to serve every lot in accordance
with the provisions of Article 9, Part VII of this Ordinance. For example, in some areas zones R-20
that are not served by public sewer, lots may have to exceed the 20,000 square feet minimum
required in order to accommodate septic tanks. In such cases and in cases where lots of less than
15,000 square feet are proposed and such lots do not have access to a sewage treatment facility
or county sewer lines, the Health Department - Environmental Health Division shall review and
approve proposed plans as provided in Sections 9.99 and 9.100.
6.8.2. Minimum Lot Widths
6.8.2.1. No lot may be created that is so narrow or otherwise so irregularly shaped that
it would be impracticable to construct on it a building that:
6.8.2.1.1. Could be used for purposes that are permissible in that zoning district.
6.8.2.1.2. Could satisfy any applicable setback requirements for that district.
6.8.2.2. Lot width shall be measured along a straight line connecting the points at which
a line that demarcates the required setback from the street intersects with lot boundary
lines at opposite sides of the lot.
6.8.2.3. No lot created after the effective date of this Ordinance that is less than the
recommended width shall be entitled to a variance from any building setback requirement.
6.8.2.4. Flag lots may be created within a subdivision provided the following standards
are met:
6.8.2.4.1. A flag lot shall serve only one single-family dwelling and its uninhabited
accessory structures.
6.8.2.4.2. The maximum flagpole length shall not exceed 300 feet.
6.8.2.4.3. The minimum flagpole width shall not be less than 25 feet.
6.8.2.4.4. The minimum lot size shall be equal to the minimum area requirements
of the zoning district in which the lot is located; the flagpole portion of the lot shall
not be considered in the calculation of lot area or in establishing minimum setback
requirements.
April 21, 2015 Page 6-23 Article 6
ARTICLE 6. ZONING DISTRICTS
6.8.2.4.5. Flag lots shall be considered an acceptable option to the development
of irregularly shaped property or unusually deep lots and not an alternative to the
construction of additional roads within a subdivision.
6.8.2.4.6. Where public water service is available, any habitable structure on a
flag lot must be located within 500 feet of a fire hydrant.
6.8.2.5. The minimum street frontage of a lot abutting the turning circle of a cul-de-sac
shall not be less than 35 feet.
6.8.3. Building Setback Requirements
6.8.3.1. Subject to Section 6.8.4 and the other provisions of this section, no portion of
any building may be located on any lot closer to any lot line or to the street right-of-way
line or centerline that is authorized by Section 6.7.
6.8.3.1.1. If the street right-of-way line is readily determinable (by reference to
a recorded map, set irons, or other means), the setback shall be measured from
such right-of-way line. If the right-of-way line is not so determinable, the setback
shall be measured from the street centerline.
6.8.3.1.2. As used in this section, the term lot boundary line refers to lot
boundaries other than those that abut streets.
6.8.3.1.3. As used in this section, the term building includes any substantial
structure which, by nature of its size, scale, dimensions, bulk, or use tends to
constitute a visual obstruction or generate activity similar to that usually associated
with a building. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the following
structures shall be deemed to fall within this description:
6.8.3.1.3.1. Gas pumps and overhead canopies or roofs.
6.8.3.1.3.2. Fences running along lot boundaries adjacent to public street
rights-of-way if such fences exceed six (6) feet in height and are
substantially opaque.
6.8.3.2. Whenever a lot in a nonresidential district has a common boundary line with a
lot in a residential district, and the property line setback requirement applicable to the
residential lot is greater than that applicable to the nonresidential lot, then the lot in the
nonresidential district shall be required to observe the property line setback requirement
applicable to the adjoining residential lot.
April 21, 2015 Page 6-24 Article 6
ARTICLE 6. ZONING DISTRICTS
6.8.3.3. Setback distances shall be measured from the property line or street right-of-way
to a point on the lot that is directly below the nearest extension of any part of the building
that is substantially a part of the building itself and not a mere appendage to it (such as
a flagpole, uncovered deck, steps, etc.). Ordinary projections of sills, belt courses,
cornices, buttresses, incidental ornamental features, uncovered deck porches and steps,
and eaves are allowed to project into yard setback areas.
6.8.3.4. Whenever a private road that serves more than three lots or more than three
dwelling units or that serves any nonresidential use tending to generate traffic equivalent
to more than three dwelling units is located along a lot boundary, then:
6.8.3.4.1. If the lot is not also bordered by a public street, buildings and
freestanding signs shall be setback from the centerline of the private road just as
if such road were a public street.
6.8.3.4.2. If the lot is also bordered by a public street, then the setback distance
on lots used for residential purposes shall be measured from the inside boundary
of the traveled portion of the private road.
6.8.3.5. If a vacant lot of record, or lot of record that becomes vacant, is adjacent to a
lot where an existing dwelling is located which is constructed less than the required
minimum front yard setback, the required minimum front yard setback for the vacant lot
shall not be less than the existing front yard setback for the adjacent dwelling. In cases
where existing dwellings are located on both sides of the vacant lot and each is constructed
less than the required minimum front yard setback, the required minimum front yard
setback for the vacant lot shall not be less than the average of the two (2) existing
dwellings.
6.8.4. Accessory Building Setback Requirements/Maximum Lot Coverage
All accessory buildings in residential districts (i.e., those established by Section 6.3) must comply
with the street right-of-way setbacks set forth in Section 6.8.3 but (subject to the remaining
provisions of this subsection) shall be required to observe only an eight-foot setback from side or
rear lot boundary lines.

ARTICLE 7. SUPPLEMENTAL REGULATIONS
SECTION 7.1 INTRODUCTION.
The following supplemental regulations shall pertain to the uses listed in the Table of Uses and
Activities located in Article 6 which are identified with an S for supplemental regulations.
For any use which requires the issuance of a conditional use permit, the supplemental use
regulations listed herein may be in addition to any other fair and reasonable conditions placed on
the use by the City Council. The conditions may impose greater restrictions on a particular use
than those which are listed herein.
SECTION 7.2 ACCESSORY USES.
7.2.1. The Table of Uses and Activities (Section 6.5) classifies different principal uses according
to their different impacts. Whenever an activity (which may or may not be separately listed as a
principal use in this table) is conducted in conjunction with another principal use and the former
use (1) constitutes only an incidental or insubstantial part of the total activity that takes place on
a lot, or (2) is commonly associated with the principal use and integrally related to it, then the
former use may be regarded as accessory to the principal use and may be carried on underneath
the umbrella of the permit issued for the principal use. For example, a swimming pool/tennis court
complex is customarily associated with and integrally related to a residential subdivision or multifamily
development and would be regarded as accessory to such principal uses, even though such
facilities, if developed apart from a residential development, would require a zoning permit.
7.2.2. For purposes of interpreting subsection 7.2.1:
7.2.2.1. A use may be regarded as incidental or insubstantial if it is of minor consequence
in and of itself or is subordinate in relation to the principal use.
7.2.2.2. To be commonly associated with a principal use it is not necessary for an
accessory use to be connected with such principal use more times than not, but only that
the association of such accessory use with such principal use takes place with sufficient
frequency that there is common acceptance of their relatedness.
7.2.3. Without limiting the generality of subsections 7.2.1 and 7.2.2, the following activities are
specifically regarded as accessory to residential principal uses so long as they satisfy the general
criteria set forth above:
7.2.3.1. Offices or studios within an enclosed building and used by an occupant of a
residence located on the same lot as such building to carry an administrative or artistic
activities of a commercial nature, so long as such activities do not fall within the definition
of a home occupation.
7.2.3.2. Hobbies or recreational activities of a non-commercial nature.

Satellite dish antennas shall be regulated as to placement and location in the following manner in
addition to other requirements of this Ordinance:
7.4.1. Only one (1) satellite dish antenna shall be allowed per premises in residential districts.

and shall meet the setback requirements for accessory structures.
7.4.3. In all nonresidential districts, a satellite dish antenna may be installed on the roof of the
principal structure. In all residential districts, a satellite dish antenna may be installed on the roof
of the principal residence or accessory structure provided the overall diameter of the satellite dish
antenna is three feet or less.
7.4.4. A satellite dish antenna shall be permanently ground or roof mounted (where permitted),
and no satellite dish antenna shall be installed on a portable or moveable structure except to
transport a satellite dish antenna to a permanent site or to provide a temporary on-site satellite
dish antenna for testing purposes not to exceed seven days in duration.
7.4.5. No satellite dish antenna shall exceed an overall diameter of 12 feet nor an overall height
of 20 feet above existing grade when located on the ground, and when located on the roof of a
building in a nonresidential district, no satellite dish antenna shall exceed more than 10 feet above
the highest point of the roof or parapet wall. When located on the roof in a residential district, no
satellite dish antenna shall extend more than four feet above the highest point of the roof.
7.4.6. All satellite dishes shall be installed in compliance with FCC regulations.
SECTION 7.5 SWIMMING POOLS.
7.5.1. Pool construction shall conform to the North Carolina State Building and Plumbing Codes
which are enforced by the Scotland County Inspections Office in Laurinburg. Any accessory
building which houses pumping and filtering equipment must conform to the provisions of this
Ordinance. Further provided that all swimming pools, inclusive of paved decks and all accessory

wires of any kind cross or be over the water surface unless otherwise approved by the
Scotland County Building Inspector.
7.5.6.2. There shall be no cross-connection of the City water supply with any other source
of water supply for the pool. The line from the City water supply to the pool shall be
protected against back flow of water by means of an air gap and shall discharge at least
six (6) inches above the maximum high water level of the make-up tank or the pool.
7.5.6.3. The drain line for the pool may be connected to the City sewer system if the
following provisions are complied with:
7.5.6.3.1. Pool drain shall be connected to the storm water, if one is available.
7.5.6.3.2. Where a storm sewer is not available, the pool drain may be connected
to a sanitary sewer or a combined sewer subject to the approval of the Engineering
Department provided an air gap discharge connection is installed.
7.5.6.4. All swimming pools to be constructed or which are already constructed shall be
enclosed by a fence which shall be at least four (4) feet in height and which shall be of a
type not readily climbed by children. The gates shall be of a self-closing and latching type
with the latch on the inside of the gate, not readily available for children to open. Provided,
however, that if the entire premises of the residence is enclosed, then this provision may
be waived by the UDO Administrator upon inspection and approval of the residence
enclosure.

scenic areas cannot be served from outside the area, or that the proposed
height of a new wireless support structure or initial wireless facility
placement or a proposed height increase of a substantially modified wireless
support structure, or replacement wireless support structure is necessary to
provide the applicants designed service.
7.43.4.4.1.3. The city may require applicants for new wireless facilities to
evaluate the reasonable feasibility of collocating new antennas and
equipment on an existing wireless support structure or structures within the
applicants search ring. Collocation on an existing wireless support structure
is not reasonably feasible if collocation is technically or commercially
impractical or the owner of the existing wireless support structure is
unwilling to enter into a contract for such use at fair market value. The city
may require information necessary to determine whether collocation on
existing wireless support structures is reasonably feasible.
7.43.4.4.2. The city may engage a third-party consultant for technical consultation
and review of applications. The fee imposed by the city for the review of an

ARTICLE 8. NONCONFORMING SITUATIONS
SECTION 8.1 CONTINUATION OF NONCONFORMING SITUATIONS AND
COMPLETION OF NONCONFORMING PROJECTS.
8.1.1. Unless otherwise specifically provided in this Article (e.g., Section 8.8, Nonconforming
Signs), and subject to the restrictions and qualifications set forth in Sections 8.2 through 8.7,
nonconforming situations that were otherwise lawful on the effective date of this Ordinance may
be continued.
8.1.2. Nonconforming projects may be completed only in accordance with the provisions of
Section 8.7.
SECTION 8.2 NONCONFORMING LOTS.
8.2.1. When a nonconforming lot can be used in conformity with all of the regulations applicable
to the intended use, except that the lot is smaller than the required minimums set forth in
Section 6.7, then the lot may be used as proposed just as if it were conforming. However, no use
(e.g., a two-family residence) that requires a greater lot size than the established minimum lot size
for a particular zone is permissible on a nonconforming lot.
8.2.2. When the use proposed for a nonconforming lot is one that is conforming in all other
respects but the applicable setback requirements (Section 6.7) cannot reasonably be complied with,
then the entity authorized by this Ordinance to issue a permit for the proposed use (the UDO
Administrator, Board of Adjustment, or City Council) may allow deviations from the applicable
setback requirements if it finds that:
8.2.2.1. The property cannot reasonably be developed for the use proposed without such
deviations;
8.2.2.2. These deviations are necessitated by the size or shape of the nonconforming lot;
and
8.2.2.3. The property can be developed as proposed without any significantly adverse
impact on surrounding properties or the public health or safety.
8.2.3. For purposes of subsection 8.2.2., compliance with applicable building setback
requirements is not reasonably possible if a building that serves the minimal needs of the use
proposed for the nonconforming lot cannot practicably be constructed and located on the lot in
conformity with such setback requirements. However, mere financial hardship does not constitute
grounds for finding that compliance is not reasonably possible.
April 21, 2015 Page 8-2 Article 8
ARTICLE 8. NONCONFORMING SITUATIONS
8.2.4. This section applies only to undeveloped nonconforming lots. A lot is undeveloped if it has
no substantial structures upon it. A change in use of a developed nonconforming lot may be
accomplished in accordance with Section 8.5.
8.2.5. Subject to the following sentence, if, on the date this section becomes effective, an
undeveloped nonconforming lot adjoins and has continuous frontage with one or more other
undeveloped lots under the same ownership, then neither the owner of the nonconforming lot nor
his successors in interest may take advantage of the provisions of this section. This subsection
shall not apply to a nonconforming lot if a majority of the developed lots located on either side of
the street where such lot is located and within 500 feet of such lot are also nonconforming. The
intent of this subsection is to require nonconforming lots to be combined with other undeveloped
lots to create conforming lots under the circumstances specified herein, but not to require such
combination when that would be out of character with the way the neighborhood has previously
been developed.
SECTION 8.3 EXTENSION OR ENLARGEMENT OF NONCONFORMING SITUATIONS.
8.3.1. Except as specifically provided in this section, no person may engage in any activity that
causes an increase in the extent of nonconformity of a nonconforming situation. In particular,
physical alteration of structures or the placement of new structures on open land is unlawful if such
activity results in:
8.3.1.1. An increase in the total amount of space devoted to a nonconforming use; or
8.3.1.2. Greater nonconformity with respect to dimensional restrictions such as setback
requirements, height limitations or density requirements or other requirements such as
parking requirements.
8.3.2. Subject to subsection 8.3.4., a nonconforming use may be extended throughout any
portion of a completed building that, when the use was made nonconforming by this Ordinance,
was manifestly designed or arranged to accommodate such use. However, subject to Section 8.7
(authorizing the completion of nonconforming projects in certain circumstances), a nonconforming
use may not be extended to additional buildings or to land outside the original building.
8.3.3. Subject to Section 8.7 (authorizing the completion of nonconforming projects in certain
circumstances), a nonconforming use of open land may not be extended to cover more land than
was occupied by that use when it became nonconforming, except that a use that involves the
removal of natural materials from the lot (e.g., a sand pit) may be expanded to the boundaries of
the lot where the use was established at the time it became nonconforming if ten percent or more
of the earth products had already been removed on the effective date of this Ordinance.
8.3.4. The volume, intensity, or frequency of use of property where a nonconforming situation
exists may be increased and the equipment or processes used at a location where a nonconforming
April 21, 2015 Page 8-3 Article 8
ARTICLE 8. NONCONFORMING SITUATIONS
situation exists may be changed if these or similar changes amount only to changes in the degree
of activity rather than changes in kind and no violations of other paragraphs of this section occur.
8.3.5. Notwithstanding subsection 8.3.1., any structure used for single-family residential purposes
and maintained as a nonconforming use may be enlarged or replaced with a similar structure of
a larger size, so long as the enlargement or replacement does not create new nonconformities or
increase the extent of existing nonconformities with respect to such matters as setback and parking
requirements. This paragraph is subject to the limitations stated in Section 8.6 (abandonment and
discontinuance of nonconforming situations).
8.3.6. Notwithstanding subsection 8.3.1., whenever: (i) there exists a lot with one or more
structures on it; and (ii) a change in use that does not involve any enlargement of a structure is
proposed for such lot; and (iii) the parking or loading requirements of Article 9, Part II that would
be applicable as a result of the proposed change cannot be satisfied on such lot because there is
not sufficient area available on the lot that can practicably be used for parking or loading, then the
proposed use shall not be regarded as resulting in an impermissible extension or enlargement of
a nonconforming situation. However, the applicant shall be required to comply with all applicable
parking and loading requirements that can be satisfied without acquiring additional land, and shall
also be required to obtain satellite parking in accordance with Section 9.17.2 if: (i) parking
requirements cannot be satisfied on the lot with respect to which the permit is required; and (ii)
such satellite parking is reasonably available. If such satellite parking is not reasonably available
at the time the zoning or conditional use permit is granted, then the permit recipient shall be
required to obtain it if and when it does become reasonably available. This requirement shall be
a continuing condition of the permit. The purpose of this subsection is to encourage the continued
use of an existing building when a change in use would require more parking spaces than can be
accommodated on the building lot. This subsection is not intended to be a mechanism to
circumvent the parking requirements of this ordinance and is applicable only to situations involving
change in use of an existing building.
SECTION 8.4 REPAIR, MAINTENANCE, AND RECONSTRUCTION.
8.4.1. Minor repairs to and routine maintenance of property where nonconforming situations exist
are permitted and encouraged. Major renovation, i.e., work estimated to cost more than
twenty-five percent of the appraised valuation of the structure to be renovated may be done only
in accordance with a conditional use permit issued pursuant to this section.
8.4.2. If a structure located on a lot where a nonconforming situation exists is damaged to an
extent that the costs of repair or replacement would exceed twenty-five percent of the appraised
valuation of the damaged structure, then the damaged structure may be repaired or replaced only
in accordance with a conditional use permit issued pursuant to this section. This subsection does
not apply to structures used for single-family residential purposes, which structures may be
reconstructed pursuant to a zoning permit just as they may be enlarged or replaced as provided
in Subsection 8.3.5.
April 21, 2015 Page 8-4 Article 8
ARTICLE 8. NONCONFORMING SITUATIONS
8.4.3. For purposes of subsections 8.4.1 and 8.4.2:
8.4.3.1. The "cost" of renovation or repair or replacement shall mean the fair market
value of the materials and services necessary to accomplish such renovation, repair, or
replacement.
8.4.3.2. The "cost" of renovation or repair or replacement shall mean the total cost of all
such intended work, and no person may seek to avoid the intent of subsections 8.4.1 and
8.4.2 by doing such work incrementally.
8.4.3.3. The "appraised valuation" shall mean either the appraised valuation for property
tax purposes, updated as necessary by the increase in the consumer price index since the
date of the last valuation, or the valuation determined by a professionally recognized
property appraiser.
8.4.4. The Board of Adjustment shall issue a conditional use permit authorized by this section if
it finds that, in completing the renovation, repair or replacement work:
8.4.4.1. There is no increase in the total amount of lot area devoted to the nonconforming
use;
8.4.4.2. There is no greater nonconformity with respect to dimensional restrictions such
as setback requirements, height limitations, or density requirements or other requirements
such as parking, loading, and landscaping requirements; and
8.4.4.3. There is no significant adverse impact on surrounding properties or the public
health or safety.
In issuing a conditional use permit, the Board may affix other reasonable and appropriate
conditions such as, but not limited to, landscaping and buffering to separate dissimilar uses or to
screen parking and loading areas.
SECTION 8.5 CHANGE IN USE OF PROPERTY WHERE A NONCONFORMING SITUATION EXISTS.
8.5.1. A change in use of property that is sufficiently substantial to require a new zoning or
conditional use permit in accordance with Article 5 may not be made except in accordance with
subsections 8.5.2. through 8.5.4. However, this requirement shall not apply if only a sign permit
is needed.
8.5.2. If the intended change in use is to a principal use that is permissible in the district where
the property is located, and all of the other requirements of this Ordinance applicable to that use
can be complied with, permission to make the change must be obtained in the same manner as
April 21, 2015 Page 8-5 Article 8
ARTICLE 8. NONCONFORMING SITUATIONS
permission to make the initial use of a vacant lot. Once conformity with this Ordinance is achieved,
the property may not revert to its nonconforming status.
8.5.3. If the intended change in use is to a principal use that is permissible in the district where
the property is located, but all of the requirements of this Ordinance applicable to that use cannot
reasonably be complied with, then the change is permissible if the Board of Adjustment issues a
conditional use permit authorizing the change. This conditional use permit may be issued if the
Board of Adjustment finds, in addition to any other findings that may be required by this
Ordinance, that:
8.5.3.1. The intended change will not result in a violation of Section 8.3; and
8.5.3.2. All of the applicable requirements of this section that can reasonably be complied
with will be complied with. Compliance with a requirement of this section is not reasonably
possible if compliance cannot be achieved without adding additional land to the lot where
the nonconforming situation is maintained or moving a substantial structure that is on a
permanent foundation. Mere financial hardship caused by the cost of meeting such
requirements as paved parking does not constitute grounds for finding that compliance is
not reasonably possible. In no case may an applicant be given permission pursuant to this
subsection to construct a building or add to an existing building if additional
nonconformities would thereby be created.
8.5.4. If the intended change in use is to another principal use that is also nonconforming, then
the change is permissible if the Board of Adjustment issues a conditional use permit authorizing
the change. The Board of Adjustment may issue the conditional use permit if it finds, in addition
to other findings that may be required by this Ordinance, that:
8.5.4.1. The use requested is one that is permissible in some zoning district with either
a zoning or conditional use permit; and
8.5.4.2. All of the conditions applicable to the permit authorized in subsection 8.5.3 of
this section are satisfied; and
8.5.4.3. The proposed development will have less of an adverse impact on those most
affected by it and will be more compatible with the surrounding neighborhood than the use
in operation at the time the permit is applied for.
April 21, 2015 Page 8-6 Article 8
ARTICLE 8. NONCONFORMING SITUATIONS
SECTION 8.6 ABANDONMENT AND DISCONTINUANCE OF NONCONFORMING SITUATIONS.
8.6.1. When a nonconforming use is (i) discontinued for a consecutive period of 180 days, or (ii)
discontinued for any period of time without a present intention to reinstate the nonconforming use,
the property involved may thereafter be used only for conforming purposes.
8.6.2. If the principal activity on property where a nonconforming situation other than a
nonconforming use exists is (i) discontinued for a consecutive period of 180 days, or (ii)
discontinued for any period of time without a present intention of resuming that activity, then that
property may thereafter be used only in conformity with all of the regulations applicable to the
preexisting use unless the Board of Adjustment issues a conditional use permit to allow the
property to be used for this purpose without correcting the nonconforming situations. This
conditional use permit may be issued if the Board of Adjustment finds that eliminating a particular
nonconformity is not reasonably possible (i.e., cannot be accomplished without adding additional
land to the lot where the nonconforming situation is maintained or moving a substantial structure
that is on a permanent foundation). The conditional use permit shall specify which nonconformities
need not be corrected.
8.6.3. For purposes of determining whether a right to continue a nonconforming situation is lost
pursuant to this section, all of the buildings, activities, and operations maintained on a lot are
generally to be considered as a whole. For example, the failure to rent one apartment in a
nonconforming apartment building for 180 days shall not result in a loss of the right to rent that
apartment or space thereafter so long as the apartment building as a whole is continuously
maintained. But if a nonconforming use is maintained in conjunction with a conforming use,
discontinuance of a nonconforming use for the required period shall terminate the right to maintain
it thereafter.
8.6.4. When a structure or operation made nonconforming by this Ordinance is vacant or
discontinued at the effective date of this Ordinance, the 180-day period for purposes of this section
begins to run on the effective date of this Ordinance.
SECTION 8.7 COMPLETION OF NONCONFORMING PROJECTS.
8.7.1. All nonconforming projects on which construction was begun at least 180 days before the
effective date of this Ordinance as well as all nonconforming projects that are at least ten percent
completed in terms of the total expected cost of the project on the effective date of this Ordinance
may be completed in accordance with the terms of their permits, so long as these permits were
validly issued and remain unrevoked and unexpired. If a development is designed to be completed
in stages, this subsection shall apply only to the particular phase under construction. In addition,
as provided in G.S. 160A-385(b), neither this ordinance nor any amendment to it shall, without the
consent of the property owner, affect any lot with respect to which a building permit has been
April 21, 2015 Page 8-7 Article 8
ARTICLE 8. NONCONFORMING SITUATIONS
issued pursuant to G.S. 160A-417 prior to the enactment of the ordinance making the change so
long as the building permit remains valid, unexpired, and unrevoked.
8.7.2. Except as provided in subsection 8.7.1., all work on any nonconforming project shall cease
on the effective date of this Ordinance, and all permits previously issued for work on
nonconforming projects may begin or may be continued only pursuant to a zoning, conditional use,
or sign permit issued in accordance with this section by the individual or board authorized by this
Ordinance to issue permits for the type of development proposed. The permit issuing authority
shall issue such a permit if it finds that the applicant has in good faith made substantial
expenditures or incurred substantial binding obligations or otherwise changed his position in some
substantial way in reasonable reliance on the land use law as it existed before the effective date
of this Ordinance and thereby would be unreasonably prejudiced if not allowed to complete his
project as proposed. In considering whether these findings may be made, the permit issuing
authority shall be guided by the following, as well as other relevant considerations:
8.7.2.1. All expenditures made to obtain or pursuant to a validly issued and unrevoked
building, zoning, sign, or conditional use permit shall be considered as evidence of
reasonable reliance on the land use law that existed before this Ordinance became
effective.
8.7.2.2. Except as provided in subsection 8.7.2.1., no expenditures made more than 180
days before the effective date of this Ordinance may be considered as evidence of
reasonable reliance on the land use law that existed before this Ordinance became
effective. An expenditure is made at the time a party incurs a binding obligation to make
that expenditure.
8.7.2.3. To the extent that expenditures are recoverable with a reasonable effort, a party
shall not be considered prejudiced by having made those expenditures. For example, a
party shall not be considered prejudiced by having made some expenditure to acquire a
potential development site if the property obtained is approximately as valuable under the
new classification as it was under the old, for the expenditure can be recovered by a resale
of the property.
8.7.2.4. To the extent that a nonconforming project can be made conforming and that
expenditures made or obligations incurred can be effectively utilized in the completion of
a conforming project, a party shall not be considered prejudiced by having made such
expenditures.
8.7.2.5. An expenditure shall be considered substantial if it is significant both in dollar
amount and in terms of (i) the total estimated cost of the proposed project, and (ii) the
ordinary business practices of the developer.
April 21, 2015 Page 8-8 Article 8
ARTICLE 8. NONCONFORMING SITUATIONS
8.7.2.6. A person shall be considered to have acted in good faith if actual knowledge of
a proposed change in the land use law affecting the proposed development site could not
be attributed to him.
8.7.2.7. Even though a person had actual knowledge of a proposed change in the land
use law affecting a development site, the permit issuing authority may still find that he
acted in good faith if he did not proceed with his plans in a deliberate attempt to
circumvent the effects of the proposed ordinance. The permit issuing authority may find
that the developer did not proceed in an attempt to undermine the proposed ordinance if
it determines that (i) at the time the expenditures were made, either there was
considerable doubt about whether any ordinance would ultimately be passed, or it was not
clear that the proposed ordinance would prohibit the intended development, and (ii) the
developer had legitimate business reasons for making expenditures.
8.7.2.8. In deciding whether a permit should be issued under this section, the permit
issuing authority shall not be limited to either denying a permit altogether or issuing a
permit to complete the project (or phases, sections, or stages thereof) as originally
proposed or approved. Upon proper submission of plans by the applicant, the permit
issuing authority may also issue a permit authorizing a development that is less
nonconforming than the project as originally proposed or approved but that still does not
comply with all the provisions of the ordinance making the project nonconforming.
8.7.3. When it appears from the developer's plans or otherwise that a project was intended to
be or reasonably could be completed in phases, stages, segments, or other discrete units, the
developer shall be allowed to complete only those phases or segments with respect to which the
developer can make the showing required under subsection 8.7.2. ln addition to the matters and
subject to the guidelines set forth in subsection 8.7.2.1. through 8.7.2.6., the permit issuing
authority shall, in determining whether a developer would be unreasonably prejudiced if not
allowed to complete phases or segments of a nonconforming project, consider the following in
addition to other relevant factors:
8.7.3.1. Whether any plans prepared or approved regarding uncompleted phases
constitute conceptual plans only or construction drawings based upon detailed surveying,
architectural, or engineering work.
8.7.3.2. Whether any improvements, such as streets or utilities, have been installed in
phases not yet completed.
8.7.3.3. Whether utilities and other facilities installed in completed phases have been
constructed in such a manner or location or such a scale, in anticipation of connection to
or interrelationship with approved but uncompleted phases, that the investment in such
utilities or other facilities cannot be recouped if such approved but uncompleted phases are
constructed in conformity with existing regulations.
April 21, 2015 Page 8-9 Article 8
ARTICLE 8. NONCONFORMING SITUATIONS
8.7.4. The permit issuing authority shall not consider any application for the permit authorized
by subsection 8.7.2., that is submitted more than sixty days after the effective date of this
Ordinance. The permit issuing authority may waive this requirement for good cause shown, but
in no case may it extend the application deadline beyond one year.
8.7.5. The UDO Administrator shall send copies of this section to the persons listed as owners for
tax purposes (and developers, if different from the owners) of all properties in regard to which
permits have been issued for nonconforming projects or in regard to which a nonconforming
project is otherwise known to be in some stage of development. This notice shall be sent by
certified mail not less than fifteen days before the effective date of this Ordinance.
8.7.6. The permit issuing authority shall establish expedited procedures for hearing applications
for permits under this section. These applications shall be heard, whenever possible, before the
effective date of this Ordinance, so that construction work is not needlessly interrupted.
SECTION 8.8 NONCONFORMING SIGNS.
8.8.1. Signs in existence on the effective date of this Ordinance which do not conform to the
provisions of this Ordinance, but which were constructed, erected, affixed or maintained in
compliance with all previous regulations, shall be regarded as nonconforming signs. Although it
is not the intent of the Ordinance to encourage the continued use of nonconforming signs,
nonconforming signs shall be allowed to continue and a decision as to the continued existence and
use or removal of such signs shall be controlled as follows:
8.8.1.1. No nonconforming sign shall be changed to another nonconforming sign.
8.8.1.2. No nonconforming sign shall have any changes made in the words or symbols
used or the message displayed on the sign unless the sign is specifically designed for
periodic change of message.
8.8.1.3. No nonconforming sign shall be structurally altered so as to change the shape,
size, type or design of the sign other than to make the sign conforming.
8.8.1.4. No nonconforming sign shall be re-established after the activity, business or use
to which it relates has been discontinued and such sign shall be removed.
8.8.1.5. No nonconforming sign shall be re-established and all remains of the sign must
be removed after damage or destruction, if the estimated expense of repairs exceeds fifty
percent of the estimated total value of the sign at the time of destruction. If damaged by
less than fifty percent, but repairs are not made within three months of the time such
damage occurred, the nonconforming sign shall not be allowed to continue and must be
removed.
April 21, 2015 Page 8-10 Article 8
ARTICLE 8. NONCONFORMING SITUATIONS
8.8.1.6. No nonconforming sign shall be relocated unless the sign can be made to
conform with this Ordinance in its new location.
8.8.2. Signs located on premises which come within the zoning jurisdiction of the City of
Laurinburg after the effective date of this Ordinance and which signs do not comply with the
provisions of this Ordinance shall be subject to the requirements listed above.
8.8.3. Any nonconforming sign which is structurally altered, relocated or replaced shall
immediately be brought into compliance with all the provisions of this Ordinance.
8.8.4. Signs in existence on the effective date of this Ordinance which do not comply with
provisions regulating use of strobe lights, ziplights, flashing lights or rotating beacons; flags,
streamers or strings of lights; or permanently installed or situated merchandise, shall be made to
conform within ninety days from the effective date of this Ordinance.
8.8.5. The UDO Administrator shall order the removal of any sign maintained in violation of the
provisions of this section for which removal procedures are herein prescribed, accordingly: the
UDO Administrator shall give ninety days written notice to the owner or lessee to remove the sign
or to bring it into compliance with this Ordinance. If the owner or lessee fails to remove the sign
within ninety days after the ninety-day written notice has been given, the UDO Administrator or
his duly authorized representative may institute removal proceedings according to the procedures
specified in G.S. 160A-175.
8.8.6. Off-premises signs that are protected from enforced removal by the Outdoor Advertising
Control Act shall not be subject to the provisions of subsection 8.8.5., unless and until just
compensation is provided in accordance with the cited statute.
SECTION 8.9 TERMINATION OF MISCELLANEOUS NONCONFORMING SITUATIONS.
Within one year after the effective date of this Ordinance, any use as described in Subsection
6.2.3.3 shall cease, and thereafter any situation in violation of that subdivision shall no longer be
regarded as a lawful nonconforming situation.

three (3) feet of planting area, no planting shall be required in that yard.
SECTION 9.9 FLEXIBILITY IN ADMINISTRATION REQUIRED.
9.9.1. The City Council recognizes that, because of the wide variety of types of developments and
the relationships between them, it is neither possible nor prudent to establish inflexible screening
requirements. Therefore, the permit-issuing authority may permit deviations from the presumptive
requirements of Article 9, Part I whenever it finds such deviations are more likely to satisfy the
standard set forth in Section 9.2.
9.9.2. Without limiting the generality of subsection 9.9.1., the permit-issuing authority may modify
the presumptive requirements for:
9.9.2.1. Commercial developments located adjacent to residential uses in business zoning
districts.
9.9.2.2. Commercial uses located adjacent to other commercial uses within the same
zoning district.
9.9.2.3. Uses located within planned residential developments (for screening requirements
within planned residential developments, see Section 7.18).
9.9.3. Whenever the permit-issuing authority allows or requires a deviation from the presumptive
requirements set forth in Article 9, Part I, it shall enter on the face of the permit the screening
requirement that it imposes to meet the standard set forth in Section 9.2 and the reasons for
allowing or requiring the deviation.

PART II. OFF-STREET PARKING AND OFF-STREET LOADING REQUIREMENTS
SECTION 9.16 OFF-STREET PARKING REQUIREMENTS.
There shall be provided at the time of the erection of any building, or at the time any principal
building is enlarged or increased in capacity by adding dwelling units, guest rooms, seats, or floor
area, permanent off-street parking space in the amount specified by this section. Such parking
space may be provided in a parking garage or properly graded open space that complies with the
standards for parking established in this section.
9.16.1. Certification of Minimum Parking Requirements.
Each application for a certificate of zoning compliance submitted to the UDO Administrator as
provided for in Section 5.3.7 of this Ordinance shall include information as to the location and
dimensions of off-street parking and the means of entrance and exit to the space. This information
shall be in sufficient detail to enable the UDO Administrator to determine whether or not the
requirements of this section are met.
9.16.2. Joint Use of Required Parking Spaces.
9.16.2.1. One parking area may contain required spaces for several different uses, but
except as otherwise provided in this section, the required space assigned to one use may
not be credited to any other use.
9.16.2.2. To the extent that developments that wish to make joint use of the same
parking spaces operate at different times, the same spaces may be credited to both uses.
For example, if a parking lot is used in connection with an office building on Monday
through Friday but is generally 90% vacant on weekends, another development that
operates only on weekends could be credited with 90% of the spaces on that lot. Or, if a
church parking lot is generally occupied only to 50% of capacity on days other than Sunday,
another development could make use of 50% of the church lots spaces on those other
days.
9.16.2.3. If the joint use of the same parking spaces by two or more principal uses
involves satellite parking spaces, then the provisions of Section 9.17.2 are also applicable.

SECTION 9.17 GENERAL PROVISIONS.
9.17.1. Phased Developments.
Each individual phase of a multi-phase development shall meet all applicable parking standards
established in this section including shared parking facilities prior to initiation of the next phase.
9.17.2. Satellite Parking.
9.17.2.1. If the number of off-street parking spaces required by this Ordinance cannot
reasonably be provided on the same lot where the principal use associated with these
parking spaces is located, then spaces may be provided on adjacent or nearby lots in
accordance with the provisions of this section. These off-site spaces are referred to in this
section as satellite parking spaces.
9.17.2.2. All such satellite parking spaces (except spaces intended for employee use) must
be located within 400 feet of a public entrance of a principal building housing the use
associated with such parking, or within 400 feet of the lot on which the use associated with
such parking is located if the use is not housed within any principal building. Satellite
parking spaces intended for employee use may be located within any reasonable distance.
Satellite parking spaces must be located in a zoning district which permits parking lots for
the use intended.
9.17.2.3. The developer wishing to take advantage of the provisions of this section must
present satisfactory written evidence, on an annual basis, that he has the permission of the
owner or other person in charge of the satellite parking spaces to use such spaces. The
developer must also sign an acknowledgment that the continuing validity of his permit
depends upon his continuing activity to provide the requisite number of parking spaces.
9.17.3. Access.
Access to public thoroughfares shall be from a driveway and not directly from a parking space.
Ingress and egress shall be by a forward motion of the vehicle. This subsection does not apply to
driveways serving one (1) to two (2) dwelling units.
9.17.4. General Design Requirements.
9.17.4.1. Vehicle accommodation areas of all developments shall be designed so that
sanitation, emergency, and other public service vehicles can serve such developments
without the necessity of backing unreasonable distances or making other dangerous or
hazardous turning movements.
9.17.4.2. Every vehicle accommodation area shall be designed so that vehicles cannot
extend beyond the perimeter of such area onto adjacent properties or public rights-of-way.
April 21, 2015 Page 9-21 Article 9
ARTICLE 9. PERFORMANCE STANDARDS
Such areas shall also be designed so that vehicles do not extend over sidewalks or tend to
bump against or damage any wall, vegetation, or other obstruction.
9.17.4.3. Circulation areas shall be designed so that vehicles can proceed safely without
posing a danger to pedestrians or other vehicles and without interfering with parking areas.
9.17.5. Vehicle Accommodation Area Surfaces.
9.17.5.1. Vehicle accommodation areas that (1) include lanes for drive-in windows or (2)
contain parking areas that are required to have more than ten (10) parking spaces and that
are used regularly at least five days per week shall be graded and surfaced with asphalt,
concrete, or other material that will provide equivalent protection against potholes, erosion,
and dust. Specifications for surfaces meeting the standard set forth in this subsection are
as follows:
9.17.5.1.1. Paved Surfaces. Vehicle accommodation areas paved with asphalt
shall be constructed in the same manner as street surfaces (refer to the City of
Laurinburg Construction Standards). If concrete is used as the paving material,
vehicle accommodation areas shall be similarly constructed except that six (6) inches
of concrete shall be used instead of two inches of asphalt. The City Engineer may
allow other paving materials to be used so long as the equivalent level of stability
is achieved.
9.17.5.1.2. Unpaved Surfaces. Vehicle accommodation areas without paving
shall be constructed in the same manner as paved areas except that crushed stone
of the following types may be used in lieu of asphalt, concrete, or other paving
material: Size 13 Crushed Stone.
9.17.5.2. Vehicle accommodation areas that are not provided with the type of surface
specified in subsection 9.17.5.1 shall be graded and surfaced with crushed stone, gravel,
or other suitable material (as provided in the specifications set forth in subsection 9.17.5.1.1
and 9.17.5.1.2) to provide a surface that is stable and will help to reduce dust and erosion.
The perimeter of such parking areas shall be defined by bricks, stones, railroad ties, or other
similar devices. In addition, whenever such a vehicle accommodation area abuts a paved
street, the driveway leading from such street to such area (or, if there is no driveway, the
portion of the vehicle accommodation area that opens onto such streets), shall be paved
as provided in subsection 9.17.5.1 for a distance of fifteen (15) feet back from the edge of
the paved street. This subsection shall not apply to single-family or two-family residences
or other uses that are required to have only one or two parking spaces.
9.17.5.3. Parking spaces in areas surfaced in accordance with subsection 9.17.5.1 shall
be appropriately demarcated with painted lines or other markings. Parking spaces in areas
surfaced in accordance with subsection 9.17.5.2 shall be demarcated however practicable.

SECTION 9.26 PERMIT REQUIRED FOR SIGNS.
9.26.1. Except as otherwise provided in Sections 9.27 (Signs Not Requiring a Permit), no sign may
be erected, moved, enlarged, or substantially altered except in accordance with the provisions of
this section. Mere repainting or changing the message of a sign shall not, in and of itself, be
considered a substantial alteration. (Amended 6/21/2016)
9.26.2. If plans submitted for a zoning permit or conditional use permit include sign plans in
sufficient detail that the permit-issuing authority can determine whether the proposed sign or signs
comply with the provisions of this Ordinance, then issuance of the requested zoning or conditional
use permit shall constitute approval of the proposed sign or signs.
9.26.3. Signs not approved as provided in subsection 9.26.2 or exempted under the provisions
referenced in subsection 9.26.1 may be erected, moved, enlarged, or substantially altered only in
accordance with a sign permit issued by the UDO Administrator. Sign permit applications and sign
permits shall be governed by the same provisions of this Ordinance applicable to zoning permits.
9.26.4. All sign permits shall expire if not utilized within one hundred eighty (180) days following
issuance. No more than one (1) off-premises sign permit per parcel may be issued within any three
hundred sixty-five (365) day period, such time beginning with the date of issuance of any previous
off-premises sign permit.

that site or 24 months from the time the fence wrap was installed, whichever is shorter. If
construction is not completed at the end of 24 months from the time the fence wrap was installed,
the town may regulate the signage but shall continue to allow fence wrapping materials to be
affixed to the perimeter fencing. No fence wrap affixed pursuant to this subsection may display any
advertising other than advertising sponsored by a person directly involved in the construction
project and for which monetary compensation for the advertisement is not paid or required.
SECTION 9.28 DETERMINING THE NUMBER OF SIGNS.
9.28.1. For the purpose of determining the number of signs, a sign shall be considered to be a
single display surface or display device containing elements organized, related, and composed to
form a single unit. Where matter is displayed in a random manner without comprising a single unit,
each element shall be considered a single sign.
9.28.2. Without limiting the generality of subsection 9.28.1, a multi-sided sign shall be regarded
as one sign.
April 21, 2015 Page 9-31 Article 9
ARTICLE 9. PERFORMANCE STANDARDS
SECTION 9.29 COMPUTATION OF SIGN AREA.
9.29.1. The surface area of a sign shall be computed by including the entire area within a single,
continuous, rectilinear perimeter of not more than eight (8) straight lines or a circle or an ellipse
enclosing the extreme limits of the writing, representation, emblem or other display, together with
any material or color forming an integral part of the background of the display or used to
differentiate the sign from the backdrop or structure against which it is placed, but not including
any supporting framework or bracing that is clearly incidental to the display itself.
9.29.2. If the sign consists of more than one section or module, all of the area, including that
between sections or modules, shall be included in the computation of the sign area.
9.29.3. With respect to two-sided, multi-sided or three-dimensional signs, the surface area shall
be computed by including the total of all sides designed either to attract attention or communicate
information that can be seen at one time by any person from any vantage point. For example, with
respect to a typical two-sided sign where a message is printed on both sides of a flat surface, the
sign surface area of one side (rather than the sum total of both sides) shall be regarded as the total
sign surface area of that sign, since one can see only one side of the sign from any vantage point.
9.29.4. With respect to V-shaped signs, the surface area shall be calculated as in subsection
9.29.3 above, provided the angle of the intersecting sign planes does not exceed ninety (90)
degrees. If the angle of the intersecting sign planes exceeds ninety (90) degrees, sign area shall
be computed as it would for a one-sided sign.
SECTION 9.30 DISTRICT SIGNS. (Amended 6/21/2016)
9.30.1. Signs in General Residential Districts.
9.30.1.1. Unless otherwise provided in this article or in Article 7, Supplemental
Regulations, the maximum sign surface area permitted on any lot in any R-20MH, R-20,
R-15, R-6, and R-6MH residential district is four (4) square feet, including home
occupations. Home occupation signage shall be permanently fixed to the residence within
which the home occupation resides.
9.30.1.2. At any entrance to a residential subdivision, multi-family development, or
manufactured home park, there may be not more than two (2) signs identifying such
subdivision or development. A single side of any such sign may not exceed thirty-two (32)
square feet nor may the total surface area of all such signs located at a single entrance
exceed sixty-four (64) square feet.

9.60.1. There are special circumstances or conditions affecting that property such that the strict
application of the provisions of this Ordinance would deprive the applicant of the reasonable use
of this land.

SECTION 9.69 FLEXIBILITY IN ADMINISTRATION AUTHORIZED.
9.69.1. The requirements set forth in this article concerning the amount, size, location and nature
of recreational facilities and open space to be provided in connection with multi-family residential
and manufactured home park developments are established by the Council as standards that
presumptively will result in the provision of that amount of recreational facilities and open space
that is consistent with officially adopted city plans. The Council recognizes, however, that due to
the particular nature of a tract of land, or the nature of the facilities proposed for installation, or
other factors, the underlying objectives of this article may be achieved even though the standards
are not adhered to with mathematical precision. Therefore, the permit issuing body is authorized
to permit minor deviations from these standards whenever it determines that: (i) the objectives
underlying these standards can be met without strict adherence to them; and (ii) because of
peculiarities in the developer's tract of land or the facilities proposed it would be unreasonable to
require strict adherence to these standards.
9.69.2. Whenever the permit issuing board authorizes some deviation from the standards set forth
in this article pursuant to subsection 9.69.1, the official record of action taken on the development
application shall contain a statement of the reasons for allowing the deviation.
SECTION 9.70 AUTHORITY TO SELL.

of this article. At the developer's request, the City Council may accept a land dedication located
elsewhere in the city's jurisdiction in lieu of a land dedication at the site of the proposed
development.

carried by the street, stated in terms of the number of trips per day;
9.72.1.2. The number of dwelling units to be served by the street may be used as a useful
indicator of the number of trips but is not conclusive;
9.72.1.3. Whenever a subdivision street continues an existing street that formerly
terminated outside the subdivision or it is expected that a subdivision street will be
continued beyond the subdivision at some future time, the classification of the street will
be based upon the street in its entirety, both within and outside of the subdivision.
9.72.2. The classification of streets shall be as follows:
9.72.2.1. Minor. A street whose sole function is to provide access to abutting properties.
It serves or is designed to serve not more than nine dwelling units and is expected to or
does handle up to seventy-five trips per day.

and is expected to or does handle between seventy-five and two-hundred trips per day.
9.72.2.3. Cul-De-Sac. A street that terminates in a vehicular turn-around and which
complies with the requirements of Section 9.78.3 and 9.78.4.
9.72.2.4. Subcollector. A street whose principal function is to provide access to abutting
properties but is also designed to be used or is used to connect minor and local streets with
collector or arterial streets. Including residences indirectly served through connecting
streets, it serves or is designed to serve at least twenty-six but not more than one hundred
dwelling units and is expected to or does handle between two hundred and eight hundred
trips per day.
9.72.2.5. Collector. A street whose principal function is to carry traffic between minor,
local, and subcollector streets and arterial streets but that may also provide direct access
to abutting properties. It serves or is designed to serve, directly or indirectly, more than
one hundred dwelling units and is designed to be used or is used to carry more than eight
hundred trips per day.

street and that is designed to provide access to abutting properties so that these properties
are somewhat sheltered from the effects of the through traffic on the arterial street and so
that the flow of traffic on the arterial street is not impeded by direct driveway access from
a large number of abutting properties.
SECTION 9.73 ACCESS TO ARTERIAL STREETS.
Whenever a major subdivision that involves the creation of one or more new streets borders on or
contains an existing or proposed arterial street, no direct driveway access may be provided from
the lots within this subdivision onto this street.
SECTION 9.74 ENTRANCES TO STREETS.
9.74.1. All driveway entrances and other openings onto streets within the city's planning
jurisdiction shall be constructed so that:
9.741.1. Vehicles can enter and exit from the lot in question without posing any
substantial danger to themselves, pedestrians, or vehicles traveling in abutting streets; and
9.74.1.2. Interference with the free and convenient flow of traffic in abutting or
surrounding streets is minimized.
9.74.2. Requests for new driveway entrances or requests for modifications to existing driveway
entrances, when not associated with a zoning, special use, or conditional use permit request, shall
be reviewed and approved by the city engineer. The city engineer shall issue a driveway permit
in such cases. Specifications for driveway entrances are set forth in the City of Laurinburg
Construction Standards. If driveway entrances and other openings onto streets are constructed in
accordance with the foregoing specifications and requirements, this shall be deemed prima facie
evidence of compliance with the standard set forth in subsection 9.74.1.
9.74.3. For purposes of this section, the term "prima facie evidence" means that the
permit-issuing authority may (but is not required to) conclude from this evidence alone that the
proposed development complies with subsection 9.74.1.

SECTION 9.75 STREET CONNECTIVITY REQUIREMENTS.
9.75.1. An interconnected street system is necessary in order to protect the public health, safety,
and welfare in order to ensure that streets will function in an interdependent manner, to provide
adequate access for emergency and service vehicles, to enhance nonvehicular travel such as
pedestrians and bicycles, and to provide continuous and comprehensible traffic routes. All proposed
new streets shall be platted according to the current Town Thoroughfare Plan. In areas where such
plans have not been completed, the streets shall be designated and located in relation to existing
and proposed streets, the topography, to natural features such as streams and tree cover, to public
safety and convenience, and to the proposed use of land to be served by such streets.
9.75.2. All proposed streets shall be continuous and connect to existing or platted streets without
offset with the exception of cul-de-sacs as permitted and except as provided below. Whenever
practicable, provisions shall be made for the continuation of planned streets into adjoining areas.
9.75.3. The street network for any subdivision shall achieve a connectivity ratio of not less than
1.45 (see example below). The phrase connectivity ratio means the number of streets links divided
by the number of nodes or link ends, including cul-de-sac heads. A link means and refers to that
portion of a street defined by a node at each end or at one end. Approved stubs to adjacent
property shall be considered links. However, alleys shall not be considered links. A node refers to
the terminus of a street or the intersection of two or more streets, except that intersections that
use a roundabout shall not be counted as a node. For the purposes of this section, an intersection
shall be defined as:
9.75.3.1. Any curve or
bend of a street that fails to
meet the minimum curve
radius as established by the
North Carolina Department
of Transportation, Division
of Highways design and
minimum construction
standards, or
9.75.3.2. Any location
where street names change
(as reviewed and approved
by the UDO Administrator).
9.75.4. For the purposes of this section, the street links and nodes within the collector or
thoroughfare streets providing access to a proposed subdivision shall not be considered in
computing the connectivity ratio.
April 21, 2015 Page 9-64 Article 9
ARTICLE 9. PERFORMANCE STANDARDS
9.75.5. Residential streets shall be designed so as to minimize the length of local streets, to
provide safe access to residences, and to maintain connectivity between and through residential
neighborhoods for autos and pedestrians.
9.75.6. Where necessary to provide access or to permit the reasonable future subdivision of
adjacent land, rights-of-way, and improvements shall be extended to the boundary of the
development. A temporary turnaround may be required where the dead end exceeds 500 feet in
length. The platting of partial width rights-of-way shall be prohibited except where the remainder
of the necessary right-of-way has already been platted, dedicated, or established by other means.
9.75.7. Exemptions. New subdivisions that intend to provide one new cul-de-sac street shall
be exempt from the connectivity requirement when the UDO Administrator determines that the
subdivision will provide for connectivity with adjacent future development and there is:
9.75.7.1. No options for providing stub streets due to topographic conditions, adjacent
developed sites, or other limiting factors; and
9.75.7.2. Interconnectivity (use of a looped road) within the development cannot be
achieved or is unreasonable based on the constraints of the property to be developed.
SECTION 9.76 RELATIONSHIP OF STREETS TO TOPOGRAPHY.
9.76.1. Streets shall be related appropriately to the topography. In particular, streets shall be
designed to facilitate the drainage and storm water runoff objectives set forth in Part IX, and street
grades shall conform as closely as practicable to the original topography.
9.76.2. The maximum grade on all streets shall comply with the City of Laurinburg Construction
Standards manual.
SECTION 9.77 STREET WIDTH, SIDEWALK, AND DRAINAGE REQUIREMENTS IN SUBDIVISIONS.
9.77.1. Street rights-of-way are designed and developed to serve several functions: (i) to carry
motor vehicle traffic, and in some cases, allow on-street parking; (ii) to provide a safe and
convenient passageway for pedestrian and bicycle traffic; and (iii) to serve as an important link in
the city's drainage system. In order to fulfill these objectives, all public streets shall be constructed
to meet either the standards set forth in subsection 9.77.2 or subsection 9.77.3.
9.77.2. All streets, except as provided in subsection 9.77.3, shall be constructed with curb and
gutter and shall conform to the other requirements of this subsection. Only standard 90E curb may
be used, except that roll-type curb shall be permitted along minor and local streets within
residential subdivisions. Street pavement width shall be measured from back of curb to back of
curb.

the effective date of this ordinance, the curb and gutter requirement may be waived provided that
(1) the final subdivision plan substantially conforms to the approved preliminary plat and (2) that
a minimum of 85 percent of the total number of lots as shown on the approved preliminary plat
have access to streets which have been constructed without curb and gutter. Single-family
residential subdivisions approved after the date of adoption of this Ordinance (April 21, 2015), may
be strip paved (no curb and gutter) if all streets within the subdivision are strip paved and adequate
drainage can be provided to the natural or man-made drainage systems are connecting to the
subdivision.
9.77.4. The City Council may require the construction of sidewalks adjacent to one side of new
streets in subdivisions. The sidewalks required by this section shall be four feet in width if on both
sides of the street and five feet in width if on one side of the street. All sidewalks shall be
constructed according to the specifications set forth in City of Laurinburg Construction Standards.
9.77.5. Whenever the permit-issuing authority finds that a means of pedestrian access is
necessary from the subdivision to schools, parks, open space, playgrounds, or other roads or
facilities and that such access is not conveniently provided by sidewalks adjacent to the streets, the
developer shall be required to reserve an unobstructed easement of at least ten feet in width to
provide such access.
SECTION 9.78 GENERAL LAYOUT OF STREETS.
9.78.1. Subcollector, local, and minor residential streets shall be curved whenever practicable to
the extent necessary to avoid conformity of lot appearance.
9.78.2. Culs-de-sac and loop streets are encouraged to reduce through traffic on residential
streets. However, streets must be designed to facilitate internal vehicular circulation within
developments as well as to accommodate vehicular access to adjoining properties and
developments. To the extent practicable, driveway access to collector streets shall be minimized
to facilitate the free flow of traffic and avoid traffic hazards.

9.78.3. All permanent dead-end streets (as opposed to temporary dead-end streets, see
Subsection 9.75) shall be developed as cul-de-sacs in accordance with the standards set forth in
subsection 9.78.4. Except where no other practicable alternative is available, such streets shall be
designed so as to provide access to no more than 20 dwelling units or a maximum average daily
traffic (ADT) count of 200, whichever is greater. ADT is calculated according to the most current
edition of the Trip Generation Manual (Institute of Transportation Engineers).
9.78.4. The right-of-way of a cul-de-sac shall have a radius of fifty feet. The radius of the paved
portion of the turn-around (measured to the outer edge of the pavement) shall be thirty-seven and
one-half feet, and the pavement width shall be twelve feet without curbs and gutter or eighteen
feet with curb and gutter. Any unpaved center of the turn-around area shall be landscaped.
9.78.5. Half streets (i.e., streets of less than the full required right-of-way and pavement width)
shall not be permitted except where such streets, when combined with a similar street (developed
previously or simultaneously) on property adjacent to the subdivision, creates or comprises a street
that meets the right-of-way and pavement requirements of this Ordinance.
9.78.6. Streets shall be laid out so that residential blocks do not exceed 1,000 feet, unless no
other practicable alternative is available.
SECTION 9.79 STREET INTERSECTIONS.
9.79.1. Streets shall intersect as nearly as possible at right angles, and no two streets may
intersect at less than 75 degrees. Not more than two streets shall intersect at any one point, unless
the city engineer certifies to the permit-issuing authority that such an intersection can be
constructed with no extraordinary danger to public safety.
9.79.2. Whenever possible, proposed intersections along one side of a street shall coincide with
existing or proposed intersections on the opposite side of such street. In any event, where a
centerline offset (jog) occurs at an intersection, the distance between centerlines of the intersecting
streets shall be not less than 125 feet, except in cases involving a subcollector, collector, or arterial
street, the minimum distance between centerlines shall be 150 feet.
9.79.3. Except when no other alternative is practicable or legally possible, no two streets may
intersect with any other street on the same side at a distance of less than 400 feet measured from
centerline to centerline of the intersecting street. When the intersected street is an arterial, the
distance between intersecting streets shall be at least 1,000 feet.

section shall abut a public street at least to the extent necessary to comply with the access
requirement set forth in Section 2.11. For purposes of this subsection, the term "public street"
includes a pre-existing public street as well as a street created by the subdivider that meets the
public street standards of this Ordinance and is dedicated for public use. Unless the recorded plat
of a subdivision clearly shows a street to be private, the recording of such a plat shall constitute an
offer of dedication of such street.
9.81.2. Subdivisions may be developed with private roads so long as:
9.81.2.1. The private roads are built to the same construction standards and specifications
as public streets;
9.81.2.2. The proposed development will have direct access onto a public street or, if the
tract has access to a public street only via a private road, such private road is improved to
public street standards;
9.81.2.3. No road intended to be private is planned or expected to be extended to serve
property outside that development; and
9.81.2.4. The standards applicable to unsubdivided developments set forth in Sections
9.82 and 9.83 are complied with.
9.81.3. No final plat that shows lots served by private roads may be recorded unless the final plat
contains the following notations:
9.81.3.1. "Further subdivision of any lot shown on this plat as served by a private road
may be prohibited by the Laurinburg Unified Development Ordinance."
9.81.3.2. "The policy of the City of Laurinburg is that, if the City improves streets (i) that
were never constructed to the standards required in the Laurinburg Unified Development
Ordinance for dedicated streets, and (ii) on which 75% of the dwelling units were
constructed after the effective date of this Ordinance, then 100% of the costs of such

(UNSUBDIVIDED DEVELOPMENTS).
9.82.1. Within unsubdivided developments, all private roads and access ways shall be designed
and constructed to facilitate the safe and convenient movement of motor vehicle and pedestrian
traffic. Width of roads, use of curb and gutter, and paving specifications shall be determined by
the provisions of the sections dealing with parking (Part II) and drainage (Part IX). To the extent
not otherwise covered in the foregoing articles, and to the extent that the requirements set forth
in this article for subdivision streets may be relevant to the roads in unsubdivided developments,
the requirements of this article may be applied to satisfy the standard set forth in the first sentence
of this subsection.
9.82.2. Whenever a road in an unsubdivided development connects two or more subcollector,
collector, or arterial streets in such a manner that any substantial volume of through traffic is likely
to make use of this road, such road shall be constructed in accordance with the standards
applicable to subdivision streets and shall be dedicated. In other cases when roads in unsubdivided
developments within the city are constructed in accordance with the specifications for subdivision
streets, the city may accept an offer of dedication of such streets.
9.82.3. In all unsubdivided residential developments, sidewalks shall be provided linking dwelling
units with other dwelling units, the public street, and on-site activity centers such as parking areas,
laundry facilities, and recreational areas and facilities. Notwithstanding the foregoing, sidewalks
shall not be required where pedestrians have access to a road that serves not more than nine
dwelling units. The sidewalk requirement may also be waived where, in the opinion of the
permit-issuing authority, an adequate system of ten-foot wide paved multi-use trails is provided
which would offer acceptable pedestrian facilities and access.
9.82.4. Whenever the permit-issuing authority finds that a means of pedestrian access is
necessary from an unsubdivided development to schools, parks, playgrounds, or other roads or
facilities and that such access is not conveniently provided by sidewalks adjacent to the roads, the
developer may be required to reserve an unobstructed easement of at least ten feet to provide such
access.
9.82.5. The sidewalks required by this section shall be at least five feet wide and constructed
according to the specifications set forth in the City of Laurinburg Construction Standards manual,
except that the permit-issuing authority may permit the installation of ten-foot wide paved multi-use
trails constructed with other suitable materials when it concludes that:
9.82.5.1. Such multi-use trails would serve the residents of the development as
adequately as concrete sidewalks; and
9.82.5.2. Such multi-use trails could be more environmentally desirable or more in keeping
with the overall design of the development.

of the developer. The developer shall also be responsible for the maintenance of street lights that
are not City-owned.
SECTION 9.92 EXCESSIVE ILLUMINATION.
Lighting within any lot that unnecessarily illuminates any other lot and substantially interferes with
the use or enjoyment of such other lot is prohibited.
SECTION 9.93 ELECTRIC POWER.
Every principal use and every lot within a subdivision shall have available to it a source of electric
power adequate to accommodate the reasonable needs of such use and every lot within such
subdivision. The provision of electrical service shall be in accordance with the City of Laurinburg
Electric System policies. No permanent electrical service shall be provided until a certificate of
occupancy is issued by the City.
SECTION 9.94 TELEPHONE SERVICE.
Every principal use and every lot within a subdivision must have available to it a telephone service
cable adequate to accommodate the reasonable needs of such use and every lot within such
subdivision. Compliance with this requirement shall be determined as follows:
April 21, 2015 Page 9-75 Article 9
ARTICLE 9. PERFORMANCE STANDARDS
9.94.1. If the use is not a subdivision and is located on a lot that is served by an existing
telephone line and the use can be served by a simple connection to such telephone line (as
opposed to a more complex distribution system, such as would be required in an apartment
complex or shopping center), then no further certification is necessary.
9.94.2. If the use is a subdivision or is not located on a lot served by an existing telephone line
or a substantial internal distribution system will be necessary, then the telephone utility company
must review the proposed plans and certify to the City that it can provide service that is adequate
to meet the needs of the proposed use and every lot within the proposed subdivision.
SECTION 9.95 UTILITIES TO BE CONSISTENT WITH INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL DEVELOPMENT.
9.95.1. Whenever it can reasonably be anticipated that utility facilities constructed in one
development will be extended to serve other adjacent or nearby developments, such utility facilities
(e.g., water or sewer lines) shall be located and constructed so that extensions can be made
conveniently and without undue burden or expense or unnecessary duplication of service as
determined by the City of Laurinburg. The dedication of requisite utility easements and/or the
construction of utility facilities may be required, as determined necessary by the City of Laurinburg,
to accommodate utility service to adjacent or nearby properties.
9.95.2. All utility facilities shall be constructed in such a manner as to minimize interference with
pedestrian or vehicular traffic and to facilitate maintenance without undue damage to improvements
or facilities located within the development.
SECTION 9.96 FIRE HYDRANTS.
9.96.1. Every development (subdivided or unsubdivided) that is served by a public water system
shall include a system of fire hydrants sufficient to provide adequate fire protection for the buildings
located or intended to be located within such development.
9.96.2. The presumption established by this ordinance is that to satisfy the standard set forth in
subsection 9.96.1, fire hydrants must be located so that all parts of every building within the
development may be served by a hydrant by laying not more than 500 feet of hose connected to
such hydrant. However, the fire chief may authorize or require a deviation from this standard if,
in his professional opinion, another arrangement more satisfactorily complies with the standard set
forth in subsection 9.96.1.
9.96.3. The public works director shall determine the color and precise location of all fire hydrants,
subject to the other provisions of this section. In general, fire hydrants shall be placed six feet
behind the curb line of publicly dedicated streets that have curb and gutter.
April 21, 2015 Page 9-76 Article 9
ARTICLE 9. PERFORMANCE STANDARDS
9.96.4. The public works director shall determine the design standards of all hydrants based on
fire flow needs. Unless otherwise specified by the public works director, all hydrants shall have two
2-1/2 inch hose connections and one 4-1/2 inch hose connection. The 2-1/2 inch hose connections
shall be located at least 21-1/2 inches from the ground level. All hydrant threads shall be national
standard threads.
9.96.5. Water lines that serve hydrants shall be at least six inch lines, and, unless no other
practicable alternative is available, no such lines shall be dead-end lines.
SECTION 9.97 SITES FOR DUMPSTERS.
9.97.1. Every development that, under the City's solid waste collection policies, is or will be
required to provide one or more dumpsters for solid waste collection shall provide sites for such
dumpsters that are:
9.97.1.1. Located so as to facilitate collection and minimize any negative impact on
persons occupying the development site, neighboring properties, or public rights-of-way;
and
9.97.1.2. Constructed according to specifications established by the public works director
to allow for collection without damage to the development site or the collection vehicle.
9.97.2. All such dumpsters shall be screened in accordance with Section 9.8.4.
9.97.3. All dumpster pads shall be constructed according to the specifications set forth in the City
of Laurinburg Construction Standards manual.
SECTION 9.98 LOTS SERVED BY GOVERNMENTALLY OWNED WATER OR SEWER LINES.
9.98.1. Whenever it is legally possible and practicable in terms of topography to connect a lot with
a City water or sewer line by running a connecting line not more than 300 feet from the lot to such
line, then no use requiring water or sewage disposal service may be made of such lot unless
connection is made to such line.
9.98.2. Connection to such water or sewer line is not legally possible if, in order to make
connection with such line by a connecting line that does not exceed 300 feet in length, it is
necessary to run the connecting line over property not owned by the owner of the property to be
served by the connection, and, after diligent effort, the easement necessary to run the connecting
line cannot reasonably be obtained.
9.98.3. For purposes of this article, a lot is "served" by a City-owned water or sewer line if
connection is required by this section.

that is adequate to accommodate the reasonable needs of such use or subdivision lot and that
complies with all applicable health regulations.
SECTION 9.100 DETERMINING COMPLIANCE WITH SECTION 9.99.
9.100.1. Primary responsibility for determining whether a proposed development will comply with
the standard set forth in Section 9.99 often lies with an agency other than the City, and the
developer must comply with the detailed standards and specifications of such other agency. The
relevant agencies are listed in subsection 9.100.2. Whenever any such agency requires detailed
construction or design drawings before giving its official approval to the proposed sewage disposal
system, the authority issuing a permit under this ordinance may rely upon a preliminary review by
such agency of the basic design elements of the proposed sewage disposal system to determine
compliance with Section 9.99. However, construction of such system may not be commenced until
the detailed plans and specifications have been reviewed and any appropriate permits issued by
such agency.

PART VIII. FLOOD DAMAGE PREVENTION
SECTION 9.111 STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION.
The Legislature of the State of North Carolina has in Part 6, Article 21 of Chapter 143; Parts 3, 5,
and 8 of Article 19 of Chapter 160A; and Article 8 of Chapter 160A of the North Carolina General
Statutes, delegated to local governmental units the responsibility to adopt regulations designed to
promote the public health, safety, and general welfare.
Therefore, the City Council of the City of Laurinburg, North Carolina, does ordain as follows:
SECTION 9.112 FINDINGS OF FACT.
9.112.1. The flood prone areas within the jurisdiction of the City of Laurinburg are subject to
periodic inundation which results in loss of life, property, health and safety hazards, disruption of
commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures of flood protection and
relief, and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety, and
general welfare.
9.112.2. These flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains
causing increases in flood heights and velocities and by the occupancy in flood prone areas of uses
vulnerable to floods or other hazards.
SECTION 9.113 STATEMENT OF PURPOSE.
It is the purpose of Article 9, Part VIII to promote public health, safety, and general welfare and
to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions within flood prone areas by provisions
designed to:
9.113.1. Restrict or prohibit uses that are dangerous to health, safety, and property due to water
or erosion hazards or that result in damaging increases in erosion, flood heights or velocities;
9.113.2. Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities that serve such uses, be
protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction;
9.113.3. Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural protective
barriers, which are involved in the accommodation of floodwaters;
9.113.4. Control filling, grading, dredging, and all other development that may increase erosion
or flood damage; and
9.113.5. Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers that will unnaturally divert flood
waters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands.

ARTICLE 9. PERFORMANCE STANDARDS
SECTION 9.114 OBJECTIVES.
The objectives of Article 9, Part VIII are to:
9.114.1. Protect human life, safety, and health;
9.114.2. Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects;
9.114.3. Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally
undertaken at the expense of the general public;
9.114.4. Minimize prolonged business losses and interruptions;
9.114.5. Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities (i.e., water and gas mains, electric,
telephone, cable and sewer lines, streets, and bridges) that are located in flood prone areas;
9.114.6. Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of flood
prone areas; and
9.114.7. Ensure that potential buyers are aware that property is in a Special Flood Hazard Area.
SECTION 9.115 GENERAL PROVISIONS.
9.115.1. Lands to Which this Part Applies.
Article 9, Part VIII shall apply to all Special Flood Hazard Areas within the jurisdiction, including
Extraterritorial Jurisdictions (ETJs), of the City of Laurinburg and within the jurisdiction of any other
community whose governing body agrees, by resolution, to such applicability.
9.115.2. Basis for Establishing the Special Flood Hazard Areas.
The Special Flood Hazard Areas are those identified under the Cooperating Technical State (CTS)
agreement between the State of North Carolina and FEMA in its Flood Insurance Study (FIS) and
its accompanying Flood Insurance Rate Maps (FIRM), for the City of Laurinburg, dated June 17,
2003, which are adopted by reference and declared to be a part of this Ordinance.
The Special Flood Hazard Areas also include those defined through standard engineering analysis
for private developments or by governmental agencies, but which have not yet been incorporated
in the FIRM. This includes, but is not limited to, detailed flood data:
9.115.2.1. Generated as a requirement of Section 9.116.3.11 and 9.116.3.12;
9.115.2.2. Preliminary FIRMs where more stringent than the effective FIRM; or
9.115.2.3. Post-disaster Flood Recovery Maps.
April 21, 2015 Page 9-84 Article 9
ARTICLE 9. PERFORMANCE STANDARDS
In addition, upon annexation to the City of Laurinburg or inclusion in the Extraterritorial Jurisdiction
(ETJ), the Special Flood Hazard Areas identified by the Federal Emergency Management Agency
(FEMA) and/or produced under the Cooperating Technical State agreement between the State of
North Carolina and FEMA as stated above, for the Unincorporated Areas of Scotland County, with
accompanying maps and other supporting data are adopted by reference and declared to be a part
of this Ordinance.
9.115.3. Establishment of Floodplain Development Permit.
A Floodplain Development Permit shall be required in conformance with the provisions of this
Ordinance prior to the commencement of any development activities within Special Flood Hazard
Areas determined in accordance with the provisions of Section 9.115.2 of this Ordinance.
9.115.4. Compliance.
No structure or land shall hereafter be located, extended, converted, altered, or developed in any
way without full compliance with the terms of this Ordinance and other applicable regulations.
9.115.5. Abrogation and Greater Restrictions.
This Ordinance is not intended to repeal, abrogate, or impair any existing easements, covenants,
or deed restrictions. However, where this Ordinance and another conflict or overlap, whichever
imposes the more stringent restrictions shall prevail.
9.115.6. Interpretation.
In the interpretation and application of this Ordinance, all provisions shall be:
9.115.6.1. Considered as minimum requirements;
9.115.6.2. Liberally construed in favor of the governing body; and
9.115.6.3. Deemed neither to limit nor repeal any other powers granted under State
statutes.
9.115.7. Warning and Disclaimer of Liability.
The degree of flood protection required by this Ordinance is considered reasonable for regulatory
purposes and is based on scientific and engineering consideration. Larger floods can and will occur.
Actual flood heights may be increased by man-made or natural causes. This Ordinance does not
imply that land outside the Special Flood Hazard Areas or uses permitted within such areas will be
free from flooding or flood damages. This Ordinance shall not create liability on the part of the City
of Laurinburg or by any officer or employee thereof for any flood damages that result from reliance
on this Ordinance or any administrative decision lawfully made hereunder.
9.115.8. Penalties for Violation.
Violation of the provisions of this Ordinance or failure to comply with any of its requirements,
including violation of conditions and safeguards established in connection with grants of variance

or special exceptions, shall constitute a misdemeanor. Any person who violates this Ordinance or
fails to comply with any of its requirements shall, upon conviction thereof, be fined not more than
$50.00 or imprisoned for not more than thirty (30) days, or both. Each day such violation continues
shall be considered a separate offense. Nothing herein contained shall prevent the City of
Laurinburg from taking such other lawful action as is necessary to prevent or remedy any violation.

Spot Zoning (Amended 6/21/2016)
The zoning of a relatively small area of land differently from the way the majority of the
surrounding land is zoned. Spot zoning is legal only if the government establishes that it is
reasonable. Reasonableness is determined by considering the size of the area; any special
conditions or factors regarding the area; the consistency of the zoning with the land use plan; the
degree of change in the zoning; the degree it allows uses different from the surrounding area; and
April 21, 2015 Page A-34 Appendix A
APPENDIX A. DEFINITIONS
the relative benefits and detriments for the owner, the neighbors, and the surrounding community.
The City of Laurinburg should consider the following factors in deliberating any potential spot
zoning:
(1) The Size and Nature of the Tract - The larger the area of spot zoning the more likely
it is to be reasonable. Singling out an individual lot for special zoning treatment is
more suspect than creating a zoning district that involves multiple parcels and
owners. Special site characteristics, such as topography, availability of utilities, or
access to rail or highways, can be important in this analysis.
(2) Compatibility with Existing Plans - If a clear public policy rationale for the different
zoning treatment is set out in the local government's adopted plans, that evidences
a public purpose for the zoning. By contrast, a zoning action that is inconsistent
with a plan may indicate special treatment that is contrary to the public interest and
thus be unreasonable.
(3) The Impact of the Zoning Decision on the Landowner, the Immediate Neighbors,
and the Surrounding Community - An action that is of great benefit to the owner
and only a mild inconvenience for the neighbors may be reasonable, while a zoning
decision that significantly harms the neighbors while only modestly benefitting the
owner would be unreasonable.
(4) The Relationship between the Newly Allowed Uses in a Spot Rezoning and the
Previously Allowed Uses - The degree of difference in the existing surrounding land
uses and the proposed new use is also important. The greater the difference in
allowed uses, the more likely the rezoning will be found unreasonable. For example,
in an area previously zoned for residential uses, allowing slightly higher residential
density may be reasonable while allowing industrial uses would be unreasonable.
(5) Ownership - In order to constitute spot zoning, the area to be rezoned must be
owned by a single owner.
Start of Construction
Includes substantial improvement, and means the date the building permit was issued, provided
the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition placement, or other
improvement was within 180 days of the permit date. The actual start means either the first
placement of permanent construction of a structure on a site, such as the pouring of slab or
footings, the installation of piles, the construction of columns, or any work beyond the stage of
excavation; or the placement of a manufactured home on a foundation. Permanent construction
does not include land preparation, such as clearing, grading, and filling; nor does it include the
installation of streets and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings,
piers, or foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the installation on the
property of accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or not part
of the main structure. For a substantial improvement, the actual start of construction means the
first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of the building, whether or not that
alteration affects the external dimensions of the building.

(1) For towers other than towers in the public rights-of-way, it increases the height of
the tower by more than 10% or by the height of one additional antenna array with
separation from the nearest existing antenna not to exceed twenty feet, whichever
is greater; for other eligible support structures, it increases the height of the
structure by more than 10% or more than ten feet, whichever is greater. Changes
in height should be measured from the original support structure in cases where
deployments are or will be separated horizontally, such as on buildings' rooftops; in
other circumstances, changes in height should be measured from the dimensions
of the tower or base station, inclusive of originally approved appurtenances and any
modifications that were approved prior to the passage of the Spectrum Act.
(2) For towers other than towers in the public rights-of-way, it involves adding an
appurtenance to the body of the tower that would protrude from the edge of the
tower more than twenty feet, or more than the width of the tower structure at the
level of the appurtenance, whichever is greater; for other eligible support structures,
it involves adding an appurtenance to the body of the structure that would protrude
from the edge of the structure by more than six feet.
(3) For any eligible support structure, it involves installation of more than the standard
number of new equipment cabinets for the technology involved, but not to exceed
four cabinets; or, for towers in the public rights-of-way and base stations, it involves
installation of any new equipment cabinets on the ground if there are no
pre-existing ground cabinets associated with the structure, or else involves

APPENDIX A. DEFINITIONS
installation of ground cabinets that are more than 10% larger in height or overall
volume than any other ground cabinets associated with the structure.
(4) It entails any excavation or deployment outside the current site.
(5) It would defeat the concealment elements of the eligible support structure
(6) It does not comply with conditions associated with the siting approval of the
construction or modification of the eligible support structure or base station
equipment, provided however that this limitation does not apply to any modification
that is non-compliant only in a manner that would not exceed the thresholds
identified in paragraphs 1-4 above.
