PREFACE 
    This Code constitutes a recodification of the general and permanent ordinances of the City of Mebane, North Carolina. 
    Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the 1952 Code, as supplemented and ordinances subsequently adopted by the city council. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this Code, the reader can locate any section of the 1952 Code, as supplemented, and any subsequent ordinance included herein. 
    The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order, and the various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Notes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state law have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this Code. 
Chapter and Section Numbering System 
    The chapter and section numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and local government codes. Each section number consists of two parts separated by a dash. The figure before the dash refers to the chapter number, and the figure after the dash refers to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the second section of chapter 1 is numbered 1-2, and the first section of chapter 6 is 6-1. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter, and at the same time new sections can be inserted in their proper place by using the decimal system for amendments. For example, if new material consisting of one section that would logically come between sections 6-1 and 6-2 is desired to be added, such new section would be numbered 6-1.5. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject. The next successive number shall be assigned to the new article or division. New chapters may be included by using one of the reserved chapter numbers. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. 
Page Numbering System 
    The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the volume. The number to the right of the colon represents the number of the page in that portion. In the case of a chapter of the Code, the number to the left of the colon indicates the number of the chapter. In the case of an appendix to the Code, the letter immediately to the left of the colon indicates the letter of the appendix. The following are typical parts of codes of ordinances, which may or may not appear in this Code at this time, and their corresponding prefixes:

Indexes 
    The indexes have been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the indexes themselves which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which the user is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
    A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up-to-date. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited, and the affected page or pages will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
    Keeping this publication up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. As revised pages are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
Acknowledgments 
    This publication was under the direct supervision of Jan Shekitka, Senior Code Attorney, and Sherry Allbritton, Editor, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida. Credit is gratefully given to the other members of the publisher's staff for their sincere interest and able assistance throughout the project. 
    The publisher is most grateful to Mr. Charles L. Bateman, City Attorney, for his cooperation and assistance during the progress of the work on this publication. It is hoped that his efforts and those of the publisher have resulted in a Code of Ordinances which will make the active law of the city readily accessible to all citizens and which will be a valuable tool in the day-to-day administration of the city's affairs.

For purpose of this article, the term "street improvement" includes grading, regrading, surfacing, resurfacing, widening, paving, repaving, the acquisition of right-of-way, and the construction or reconstruction of curb, gutters, and street drainage facilities. 
Sec. 6.2. - Street improvements; when petition unnecessary.

(2)  That it is in the public interest to connect two streets, or portions of a street, already improved. 
(3)  That it is in the public interest to widen a street, or part thereof, which is already improved, provided that assessments for widening any street or portions of a street without petition shall be limited to the cost of widening and otherwise improving the street in accordance with the street classiication and improvement standards established by the City's thoroughfare or major street plan for the particular street or part thereof to be widened and improved under the authority granted by this article.

Sec. 9.2. - Settlement of claims by city manager. 
    The Council may, by ordinance, authorize the City Manager to settle claims against the City.

Sec. 1-6. - General penalty; enforcement of ordinances; continuing violations. 
(a)  Unless otherwise specifically provided, violation of any provision of this Code or any other city ordinance shall subject the offender to a civil penalty of $500.00; except, that where the General Statutes of North Carolina provide specific remedies for violations of provisions of this Code adopted pursuant to such statutes, such remedies available to the city for enforcement of this Code shall be in addition to the remedies hereinafter stated. No criminal penalties shall be applicable unless hereinafter stated in this section as being applicable to specific chapters or provisions of this Code. Where a civil penalty is incurred, a civil citation shall be issued by the appropriate official of the city and either served directly on the violator or his duly designated agent, or registered agent if a corporation, in person or posted in the United States mail service by first class mail addressed to the last known address of the violator as contained in the records of the county, or obtained from the violator at the time of issuance of the warning citation. If the violation is due to use of a vehicle, the citation may be served by posting it on the windshield of the offending vehicle. The violator shall be deemed to have been served upon the mailing of such citation. The citation shall direct the violator to appear before the designated city official, located in the city hall, within 15 days of the date of the citation or alternatively to pay the citation by mail. The violation for which the citation is issued must have been corrected by the time the citation is paid, if applicable; otherwise, further citations shall be issued. Citations may be issued for each day the offense continues until the prohibited activity is ceased or abated. If the violator fails to respond to a citation within 15 days of its issuance or pay the penalty prescribed therein, the violator is liable for an additional penalty of $100.00. If the violator fails to respond to a citation within 30 days, the city may institute a civil action in the nature of a debt in the appropriate division of the North Carolina General Court of Justice for the collection of the penalty. 
(b)  Any willful failure to pay any civil penalty imposed within this Code is a misdemeanor under G.S. 14-4 and punishable by a fine of $500.00 or 30 days in jail, or both. 
(c)  In addition to any civil or criminal penalties set out in this section, any provision of this Code or any other city ordinance may be enforced by an appropriate equitable remedy issuing from a court of competent jurisdiction. In such case, the general court of justice shall have jurisdiction to issue such orders as may be appropriate, and it shall not be a defense to the application of the city for equitable relief that there is an adequate remedy at law. 
(d)  In addition to any civil or criminal penalties set out in this section, any provision of this Code or any other city ordinance that makes unlawful a condition existing upon or use made of real property may be enforced by injunction and order of abatement, and the general court of justice shall have jurisdiction to issue such orders. When a violation of such a provision occurs, the city may apply to the appropriate division of the general court of justice for a mandatory or prohibitory injunction and order of abatement commanding the defendant to correct the unlawful condition upon or cease the unlawful use of the property. The action shall be governed in all respects by the laws and rules governing civil proceedings, including the Rules of Civil Procedure in general and Rule 65 in particular. 
(e)  In addition to an injunction, the court may enter an order of abatement as a part of the judgment in the cause. An order of abatement may direct that: 
(1)  Buildings or other structures on the property be closed, demolished or removed; 
(2)  Fixtures, furniture or other movable property be removed from buildings on the property; 
(3)  Grass and weeds be cut; 
(4)  Improvements or repairs be made; or 
(5)  Any other action be taken that is necessary to bring the property into compliance with this Code or such ordinance. 
If the defendant fails or refuses to comply with an injunction or with an order of abatement within the time allowed by the court, he may be cited for contempt, and the city may execute the order of abatement. The city shall have a lien on the property for the cost of executing an order of abatement in the nature of a mechanic's and materialman's lien, and may post notice of lis pendens against the real property of the defendant at the office of the register of deeds of the county. The defendant may secure cancellation of an order of abatement by paying all costs of the proceedings and posting a bond for compliance with the order. The bond shall be given with sureties approved by the clerk of superior court in an amount approved by the judge before whom the matter is heard and shall be conditioned on the defendant's full compliance with the terms of the order of abatement within a time fixed by the judge. Cancellation of an order of abatement shall not suspend or cancel an injunction issued in conjunction therewith. 
(f)  The provisions of this Code and any other city ordinances may be enforced by one, all or a combination of the remedies authorized and prescribed by this section, except that any provision the violation of which incurs a civil penalty shall not be enforced by criminal penalties except as outlined in subsection (b) of this section. 
(g)  Except as otherwise specifically provided, each day's continuing violation of any provision of this Code or any other city ordinance shall be a separate and distinct offense. 
(h)  Any ordinances hereafter adopted by the city council, the violation of which shall incur a penalty, shall specify whether the enforcement shall be pursuant to the civil penalty or criminal penal provisions of this section. 
(i)  Upon determination of a violation of any section of this Code, the penalty for which is a civil penalty, the city may cause a warning citation to be issued to the violator, setting out the nature of the violation, the section violated, the date of the violation and an order to immediately cease the violation or, if the violation is in the nature of an infraction for which an order of abatement would be appropriate in a civil proceeding, stating a reasonable period of time in which the violation must be abated. The warning citation shall specify that a second citation shall incur a civil penalty. 
(j)  Upon failure of the violator to obey the warning citation, a civil citation shall be issued by the appropriate official of the city and either served directly on the violator or his duly designated agent, or registered agent if a corporation, in person or posted in the United States mail service by first class mail addressed to the last known address of the violator as contained in the records of the county, or obtained from the violator at the time of issuance of the warning citation. The violator shall be deemed to have been served upon the mailing of such citation. The citation shall direct the violator to appear before the designated city official, located in the city hall, within 15 days of the date of the citation or alternatively to pay the citation by mail. The violation for which the citation is issued must have been corrected by the time the citation is paid; otherwise, further citations shall be issued. Citations may be issued for each day the offense continues until the prohibited activity is ceased or abated. If the violator fails to respond to a citation within 15 days of its issuance and pay the penalty prescribed therein, the city may institute a civil action in the nature of debt pursuant to subsection (a) of this section.

Sec. 1-8. - Supplementation of Code. 
(a)  By contract or by city personnel, supplements to this Code shall be prepared whenever authorized or directed by the city. A supplement to the Code shall include all substantive, permanent and general parts of ordinances passed by the city council during the period covered by the supplement and all changes made thereby in the Code. The pages of a supplement shall be so numbered that they will fit properly into the Code and will, where necessary, replace pages which have become obsolete or partially obsolete, and the new pages shall be so prepared that, when they have been inserted, the Code will be current through the date of the adoption of the latest ordinance included in the supplement. 
(b)  In preparing a supplement to this Code, all portions of the Code which have been repealed shall be excluded from the Code by their omission from reprinted pages. 
(c)  When preparing a supplement to this Code, the codifier (meaning the person, agency or organization authorized to prepare the supplement) may make formal, nonsubstantive changes in ordinances and parts of ordinances included in the supplement, insofar as it is necessary to do so to embody them into a unified code. For example, the codifier may:

(2)  Provide appropriate catchlines, headings and titles for sections and other subdivisions of the Code printed in the supplement, and make changes in such catchlines, headings and titles. 
(3)  Assign appropriate numbers to sections and other subdivisions to be inserted in the Code and, where necessary to accommodate new material, change existing section or other subdivision numbers. 
(4)  Change the words "this ordinance" or words of the same meaning to "this chapter," "this article," "this division," etc., as the case may be, or to "sections _____ to _____" (inserting section numbers to indicate the sections of the Code which embody the substantive sections of the ordinance incorporated into the Code). 
(5)  Make other nonsubstantive changes necessary to preserve the original meanings of ordinance sections inserted into the Code; but in no case shall the codifier make any change in the meaning or effect of ordinance material included in the supplement or already embodied in the Code. 
Sec. 1-9. - Ordinances not affected by Code. 
    Nothing in this Code or the ordinance adopting this Code shall be construed to repeal or otherwise affect the validity of any of the following:

    The City of Mebane is authorized to adopt this article pursuant to North Carolina law, including but not limited to Article 14, Section 5 of the Constitution of North Carolina; North Carolina General Statutes 143-214.7 and rules promulgated by the Environmental Management Commission thereunder; Session Law 2006-246; Chapter 160A, §§ 174, 185. 
(Ord. of 5-7-2007(1), § 102) 
Sec. 6-193. - Findings. 
(a)  It is hereby determined that: 
(1)  Development and redevelopment alter the hydrologic response of local watersheds and increases stormwater runoff rates and volumes, flooding, soil erosion, stream channel erosion, nonpoint and point source pollution, and sediment transport and deposition, as well as reducing groundwater recharge; 
(2)  These changes in stormwater runoff contribute to increased quantities of water-borne pollutants and alterations in hydrology which are harmful to public health and safety as well as to the natural environment; and 
(3)  These effects can be managed and minimized by applying proper design and well-planned controls to manage stormwater runoff from development sites. 
(b)  Further, the Federal Water Pollution Control Act of 1972 ("Clean Water Act") and federal Phase II Stormwater Rules promulgated under it, as well as rules of the North Carolina Environmental Management Commission promulgated in response to federal Phase II requirements, compel certain urbanized areas, including this jurisdiction, to adopt the minimum stormwater controls such as those included in this article. 
(c)  Therefore, the Mebane City Council establishes this set of water quality and quantity regulations to meet the requirements of state and federal law regarding control of stormwater runoff and discharge.

Sec. 6-194. - Purpose. 
(a)  General. The purpose of this article is to protect, maintain and enhance the public health, safety, environment and general welfare by establishing minimum requirements and procedures to control the adverse effects of increased post-development stormwater runoff and nonpoint and point source pollution associated with new development and redevelopment It has been determined that proper management of construction-related and post-development stormwater runoff will minimize damage to public and private property and infrastructure, safeguard the public health, safety, and general welfare, and protect water and aquatic resources. 
(b)  Specific. This article seeks to meet its general purpose through the following specific objectives and means: 
(1)  Establishing decision-making processes for development that protects the integrity of watersheds and preserve the health of water resources; 
(2)  Requiring that new development and redevelopment maintain the pre-development hydrologic response in their post-development state as nearly as practicable for the applicable design storm to reduce flooding, streambank erosion, nonpoint and point source pollution and increases in stream temperature, and to maintain the integrity of stream channels and aquatic habitats; 
(3)  Establishing minimum post-development stormwater management standards and design criteria for the regulation and control of stormwater runoff quantity and quality; 
(4)  Establishing design and review criteria for the construction, function, and use of structural stormwater BMPs that may be used to meet the minimum post-development stormwater management standards; 
(5)  Encouraging the use of better management and site design practices, such as the use of vegetated conveyances for stormwater and the preservation of greenspace, riparian buffers, and other conservation areas to the maximum extent practicable; 
(6)  Establishing provisions for the long-term responsibility for and maintenance of structural and nonstructural stormwater BMPs to ensure that they continue to function as designed, are maintained appropriately, and pose no threat to public safety; 
(7)  Establishing administrative procedures for the submission, review, approval and disapproval of stormwater management plans, for the inspection of approved projects, and to assure appropriate long-term maintenance.

(a)  In general. 
(1)  Prior to the conveyance or transfer of any lot or building site to be served by a structural BMP pursuant to this article, and prior to issuance of any permit for development or redevelopment requiring a structural BMP pursuant to this article, the applicant or owner of the site must execute an operation and maintenance agreement that shall be binding on all subsequent owners of the site, portions of the site, and lots or parcels served by the structural BMP. Until the transference of all property, sites, or lots served by the structural BMP, the original owner or applicant shall have primary responsibility for carrying out the provisions of the maintenance agreement. 
(2)  The operation and maintenance agreement shall require the owner or owners to maintain, repair and, if necessary, reconstruct the structural BMP, and shall state the terms, conditions, and schedule of maintenance for the structural BMP. In addition, it shall grant to the city a right of entry in the event that the stormwater administrator has reason to believe it has become necessary to inspect, monitor, maintain, repair, or reconstruct the structural BMP; however, in no case shall the right of entry, of itself, confer an obligation on the city to assume responsibility for the structural BMP. 
(3)  The operation and maintenance agreement must be approved by the stormwater administrator prior to plan approval, and it shall be referenced on the final plat and shall be recorded with the county register of deeds upon final plat approval. A copy of the recorded maintenance agreement shall be given to the stormwater administrator within 14 days following its recordation. 
(b)  Special requirement for homeowners' and other associations. For all structural BMPs required pursuant to this article and that are to be or are owned and maintained by a homeowners' association, property owners' association, or similar entity, the required operation and maintenance agreement shall include all of the following provisions: 
(1)  Acknowledgment that the association shall continuously operate and maintain the stormwater control and management facilities. 
(2)  Establishment of an escrow account, which can be spent solely for sediment removal, structural, biological or vegetative replacement, major repair, or reconstruction of the structural BMPs. If structural BMPs are not performing adequately or as intended or are not properly maintained, the city, in its sole discretion, may remedy the situation, and in such instances the City of Mebane shall be fully reimbursed from the escrow account. Escrowed funds may be spent by the association for sediment removal, structural, biological or vegetative replacement, major repair, and reconstruction of the structural BMPs, provided that the City of Mebane shall first consent to the expenditure. 
(3)  Both developer contribution and annual sinking funds shall fund the escrow account. Prior to plat recordation or issuance of construction permits, whichever shall first occur, the developer shall pay into the escrow account an amount equal to 15 percent of the initial construction cost of the structural BMPs. Two-thirds of the total amount of sinking fund budget shall be deposited into the escrow account within the first five years and the full amount shall be deposited within ten years following initial construction of the structural BMPs. Funds shall be deposited each year into the escrow account. A portion of the annual assessments of the association shall include an allocation into the escrow account. Any funds drawn down from the escrow account shall be replaced in accordance with the schedule of anticipated work used to create the sinking fund budget. 
(4)  The percent of developer contribution and lengths of time to fund the escrow account may be varied by the city depending on the design and materials of the stormwater control and management facility.

The notification shall indicate the nature of the violation, contain the address or other description of the site upon which the violation is occurring, order the necessary action to abate the violation, and give a deadline for correcting the violation. If civil penalties are to be assessed, the notice of violation shall also contain a statement of the civil penalties to be assessed, the time of their accrual, and the time within which they must be paid or be subject to collection as a debt. 
(2)  The stormwater administrator may deliver the notice of violation and correction order personally, by the city police department, city planning department, by certified or registered mail, return receipt requested, or by any means authorized for the service of documents by Rule 4 of the North Carolina Rules of Civil Procedure. 
(3)  If a violation is not corrected within a reasonable period of time, as provided in the notification, the stormwater administrator may take appropriate action under this article to correct and abate the violation and to ensure compliance with this article. 
(4)  Extension of time. A person who receives a notice of violation and correction order, or the owner of the land on which the violation occurs, may submit to the stormwater administrator a written request for an extension of time for correction of the violation. On determining that the request includes enough information to show that the violation cannot be corrected within the specified time limit for reasons beyond the control of the person requesting the extension, the stormwater administrator may extend the time limit as is reasonably necessary to allow timely correction of the violation, up to, but not exceeding 30 days. The stormwater administrator may grant 15-day extensions in addition to the foregoing extension if the violation cannot be corrected within the permitted time due to circumstances beyond the control of the person violating this article. The stormwater administrator may grant an extension only by written notice of extension. The notice of extension shall state the date prior to which correction must be made, after which the violator will be subject to the penalties described in the notice of violation and correction order. 
(5)  Enforcement after time to correct. After the time has expired to correct a violation, including any extension(s) if authorized by the stormwater administrator, the stormwater administrator shall determine if the violation is corrected. If the violation is not corrected, the stormwater administrator may act to impose one or more of the remedies and penalties authorized by this article. 
(6)  Emergency enforcement. If delay in correcting a violation would seriously threaten the effective enforcement of this article or pose an immediate danger to the public health, safety, or welfare, then the stormwater administrator may order the immediate cessation of a violation. Any person so ordered shall cease any violation immediately. The stormwater administrator may seek immediate enforcement, without prior written notice, through any remedy or penalty authorized by this article.

DIVISION 6. - DEFINITIONS 

Sec. 6-291. - Terms defined. 
    When used in this article, the following words and terms shall have the meaning set forth in this section, unless other provisions of this article specifically indicate otherwise. 
    Ten-year, 24-hour storm. A stormwater event which occurs on average once every ten years or statistically has a ten-percent chance on average of occurring in a given year. The ten-year, 24-hour storm produces 5.9 inches of rain in the Mebane area. 
    Applicator. Person who applies fertilizer to the land or the immediate supervisor of such person. 
    Built-upon area (BUA). That portion of a development project that is covered by impervious or partially impervious surface including, but not limited to, buildings; pavement and gravel areas such as roads, parking lots, and paths; and recreation facilities such as tennis courts. "Built-upon area" does not include a wooden slatted deck, the water area of a swimming pool, or previous or partially pervious paving material to the extent that the paving material absorbs water or allows water to infiltrate through the paving material. 
    Commission. The North Carolina Environmental Management Commission. 
    Consultant. Person who is hired to provide professional advice to another person. 
    Department. The North Carolina Department of Environment and Natural Resources. 
    Ditch or canal. A man-made channel other than a modified natural stream constructed for drainage purposes that is typically dug through inter-stream divide areas. A ditch or canal may have flows that are perennial, intermittent, or ephemeral and may exhibit hydrological and biological characteristics similar to perennial or intermittent streams. 
    Development. Any land disturbing activity which adds to or changes the amount of impervious or partially pervious cover on a land area or which otherwise decreases the infiltration of precipitation into the soil, other than rebuilding activity that does not qualify as redevelopment. 
    Director. The director of the Division of Water Quality or the North Carolina Department of Environment and Natural Resources. 
    Division. The Division of Water Quality in the Department. 
    Ephemeral (stormwater) stream. A feature that carries only stormwater in direct response to precipitation with water flowing only during and shortly after large precipitation events. An ephemeral stream may or may not have a well-defined channel, the aquatic bed is always above the water table, and stormwater runoff is the primary source of water. An ephemeral stream typically lacks the biological, hydrological, and physical characteristics commonly associated with the continuous or intermittent conveyance of water. 
    High-density project. Any project that exceeds the low density threshold for dwelling units per acre or built-upon area. 
    Intermittent stream. A well-defined channel that contains water for only part of the year, typically during winter and spring when the aquatic bed is below the water table. The flow may be heavily supplemented by stormwater runoff. An intermittent stream often lacks the biological and hydrological characteristics commonly associated with the conveyance of water. 
    Larger common plan of development or sale. Any area where multiple separate and distinct construction or land disturbing activities will occur under one plan. A plan is any announcement or piece of documentation (including but not limited to a sign, public notice or hearing, sales pitch, advertisement, loan application, drawing, permit application, zoning request, or computer design) or physical demarcation (including but not limited to boundary signs, lot stakes, or surveyor markings) indicating that construction activities may occur on a specific plot. 
    Low-density project. A project that has no more than two dwelling units per acre or twenty-four percent built-upon area (BUA) for all residential and non-residential development. A project with an overall density at or below the relevant low-density threshold, but containing areas with a density greater than the overall project density, may be considered low density as long as the project meets or exceeds the post-construction model practices for low-density projects and locates the higher density in upland areas and away from surface waters and drainageways to the maximum extent practicable. 
    Owner. The legal or beneficial owner of land, including but not limited to a mortgagee or vendee in possession, receiver, executor, trustee, or long-term or commercial lessee, or any other person or entity holding proprietary rights in the property or having legal power of management and control of the property. "Owner" shall include long-term commercial tenants; management entities, such as those charged with or engaged in the management of properties for profit; and every person or entity having joint ownership of the property. A secured lender not in possession of the property does not constitute an owner, unless the secured lender is included within the meaning of "owner" under another description in this definition, such as a management entity. 
    Perennial stream. A well-defined channel that contains water year round during a year of normal rainfall with the aquatic bed located below the water table for most of the year. Groundwater is the primary source of water for a perennial stream, but it also carries stormwater runoff. A perennial stream exhibits the typical biological, hydrological, and physical characteristics commonly associated with the continuous conveyance of water. 
    Runoff. That portion of the precipitation resulting from the one-year, 24-hour storm that is discharged from the drainage area. 
    Redevelopment. Any development on previously-developed land other than a rebuilding activity that results in no net increase in built-upon area and provides equal or greater stormwater control than the previous development. 
    Stormwater BMP design manual. The stormwater BMP design manual approved for use in Phase II jurisdictions by the North Carolina Department of the Environment and Natural Resources-Division of Water Quality for the proper implementation of the requirements of the federal Phase II stormwater program. All references herein to the stormwater BMP design manual are to the latest published edition or revision. 
    Structural BMP. A physical device designed to trap, settle out, or filter pollutants from stormwater runoff; to alter or reduce stormwater runoff velocity, amount, timing, or other characteristics; to approximate the pre-development hydrology on a developed site; or to achieve any combination of these goals. Structural BMP includes physical practices such as constructed wetlands, vegetative practices, filter strips, grassed swales, and other methods installed or created on real property. "Structural BMP" is synonymous with "structural practice," "stormwater control facility," "stormwater control practice," "stormwater treatment practice," "stormwater management practice," "stormwater control measures," "structural stormwater treatment systems," and similar terms used in this article. 
    Surface waters. All waters of the state as defined in G.S. 143-212 except underground waters. 
    Substantial progress. For the purposes of determining whether sufficient progress has been made on an approved plan, one or more of the following construction activities toward the completion of a site or subdivision plan shall occur: obtaining a grading permit and conducting grading activity on a continuous basis and not discontinued for more than 30 days; or installation and approval of on-site infrastructure; or obtaining a building permit for the construction and approval of a building foundation. "Substantial progress" for purposes of determining whether an approved plan is null and void is not necessarily the same as "substantial expenditures" used for determining vested rights pursuant to applicable law.

Sec. 10-35. - Burial rights of lot and grave owners. 
(a)  Certificate of ownership. Upon receipt of payment in full for any lot, the city shall execute and deliver to the purchaser (or purchasers) a certificate of ownership (deed), granting to such purchaser or purchasers and his, her or their heirs and assigns, the exclusive right of interment in said lot, subject to the rules and regulations contained in this chapter and in any amendments hereto which may hereafter be made by the city council. 
(b)  Right of interment under owner's declaration of reservation. At the time of the purchase of a lot or grave, or at any time thereafter during the lifetime of the purchaser or transferee, and in accordance with these rules and regulations, the owner or owners of any such lot or grave may present his, her or their deed and may file in the office of the management a declaration of reservation, therein specifically designating the persons entitled to be buried in any or all of the graves in the lot. No other person may be buried in any grave designated by the owner or owners in the declaration of reservation except by an amended declaration of reservation executed by the owner or owners and filed in the office of the management. The owner or owners of any lot may in the declaration of reservation limit the persons entitled to be buried in said lot to those persons designated in the declaration of reservation. In the event that the owner or owners shall fail to designate burial rights as to each grave in said lot, or shall fail to limit burials in said grave to those designated in the declaration of reservation, then, as to the graves not designated, the right of burial shall be as provided in subsection (c) of this section. Upon application by any person for interment of a body in a given grave, the burden of proof as to the identity of the person to be interred rests upon the applicant; and no liability shall be incurred by the management or the city as the result of a false statement in the application; but the management shall make reasonable effort to see that only persons entitled to be buried in a given grave are so interred. 
(c)  Interment in absence declaration. In the absence of a declaration of reservation by the registered owner of a lot, the right of interment shall be in the following order: 
(1)  One grave shall be reserved for the owner and one for the owner's surviving spouse, if any. 
(2)  The remaining graves in said lot shall be held in trust by the city for burial of the following persons in the order of their death, and a request for burial, to wit: 
a.  Children of owner or owners and their respective spouses. 
b.  Lineal descendants of owner or owners and their respective spouses. 
c.  Parents of the owner or owners. 
(d)  Vested rights of lot owners. The burial rights in all lots and graves conveyed shall be presumed to be the sole and separate property of the person or persons named as grantees in the certificate of ownership, in accordance with these rules and regulations; provided, however, that the husband or wife shall have a vested right of interment of his or her body in any burial grave conveyed to the other, which shall continue as long as he or she shall remain the husband or wife of the grave owner, or shall be his or her wife or husband at the time of such grave owner's demise. No conveyance or transfer shall divest the husband or wife of any owner of his or her vested right of interment without the joinder therein executed by the spouse and filed in the office of the management. 
(e)  Alienability of cemetery grave. All lots, the use of which has been conveyed in a deed, are indivisible. Whenever an interment of the remains of a member, or of a relative of a member, of the family of the recorded owner, or of the recorded owner, is made in a lot, the lot thereby becomes inalienable and shall be held as the family lot of the owner, except as otherwise provided by owner's declaration of reservation. 
(f)  Residency as related to Mebane Memorial Gardens. Graves are sold based on the permanent residency of the purchaser(s) and the permanent residency of the person(s) designated in the declaration of reservation as having rights of interment. Any grave or graves not designated under the declaration of reservation shall be considered purchased for the interment of a non-resident, and the prices will be reflected as such in accordance with the current cemetery fee schedule at the time of purchase. Graves purchased by and/or designated to residents, but later designated for use by a non-resident shall be subject to a transfer from resident to non-resident fee and a document transfer fee as reflected on the cemetery fee schedule current at the time of the transfer. Graves purchased at non-resident rates shall not qualify for any refund should a decision be made to inter the remains of a resident at a later date. Graves shall be sold to individual persons only and not to businesses. Registered funeral services may purchase graves at-need or pre-need as an agent of the person or persons intended for interment therein, but the cemetery purchase contract shall be made out in the name of that person or persons, and the cost of said graves shall reflect that or those person's residency status.

Sec. 32-40. - Payment of franchise fee. 
(a)  For the reason that the streets to be used by the grantee in the operation of its system within the boundaries of the city are valuable public properties acquired and maintained by the city at great expense to its taxpayers, and that the grant to the grantee of the streets is a valuable property right without which the grantee would be required to invest substantial capital in right-of-way costs and acquisitions, and because the city will incur costs in regulating and administering the franchise, and because the city will make available a portion of the franchise fee to further the development of the public and community uses of cable TV, the grantee shall pay to the city an amount equal to three percent of the grantee's gross annual revenue. 
(b)  The annual franchise fee, as stated in subsection (a) of this section, shall be payable quarterly to the city treasurer and will begin accruing from the date this article is accepted.

If no such services are available, the grantee shall endeavor to find some beneficial use for the vacated channel. 
(2)  The grantee shall inform the city manager 30 days before it plans to eliminate any program offering. 
(3)  In no event shall the grantee cease offering the channel providing daily alphanumeric listings of all programs and other offerings on every channel for each period. 
(4)  The switching of any program services from basic to full service tier, or from either of those to a new service tier, shall be considered a rate increase and shall require the approval of the city council unless otherwise preempted by actions at the FCC. 
(Code 1952, ch. H, art. VI, § 10) 
Sec. 32-42. - Use of poles and streets.

Sec. 36-189. - Notification of the discharge of hazardous waste. 
    The city prohibits the discharge of any hazardous wastes without notification and approval of the POTW director. 
(1)  Any user who commences the discharge of hazardous waste shall notify the POTW, the EPA Regional Waste Management Division Director, and state hazardous waste authorities, in writing, of any discharge into the POTW of a substance which, if otherwise disposed of, would be a hazardous waste under 40 CFR Part 261. Such notification must include the name of the hazardous waste as set forth in 40 CFR Part 261, the EPA hazardous waste number, and the type of discharge (continuous, batch, or other). If the user discharges more than 100 kilograms of such waste per calendar month to the POTW, the notification also shall contain the following information to the extent such information is known and readily available to the user: an identification of the hazardous constituents contained in the wastes, an estimation of the mass and concentration of such constituents in the wastestream discharge during the calendar month, and an estimation of the mass of constituents in the wastestream expected to be discharged during the following 12 months. All notifications must take place no later than 180 days after the discharge commences. Any notification under this paragraph need be submitted only once for each hazardous waste discharge. However, notifications of changed conditions must be submitted under section 36-185. The notification requirement in this section does not apply to pollutants already reported by users subject to categorical pretreatment standards under the self-monitoring requirements of sections 36-181, 36-183, and 36-184. 
(2)  Dischargers are exempt from the requirements of subsection 36-189(1) above, during a calendar month in which they discharge no more than 15 kilograms of hazardous wastes, unless the wastes are acute hazardous wastes as specific in 40 CFR 261.30(d) and 261.33(e). Discharge of more than 15 kilograms of nonacute hazardous wastes in a calendar month, or of any quantity of acute hazardous wastes as specified in 40 CFR 261.30(d) and 261.33(e), requires a one-time notification. Subsequent months during which the user discharges more than such quantities of any hazardous waste do not require additional notification. 
(3)  In the case of any new regulation under section 3001 of RCRA identifying additional characteristics of hazardous waste or listing any additional substance as a hazardous waste, the user must notify the POTW director, the EPA Regional Waste Management Waste Division Director, and state hazardous waste authorities of the discharge of such substance within 90 days of the effective date of such regulations. 
(4)  In the case of any notification made under this section, the user shall certify that it has a program in place to reduce the volume and toxicity of hazardous wastes generated to the degree it has determined to be economically practical. 
(5)  This provision does not create a right to discharge any substance not otherwise permitted to be discharged by this ordinance, a permit issued thereunder, or any applicable federal or state law.

Sec. 36-191. - Grab and composite sample collection. 
(a)  All wastewater samples must be representative of the user's discharge. Wastewater monitoring and flow measurement facilities shall be properly operated, kept clean, and maintained in good working order at all times. The failure of a user to keep its monitoring facility in good working order shall not be grounds for the user to claim that sample results are unrepresentative of its discharge. 
(b)  Grab samples must be used for pH, cyanide, total phenols, oil and grease, sulfide, volatile organic compounds, and any other pollutants as required by 40 CFR 136. The POTW shall determine the number of grabs necessary to be representative of the USER'S discharge. See 40 CFR 403.12(g)(5) for additional grab sample number requirements for BMR and 90 day compliance reports. Additionally, the POTW Director may allow collection of multiple grabs during a 24-hour period which are composited prior to analysis as allowed under 40 CFR 136. 
(c)  Composite samples: All wastewater composite samples shall be collected with a minimum of hourly aliquots or grabs for each hour that there is a discharge. All wastewater composite samples shall be collected using flow proportional composite collection techniques, unless time-proportional composite sampling or grab sampling is authorized by the POTW director. When authorizing time-proportional composites or grabs, the samples must be representative and the decision to allow the alternative sampling must be documented.

Within 30 days from the date of this notice, an explanation for the violation and a plan for the satisfactory correction thereof shall be submitted to the city by the user. Submission of this plan does not relieve the discharger of liability for any violations occurring before or after receipt of the notice of violation. 
(2)  Consent orders. The POTW director is hereby empowered to enter into consent orders, assurances of voluntary compliance, or other similar documents establishing an agreement with the person responsible for the noncompliance. Such orders will include specific action to be taken by the discharger to correct the noncompliance within a time period also specified by the order. Consent orders shall have the same force and effect as an administrative order issued pursuant to subsection 36-231(b)(4), below. 
(3)  Show cause hearing. 
a.  The POTW director may order any industrial user who causes or is responsible for an unauthorized discharge, has violated this article or is in noncompliance with a wastewater discharge permit to show cause why a proposed enforcement action should not be taken. In the event the POTW director determines that a show cause order should be issued, a notice shall be served on the user specifying the time and place for the hearing, the proposed enforcement action, the reasons for such action, and a request that the user show cause why this proposed enforcement action should not be taken.

b.  On which the total area covered by all things (except for clear plastic that does not affect the reflectiveness of the outerwear) resting on or attached to it is less than a total of four square inches. 
(8)  Signs in general. Display a sign larger than two feet in any dimension, or display anything with illuminated, animated, blinking, chasing, flashing, or moving effects that can be seen by a person with 20-20 vision from a distance of four feet. 
(9)  Signs in violation of UDO. Display a sign or other device in the solicitation- restricted right-of-way that is in violation of the UDO.

(14)  Removal of goods. Fail to remove all goods in connection with soliciting from the solicitation-restricted right-of-way when the individual is more than 50 feet away from any such item.

A "work zone" is the area between the first sign that informs motorists or drivers of the existence of a work zone, construction zone, maintenance zone, utility work zone, or similar warning on a street and the last sign that informs motorist or drivers of the end of the zone, regardless of whether a sign states the penalty for speeding in the zone. Work zones are designated as such if the Secretary of State Department of Transportation or the city manager determines, after engineering review, that the posting is necessary to ensure the safety of the traveling public due to a hazardous condition; or if the posting is done at the direction of or with the consent of a governmental body or official having jurisdiction. The direction or consent may be given by any appropriate manner, including incorporation into specifications of a contract.

The chief of police may amend an already-issued permit to impose, as additional conditions of the permit, additional requirements respecting the posting of permits. 
    Those amendments shall be effective on the fourth day after notice of amendment is mailed to the permittee's address as stated in the permit application. 
( Ord. of 8-1-2016 )

(h)  A statement as to whether or not the applicant has been convicted of any crime, misdemeanor or violation of any municipal ordinance, the nature of the offense and the punishment or penalty assessed therefor;

( Ord. of 8-1-2016 ) 
Sec. 39-11. - False information. 
    It shall be unlawful for any person to give false or misleading information in connection with his application for a permit required by this article. 
( Ord. of 8-1-2016 )

    The chief of police shall issue a permit to the applicant unless the applicant fails to comply with this article which permit will be valid for 30 days. 
( Ord. of 8-1-2016 ) 
Sec. 39-13. - Termination and revocation of permit; review of decisions. 
(a)  Termination; grounds and procedure for revocation. Upon request of the chief of police, the city manager may, at any time, terminate any permit issued under this article, excluding permits issued solely to allow First Amendment protected sales, for reasons satisfactory to the city manager. In addition, the city manager may revoke any permit issued under this article and any special-event permit referred to in this article if: 
(1)  The city manager finds fraud, misrepresentation, or knowingly false statement with respect to a material fact in the permit application; 
(2)  The city manager finds that the permittee or the permittee's agent or employee violated this article or the terms of the permit; or 
(3)  The city manager finds that the permittee or the permittee's agent or employee conducted an activity for which the permit is required in such a manner as to create a public nuisance, cause of a breach of the peace, violate any applicable law, or interfere with the rights of abutting property owners. 
Without limiting the foregoing provisions of this section, the city manager may revoke a permit issued under this article upon finding that the public safety or the convenience of pedestrians is not served by the permit, and the city manager may revoke a permit issued under this article solely to allow First Amendment protected sales upon finding that the public safety is not served by the permit. 
Except in case of emergency, before making the decision to terminate or revoke, the city manager shall give reasonable notice to the permittee and an opportunity to be heard. A permit may be revoked pursuant to this section even if the person making the findings pursuant to this section (the city manager or chief of police, as applicable) had made a contrary finding before the permit was issued, regardless of whether the facts upon which the finding is made had changed. 
(b)  Notice. The city manager shall cause a written notice of the revocation to be served on the permittee by first-class mail to the address shown on the permit application or by any method allowed by law for service of a summons in a civil action, provided that the person delivering the notice may be any person who is 18 years or older, including the city manager. The notice shall set forth a brief statement of the grounds for revocation and of the right to appeal. 
(c)  Waiting period. The person whose permit is revoked for grounds stated in subsection (a)(1) or (a)(2), regardless of whether additional grounds existed, shall not be issued a permit under the same section of this article for the remainder of the time for which the revoked permit had been issued or 30 days after the date of the revocation, whichever time period is longer. The city manager shall use reasonable judgment in deciding whether two applicants are the same so that, for example, technical changes in the applicant, or where the applicant one year is the wife and the next year is the husband, may be disregarded. 
(d)  Review of decisions. If the chief of police or the city manager denies the issuance of a permit, revokes a permit, issues a permit with terms deemed unacceptable to the permittee, or makes any other decision pursuant to this article with respect to a permit, the applicant or permittee may have that decision reviewed by filing a written request in the office of the city manager within ten days of the date of the notice of decision. The city manager or a person designated by the city manager for this purpose who is neither the person who made the decision complained of nor that person's subordinate, shall be named as the hearing officer to conduct a hearing in order to review the decision. The city manager shall cause a written notice of the time and place of the hearing to be given or sent to the person seeking review. The permittee and the city manager may appear in person or through counsel and may present evidence, provided, however, that the hearing officer shall have the authority to conduct the hearing in the manner and for the period of time that he or she deems appropriate to make a decision. The hearing officer may affirm, deny, or modify the decision complained of, and the hearing officer's decision shall be final. Failure to request a review within the time and in the manner provided for in this subsection shall constitute a waiver of the right of review. The permit may be used during the review process only if the City Manager determines that its use would not constitute a substantial threat that the grounds described in subsection (a)(2) or (a)(3) will occur, re-occur or continue during the review process. 
( Ord. of 8-1-2016 ) 
ARTICLE IV. - OTHER PROVISIONS 

Sec. 39-14. - Penalties for violations. 
(a)  Assessment of civil penalties. The city manager shall access civil penalties for violation of this chapter, including the terms of a permit. The city manager shall give the offender written notice of the nature of the violation and the amount of the civil penalty. The notice shall be served by any method allowed by law for service of a summons in a civil action, provided that the person delivering the notice may be any person who is 18 years or older, including the city manager. The civil penalty shall be $200.00 per violation plus the costs incurred by the city resulting from the violation, including costs of removing litter. 
(b)  Review of assessment of civil penalties. Any person who has been assessed a civil penalty under this chapter may have that assessment reviewed by filing a written request in the office of the city manager within ten days of the date of service of the notice of the civil penalty. A person designated by the city manager for this purpose who is neither the person who assessed the civil penalty nor that person's subordinate shall be named the hearing officer to conduct a hearing in order to review the assessment. The city manager shall cause a written notice of the time and place of the haring to be given or sent to the person seeking review. The person assessed the penalty and the city manager may appear in person or through counsel and may present evidence, provided, however, that the hearing officer shall have the authority to conduct the hearing in the manner and for the period of time that she or she deems appropriate to make a decision. The hearing officer may affirm, deny, or modify the decision complained of, and the hearing officer's decision shall be final. Failure to request a review within the time and in the manner provided for in this subsection constitutes a waiver of the right of review. 
(c)  Collection of civil penalties. If the offender does not pay the civil penalty within ten days after having been served with the notice of the civil penalty, the city manager may collect the civil penalties by causing to be commenced civil actions in the nature of debt. The city manager may compromise such claims, before or after commencement of the civil action, if the city manager finds there is a reasonable probability that the city will be unable to collect the entire amount of the claim, that the amount offered in compromise of the claim reasonably reflects either the amount of money available from the offender or the amount the city is likely to recover in the civil action, taking into account the resources required to pursue the civil action, and that the facts and circumstances of the events giving rise to the claim, taken as a whole, indicate that the amount offered in compromise is fair and reasonable. Using the foregoing standards, in an appropriate case, the city manager may abandon a claim. 
(d)  Criminal remedies. Except for provisions, if any, of this chapter that regulate the operation or parking of motor vehicles, each violation of this chapter, including the terms of a permit, is a misdemeanor punishable by a maximum fine of $500.00. 
(e)  Reserved. 
(f)  Available remedies. This article and the provisions of permits issued under this article may be enforced by an appropriate equitable remedy, including abatement orders and mandatory or prohibitory injunctions, issuing from a court of competent jurisdiction. The general court of justice shall have jurisdiction to issue such orders as may be appropriate, and it shall not be a defense to the application of the city for equitable relief that there is an adequate remedy at law. As such, the city council intends that termination and revocation of a permit be considered to be remedies. 
( Ord. of 8-1-2016 ) 
Sec. 39-15. - Cumulative requirements. 
    No provisions of the City Code, except those explicitly repealed or explicitly amended by the ordinance adopting this chapter, are repealed by this chapter. If any provision of this chapter allows an activity to occur but another provision of the City Code regulates or prohibits it, the more restrictive provision applies. 
( Ord. of 8-1-2016 ) 
Sec. 39-16. - Reservation of rights in city; other ordinances and NC DOT not limited. 
(a)  To the extent directed by the city, any person allowed to do any activity by this chapter or by a permit issued under this chapter shall promptly cease the activity and remove all property that the city deems to interfere with the purposes for which the direction is given. The city reserves the right to require any activity allowed by this chapter or by a permit issued under this chapter to cease in whole or in part, for any purpose, including: 
(1)  To allow for construction, maintenance or repair of any street, sidewalk, utility, building, or facility; 
(2)  To allow for use of a public street, sidewalk, utility, building or facility in connection with parades, festivals, or other events; 
(3)  To remedy a nuisance; or 
(4)  To protect or promote the public health, safety or welfare. 
(b)  To the extent directed by the city, any person allowed to do any activity by this chapter or by a permit issued under this chapter shall promptly cease the activity and remove all property that the city deems to interfere with the purposes for which the direction is given. 
(c)  In case of emergency, danger to property, or detriment, danger, or hazard to public health, safety or welfare, the city manager may, orally or in writing, order a seller or salesperson to immediately move such distance as the city manager specifies, and to cease acts determined by the city manager to contribute to the emergency, danger, detriment, or hazard. Upon receiving such order, the seller or salesperson shall comply. When such an order is not complied with (including because the seller or salesperson is not readily found), the city manager may cause objects in violation of the order to be removed, disposed of, or both, and the cost of such actions shall be borne by the offender. This subsection shall not be construed to limit subsection 9a [other provisions of this chapter]. 
(d)  Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to limit any other ordinance, those imposing parking restrictions. Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to limit the authority of the N.C. Department of Transportation over rights-of-way under its jurisdiction. 
( Ord. of 8-1-2016 ) 
Sec. 39-17. - Severability. 
    In applying this chapter, if this chapter is invalid as to a particular portion of a street right-of-way, it shall still be valid as to the remaining street right-of-way. This section shall not be construed to limit any other ordinance.

February 4, 2008
ARTICLE 1
GENERAL PROVISIONS
1-1 SHORT TITLE
This Ordinance shall be known and may be cited as the City of Mebane Unified Development Ordinance, except as referred to herein, where it shall be known as this Ordinance.
1-2 REPEALS AND ENACTMENT
A. Repeal of Inconsistency
All ordinances, or portions thereof, of the City of Mebane that relate to zoning, subdivision, and land use which are inconsistent with the provisions of this Ordinance are hereby repealed to the extent of such inconsistency.
B. Enactment
This Ordinance is hereby enacted and shall be the Unified Development Ordinance for the City of Mebane.
C. Effective Date
This Ordinance shall become effective on February 4, 2008, as adopted by the City of Mebane City Council.
1-3 PURPOSE
A. General Purpose
It is the purpose of this Ordinance to promote the health, safety, and general welfare of the residents of the City of Mebane and the citys municipal extraterritorial planning jurisdiction (ETJ) to serve the public health, safety, and general welfare, and to provide the economic, social, and aesthetic advantages resulting from an orderly, planned use of land resources. This Ordinance shall govern the development and use of land and structures within the Mebane corporate limits and the citys ETJ.
In particular, this Ordinance is designed to address the following objectives:
1. Provide for the orderly growth and development of the area of the City of Mebane and the municipal extraterritorial planning jurisdiction;
2. Minimize land use conflicts and encourage the most appropriate use of land throughout the city;
3. Conserve the value of buildings and property;
4. Preserve the desirable features of the city's appearance and character;
5. Protect public investments and facilitate the adequate provision of schools, sewer, water, transportation, parks, open space, and other public requirements;
Mebane UDO, Article 1 1-2
February 4, 2008
6. Protect the natural environment and other valuable resources;
7. Promote the overall economic welfare of the city;
8. Protect designated public water supply watersheds from activities which could degrade water quality; and
9. Minimize public and private losses due to flooding by permitting only that development within the floodplain which is appropriate in light of the probability of flood damage and which represents a reasonable social and economic use of land in relation to the hazards involved.
B. Specific Purposes
More specific purposes concerning zoning, land subdivision, signs, landscaping and buffering, watershed protection, and flood damage prevention are delineated in the individual articles of this Ordinance that include provisions relating to these particular subjects.
1-4 JURISDICTION
This Ordinance shall govern the use and development of land within the City of Mebane and the Mebane extraterritorial jurisdiction. The City of Mebane zoning jurisdictional area comprises the area which is delineated on the official zoning map described in Section 3-2. The Citys planning jurisdictional area may be modified from time to time in accordance with Section 160A-360 of the North Carolina General Statutes (NCGS).
1-5 AUTHORITY
The provisions of this Ordinance are adopted under authority granted by the General Assembly to North Carolina cities (NCGS Chapter 160A, Article 19). This Ordinance may be amended from time to time as required or allowed by subsequent legislature enactments. This Ordinance shall in no way regulate, restrict, prohibit, or otherwise deter any bona fide farm and its related uses, except that commercial feeder/breeder operations and any use of property for nonfarm purposes shall be subject to the provisions of this Ordinance. Chapter 4 of the City of Mebane City Code regulates the keeping of animals within the corporate limits of the City of Mebane. Consequently, some animal operations may not be permissible within zoning districts that are located within the Mebane corporate limits.
1-6 ABROGATION
This Ordinance is not intended to repeal, abrogate, annul, impair or interfere with any existing easements, covenants, deed restrictions, agreements, rules, regulations, or permits previously adopted or issued pursuant to law.
1-7 COMPLIANCE
No building, premises, or structure shall be constructed, erected, modified, converted, occupied, placed, maintained or moved, and no land use shall be commenced, maintained, or modified, except as authorized by this Ordinance. Development which was approved prior to the effective date of this Ordinance
Mebane UDO, Article 1 1-3
February 4, 2008
and which does not comply with the provisions of this Ordinance shall be considered legally nonconforming. Modifications to and conversion of nonconforming uses shall be allowed pursuant to the requirements of Article 10, Nonconforming Situations. Nothing in this Section shall be deemed to preclude voluntary compliance with the provisions of this Ordinance for development approved prior to the effective date of this Ordinance.
1-8 RELATIONSHIP TO PLANNING POLICIES AND DOCUMENTS
It is the intention of the City Council that this Ordinance implement the planning policies adopted by the City Council for the City of Mebane planning jurisdiction, as reflected in land development plans, master plans, and other pertinent planning documents. In reviewing map or text amendments to this Ordinance, plan consistency statements are required for the Planning Board [Section 9-3, A] and the City Council [Section 9-4, A]. While the City Council reaffirms its commitment that this Ordinance and any amendment to it be in conformity with adopted planning policies, the City Council hereby expresses its intent that neither this Ordinance nor any amendment to it may be challenged on the basis of any alleged nonconformity with any planning document.
1-9 FEES
Reasonable fees sufficient to cover the costs of administration, inspection, publication of notice and similar matters may be charged to applicants for zoning permits, sign permits, conditional use permits, special use permits, certificates of appropriateness, subdivision plat approval, zoning amendments, variances and other administrative relief. The amount of the fees charged shall be set forth in the city's budget or as established by resolution of the City Council and filed in the offices of the City of Mebane Planning and Zoning Department. Fees established as outlined above shall be paid upon submission of a signed application.
1-10 SEVERABILITY
A. Invalidation
Should any Section, sentence, clause, phrase, or word of this Ordinance be held invalid or unconstitutional by a Court of competent jurisdiction of either the State of North Carolina or the United States, such decision shall not affect, impair, or invalidate the validity of the remaining parts of this Ordinance which can be given effect without the invalid provision.
B. Prejudicial Application
If any section, sentence, clause, phase, or word of this Ordinance be held invalid or unconstitutional in its application to a particular case, such decision shall not affect or prejudice its application to other cases.
C. Lawful Presumption
There shall be a conclusive presumption when a zoning administrator or board authorizes regulatory action, that such administrator or board would not have authorized such action except in the belief that such action was lawful.

Pursuant to the requirements of NCGS 160A-388 (e1), a member of the City Council shall not participate in or vote on a special use permit request or any other quasi-judicial matter in a manner that would violate an affected persons' constitutional rights to an impartial decision maker. Impermissible conflicts include, but are not limited to, a member having a fixed opinion prior to hearing the matter that is not susceptible to change; undisclosed ex parte communications; a close familial, business, or other associational relationship with an affected person; or a financial interest in the outcome of the matter. If an objection is raised to a member's participation and that member does not recuse himself or herself, the remaining members shall by majority vote rule on the objection.
2-2 Planning Board
The City of Mebane Planning Board is established pursuant to NCGS 1603A-361, to be known as the City of Mebane Planning Board and referred to herein as the Planning Board. As an appointed, advisory body, the Planning Board makes recommendations to the City Council as generally authorized by Chapter 160A, Article 19, of the North Carolina General Statutes.
A. Appointment and Terms of Planning Board Members
1. The City of Mebane Planning Board shall consist of nine members, six of whom shall be residents of the City of Mebane, appointed by the City Council, and three members shall be residents of the portion of the citys planning and zoning jurisdictional area which is located outside of the corporate limits of the City (two from Alamance County and one from Orange County). Reduction from the current numbers shall be accomplished as terms expire; no sitting member shall be removed prior to the end of his or her existing term.
2. Extraterritorial Planning Board members shall be appointed by the Board of County Commissioners from the applicable county. If a larger number of extraterritorial members is needed to comply with the proportional representation requirements of NCGS 160A-362, the City Council shall submit to the applicable Board of County Commissioners a resolution requesting that an additional member or members, as appropriate, be appointed. Proportional representation shall be determined by calculating the proportional relationship of the extraterritorial area population to the municipal population and applying that proportional relationship to the total membership of the Planning Board. An additional member must be appointed to the Planning Board to achieve proportional representation only when the population of the entire extraterritorial area constitutes a full fraction of the citys population divided by the
Mebane UDO, Article 2 2-3
Table of Contents
February 4, 2008; amended April 7, 2008, amended May 12, 2014

Once the City of Mebane provides proportional representation, no power available to it under NCGS 160A-360 shall be ineffective in its extraterritorial area solely because county appointments have not yet been made. If the Board of County Commissioners fails to make appointments within 90 days after receiving a resolution from the City Council requesting that they be made, the City Council may make the appointments.
3. Each member of the Planning Board shall be appointed for a term of four years. Vacancies occurring otherwise shall be for the remaining term and shall be made by the City Council. Members shall serve until they are duly replaced.
4. Any member of the Planning Board shall be removed for cause (including, but not limited to, neglect of duty, malfeasance, misconduct or failure to faithfully attend meetings) by the City Council upon written charge and after a public hearing.

C. Written Statements. The City Council or its agent shall also have the power to require written statements, certificates and certifications or the filing of reports under oath, with respect to pertinent questions relating to complaints or alleged violations of this Ordinance.

1. The requested permit is not within the authority of the Zoning Administrator according to Section 4-1-1, Table of Permitted Uses; or
2. The application is incomplete; or
3. If completed as proposed in the application, the development will not comply with one or more requirements of this Ordinance.

Mebane UDO, Article 2 2-15
Table of Contents
February 4, 2008; amended April 7, 2008, amended May 12, 2014
1. The requested permit is not in compliance with the requirements of Section 6-6, Signs; or
2. The application is incomplete.
2-16 Special Use Permits
A. Special Use Permit Submission. An application for a special use permit shall be submitted to the City Council or the Board of Adjustment by filing a copy of the application with the Zoning Administrator in the Planning and Zoning Department 20 working days prior to the Planning Board meeting at which the special use permit request will be reviewed. The appropriate permit-issuing authority (either the City Council or the Board of Adjustment) for special use permits is determined in Table 4-1-1, Table of Permitted Uses.
B. Special Use Permit Review and Approval. The review process for a special use permit request shall include:
1. Planning and Zoning Department and TRC review in accordance with Section 2-17;
2. Planning Board Review and recommendation to the City Council or Board of Adjustment;
3. Evidentiary hearing held by the City Council or Board of Adjustment in accordance with the provisions of Sections 2-18 through 2-20; and
4. Review and action by the City Council or Board of Adjustment.
2-17 Recommendations on Special Use Permits
A. When presented to the appropriate permit-issuing authority at the evidentiary hearing, the application for a special use permit shall be accompanied by a recommendation from the Planning Board and a report setting forth the Planning and Zoning Department's proposed findings concerning the application's compliance with Section 2-10 and the other requirements of this Ordinance, as well as any staff or TRC recommendations for additional requirements to be imposed by the appropriate permit-issuing authority.
B. If the Zoning Administrator proposes a finding or conclusion that the application fails to comply with Section 2-10 or any other requirement of this Ordinance, the Zoning Administrator shall identify the requirement in question and specifically state supporting reasons for the proposed findings or conclusions.
2-18 Evidentiary Hearing Requirements and Procedures for Special Use Permit Applications
A. No special use permit shall be approved until an evidentiary hearing has been held by the appropriate permit-issuing authority in accordance with the provisions of this Section. The purpose of the evidentiary hearing is to gather facts, not to solicit citizen opinion. Consequently, the hearing
Mebane UDO, Article 2 2-16
Table of Contents
February 4, 2008; amended April 7, 2008, amended May 12, 2014
procedures differ from those of the typical public hearing. In an evidentiary hearing, testimony may be provided only by sworn witnesses and written findings of fact are required (amended April 7, 2008)
B. The Zoning Administrator shall provide due notice to the parties involved in the special use permit request as well as to the owners of property adjacent to the property involved in the permit request. The Zoning Administrator shall mail written notice of the evidentiary hearing to the owners of all properties involved in the permit request as well as the owners of all properties adjacent to the property involved in the permit request.
C. The Zoning Administrator shall also publish a general public notice of the evidentiary hearing in a newspaper having general circulation in the area. If published, the notice shall be published not less than ten days before the date affixed for the hearing. In computing this period, the date of publication shall not be counted but the date of the hearing shall be. The newspaper notice shall:
1. State the date, time, and place of the hearing;
2. State the purpose of the hearing and summarize the procedures of an evidentiary hearing;
3. Summarize the nature and character of the permit request;
4. Reasonably identify the property affected by the permit request;
5. State that the full permit request application can be reviewed at the office of the Zoning Administrator; and
6. State that substantial changes in the permit request may be made following the hearing.
D. The Zoning Administrator shall also post notices of the evidentiary hearing on or in the vicinity of the property involved in the permit request and take any other action deemed by the Zoning Administrator to be useful or appropriate to give notice of the evidentiary hearing on any permit request.
E. The Zoning Administrator shall make every reasonable effort to comply with the notice provisions set forth in this Section. However, it is the permit-issuing authoritys intention that no failure to comply with any of the notice provisions [except those set forth in Section 2-18, B] shall render any permit request invalid.
F. At the conclusion of the evidentiary hearing, the permit-issuing authority may proceed to vote on the permit request or take any other action consistent with its usual rules of procedure (amended April 7, 2008). Section 2-19 delineates specific actions that the permit-issuing authority must take on requests for special use permits.
G The permit-issuing authority is not required to take final action on a special use permit request within any specific period of time, but it should proceed as expeditiously as practicable on permit requests since inordinate delays can result in the applicant incurring unnecessary costs.
Mebane UDO, Article 2 2-17
Table of Contents
February 4, 2008; amended April 7, 2008, amended May 12, 2014
H. Subject to subsection I below, the permit-issuing authority shall approve the requested special use permit unless it concludes, based upon the information submitted at the hearing, that:
1. The requested special use permit is not within its jurisdiction according to Section 4-1-1, Table of Permitted Uses; or
2. The application is incomplete; or
3. If completed as proposed in the application, the development will not comply with one or more requirements of this Ordinance.
I. Even if the permit-issuing authority finds that the application complies with all other provisions of this Ordinance, it may still deny the special use permit request if it concludes, based upon the information submitted at the hearing, that if completed as proposed, the development, more probably than not:
1. Will materially endanger the public health or safety; or
2. Will substantially injure the value of adjoining or abutting property; or
3. Will not be in harmony with the area in which it is to be located; or
4. Will not be in general conformity with the land use plan or other plans and policies officially adopted by the City Council.
J. (Reserved) [amended April 7, 2008]
2-19 Action on Special Use Permits
A. Following the evidentiary hearing, the permit-issuing authority may proceed to vote on the permit request or take any other action consistent with its usual rules of procedure (amended April 7, 2008). The City Council and Board of Adjustment, in considering special use permit applications, act in a quasi-judicial capacity and, accordingly, are required to observe quasi-judicial procedures except that no vote greater than a majority vote shall be required for the City Council to issue a special use permit (a 4/5 majority vote is required for the Board of Adjustment). For purposes of this Section, vacant positions on the permit-issuing authority and members who have been disqualified from voting on a quasi-judicial matter shall not be considered members of the board for calculation of the requisite majority.
B. In considering whether to approve an application for a special use permit, the permit-issuing authority shall proceed according to the following format:
1. The permit-issuing authority shall consider whether the application is complete. If the permit-issuing authority concludes that the application is incomplete and the applicant refuses to provide the necessary information, the application shall be denied. A motion to this effect shall specify either the particular type of information lacking or the particular requirement with respect to which the application is incomplete. A motion to this effect, concurred in by a simple majority
Mebane UDO, Article 2 2-18
Table of Contents
February 4, 2008; amended April 7, 2008, amended May 12, 2014
vote of the permit-issuing authority, shall constitute the permit-issuing authority's finding on this issue. If a motion to this effect is not made and concurred in by a simple majority vote, this shall be taken as an affirmative finding by the permit-issuing authority that the application is complete.
2. The permit-issuing authority shall consider whether the application complies with all of the applicable requirements of this Ordinance. If a motion to this effect passes by the necessary majority vote, the permit-issuing authority need not make further findings concerning such requirements.
If such a motion fails to receive the necessary majority vote or is not made, then a motion shall be made that the application be found not in compliance with one or more requirements of this Ordinance. Such a motion shall specify the particular requirements the application fails to meet. A separate vote may be taken with respect to each requirement not met by the application. If the permit-issuing authority concludes that the application fails to meet one or more of the requirements of this Ordinance, the application shall be denied.
3. If the permit-issuing authority concludes that all such requirements are met, it shall issue the permit unless it adopts a motion to deny the application for one or more of the reasons set forth in Section 2-18, H. Such a motion shall propose specific findings, based upon the evidence submitted, justifying such a conclusion.
4. Decisions by the permit-issuing authority on special use permit requests shall be filed in the offices of the Planning and Zoning Department. A copy of the permit-issuing authoritys decision shall be provided, by first class mail, to the applicant as well as to any parties that have requested a written copy of the permit-issuing authoritys decision.
5. Decisions of the City Council and Board of Adjustment regarding special use permit requests shall be subject to review by the Superior Court of the applicable County by proceedings in the nature of certiorari (see Section 11-7, Judicial Review).
C. Right to an Impartial Decision Maker. Pursuant to the requirements of NCGS 160A-388 (e1), a member of the City Council or Board of Adjustment shall not participate in or vote on any quasi-judicial matter in a manner that would violate affected persons' constitutional rights to an impartial decision maker. Impermissible conflicts include, but are not limited to, a member having a fixed opinion prior to hearing the matter that is not susceptible to change, undisclosed ex parte communications, a close familial, business, or other associational relationship with an affected person, or a financial interest in the outcome of the matter. If an objection is raised to a member's participation and that member does not recuse himself or herself, the remaining members shall by majority vote rule on the objection.
D. Recordation of Approved Special Use Permits Required. All approved special use permits shall be recorded in the applicable county registry and indexed under the record owners name as grantor. Nothing authorized by
Mebane UDO, Article 2 2-19
Table of Contents
February 4, 2008; amended April 7, 2008, amended May 12, 2014
the permit may be done until the record owner of the property provides documentation that indicates that the permit has been recorded.
2-20 Additional Requirements on Special Use Permits
A. Subject to subsection B below, in approving a special use request, the City Council or Board of Adjustment, may attach to the approval such reasonable requirements in addition to those specified in this Ordinance as will ensure that the development in its proposed location:
1. Will not endanger the public health or safety;
2. Will not injure the value of adjoining or abutting property;
3. Will be in harmony with the area in which it is located; and
4. Will be in conformity with the land development plan, thoroughfare plan, or other plan officially adopted by the City Council.
B. The permit-issuing authority may not attach additional conditions that modify or alter the specific requirements set forth in this Ordinance unless the development in question presents extraordinary circumstances that justify the variation from the specified requirements.
C. Without limiting the foregoing, the permit-issuing authority may attach to a special use approval a condition limiting the approval to a specified duration.
D. All additional conditions or requirements shall be specified in the letter of approval issued to the applicant by the Zoning Administrator.
E. All additional conditions or requirements authorized by this Section are enforceable in the same manner and to the same extent as any other applicable requirement of this Ordinance.
F. A vote may be taken on application conditions or requirements before consideration of whether the special use request should be denied for any of the reasons set forth in Sections 2-18, H or 2-18, I.
2-21 Authorizing Use or Occupancy before Completion of Development under Zoning and Special Use Permits
A. In cases when, because of weather conditions or other factors beyond the control of the zoning or special use permit recipient (exclusive of financial hardship) it would be unreasonable to require the permit recipient to comply with all of the requirements of this Ordinance before commencing the intended use of the property or occupying any buildings, the permit-issuing authority may authorize the commencement of the intended use or the occupancy of buildings (insofar as the requirements of this Ordinance are concerned) if the permit recipient provides an adequately secured performance bond or other security satisfactory to the permit-issuing authority to ensure that all of these requirements will be fulfilled within a reasonable period (not to exceed twelve months). The proposed performance bond and security shall be reviewed and approved by the city
Mebane UDO, Article 2 2-20
Table of Contents
February 4, 2008; amended April 7, 2008, amended May 12, 2014
attorney, however, prior to the permit-issuing authority authorizing the intended use or occupancy.
B. When the permit-issuing authority imposes additional requirements upon the special use permit recipient in accordance with Section 2-20 or when the developer proposes in the plans submitted to install amenities beyond those required by this Ordinance, the permit-issuing authority may authorize the permittee to commence the intended use of the property or to occupy any building before the additional requirements are fulfilled or the amenities installed if it specifies a date by which or a schedule according to which such requirements must be met or each amenity installed and if it concludes that compliance will be ensured as the result of any one or more of the following:
1. A performance bond and security satisfactory to the city attorney is furnished;
2. A condition is imposed establishing an automatic expiration date on the permit, thereby ensuring that the permit recipient's compliance will be reviewed when application for renewal is made; or
3. The nature of the requirements or amenities is such that sufficient assurance of compliance is given by Section 11-4, Penalties and Remedies for Violations, and Section 11-6, Permit Revocation.
2-22 Completing Development in Phases
A. If a development is constructed in phases or stages in accordance with this Section, then, subject to subsection C., the provisions of Section 2-13 and Section 2-21 shall apply to each phase as if it were the entire development.
B. As a prerequisite to taking advantage of the provisions of subsection A., the developer shall submit plans that clearly show the various phases or stages of the proposed development and the requirements of this Ordinance that will be satisfied with respect to each phase or stage.
C. If a development that is to be built in phases or stages includes improvements that are designed to relate to, benefit, or be used by the entire development (such as a swimming pool or tennis courts in a residential development) then, as part of his application for development approval, the developer shall submit a proposed schedule for completion of such improvements. The schedule shall relate completion of such improvements to completion of one or more phases or stages of the entire development. Once a schedule has been approved and made part of the permit by the permit-issuing authority, no land may be used, no buildings may be occupied except in accordance with the schedule approved as part of the permit, provided that:
1. If the improvement is one required by this Ordinance then the developer may utilize the provisions of Section 2-21, A; or
2. If the improvement is an amenity not required by this Ordinance or is provided in response to a condition imposed by the permit-issuing
Mebane UDO, Article 2 2-21
Table of Contents
February 4, 2008; amended April 7, 2008, amended May 12, 2014
authority, then the developer may utilize the provisions of Section 2-21, B.
2-23 Expiration of Approved Permits and Site Plans
A. Except as provided in subsection F., zoning, sign, and special use permits (including approved site or plot plans) shall expire automatically if, within six months after the issuance of such permits:
1. The use authorized by such permits has not commenced, in circumstances where no substantial construction, erection, alteration, excavation, demolition, or similar work is necessary before commencement of such use; or
2. Less than ten percent of the total cost of all construction, erection, alteration, excavation, demolition, or similar work on any development authorized by such permits has been completed on the site. With respect to phased development (see Section 2-22), this requirement shall apply only to the first phase.
B. If, after some physical alteration to land or structures begins to take place, such work is discontinued for a period of one year, then the zoning or special use permit authorizing such work shall immediately expire. However, expiration of the permit shall not affect the provisions of Section 2-24.
C. The permit-issuing authority (Zoning Administrator, City Council, or Board of Adjustment, as applicable) may extend for a period up to six months the date when a zoning, sign or special use permit would otherwise expire pursuant to subsections A or B above if it concludes that (i) the permit has not yet expired, (ii) the permit recipient has proceeded with due diligence and in good faith, and (iii) conditions have not changed so substantially as to warrant a new application. Successive extensions may be granted for periods up to six months upon the same findings. All such extensions may be granted without resort to the formal processes and fees required for a new permit.
D. For purposes of this Section, the permit within the jurisdiction of the City Council or the Board of Adjustment is issued when the applicable permit-issuing authority votes to approve the application and issue the permit. A zoning permit within the jurisdiction of the Zoning Administrator is issued when the earlier of the following takes place:
1. A copy of the fully executed permit is delivered to the permit recipient, and delivery is accomplished when the permit is delivered to the permit applicant; or
2. The Zoning Administrator notifies the permit applicant that the application has been approved and that all that remains before a fully executed permit can be delivered is for the applicant to take certain specified actions, such as having the permit executed by the property owner so it can be recorded, if required under Section 2-24, B.
Mebane UDO, Article 2 2-22
Table of Contents
February 4, 2008; amended April 7, 2008, amended May 12, 2014
E. Notwithstanding any of the provisions of Article 10, Nonconformities, this Section shall be applicable to permits issued prior to the date this Ordinance becomes effective.
F. Special use permits with a vested right established in accordance with Section 2-28, Zoning Vested Rights, shall expire at the end of the two-year vesting period established pursuant to Section 2-28.
2-24 Effect of Permit on Successors and Assigns
A. Zoning, sign and special use permits authorize the permittee to make use of land and structures in a particular way. Such permits are transferable. However, so long as the land or structures or any portion thereof covered under a permit continues to be used for the purposes for which the permit was granted, then:
1. No person (including successors or assigns of the person who obtained the permit) may make use of the land or structures covered under such permit for the purposes authorized in the permit except in accordance with all the terms and requirements of that permit; and
2. The terms and requirements of the permit apply to and restrict the use of land or structures covered under the permit, not only with respect to all persons having any interest in the property at the time the permit was obtained, but also with respect to persons who subsequently obtain any interest in all or part of the covered property and wish to use it for or in connection with purposes other than those for which the permit was originally issued.
2-25 Amendments to and Modifications of Permits and Plans
A. Insignificant deviations from the permit (including approved site plans) approved by the City Council, Board of Adjustment, or the Zoning Administrator are permissible and the Zoning Administrator may authorize such insignificant deviations. A deviation is insignificant if it has no discernible impact on neighboring properties, the general public, or those intended to occupy or use the proposed development.
B. Minor design modifications or changes in permits (including approved site plans) are permissible with the approval of the permit-issuing authority. Such permission may be obtained without a formal application, evidentiary hearing, or payment of any additional fee. For purposes of this Section, minor design modifications or changes are those that have no substantial impact on neighboring properties, the general public, or those intended to occupy or use the proposed development.
C. All other requests for changes in approved site plans will be processed as a modification to the original application. If such requests are to be acted upon by the City Council or Board of Adjustment, new conditions may be imposed only on the specific site or area requested to be modified in accordance with Section 2-20, but the applicant retains the right to reject such additional conditions by withdrawing his request for an amendment and may then proceed in accordance with the previously issued permit.
Mebane UDO, Article 2 2-23
Table of Contents
February 4, 2008; amended April 7, 2008, amended May 12, 2014
D. The Zoning Administrator shall determine whether amendments to and modifications of permits fall within the categories set forth above in subsections A through C.
E. A property owner requesting approval of changes shall submit a written request for such approval to the Zoning Administrator, which request shall identify the changes. Approval of all changes must be provided to the property owner in writing.
F. A vested right established in accordance with Section 2-28 shall not be extended by any amendments or modifications to an approved site specific development plan unless expressly provided for by the City Council.
2-26 Reconsideration of Action on Special Use Permits
A. Whenever the City Council or Board of Adjustment disapproves a special use permit application, on any basis other than the failure of the applicant to submit a complete application, such action may not be reconsidered by the permit-issuing authority at a later time unless the applicant clearly demonstrates that:
1. Circumstances affecting the property that is the subject of the application have substantially changed; or
2. New information is available that could not with reasonable diligence have been presented at a previous hearing. A request to be heard on this basis must be filed with the Zoning Administrator within the time period for an appeal to superior court (see Section 11-7, B). However, such a request does not extend the 30-day period within which an appeal must be taken.
B. The permit-issuing authority may, however, at any time consider a new application affecting the same property as an application previously denied. A new application is one that differs in some substantial way from the one previously considered.
C. The permit-issuing authority shall, by a majority vote, make the determination as to whether or not an amended application meets the criteria delineated in subsection A for a rehearing or qualifies as a new application pursuant to subsection B.
2-27 Maintenance of Common Areas, Improvements, and Facilities.
The recipient or the recipients successor of any zoning or special use, shall be responsible for maintaining all common areas, improvements or facilities required by this Ordinance or any permit issued in accordance with its provisions, except those areas, improvements or facilities with respect to which an offer of dedication to the public has been accepted by the appropriate public authority. As illustrations, and without limiting the generality of the foregoing, this means that private streets and parking areas, water and sewer lines, stormwater facilities, common open space, and recreational facilities must be properly maintained so that they can be used in the manner intended, and that required vegetation and trees used for screening, landscaping, or shading must be replaced if they die or are destroyed.

2-28 Zoning Vested Rights
A. A vested right shall be established, upon petition by the owner of the property, after the approval or conditional approval of a site specific development plan by the City Council in accordance with the provisions outlined in this Section. A right which has been vested as provided for in this Section shall, as a general rule, remain valid for two years and shall attach to and run with the land.
B. Unless otherwise specifically provided, or unless clearly required by the context, the words and phrases defined in this Section shall have the meaning indicated when used in this Section.
1. Landowner. Any owner of a legal or equitable interest in real property, including the heirs, devisees, successors, assigns, and personal representative of such owner. The landowner may allow a person holding a valid option to purchase to act as his agent or representative for purposes of submitting a proposed site specific development plan.
2. Property. All real property subject to the regulations and restrictions of this Ordinance as well as the zoning district boundaries established by this Ordinance and depicted on the official zoning map.
3. Site specific development plan. A plan which has been submitted to the City of Mebane by a landowner describing in detail the type and intensity of use for a specific parcel or parcels of property. Such plan shall be in the form of a site plan required to obtain a special use permit. The information required by Section 2-10 and Appendix A, as applicable, shall be included. All site specific development plans shall be approved by the City Council.
4. Vested right. The right to undertake and complete the development and use of property under the terms and conditions of an approved site specific development plan.
C. A vested right shall be deemed established, following the receipt of a petition from the property owner, upon the effective date of approval by the City Council of a site specific development plan. Following the approval of a site specific development plan, the Zoning Administrator shall issue a vested right certificate to the landowner which indicates the duration of the vesting period, the conditions, if any, imposed on the approval of the site specific development plan, and any other information determined by the Zoning Administrator to be necessary to administer the vested right.
D. A vested right shall confer upon the landowner the right to undertake and complete the development and use of the property as delineated in the approved site specific development plan. The City Council may approve a site specific development plan upon such terms and conditions, as may be determined necessary to protect the public health, safety, and welfare. Failure to comply with the approved terms and conditions shall result in a forfeiture of vested rights.
Mebane UDO, Article 2 2-25
Table of Contents
February 4, 2008; amended April 7, 2008, amended May 12, 2014
E. Approval by the City Council of a site specific development plan shall follow the procedural requirements for the issuance of a special use permit as outlined in Sections 2-18 and 2-19. Changes in or modifications to an approved site specific development plan shall be made only with the concurrence of the City Council in accordance with the provisions of Section 2-25.
F. A vested right obtained under this section runs with the land and is valid for two years from the effective date of approval by the City Council of a site specific development plan. A vested right shall not be extended by any amendments or modifications to an approved site-specific development plan unless expressly provided for by the City Council. A vested right shall expire at the end of two years if no building permit applications have been filed with the City of Mebane to construct the use or uses proposed in the approved site specific development plan. If building permits are issued, the provisions of NCGS 160A-418 and NCGS 160A-422 shall apply, except that a building permit shall not expire or be revoked because of the lack of progress during the two-year vesting period.
G. A vested right, once established or provided for in this section, precludes any zoning action by the City of Mebane which would change, alter, impair, prevent, diminish, or otherwise delay the development or use of the property as set forth in the approved site specific development plan, except:
1. With the written consent of the affected landowner;
2. Upon findings, by ordinance after notice and a public hearing, that natural or man-made hazards in the immediate vicinity of the property, if uncorrected, would pose a serious threat to the public health, safety, and welfare if the project were to proceed as contemplated in the site specific development plan;
3. To the extent that the affected landowner receives compensation for all costs, expenses, and other losses incurred by the landowner, including, but not limited to, all fees paid in consideration of financing, and all architectural, planning, marketing, legal, and other consultant's fees incurred after approval by the city, together with interest thereon at the legal rate until paid. Compensation shall not include any diminution in the value of the property, which is caused by such action;
4. Upon findings, by ordinance after notice and a public hearing, that the landowner or his representative intentionally supplied inaccurate information or made material misrepresentations which made a difference in the approval by the city of the site specific development plan; or
5. Upon the enactment or promulgation of a state or federal law or regulation which precludes development as contemplated in the site specific development plan, in which case the city may modify the affected provisions, upon a finding that the change in state or federal law has a fundamental effect on the plan, by ordinance after notice and a public hearing.
Mebane UDO, Article 2 2-26
Table of Contents
February 4, 2008; amended April 7, 2008, amended May 12, 2014
H. The establishment of a vested right shall not preclude the application of overlay zoning which imposes additional requirements but does not affect the allowable type or intensity of use, or ordinances or regulations which are general in nature and are applicable to all property subject to land use regulation by the city, including, but not limited to, building, fire, plumbing, electrical, and mechanical codes.
I. Notwithstanding any provisions of this Section, the establishment of a vested right shall not preclude, change, or impair the authority of the City to enforce provisions of this Ordinance governing nonconforming situations or uses.
J. A vested right obtained under this section is not a personal right, but shall attach to and run with the applicable property. After approval of a site specific development plan, all successors to the original landowner shall be entitled to exercise such vested rights.
K. The city shall not require a landowner to waive his or her vested rights as a condition of developmental approval.
2-29 Certificate of Zoning Compliance
A. Except as otherwise specifically exempted elsewhere in this Ordinance, no building shall be occupied, no land shall be used, and the use of any land shall not be changed until a certificate of zoning compliance has been issued by the Zoning Administrator.
B. The certificate of zoning compliance shall state that the building and/or proposed use of land complies with the provisions of this Ordinance.
C. The certificate of zoning compliance shall be presented by the applicant to the City of Mebane Building Inspector prior to the citys issuance of a certificate of occupancy.
D. A temporary certificate of zoning compliance may be issued by the Zoning Administrator, for a period not to exceed six months, during alteration or construction for partial occupancy of a building pending completion. Such temporary certificate shall bear the dates of issuance and expiration on the certificate, shall be clearly marked, Temporary, and shall stipulate such conditions and safeguards as will protect the safety of the occupants and the public.
2-30 Compliance with Overlay District Provisions, Environmental Regulations, and Development Standards
Additional requirements that are applicable to properties within overlay zoning districts and requirements for stormwater management, soil erosion and sedimentation control, watershed protection, flood damage prevention, and coordination with the Army Corps of Engineers regarding wetlands are delineated in Article 5. Use-specific standards that are applicable to those uses designated in Table 4-1-1, Table of Permitted Uses as D or S are provided in Article 4.

See Section 11-6, Permit Revocation.
2-32 Development Agreements
To better structure and manage development approvals for large-scale, multiple-phase developments and to ensure their proper integration into local capital facilities programs, the City Council may enter into development agreements with developers, subject to the procedures and requirements of Chapter 160A, Article 19, Part 3D.

3-1 Establishment of Zoning Districts
In order to achieve the purposes of this Ordinance as set forth, all property within the jurisdiction of the City of Mebane is divided into zoning districts with the designations and purposes listed in Section 3-1, subsections A through C. The minimum lot size specified for each residential zoning district in the descriptions below is the general requirement. The specific minimum lot sizes and dimensional requirements for each zoning district are provided in Article 4, Table 4-2-1, Table of Density and Dimensional Requirements. See also Article 5, Section 5-2 for additional density and built-upon requirements for properties located within a watershed protection overlay district.
A. General Use Zoning Districts
1. RA-20 Residential Agricultural District. The RA-20 Residential Agricultural District designates properties used for mixed agricultural and residential purposes and some mixed compatible business uses such as day care. This district is generally in the city's extra territorial zoning area. Rezonings within this district should be accomplished with the intent of seeking compatibility with nearby uses within the city. Water and/or sewer may or may not be available in this district. In areas where there is no public water/and or sewer, lot size is determined by the applicable County Health Department. The overall gross density is typically 2.17 units per acre or less.
2. R-20 Residential District. The R-20 Residential District is established for low-density residential and agricultural purposes with some limited public, semi-public and recreational uses permitted when they are compatible with low density residential development. Water and/or sewer may or may not be available in this district. In areas where there is no public water and/or sewer, lot size is determined by the applicable County Health Department. The overall gross density is typically 2.17 units per acre or less.
3. R-15 Residential District. The R-15 Residential District is established for moderate density residential uses in areas with public water and sewer with some limited agricultural, public, semi-public, and recreational activities that are compatible with residential development. The overall gross density is typically 2.9 units per acre or less.
4. R-12 Residential District. The R-12 Residential District is established for moderate density residential uses with some limited agricultural, public, semi-public, and recreational activities that are compatible with residential development. The overall gross density is typically 3.63 units per acre or less.
Mebane UDO, Article 3 3-2
Table of Contents
February 4, 2008; amended November 25, 2008; November 5, 2018
5. R-10 Residential District. The R-10 Residential District is established for moderate to high residential use; limited public, semi-public and commercial uses permitted when they are compatible with residential development. The overall gross density is typically 4.35 units per acre or less.
6. R-8 Residential District. The R-8 Residential District is established for moderate to high density two-family and multi-family residences with limited public, semi-public, and commercial uses, permitted when they are compatible with high density residential development. The overall gross density is typically 5.44 units per acre or less for single family residences and approximately 10 units per acre for multi-family residences.
7. R-6 Residential District. The R-6 Residential District is established for high density two-family and multi-family residences with limited public, semi-public, and commercial uses, permitted when they are compatible with high density residential development. The overall gross density is typically 7.26 units per acre or less for single family residences and approximately 14 units per acre for multi-family residences and is intended to make efficient use of available land.
8. O&I Office and Institutional District. The Office and Institutional District is established to provide for business and professional office use, service occupations and light commercial uses. Because the Office and Institutional uses are subject to the public view, developers and operators of offices and business shall provide an appropriate appearance, ample parking and design of entrances, and exists to offices and businesses in a manner to minimize the traffic congestion. Residential densities range from 5.44 units per acre for single family residences to 8.71 units per acre for multi-family residences.
9. B-1 Central Business District. The B-1 Central Business District is established as the centrally located trade and commercial service area to provide for retailing goods and services to the passing motorists and residents living in the area. Because the business uses are subject to the pubic view, developers and operators of businesses should provide an appropriate appearance, ample parking, and design of entrances and exists to businesses in a manner to minimize traffic congestion. The regulations of this district are designed to permit a concentrated development of permitted uses while maintaining a substantial relationship between the intensity of land uses and the capacity of utilities and streets.
10. B-2 General Business District. The B-2 General Business District is established to provide for a compact neighborhood shopping district which provides convenience goods such as groceries and drugs and some types of personal services to the surrounding residential area. They are generally located on major thoroughfares and collector streets in the Mebane Planning area. The regulations are designed to protect the surrounding residential districts and provide an appropriate community appearance. Ample parking and design of entrances and exists to businesses must be established in a manner to minimize traffic congestion.
Mebane UDO, Article 3 3-3
Table of Contents
February 4, 2008; amended November 25, 2008; November 5, 2018
11. B-3 Neighborhood Business District. The B-3 Neighborhood Business District is established as a district in which the principal use of land is for the retailing of goods and services to the adjacent residential neighborhoods. The regulations of this district are indented to provide for smaller scale retail trades and services in designated shopping areas, with standards designed to protect abutting residential areas.
12. M-1 Heavy Manufacturing District. The M-1 Heavy Manufacturing District is established for those areas of the community where the principle use of land is for manufacturing, industrial, and warehousing uses. These uses, by their nature, may create some nuisances which are not properly associated with residential, institutional, commercial and/or service establishments. These uses normally seek outlying locations on large tracts of land where the operations involved do no detract from the development potential of nearby undeveloped properties.
13. M-2 Light Manufacturing District. The M-2 Light Manufacturing District is established for industry assembly, fabrication and warehousing located on planned sites with access to major highways and streets and with adequate utility facilities. This district is intended to allow a lower density of manufacturing and warehousing operations which create a more desirable appearance and less environmental pollution than a more dense manufacturing zone. These uses by their nature may create some nuisance which is not properly associated with residential institutional, commercial, and/or service establishments. These uses normally seek outlying locations on large tracts of land where the operations involved do not detract form the development potential of nearby development property. The purpose of these regulations is to control building and traffic congestion and to provide an appropriate community appearance.
B. Conditional Zoning Districts
1. In addition to the general use zoning districts established in Section 3-1, A, a corresponding conditional zoning district, bearing the designation CD, may be established in accordance with the provisions of Section 9-7. Accordingly, the following conditional zoning districts may be designated upon approval by the City Council of a petition by the property owners to establish a conditional zoning district:
(a) RA-20(CD) Residential Agricultural Conditional Zoning District
(b) R-20(CD) Residential Conditional Zoning District
(c) R-15(CD) Residential Conditional Zoning District
(d) R-12(CD) Residential Conditional Zoning District
(e) R-10(CD) Residential Conditional Zoning District

(k) B-3(CD) Neighborhood Business Conditional Zoning District
(l) M-1(CD) Heavy Manufacturing Conditional Zoning District
(m) M-2(CD) Light Manufacturing Conditional Zoning District
2. The development and use of property within a conditional zoning district is subject to the rules, regulations, and conditions imposed as part of the legislative decision creating the district. All descriptions and definitions which apply to a general use zoning district also apply to the corresponding conditional zoning district, and modification of specific general use zoning district provisions may be permitted through the legislative decisions of City Council. Conditional zones are not intended to avoid site conditions that are appropriately addressed by a variance. All other rules, regulations, and conditions which may be offered by the property owner and approved by the City Council as part of the rezoning process shall also apply. Property may be placed in a conditional zoning district only in response to a petition by the owners of all of the property proposed to be included in the conditional zoning district. Requirements for conditional zoning districts are delineated in Section 9-7.
(Amended November 5, 2018)
C. Overlay Zoning Districts
1. Overlay districts establish certain regulations that are in addition to those of the underlying general use or conditional zoning districts. Property within a designated overlay district may be used in a manner permitted in the underlying general use or conditional zoning districts only if and to the extent such use is also permitted in the applicable overlay district.
2. The following overlay districts are established:
(a) MH Manufactured Housing Overlay District. The MH Manufactured Housing Overlay District is established to provide regulations governing the development of manufactured housing on individual lots in certain areas of the city. These regulations are specified in Article 5, Section 5-1.

3. A blank space in the table indicates that a particular use is not permitted. Should there be a discrepancy between the Table of Permitted Uses and any other section of this Ordinance as to a use being permissible, the Table of Permitted Uses shall prevail.
4. Exempt uses are indicated by an E in Table 4-1-1.
B. Formulation of Permitted Use Table
1. The Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) Manual - 1987 was utilized in the preparation of this table and shall be referred to as a guide for purposes of interpretation by the Zoning Administrator. SIC codes are used to refer to SIC Classifications. Entries with 0000 in the Reference SIC column do not correspond to any classification in the SIC Manual.

2. When a use is not listed in the Permitted Use Table, the Zoning Administrator shall classify it with that use in the table most similar to it. The SIC Manual shall serve as a guide in classifying any unlisted use. If the Zoning Administrator should determine that a use is not listed and is not similar to a use in the Permitted Use Table, then said use is prohibited.
3. Rental and leasing of any commodity shall be permitted under the same classification and in the same districts, as are sales of that commodity, unless rental or leasing of that commodity is listed separately in the Permitted Use Table.
C. Permissible Uses Not Requiring Permits
Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Ordinance, neither a zoning nor a special use permit is necessary for the following uses:
1. Streets.
2. Electric power, telephone, telegraph, cable television, gas, water, and sewer lines, wires or pipes, together with supporting poles or structures, located within a public right of way.
3. Any accessory building with a building dimension of 12 feet or less.
4. Farm buildings except for buildings on a bona fide farm used for nonfarm purposes and buildings used for feeder/breeder operations.
D. Change in Use
1. A substantial change in use of property occurs whenever the essential character or nature of the activity conducted on a lot changes. This occurs whenever:
(a) The change involves a change from one principal use category to another.
(b) If the original use is a combination use, the relative proportion of space devoted to the individual principal uses that comprise the combination use changes to such an extent that the parking requirements for the overall use are altered.
(c) If the original use is a combination use, the mixture of types of individual principal uses that comprise the combination use changes.
(d) If there is only one business or enterprise conducted on the lot (regardless of whether that business or enterprise consists of one individual principal use or a combination use), that
Mebane UDO, Article 4 4-12
February 4, 2008; amended November 25, 2008; October 6, 2014; January 12, 2015; June 5, 2017; October 1, 2018;
November 5, 2018
business or enterprise moves out and a different type of enterprise moves in (even though the new business or enterprise may be classified under the same principal use or combination use category as the previous type of business). For example, if there is only one building on a lot and a florist shop that is the sole tenant of that building moves out and is replaced by a clothing store, that constitutes a change in use. However, if the florist shop were replaced by another florist shop, that would not constitute a change in use since the type of business or enterprise would not have changed. Moreover, if the florist shop moved out of a rented space in a shopping center and was replaced by a clothing store, that would not constitute a change in use since there is more than one business on the lot and the essential character of the activity conducted on that lot (shopping center-combination use) has not changed.
2. A mere change in the status of property from unoccupied to occupied or vice-versa does not constitute a change in use. Whether a change in use occurs shall be determined by comparing the two active uses of the property without regard to any intervening period during which the property may have been unoccupied, unless the property has remained unoccupied for more than 180 consecutive days or has been abandoned.
3. A mere change in ownership of a business or enterprise or a change in the name shall not be regarded as a change in use.
E. Combination Uses
1. When a combination use comprises two or more principal uses that require different types of permits (zoning or special use), then the permit authorizing the combination use shall be:
(a) A special use permit if any of the principal uses combined requires a special use permit.
(b) A zoning permit in all other cases.
F. Mixed Uses
Two or more permitted uses may occupy the same principal building.
G. Accessory Uses
1. Whenever an activity is conducted in conjunction with another principal use and the former use (i) constitutes only an incidental or insubstantial part of the total activity that takes place on a lot, or (ii) is customarily associated with the principal use and integrally related to it, then the former use may be regarded as accessory to the
Mebane UDO, Article 4 4-13
February 4, 2008; amended November 25, 2008; October 6, 2014; January 12, 2015; June 5, 2017; October 1, 2018;
November 5, 2018
principal use and may be carried on underneath the umbrella of the permit issued for the principal use.
2. For purposes of interpreting subsection 1 above:
(a) A use may be regarded as incidental or insubstantial if it is incidental or insubstantial in and of itself or in relation to the principal use;
(b) To be customarily associated with a principal use it is not necessary for an accessory use to be connected with such principal use more times than not, but only that the association of such accessory use with such principal use takes place with sufficient frequency that there is common acceptance of their relatedness.
3. Without limiting the generality of subsections 1 and 2 above, the following activities are specifically regarded as accessory to residential principal uses so long as they satisfy the general criteria set forth above:
(a) Offices or studios within an enclosed building and used by an occupant of a residence located on the same lot as such building to carry on administrative or artistic activities of a commercial nature, so long as such activities do not fall within the definition of a home occupation.
(b) Hobbies or recreational activities of a non-commercial nature.
4. Table 4-1-1, Table of Permitted Uses outlines the zoning districts in which specific accessory uses are allowed. See also Section 4-2 B for dimensional standards for accessory structures.
5. Application of cosmetic tattoos, also known as permanent makeup, dermagraphics, or micropigmentation shall be permitted as an accessory use within an otherwise lawful beauty shop, spa, or salon located in an O&I or Business zone provided such use constitutes less than fifty per cent (50%) of the total revenues of such establishment. (Amended July 11, 2011)
H Temporary Uses
Temporary uses are established for a limited duration with the intent to discontinue such use upon the expiration of the time period. Table 4-1-1, Table of Permitted Uses outlines the zoning districts in which temporary uses are allowed. See also Sections 4-7.13, A-J for specific standards and requirements for certain temporary uses.
I. Prohibited Uses
Mebane UDO, Article 4 4-14

November 5, 2018
Within certain overlay districts some uses are specifically prohibited. The following uses are prohibited in the overlay districts listed.
1. WCA Watershed Critical Area Overlay District: The following uses are prohibited:

(b) Any use that would cause any increase in base flood levels.
4. Open Storage in Business and Manufacturing Zoning Districts: In the B-1, B-2, B-3, and M-2 zoning districts, open storage is not permitted. In M-1 zoning districts, outdoor storage is permitted for uses such as building materials sales, plumbing and heating supply houses, contractor offices and storage yards, industrial supplies and equipment sales. However, all outdoor storage must be enclosed by a solid fence at least six feet in height and landscaped in accordance with the provisions of Section 6-3.
4-2 Density and Dimensional Requirements
A. Table of Density and Dimensional Requirements
The density and dimensional requirements for all general zoning districts are found in Table 4-2-1, Table of Density and Dimensional Requirements. No lot created after the effective date of this Ordinance that is less than the lot width required in Table 4-2-1 shall be entitled to a variance from any building setback requirement.

OVERLAY, ENVIRONMENTAL, AND SPECIAL PURPOSE REGULATIONS
5-1 Manufactured Housing Overlay District Requirements
A. Purpose and Intent
The Manufactured Housing Overlay District is intended to provide for alternative housing opportunities by allowing the placement of manufactured homes on individual lots within specific defined areas which overlay the R-10, Residential general zoning districts. Such overlay districts are designated R-10MH on the official zoning map. The Manufactured Housing Overlay District is established pursuant to Article 19, Section 160A-383.1 (e) of the North Carolina General Statutes and this Ordinance.
B. Minimum Criteria for Manufactured Dwellings on Single Family Lots
1. Class A manufactured dwellings may be permitted on single family lots in the R-10 residential zoning district provided overlay district zoning is approved by the City Council in accordance with the provisions of Ordinance. All requirements of this Ordinance applicable in the R-10 zoning district shall apply. In addition each manufactured dwelling shall be:
(a) Occupied only as a single family dwelling;
(b) Have a minimum width of 16 feet;
(c) Have a length not exceeding four times its width, with length measured along the longest axis and width measured perpendicular to the longest axis at the narrowest part (towing apparatus, wheels, and transporting lights are not included in length and width measurements);
(d) Have a minimum of 1,000 square feet of enclosed and heated space;
(e) Have the towing apparatus, wheels, axis and transporting lights removed;
(f) Have the longest axis oriented parallel or within a ten degree deflection of being parallel to the lot frontage, unless other orientation is permitted as a variance approved by the Board of Adjustment following a public hearing;
(g) Set up in accordance with the standards established by the NC Department of Insurance. In addition, a continuous, permanent masonry foundation or masonry curtain wall constructed in accordance with the standards of the NC Building Code for One-and Two-Family Dwellings, unpierced except for required ventilation and access, shall be installed under the perimeter;
Mebane UDO, Article 5 5-2
February 4, 2008; amended April 7, 2008; amended 07/11/16; amended November 6, 2017
(h) Have exterior siding comparable in composition, appearance, and durability to the exterior siding commonly used in standard residential construction, consisting of one or more of the following:
(1) Vinyl or aluminum lap siding (whose reflectivity does not exceed that of flat white paint);
(2) Cedar or other wood siding;
(3) Wood grain, weather-resistant press board siding;
(4) Stucco siding; or
(5) Brick or stone siding.
(i) Have a roof pitch minimum vertical rise of three feet for each twelve feet of horizontal run;
(j) Have the roof finished with a Class C or better roofing material that is commonly used in standard residential construction;
(k) Have an eave projection for all roof structures of no less than six inches, which may include a gutter;

Wood stairs shall only be used in conjunction with a porch or entrance platform with a minimum of 24 square feet; and
(m) Be connected to the municipal water and sewer system.
C. Minimum Development Size
1. Ten existing contiguous lots in single-ownership covering at least 90,000 square feet, excluding public street right-of-way; or
2. 120,000 square feet of land, excluding public street right-of-way.
5-2 Watershed Overlay District Regulations
A. Purpose and Intent
The watershed protection overlay districts, as described in Section 3-1, C, 2, (b) and (c) are designed to protect designated public water supply watershed from activities which could degrade water quality. The following separate watershed protection overlay districts have been established:
1. WCA, Watershed Critical Area Overlay District and
2. GWA, General Watershed Area Overlay District.
Mebane UDO, Article 5 5-3
February 4, 2008; amended April 7, 2008; amended 07/11/16; amended November 6, 2017
Both of these watershed overlay districts are within a public water supply watershed that has been classified by the State of North Carolina as a WS-II watershed. The WCA Overlay District represents the Graham-Mebane Lake Public Water Supply Watershed WS-II Critical Area and the GWA Overlay District represents the Graham-Mebane Lake Public Water Supply Watershed WS-II Balance of Watershed Area as designated by the NC Environmental Management Commission. The purpose of this Section is to implement the provisions of the Water Supply Watershed Protection Act (NCGS 143-214.5) which requires the City of Mebane to adopt minimum land use regulations, consistent with the WS-II Critical Area and Balance of Watershed management rules as adopted by the North Carolina Environmental Management Commission, to protect the water quality of the Graham-Mebane Lake Watershed located within the citys planning and zoning jurisdictional area.
B. General Provisions Applicable to Both Watershed Overlay Districts
1. The construction of new roads and bridges and non-residential development should minimize built-upon area, divert stormwater away from surface water supply waters as much as possible, and employ best management practices (BMPs) to minimize water quality impacts. To the extent practicable, construction of new roads in the critical area should be avoided. The Department of Transportation BMPs as outlined in their document entitled Best Management Practices for the Protection of Surface Waters shall be used in all road and bridge construction projects in the Watershed Overlay Districts.
2. All development activities within Watershed Overlay Districts, in addition to those activities specifically regulated by these provisions, are subject to the standards, usage conditions and other regulations contained in the Rules and Requirements of the Surface Water Supply Protection Rules adopted by the North Carolina Environmental Management Commission.
3. A minimum 30-foot vegetative buffer for development activities is required along all perennial waters, including streams, rivers and impoundments, indicated on the most recent versions of the United States Geodetic Survey (USGS) 1:24,000 scale topographic maps; provided, that a 50-foot buffer shall be required along Graham-Mebane Lake. Nothing in this subsection shall prevent artificial streambank or shoreline stabilization. No new development is allowed in the buffer, except that water-dependent structures and public works projects such as road crossings and greenways, may be allowed where no practicable alternative exists. These activities shall minimize built-upon surface area, direct runoff away from the surface water, and maximize the utilization of BMPs. The Citys Riparian Buffer Protection Ordinance shall have precedence over all other stream or riparian buffer regulations within the City of Mebanes jurisdiction.
4. Existing development, as defined in this Ordinance, is not subject to the requirements of the overlay provisions. Expansions to
Mebane UDO, Article 5 5-4
February 4, 2008; amended April 7, 2008; amended 07/11/16; amended November 6, 2017
structures, other than single-family, classified as existing development must meet the requirements of these provisions, provided however, the built-upon area of the existing development is not required to be included in the density calculations. In determining expansions to existing development, the maximum permitted additional built-upon area is derived by multiplying the area of the portion of the property that is not built-upon by the appropriate percent built-upon limitation for the Overlay District in which the property is located.
5. A pre-existing lot created prior to the effective date of this Ordinance, regardless of whether or not a vested right has been established, may be developed or redeveloped for single-family residential purposes without being subject to the restrictions of these overlay provisions.
6. Any existing building or built-upon area not in conformance with the limitations of these provisions that has been damaged or removed for any reason may be repaired and/or reconstructed, provided:
(a) Repair or reconstruction is initiated within 12 months and completed within 2 years of such damage or removal.
(b) The total amount of space devoted to built-upon area may not be increased.
(c) The repair or reconstruction is otherwise permitted under the provisions of this Ordinance.
7. Clustering of development if permitted by the underlying use district is allowed on a project by project basis as follows: overall density of the project meets associated density or stormwater control requirements; built upon areas are designed and sited to minimize stormwater runoff impact to the receiving waters and minimizes concentrated stormwater flow; remainder of tract to remain in vegetated or natural state.
8. No activity, situation, structure or land use shall be permitted or allowed to operate within a watershed which poses a threat to water quality and the public health, safety and welfare. Such conditions may arise from inadequate on-site sewage systems which utilize ground absorption; inadequate sedimentation and erosion control measures; the improper storage or disposal of junk, trash or other refuse within a buffer area; the absence or improper implementation of a spill containment plan for toxic and hazardous materials; the improper management of stormwater runoff; or any other situation found to pose a threat to water quality.
9. The Zoning Administrator may require such information on subdivision plat, zoning and special use permit and site development plan applications, including density/built-upon area calculations, as he/she may deem necessary to determine compliance with Watershed Overlay District provisions. Preliminary and final subdivision plat approval and other such plan approvals may be required to note density/built-upon limitations on
Mebane UDO, Article 5 5-5
February 4, 2008; amended April 7, 2008; amended 07/11/16; amended November 6, 2017
the plat. For example, plats may be required to show such information as total area of the development, the amount and percent of impervious area in streets and sidewalks, the amount and percent of impervious area in other public improvements, and the amount and percent of impervious area that is allocated to the various lots for future development. Such information shall be displayed in such a manner that the Zoning Administrator can readily determine compliance with these provisions on a project by project basis.
10. The Zoning Administrator may, prior to the issuance of any permit in a Watershed Overlay District, require evidence of a valid Sedimentation Control Permit issued by the State of North Carolina or evidence satisfactory to the Zoning Administrator that no permit is required.
11. The Zoning Administrator shall maintain records of the administration of the Watershed Overlay District regulations and shall submit any modifications of the regulations and/or Map to the Division of Community Assistance. The Zoning Administrator shall also maintain a record of variances issued pursuant to Article 8, Section 8-2, C of this Ordinance and shall submit an annual report of each project receiving a variance and the reason for the variance to the Division of Environmental Management.

(c) Notwithstanding the limitations of subsection (b) above, 10 percent (334 acres) of the GWA area (3340 acres) may be developed with new projects of up to 70 percent built-upon area as Special Intensity Allocations (SIAs). SIAs shall be allocated and developed in accordance with the following rules:
(1) SIAs shall be allocated by the Zoning Administrator through the Zoning Permit/Development Plan process. The Zoning Administrator shall maintain a record of the total acreage in the GWA area eligible for SIAs, the acreage that has been allocated and the acreage that has been used as of the latest date. In no case shall allocated acreage exceed the acreage eligible for allocation.
(2) SIAs shall be allocated on a first come, first served basis upon the approval and issuance of the appropriate permit, provided that no SIA shall be allocated to a development unless it is served by or is to be served by City of Mebane water and sewer service.
(3) The right to develop a SIA shall terminate with the loss of the right to develop due to the expiration of a zoning permit, zoning permit with vested right, or building permit. In such a case, the allocated acreage, or unused allocated acreage, shall be returned to the unallocated total acreage eligible for allocation.

February 4, 2008; amended April 7, 2008; amended 07/11/16; amended November 6, 2017
(4) All SIA development shall be located so that all stormwater from the development drains into an engineered stormwater control facility designed and constructed in accordance with all the requirements of subsection E, 5, (c) below.
E. Exceeding Basic Density/Built-upon Limitations; Permit to Exceed
Development in the Watershed Overlay Districts may exceed the basic density/built-upon limitations established in subsections C, 2 and D, 2 above upon the receipt of a Permit to Exceed from the Zoning Administrator. No Permit to Exceed shall be issued except for development which is in conformance with the following conditions and limitations:
Built-upon Limitations
In no case shall the built-upon area of any development, on a project by project basis, exceed the following limitations and all development shall be calculated on a built-upon area basis only:
(a) WCA 24% built-upon area
(b) GWA 30% built-upon area
Nothing in this Section, however, shall permit any development to exceed the maximum permissible lot coverage limitations for principal and accessory buildings as set forth in this Ordinance for Use Districts.
Buffer
A minimum 50 foot vegetative buffer is required for any new development activity which exceeds the basic density/built-upon limitations along all perennial waters indicated on the most recent versions of USGS 1:24,000 scale topographic maps. Nothing in this subsection shall prevent artificial streambank or shoreline stabilization. No new development is allowed in the buffer, except that water dependent structures and public works projects such as road crossings, utilities and greenways may be allowed where no practicable alternatives exist. These activities shall minimize built-upon surface area, direct runoff away from surface water, and maximize the use of BMPs. The Citys Riparian Buffer Protection Ordinance shall have precedence over all other stream or riparian buffer regulations within the City of Mebanes jurisdiction.
Development Location
All development which exceeds the basic density/built-upon limitations shall be located so that all stormwater from the development drains into an engineered stormwater control facility designed and constructed in conformance with the requirements of this Section.
Facility Approval
No Permit to Exceed shall be issued for any development until such facility is fully constructed and approved by the Zoning Administrator or his/her agent to be capable of functioning in accordance with the requirements of this Section. Prior to
Mebane UDO, Article 5 5-8
February 4, 2008; amended April 7, 2008; amended 07/11/16; amended November 6, 2017
inspection by the Zoning Administrator or his/her agent to determine compliance, the developer shall furnish a certification sealed by an engineer or landscape architect stating that the facility is complete and consistent with the approved plans and specifications.
Facility Requirements
Engineered stormwater control facilities intended to serve development which exceeds the basic density/built-upon limitations of this Ordinance shall conform with the following requirements:
(a) Developer Responsible for Costs. The developer or his designee shall be responsible for all costs associated with the construction, operation, maintenance and repair of any such facility.
(b) Plans Required. No construction shall begin on any such facility until the construction, operation and maintenance and related plans have been submitted to and approved by the Zoning Administrator. The maintenance and operation plan shall specify a facility ownership plan and the entity to be responsible for maintenance, operation, and repair. The plan shall designate sufficient area and access to perform inspections maintenance, repairs and reconstruction. The plan shall also provide a cost estimate for routine and non-routine maintenance over a 20 year period. At the time the plans are submitted, the developer shall pay to the City of Mebane a plan review and construction inspection fee as set by the City Council.
(c) Design Standards. All stormwater control facilities shall use wet detention ponds as a primary treatment system unless alternative stormwater management measures, as outlined in subsection (f) below, are used. Wet detention ponds shall be designed for specific pollutant removal according to modeling techniques approved by the North Carolina Division of Environmental Management. Specific requirements for these systems shall be in accordance with the following design criteria:
(1) Wet detention ponds shall be designed to remove 85 percent of total suspended solids in the permanent pool and store runoff from a one inch rainfall from the watershed above the permanent pool, assuming maximum permitted development;
(2) The designed runoff storage volume shall be above the permanent pool;
(3) The discharge rate from these systems following the one inch rainfall design storm shall be such that the runoff does not draw down to the permanent pool level in less than 2 days and that the pond is drawn down to the permanent pool level within at least 5 days;
Mebane UDO, Article 5 5-9
February 4, 2008; amended April 7, 2008; amended 07/11/16; amended November 6, 2017
(4) The mean permanent pool depth shall be a minimum of 3 feet;
(5) The inlet structure shall be designed to minimize turbulence using baffles or other appropriate design features;
(6) Vegetative filters shall be constructed for the overflow and discharge of all stormwater wet detention ponds and shall be at least 30 feet in length. The slope and width of the vegetative filter shall be determined so as to provide a non-erosive velocity of flow through the filter for a 10-year, 24-hour storm with a slope of 5 percent or less. Vegetation in the filter shall be natural vegetation, grasses or artificially planted wetland vegetation appropriate for the site characteristics;
(7) In addition to the vegetative filters required in subsection (6) above, all disturbed land areas outside of the pond shall be provided with a ground cover sufficient to restrain erosion within 15 days after any land disturbance. Upon completion of the stormwater control structure, a permanent ground cover shall be established and maintained as part of the maintenance and operations plan.
(d) A description of the area containing the stormwater control structure shall be prepared and filed as a separate deed with the applicable county Register of Deeds along with any easements necessary for general access to the stormwater control structure. The deeded area shall include the stormwater control structure, vegetative filters, all pipes and water control structures, berms, dikes, etc., and sufficient area to perform inspections, maintenance, repairs, and reconstruction.
(e) Qualifying areas of the stormwater control structure may be considered pervious when computing total built-upon area. However, if the structure is used to compute the percentage built-upon area for one site, it shall not be used to compute built-upon are for any other site or area.
(f) Alternative Stormwater Management Measures. Alternative stormwater management systems, as detailed in the NC Stormwater Best Management Practices Manual, consisting of one treatment option or a combination of treatment options, may be used. The design criteria for approval shall be 85 percent average annual removal of Total Suspended Solids. Also, the discharge rate shall meet one of the following criteria;
(1) the discharge rate following the 1-inch design storm shall be such that the runoff draws down to the pre-
Mebane UDO, Article 5 5-10
February 4, 2008; amended April 7, 2008; amended 07/11/16; amended November 6, 2017
storm design stage within five days, but not less that two days; or
(2) the post development peak discharge rate shall equal the predevelopment rate for the 1-year, 24-hour storm.
Finance Guarantee and Maintenance Agreement
Before the Zoning Administrator shall approve the completed facility and issue any Permit to Exceed, the developer and/or maintaining entity shall furnish the City of Mebane with a financial guarantee ensuring future maintenance, operation and repair of the facility. The financial guarantee shall be in the form of cash, an irrevocable letter of credit or other instrument readily convertible to cash at face value and shall be deposited and made payable to the City of Mebane. The amount of the deposit shall be equal to 40 percent of the total cost of constructing the facility. The initial cost estimates shall be the responsibility of the developer but the approval of the final cost estimate shall be made by the Zoning Administrator or his/her agent. At this time the developer and/or maintaining entity shall also pay to the City of Mebane a fee as set by the City Council to cover annual inspections by the City for 20 years.
The initial duration of the financial guarantee shall be for 20 years. At the end of that period the City of Mebane may, at its own option, require extension of the guarantee for an additional period of up to 20 years based upon future maintenance cost or take whatever lawful action it may deem appropriate at that time. The financial guarantee may be dissolved at any time in its lifetime by mutual agreement when the need for such guarantee no longer exists.
As part of the financial guarantee, the developer or maintaining entity shall enter into a binding Operation and Maintenance Agreement in a form acceptable to and enforceable by the City of Mebane. Such agreement shall require the responsible entity to maintain, repair and, if necessary, reconstruct the facility in accordance with the approved operation and maintenance plan. The plan shall clearly indicate the steps that will be taken for restoring a stormwater control structure to design specifications if a failure occurs.
Landscaping and grounds management shall be the responsibility of the owning entity. However, vegetation shall not be established or allowed to mature to the extent that the integrity of the control structure is diminished or threatened, or to the extent of interfering with any easement or access to the stormwater control structure.
The agreement shall pledge the financial guarantee in support of the agreement but also shall acknowledge that default does not release the entity from liability/responsibility for operation, maintenance and repair/reconstruction. The agreement shall provide that in case of default by the operating entity, the City of Mebane, at any time after default, may on its own motion assume actual maintenance and operation of the facility and convert for its use in maintenance and operation any and all funds remaining in the financial guarantee. The agreement shall be recorded with the
Mebane UDO, Article 5 5-11
February 4, 2008; amended April 7, 2008; amended 07/11/16; amended November 6, 2017
appropriate County Register of Deeds by the Zoning Administrator after it is executed by both parties. No changes to the agreement or its terms including ownership and responsible entity shall be made except upon agreement of the parties.
Amendments to the plans and specifications of the stormwater control structure and/or the operation and maintenance plan shall be approved by the Zoning Administrator. Proposed changes shall be prepared by a North Carolina registered professional engineer or landscape architect (to the extent that the General Statutes, Chapter 89A, allow) and submitted to and reviewed by the City Engineer.
Inspections
The Zoning Administrator or his/her agent shall inspect all facilities at least on an annual basis to determine whether the controls are performing as designed or intended and whether maintenance is being performed as required. Records of inspections shall be maintained on forms approved or supplied by the NC Division of Environmental Management. The first annual inspection shall be made during the 12 months following the date of certification.
Failure to Perform
In the event the Zoning Administrator should find that the facility is not performing as designed or intended or that maintenance and repairs are not being made as required or that any action is being done or not done that is in violation of this Ordinance or the agreement related to the facility, the Zoning Administrator shall notify the responsible entity who shall be given a reasonable time to correct the defect(s). Should the responsible entity fail to act, fail to act in a timely manner, or otherwise fail to correct the defect(s), the Zoning Administrator shall institute appropriate action to obtain compliance including criminal or civil penalties, or both. In addition, the City of Mebane may declare the responsible entity in default of the agreement and financial guarantee and use part or all of the proceeds of the guarantee to correct the defect(s) and may assume actual operation and maintenance. Default in the agreement does not release the responsible entity from liability/responsibility for the defect(s), nor release the entity from the agreement. Likewise, default in the agreement does not prevent the City of Mebane from taking criminal or civil action, or other.
F. Variances
Requests for variances from the watershed district overlay requirements of Section 5-2 shall be reviewed by the Board of Adjustment in accordance with the provisions of Section 8-2, C.
5.3 Flood Hazard Overlay District Requirements
5-3.1 Statutory Authorization, Purpose,Objectives, Legal Status Provisions
A. The Flood Hazard Overlay District (FHO), as established in Section 3-1, D, 2, (d), is designed for the purpose of protecting people and property from the hazards of flooding in accordance with the authority
Mebane UDO, Article 5 5-12

provided in Part 6, Article 21 of Chapter 143; Parts 3, 5, and 8 of Article 19 of Chapter 160A; and Article 8 of Chapter 160A of the North Carolina General Statutes.
B. Flood prone areas within the jurisdiction of the City of Mebane are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life, property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures of flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety, and general welfare. These flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains causing increases in flood heights and velocities and by the occupancy in flood prone areas of uses vulnerable to floods or other hazards.
C. It is the purpose of Section 5-3 to promote public health, safety, and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions within flood prone areas by provisions designed to:
1. Restrict or prohibit uses that are dangerous to health, safety, and property due to water or erosion hazards or that result in damaging increases in erosion, flood heights or velocities;
2. Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities that serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction;
3. Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural protective barriers, which are involved in the accommodation of floodwaters;
4. Control filling, grading, dredging, and all other development that may increase erosion or flood damage; and
5. Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers that will unnaturally divert flood waters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands.
D. The objectives of Section 5-3 are:
1. To protect human life and health;
2. To minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects;
3. To minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
4. To minimize prolonged business losses and interruptions;
5. To minimize damage to public facilities and utilities (i.e. water and gas mains, electric, telephone, cable and sewer lines, streets, and bridges) that are located in flood prone areas;
6. To minimize damage to private and public property due to
Mebane UDO, Article 5 5-13
February 4, 2008; amended April 7, 2008; amended 07/11/16; amended November 6, 2017
flooding;
7. To make flood insurance available to the community through the National Flood Insurance Program;
8. To maintain the natural and beneficial function of the floodplains;
9. To help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of flood prone areas; and
10. To ensure that potential buyers are aware that property is in a Special Flood Hazard Area.
E. Legal Status Provisions associated with Section 5-3 are:
1. This Section in part comes forward by re-enactment of some of the provisions of the Flood Damage Prevention Ordinance enacted March 7, 1994 as amended, and it is not the intention to repeal but rather to re-enact and continue to enforce without interruption of such existing provisions, so that all rights and liabilities that have accrued thereunder are reserved and may be enforced. The enactment of this Section shall not affect any action, suit or proceeding instituted or pending. All provisions of the Flood Damage Prevention Ordinance of the City of Mebane enacted on March 7, 1994, as amended, which are not reenacted herein are repealed.
The date of the initial Flood Damage Prevention Ordinance for Alamance County is August 15, 1994. The date of the initial Flood Damage Prevention Ordinance for Orange County is March 2, 1981.
2. Nothing herein contained shall require any change in the plans, construction, size, or designated use of any development or any part thereof for which a floodplain development permit has been granted by the Floodplain Administrator or his or her authorized agents before the time of passage of this Section; provided, however, that when construction is not begun under such outstanding permit within a period of six (6) months subsequent to the date of issuance of the outstanding permit, construction or use shall be in conformity with the provisions of this Section.
3. Section 5-3 as amended November 6, 2017 shall become effective November 17, 2017.

1. An erosion control plan has been submitted to and approved by the Land Quality Section; or
2. The Land Quality Section has examined the preliminary plans for the development and it reasonably appears that an erosion control plan can be approved upon submission by the developer of more detailed construction or design drawings. However, in this case, construction of the development may not begin (and no building permits may be issued) until the Land Quality Section approves the erosion control plan.
B. For purposes of this Section, land disturbing activity means any use of the land by any person in residential, industrial, educational, institutional or commercial development, highway and street construction and maintenance that results in a change in the natural cover or topography and that may cause or contribute to sedimentation except activities that are exempt under NCGS 113A-52(6)). Sedimentation occurs whenever solid particulate matter, mineral or organic, is transported by water, air, gravity, or ice from the site of its origin.
5-6 Highway Corridor Overlay District Requirements

7. Loading docks, service areas, and trash facilities shall be located at the rear of structures, and shall not be visible from the street. Parking and loading areas shall be screened from abutting properties in accordance with the requirements of Section 6-4.8.
8. A required streetscape buffer yard shall comply with the requirements of Section 6-3, D, 4 except that the additional minimum standards shall also be applicable to properties in the HCO District:
(a) Two canopy trees for every 40 linear feet of highway frontage;
(b) Two understory trees for every 20 linear feet of highway frontage; and
(c) Thirty-four shrubs for every 100 linear feet of highway frontage.
9. Signs shall be architecturally compatible with the style, composition, materials, colors, and details of the structure as well as with other signs used on the structure.
10. General building design standards:
(a) No awnings or canopy fascias shall be internally lit.
(b) Building and roof colors shall consist of natural earth tones, white, black, or shades of gray. Primary colors or bright colors shall be limited to trim and signage. Day glow or neon colors shall be avoided.
(c) Building color schemes shall blend in with surroundings. Multiple colors and garish or unusual patterns or geometric shapes shall be avoided.
(d) Applicants are required to submit color renderings, color elevation drawings, or color photographs with the site plan or to place a note on the site plan indicating that compliance with subsections (b) and (c) above shall be achieved and approved by the City Council prior to installation.

ARTICLE 6
DESIGN AND PERFORMANCE STANDARDS
6-1 Building Design and Architectural Character
The purpose and intent of this section is to establish standards to guide development that is aesthetically pleasing and compatible within the context of the surrounding area. These guidelines are intended to allow for creativity and diversity, and avoid to monotony in design.
A. Applicability
1. The standards and guidelines contained in Section 6-1 shall apply to all new nonresidential structures or combined structures greater than 25,000 square feet and to expansions or alterations of any such existing building where the expansion or alteration exceeds 50 percent of the building value as assessed for real property taxes except in M-1, M-2 Industrial Zoning Districts. (Amended March 4, 2013)
2. All development subject to this Section shall be compatible with the established architectural character of the City of Mebane by utilizing a design that is complementary to existing City architectural styles, designs, and forms. Compatibility shall be achieved through techniques such as the repetition of roof lines, the use of similar proportions in building mass and outdoor spaces, similar relationships to the street, similar window and door patterns, and the use of building materials that have color, shades, and textures similar to those existing in the immediate area of the proposed development.
B. Definitions
Unless otherwise specifically provided, or unless clearly required by the context, the words and phrases defined in this subsection shall have the meaning indicated when used throughout Section 6-2.
1. Arcade. A continuous passageway parallel to and open to a street, open space, or building, usually covered by a canopy or permanent roofing.
2. Architectural Feature. A prominent or significant part of element of a building, structure, or site.
3. Architectural Style. The characteristic form and detail of buildings of a particular historic period.
4. Awning. An architectural projection that provides weather protection, identity and/or decoration and is wholly supported by the building to which it is attached. An awning is comprised of a lightweight, rigid or retractable skeleton over which an approved cover is attached.
5. Building Mass. The height, width, and depth of a structure.
Mebane UDO, Article 6 6-2
February 4, 2008; amended April 7, 2008; amended September 11, 2017; amended July 7, 2019
6. Bulk. The size and shape of buildings, structures, and non-building uses and the physical relationship of their exterior walls or construction or their location to lot lines and other buildings or structures or other walls or construction of the same building or structure.
7. Canopy. A structure constructed of rigid materials, including but not limited to metal, wood, concrete, canvas, or glass, which is attached to and supported by a building, or which is free-standing and supported by columns, poles, or braces extended to the ground.
8. Courtyard. A space, open and unobstructed to the sky, located at or above grade level on a lot bounded on three or more sides by walls or a building.
9. Façade. The exterior side of a building which faces, and is most nearly parallel to, a public or private street. The façade shall include the entire building wall, including wall face, parapets, fascia, windows, doors, canopy, and visible roof structures of one complete elevation.
10. Eave. The projecting lower edges of a roof overhanging the wall of a building.
11. Infill. The development of new housing or other buildings on scattered vacant sites which is surrounded by existing development.
12. Intensity. The number of square feet per acre by land use type with respect to nonresidential land uses.
13. Marquee. Any permanent roof-like structure projecting beyond a building or extending along and projecting beyond the wall of the building, generally designed and constructed to provide protection from the weather.
14. Parapet wall. That portion of a building wall that extends above the roofline. Parapet walls are often used to shield mechanical equipment and vents.
15. Plaza. An open space that may be improved and landscaped; usually surrounded by streets and buildings.
16. Roof line. The highest edge of the roof or the top of a parapet, whichever establishes the top line of the structure when viewed in a horizontal plane.
17. Scale of Development. The relationship of a particular project or development, in terms of size, height, bulk, intensity, and aesthetics, to its surroundings.
Mebane UDO, Article 6 6-3
February 4, 2008; amended April 7, 2008; amended September 11, 2017; amended July 7, 2019
C. Building Design Standards
Design standards promote creativity and innovation while discouraging obtrusive, incongruous structures. The City discourages architectural styles that do not build upon and promote the existing character of the City. The City supports the view that inspiring, well-maintained, and harmonious development is in the best economic development interests of all residents and businesses.
1. Emphasize Human Scale
Building design shall emphasize a human scale at ground level, at entryways, and along street frontages through the creative use of windows, doors, columns, canopies, and awnings.
2. Major Building Design Features Proportional
Major building design features, such as windows, doors, eaves, and parapets, shall be designed to be in proportion to one another.
3. Structural Lines Retained at Storefront Level
The structural lines of a building and its materials shall be retained at the storefront level. For instance, brick piers and columns shall be carried down to street level.
4. Awnings and Canopies
Awnings and canopies shall complement the color and material of the building to which they are affixed.
5. Massing
A single, large, dominant building mass shall be avoided. Where large structures are required, mass should be broken up through the use of setbacks, projecting and recessed elements, and similar design techniques. Changes in mass shall be related to entrances, the integral structure, and/or the organization of interior spaces and activities and not merely for cosmetic effect.
6. Avoiding Garage Dominance
Where garages are located in front of, even with, or to the side of a principal dwelling, the width of garage doors on the house elevation facing the street shall not exceed 40 percent of the total width of the house and garage together.
D. Avoiding Monotony of Design
Monotony of design in single or multiple building projects shall be avoided by varying detail, form, and siting to the maximum extent practicable, within the standards set forth in this article, to provide visual interest.
E. Harmony of Design
The purpose of this subsection is to preserve the design character of existing development, to protect the visual pattern of the community, and to promote harmony in the visual relationships and transitions between new and older buildings. New buildings should respect the scale, form, and proportion of existing development. This can be done by repeating building lines and surface
Mebane UDO, Article 6 6-4
February 4, 2008; amended April 7, 2008; amended September 11, 2017; amended July 7, 2019
treatments and by requiring some uniformity of detail, scale, proportion, texture, materials, color, and building form.
1. Building Color Shades
Building color shades shall be used to facilitate blending into the neighborhood and unify the development. The color shades of building materials shall draw from the range of color shades that already exist on the block or in the adjacent neighborhood.
2. Building Materials
Building materials shall either be similar to the materials already being used in the neighborhood or, if dissimilar materials are being proposed, other characteristics such as scale and proportions, form, architectural detailing, color, and texture, shall be utilized to ensure that enough similarity exists for the building to be compatible, despite the differences in materials.
3. Similar Size and Height for Infill Development
New infill development shall either be similar in size and height or, if larger, be articulated and subdivided into massing that is proportional to the mass and scale of other structures on the same block, or if no buildings exist thereon, then on adjoining blocks.
4. Unify Individual Storefronts
If several storefronts are located in one building, the individual storefronts shall be unified in all exterior design elements, such as mass, window and door placement, color, materials, and signage.
5. Additions and Renovations
Building additions and façade renovations should be designed to reflect existing buildings in scale, materials, window treatment, and color. A change in scale may require a transitional design element between the new development and existing buildings.
6. Varying Architectural Styles
In developments with multiple structures of varying architectural styles, buildings shall be compatible by such means as a pattern of architectural features, similar scale and proportions, and consistent location of signage.
F. Architectural Character
Architectural character focuses on the specific details that greatly affect the overall appearance of a particular development. These architectural character standards in this subsection provide direction in aspects of color, facade materials, rooflines, and the enhancement of entryways. The primary goal is to define the finishing touches that provide the development with a sense of permanence, style, and compatibility. The City discourages proposals that have not taken these matters into account. The City policy is that all development be treated as a lasting contributor to the community and as a good neighbor to its surroundings.
1. Roofs
The following standards are intended to foster variations in roof lines to soften and reduce the massive scale of large buildings:
Mebane UDO, Article 6 6-5
February 4, 2008; amended April 7, 2008; amended September 11, 2017; amended July 7, 2019
(a) Roof lines shall be varied to reduce the scale of structures and add visual interest.
(b) Roof shape (for example: flat, hip, mansard, or gable) and material shall be architecturally compatible with façade elements and the rest of the building.
(c) Flat roofs must be enclosed by a parapet that screens mechanical equipment from view by pedestrians at street level.
(d) The height of the parapet shall not exceed one-third of the height of the supporting wall. Such parapet shall not be of a constant height for a distance greater than 150 feet.
2. Facades
(a) Recesses and Projections
Facades greater than 100 feet in length, measured horizontally, shall incorporate building wall offsets including recesses and projections along at least 20 percent of the length of the façade. Windows, awnings, and arcades shall total at least 60 percent of the façade length abutting a public street.
(b) Repeating Design Patterns
Facades greater than 100 feet in length, measured horizontally, shall incorporate a repeating pattern of change in color, texture, and material modules. All elements should repeat at intervals of no more than 30 feet, either horizontally or vertically.
(c) Renovations
Façade renovations shall incorporate original building details to the maximum extent practicable.
(d) Materials
Brick, stone, or wood facades shall not be covered or replaced with artificial siding or panels.
(e) Roof Cornices
If roof cornices have been removed or damaged on an existing building, renovations of that building must include retaining, repairing, and replacing the roof cornices if previously removed.
(f) Replacement of Windows
Replacement of windows on the façade of an existing building shall be accomplished by using windows of the same trim, size, and character as the original or by using a different style of window that complements the architectural style of the building.
(g) Exterior Wall Cladding
All exterior walls visible from a parking lot or public right-of-way in any zoning district except the M-1 and M-2 Industrial zoning districts shall be clad with the same material required for the front
Mebane UDO, Article 6 6-6
February 4, 2008; amended April 7, 2008; amended September 11, 2017; amended July 7, 2019
of the building. Buildings in the M-1 and M-2 zoning districts are required to provide the same material as the front of the building for at least 25% of the area of the side façades and 100% of the area of side façades directly facing a public right-of-way. All walls not visible from a parking lot or public right-of-way, or the remaining 75% of the side façades in the M-1 and M-2 zoning districts, may be constructed of alternate material(s), but shall be of a color that is complimentary to the primary material, is incorporated into the overall color scheme of the building, and is approved by the City Council. See also subsection 4 (a), Predominant Exterior Building Materials.
(h) Building Orientation
New buildings shall be oriented so that the largest and longest façade faces the primary road. To the maximum extent feasible, new buildings shall be oriented or designed to minimize shadows falling on public or semi-public spaces.
3. Entryways
(a) Required Entryway Features
Entryway design elements and variations shall provide orientation and aesthetically pleasing character to the building. The following standards identify desirable entryway design features. Each principal building on a site shall have clearly defined, highly visible customer entrances featuring no less than three of the following:
(1) Canopies or Porticos
(2) Arcades
(3) Overhangs
(4) Recesses/projections
(5) Raised corniced parapets over the doors
(6) Peaked roof forms
(7) Arches
(8) Wing walls
(9) Outdoor patio
(10) Display windows
(11) Planters
(12) Architectural details such as tile work and moldings which are designed into the building structure and overall design
Mebane UDO, Article 6 6-7
February 4, 2008; amended April 7, 2008; amended September 11, 2017; amended July 7, 2019
(b) Sides Facing Abutting Street
All sides of a principal building that directly face an abutting public street shall feature at least one customer entrance.
4. Exterior Building Materials and Colors

Predominant exterior building materials shall be high quality materials, including brick, wood, cast stone, stucco, sandstone, other native stone, and tinted/textured concrete masonry units.
(b) Colors
(1) Façade colors shall be of low reflectance and/or subtle colors. Building trim may feature brighter colors, but neon tubing is not allowed as an accent material. The use of high intensity colors or fluorescent colors shall be prohibited.
(2) Variations in color schemes are encouraged in order to articulate entryways and public amenities so as to give greater recognition to these features.
1. Outdoor Plazas
Outdoor plazas shall contain at least two of the following features:
(a) Landscaping island
(b) Benches
(c) Fountains
(d) Clock tower
(e) Pond or other prominent water feature

certificate of zoning compliance.
6-3 Landscaping, Buffering, and Screening
A. Purpose and Applicability
1. Purpose: Protection of Mebanes natural environment and enhancement of the communitys built environment with installation of new landscape areas are important to the City of Mebane and its citizens. The regulations of this Section are a tool to ensure these goals are accomplished. The purposes of this Section are:
(a) To encourage the proper use of the land by promoting an appropriate balance between the built environment and preservation/conservation of open space;
(b) To preserve and improve property values and protect private and public investment through preservation of open space, protection of the existing tree canopy, providing buffers between incompatible uses and along roadways, and encouraging the planting of new vegetation as deemed appropriate;
(c) To consider the guidelines and recommendations in Mebanes Land Development Plan and the MAP 2000 strategic planning project;
(d) To preserve and protect the identity and character of Mebane, and to enhance the business economy; and
(e) To set forth development standards and requirements for preserving existing vegetation and installation of new landscape areas.
2. Application: The requirements of this Section shall apply to all uses of land, buildings, and structures located within the City of Mebane Planning and Zoning Jurisdiction which are not exempted in subsection 3 below.
3. Exemptions: None of the landscaping and screening requirements of this Section shall apply to:
(a) A detached single-family dwelling on its own separate lot.
(b) A two-family dwelling on its own separate lot.
(c) Existing uses and buildings, including repairs, alterations, or improvements to the interiors and exteriors of existing buildings which do not result in additions or expansions to them.
(d) Additions or expansions made to existing buildings within any consecutive 12-month period where the gross floor area of the additions or expansions does not exceed 45% of the gross floor area of the existing buildings.
Mebane UDO, Article 6 6-10
February 4, 2008; amended April 7, 2008; amended September 11, 2017; amended July 7, 2019
(e) Additions or expansions made to existing vehicular parking areas
within any consecutive 12-month period where the total area of the
additions or expansions will not exceed 45% of the existing
vehicular parking areas.
(f) Application to Small Developments and Lots:
Notwithstanding any other provisions to the contrary contained in
this Ordinance, the requirements and standards set forth herein
shall not apply to developments, uses, or expansions where the
total area is 2.00 acres or less. Such uses and development shall
submit a landscape plan to the Zoning Administrator showing the
following landscaping and screening requirements:
 An aesthetic perimeter buffer of average linear width of fifteen feet (15) with a minimum of five feet (5) buffer area in width shall be located along the outer perimeter of parcel to separate that use from adjacent residential uses. This buffer shall function as a semi-opaque Type B buffer.
 There shall be a minimum of one canopy tree every 2500 square feet or one understory tree for every 1400 square feet of parking area. All vehicular parking areas shall be screened from adjacent properties and streets by evergreen plantings that will attain a height of three feet (3) within three years. The use of shrubs and ground covers is encouraged in parking area islands and along the borders of parking areas.
(Adopted on May 7, 2012; Amended September 10, 2018)
B. General Provisions
Landscaping plans
Landscaping and tree preservation plans shall be submitted for approval as part of each site plan required by this Ordinance.
Pre-design Conference
A pre-design conference with the Zoning Administrator is strongly encouraged to understand the requirements of this Section.
A. Alternative Methods of Compliance
(a) Under certain circumstances the application of the standards delineated in this Section may either be inappropriate or ineffective in achieving the purposes of this Section. When landscaping and screening is required by this Section or by other provisions of this Ordinance and the site design, topography, unique relationships to other properties, lot configuration, spatial separation, natural vegetation, or other special considerations exist relative to the proposed development, the developer may submit a specific alternative plan to the Zoning Administrator. This plan must demonstrate how the purposes and standards of this Ordinance will
Mebane UDO, Article 6 6-11
February 4, 2008; amended April 7, 2008; amended September 11, 2017; amended July 7, 2019
be met by measures other than those listed in this Section. If approved by the Zoning Administrator, the alternative landscaping plan may be utilized to meet the requirements of this Ordinance. Any party aggrieved by the staffs approval or disapproval of an alternative landscaping plan may appeal such granting or denial to the City Council for its decision. The City Councils decision on the alternative plan shall be conclusive.
(b) A combination of natural vegetation, fences, walls and berms may be utilized to achieve the screening requirements of this Section provided that the following standards are met:
(1) Walls (a minimum of 5 feet in height and constructed of masonry, stone or pressure treated lumber) or an opaque fence (a minimum of 5 feet in height) may be used to reduce the widths of the buffer yards required by 10 feet.
(2) Understory trees may be substituted for canopy trees if, in the opinion of the Zoning Administrator upon conferring with the electrical utility provider, a conflict exists with overhead utility lines.
(3) Wall planters shall be constructed of masonry, stone or pressure treated lumber and shall have a minimum height of 30 inches. The minimum height of shrubs in wall planters shall be 12 inches. The effective planting area of the wall planter shall be 4 feet in width (7 feet if the wall planter contains trees).
(4) Any berm utilized for screening purposes shall comply with the standards and requirements of subsection H, 4.
4. All portions of required perimeter and streetscape buffer yards not planted with trees or shrubs or covered by a wall, driveway, or other barrier shall be planted with grass, ground cover, or natural mulch of a minimum depth of 3 inches.
5. All tree and plant material selections shall be native or adaptable to the Mebane region and its climate. A recommended plant materials list is provided in Appendix G.
C. Perimeter Buffers: Existing Vegetation or New Perimeter Landscaping, General Requirements
1. Applicability
All land uses for which site plan approval is required shall provide a buffer to separate that use from adjacent land uses in accordance with the buffer chart (see Table 6-3-1). Within the B-1 Central Business District, however, the requirements of this Section shall apply only to boundaries between properties located within the district and properties located outside the district, and not to boundaries between properties which are each located within the B-1 Central Business District.
Mebane UDO, Article 6 6-12
February 4, 2008; amended April 7, 2008; amended September 11, 2017; amended July 7, 2019
2. Purpose of buffers
Natural and landscaped buffers to separate adjacent land uses shall be provided in order to:
(a) Shield properties from any adverse external effects of adjacent development, so as to mitigate incompatibilities between adjacent uses;
(b) Preserve open space;
(c) Preserve or create tree canopy and vegetation:
(d) Minimize future increases in stormwater runoff; and
(e) Improve appearance of developments.
3. Existing Natural Buffers
Existing buffers should be preserved rather than removing existing vegetation, in order to promote the preservation of existing natural areas. Where possible, buffers should remain in an undisturbed condition; but if the buffer is not a stream buffer, some maintenance may be necessary to prevent overgrowth. If an existing buffer does not meet the required buffer type as specified in Table 6-3-1, it must be enhanced to meet the specifications. The buffer shall have the width, amount of vegetation, and other features to properly mitigate negative effects of contiguous land uses.
4. Landscaped or Re-vegetated Buffers
If the Zoning Administrator determines that there is not an existing buffer on the site or has been disturbed, then a re-vegetated natural buffer shall be installed.
5. Type and width of buffer required
Table 6-3-1 determines the type and width of existing buffer or landscaped buffer that must be installed.

* see subsection C, 7, (a) and (b) for descriptions of buffer types
Notes:
1. When no significant trees and shrubs occur within the perimeter buffer, new trees and shrubs are required to be planted to meet the requirements for the applicable buffer type. The new plantings shall be spread across the entire width of the buffer and not always planted in a row or rows.
2. No buffer is required between shared public uses (example a park adjacent to a school, library, or other shared public facility).
3. Buffers consistent with these land use classes are required between out-parcels and the adjacent shopping center or development to which the parcel is related. However, a required perimeter buffer between outparcels may be shifted elsewhere on the site per subsection C, 9.
6. Land use classes for purposes of determining buffer width and type
The seven land use classes appearing in Table 6-3-1 include the following uses and structures:

7. Types of Buffers and Landscaped Areas; Performance Standards
The two types of landscaped buffers that appear in Table 6-3-1 are described below along with performance standards for each. The use of existing plantings and trees is the preferred method of meeting the buffer and landscape requirements.
These types of buffers may be achieved by meeting the requirements listed below or by an approved alternative method that meets the performance requirements.
(a) Type B, Semi-opaque
Performance Standards: This perimeter buffer functions as a semi-opaque screen from the ground to at least a height 6 feet. Vegetative material within this buffer shall meet the following criteria:
(1) Existing or planted deciduous and/or evergreen trees shall attain a height at maturity of no less than 40 feet.
(2) At least 75 percent of the required shrubs shall be evergreen species locally adapted to the area.
(3) Minimum spacing shall generally be no wider than 20 feet between tree trunks (but may be wider depending on tree type), with evergreen shrubs spacing ranging from 5 to 8 feet on center.
(4) Composition of the Semi-opaque Type B buffer may include a wall, fence, landscaped earthen berm, planted vegetation, existing vegetation, or any appropriate combination of the elements.
(b) Type C, Aesthetic
Mebane UDO, Article 6 6-17
February 4, 2008; amended April 7, 2008; amended September 11, 2017; amended July 7, 2019
Performance Standards: This perimeter buffer functions as an intermittent visual obstruction from the ground to a height of at least 20 feet, and creates the impression of spatial separation without eliminating visual contact between uses. Vegetative material within this buffer shall meet the following criteria:
(1) Existing or proposed tree plantings and shrubs of either deciduous and/or evergreen species may be installed in either a random, clustered, and/or linear fashion.
(2) Minimum spacing shall generally be no wider than 40 feet between canopy tree trunks and no wider than 20 feet between ornamental tree trunks. (Amended 12/05/11)
(3) Composition of the Aesthetic Type C buffer may include a wall, fence, earth berm, planted vegetation, existing vegetation, or any appropriate combination of these elements.
Mebane UDO, Article 6 6-18
February 4, 2008; amended April 7, 2008; amended September 11, 2017; amended July 7, 2019

Mebane UDO, Article 6 6-20
February 4, 2008; amended April 7, 2008; amended September 11, 2017; amended July 7, 2019
(c) General Buffer Standards
Buffer plantings shall conform to the following standards:
(1) The new plantings comprising the buffer shall be spread across the entire span of the buffer and not always planted in a row or rows. In some cases, planting in a row or rows is necessary to achieve the desired performance objective. Specifically, the entire buffer width may not be needed to achieve the desired performance objective of the buffer type. However, the remainder of the required buffer area should have a minimum spacing of trees as required by the applicable buffer type.
(2) Buffer performance requirements must be achieved within five years.
(3) Additional trees and shrubs may be required in addition to the existing vegetation to meet these buffer requirements.
8. Determination of buffer width and responsibility for installation:
(a) Where a developing parcel is adjacent to a vacant parcel, then the developing parcel shall provide one-half of the buffer required adjacent to the vacant land as indicated in Table 6-3-1.
(b) Where a developing parcel is adjacent to an existing land use, then the developing parcel shall provide the full buffer required adjacent to the existing land use unless the existing use already has a buffer that may be credited for part of the required width. If the existing use is residential with a planted buffer, the developing lot may not credit the buffer to part of the required width. The Zoning Administrator shall determine the amount of credit based upon an assessment of the adequacy of the existing buffer. (Amended December 5, 2011)
9. Location of buffers
The perimeter buffers required by this Section shall be located along the outer perimeter of the parcel and shall extend to the parcel boundary line or right-of-way line; however, the buffers may be located along shared access easements between parcels in non-residential developments. Within shopping centers or other non-residential centers/developments, the perimeter buffer area between outparcels may be shifted totally or in part, elsewhere on the site. For example a 20-foot buffer between like uses may be shifted elsewhere on the site preferably interior to the site as long as the total area is provided for. The intent of this subsection is to provide for more flexibility in designing sites and potentially save larger natural areas elsewhere on the site.
Perimeter buffers shall not include any portion of an existing or proposed
Mebane UDO, Article 6 6-21
February 4, 2008; amended April 7, 2008; amended September 11, 2017; amended July 7, 2019
Public or private street, easement, stormwater management area, or
right-of-way. Stormwater management structures may be allowed in a buffer provided that it can be landscaped to meet the intent of the buffer requirements.
10. Existing vegetation, fences, walls, and berms
Existing significant vegetation within the required buffer shall be preserved and credited toward standards for the type of buffer required, unless otherwise approved by the Zoning Administrator at the time of site plan approval. Existing berms, walls, or fences within the buffer, but not including chain link fencing, may be used in part to fulfill the requirements for the 6-foot tall screen where required, provided that these elements are healthy and/or in a condition of good repair. Other existing site features within the required buffer area which do not otherwise function to meet the standards for the required buffer shall be screened from the view of other properties or removed, as determined during review and approval of the site plan.
11. Installation of new vegetation and other features
If existing significant vegetation and other site features do not fully meet the standards for the type of buffer required, then additional vegetation and/or site features (such as fences) shall be planted or installed within the required buffer area to meet the performance criteria outlined in subsection 7 above (Types of Buffers/Landscaped Areas; Performance Standards).
12. No development within the required buffers
With the exceptions noted below, the required buffer shall not contain any development, impervious surfaces, or site features that do not function to meet the standards of this Section or that require removal of existing vegetation. No grading, development, or land-disturbing activities shall occur within the buffer or within the tree protection fence area unless approved by the Zoning Administrator.
Sidewalks and trails may be placed in buffers provided that damage to existing vegetation is minimized. Utilities are not permitted in buffers unless no reasonable alternative exists. If utilities are placed in a buffer, they shall be located and installed in a way that minimizes disturbance of the buffer area (for example, installed not parallel but perpendicular or not less than at a 75 degree angle). Streets may not be placed within a buffer except to cross the buffer where necessary to connect to adjoining properties.
D. Streetscape Landscaping: Preservation of Existing Vegetation and Installation of New Landscape Areas
1. Preservation of Existing Vegetation along Roadways
All uses which are subject to the requirements of this Ordinance shall preserve existing healthy vegetation within the streetscape or street front along all existing and proposed streets.
Mebane UDO, Article 6 6-22
February 4, 2008; amended April 7, 2008; amended September 11, 2017; amended July 7, 2019
(a) Residential Development Perimeters: Natural and dense vegetation should be maintained along major collectors and thoroughfares to mitigate the impact of these roadways.
(b) On sites zoned for commercial or manufacturing use where Type C Aesthetic buffers are applicable, selective thinning may occur to improve the health of trees within the buffer. In addition, existing low-growing healthy vegetation and undergrowth for typical trees may be removed, if necessary, to allow for greater visibility of the site; however, healthy native ornamental specimen species should be saved if practical. Proposals for thinning buffers must be approved by the Zoning Administrator.
(c) The Zoning Administrator may allow the installation and maintenance of a planted streetscape in lieu of preservation of the existing vegetation along each thoroughfare or all streets which are adjacent to the site. Such modifications can be made with sound justification related to topography, drainage, site configuration, quality and quantity of existing healthy vegetation, road construction requirements or other similar issue. If a planted streetscape is permitted, then the required vegetation will be installed or an amount comparable to what existed naturally (given time for maturity at a later date). If no existing healthy vegetation exists, then a minimum of a Type C planting is required.
Existing healthy vegetation may be removed in order to achieve required automobile sight distance triangles at intersections, driveways, or ingress/egress points, drive access to the site or to locate sidewalks or trails after review and approval by the Zoning Administrator
(d) The applicant may appeal the Zoning Administrators decision by electing to have the development plan forwarded to the City Council for consideration, after review and recommendation by the Planning Board.
2. Required Width of Streetscapes for All Types of Development
The width of the streetscape for non-residential uses (except when located in the B-1, Central Business District) shall be a minimum of 20 feet along thoroughfares and major collectors, as measured from the right-of-way line. The width of streetscapes in the B-1 district shall be determined on a case-by-case basis in accordance with the provisions of subsection I, 2, (c).
(a) For residential developments along thoroughfares and major collectors, the width of the streetscape shall be a minimum of 20 feet in width. In accordance with subsection I, Incentives the Zoning Administrator may grant reductions in the width for residential streetscapes, only when the remaining streetscape is effective at reducing the impact of the adjacent roadway (i.e. use of walls, berms with a substantially more intensive landscape plan). The City Council may permit other reductions, after review and recommendation by the Planning Board.
Mebane UDO, Article 6 6-23
February 4, 2008; amended April 7, 2008; amended September 11, 2017; amended July 7, 2019
(b) On redeveloped sites or existing non-conforming sites, Council may reduce the streetscape to less than ten feet to promote redevelopment and reuse of existing developments (see subsection I, Incentives). The following criteria shall be considered in reducing the width of a streetscape:
(1) The relationship of existing topography to the finished street grades;
(2) The type, amount, and location of existing vegetation within 30 feet of the right-of-way line;
(3) The size and configuration of the site;
(4) The location and extent of existing and proposed underground and overhead utilities;
(5) Slopes steeper than two and one-half to one (2.5:1) next to the right-of-way;
(6) Natural barriers to installation or maintenance of the streetscape, such as waterways, rock formations, and soil conditions;
(7) Proposed landscaping within the streetscape that exceeds the minimum.
(c) If reductions are granted, the total area or part of that area that is reduced may be required to be placed elsewhere on the site.
3. Streetscape Landscaped Area
Table 6-3-2 below lists the full widths of streetscape required for the development based on land use across an adjacent street. The full width listed is required on each proposed site (not split between the two uses).

February 4, 2008; amended April 7, 2008; amended September 11, 2017; amended July 7, 2019
4. Plantings in Streetscape
The property owner or developer shall preserve existing healthy trees or, if none exist, install or maintain one canopy tree of at least two and one-half inches in caliper for each 40 linear feet of streetscape. One understory ornamental tree every 20 feet on average is also required. Shrubs and other types of vegetation shall be planted to meet the intent of the streetscape. The planting throughout the streetscape should be designed to achieve a natural tree stand area in future years. Additional trees may be required to be installed where existing healthy trees are preserved to ensure that the spacing of streetscape trees is met. The selected tree type located under overhead power lines may reach a maximum height of 20-25 feet at maturity.
5. Tree Placement
Trees shall be installed on the thoroughfare side of any berm or screen planting, no less than 5 feet from the sidewalk or back of curb where no sidewalk exists or is planned within the right-of-way. Trees should be installed in a staggered fashion, or in clusters or groupings of large and/or small trees in combination with associated plantings. Trees may be planted in a linear arrangement parallel to the street depending upon the area (e.g., downtown areas, neotraditional developments, etc.). Street trees shall be spaced at least 8 feet from light poles and 10 feet from electrical transformers in order to safely service these utilities (understory trees may be placed closer if approved by the Zoning Administrator). No plantings shall impede vehicular visibility or movement at any intersection with street lines. For any corner lot, a sight triangle measuring ten feet from the right of way and extending 70 feet from the edge of each side of the corner lot shall be required when designing the landscaping dimensions.

(Amended September 11, 2017)
6. Pervious Area for New Trees
A minimum of 300 square feet of pervious ground area per canopy tree shall be provided (understory trees may be allowed in less area but no less than 240 square feet). Any planting area bounded by an impervious surface should be at least ten feet wide. No canopy tree should be planted closer than 5 feet to a sidewalk, paved areas or other impervious surfaces (other types of trees may be closer).
Mebane UDO, Article 6 6-25
February 4, 2008; amended April 7, 2008; amended September 11, 2017; amended July 7, 2019
7. Stabilizing Steep Slopes
All slopes two to one (2:1) and steeper shall be stabilized with permanent slope retention devices or a suitable combination of plantings and retention devices. Slopes greater than three to one (3:1) shall not be stabilized with turf grass (i.e. grasses that are mowed) but with other permanent ground cover such as weeping love grass, low junipers, etc.
8. Screening Parking Areas
Where there is a parking area between the thoroughfare and a non-residential building, streetscaping shall provide a semi-opaque screen or barrier between the right-of-way and the parking area. The screen or barrier may consist of plants, earthen berms, fences, walls, or any combination thereof which meets the following:
(a) The screen shall occupy 75 percent of the length of the parking area except for sidewalks and driveways that cut through the screen to connect the parking area to streets and other properties. Shrubs shall be at least two feet in height above the ground and healthy at the time of installation.
(b) Berms may be used or installed instead of or in addition to plantings. If the berm does not meet the performance standards of this Section, then plant materials shall be installed which meet these performance standards. The installation of additional plant materials is encouraged so as to enhance the visual and aesthetic qualities of the streetscape.
(c) Berms must, at a minimum, be planted with and maintained with a groundcover vegetation or grass that will permanently stabilize the soil.
(d) Shrubs, plantings, hedge, or wall shall provide a screen or barrier for the first three feet of height within three years.
9. Planting Criteria for Steep Slopes adjacent to Rights-of-Way
Where the right-of-way is bounded by slopes steeper than two to one (2:1) or is otherwise not suitable for the planting of street trees, the following standards shall apply:
(a) If natural areas are permitted to be removed and/or graded, the streetscape shall provide a planting strip at a grade no greater than 4 feet horizontal to 1 foot vertical, for street trees at least ten feet wide located parallel to the thoroughfare. All street trees required by this Section shall be located at least 6 feet from the curb or sidewalk.
(b) Existing significant vegetation within thirty feet of and extending to the right-of-way may be used to satisfy the requirements of this Section.
10. (Reserved)
Mebane UDO, Article 6 6-26
February 4, 2008; amended April 7, 2008; amended September 11, 2017; amended July 7, 2019
11. Ownership of Streetscapes
No required streetscape in a residential subdivision shall be wholly owned (in fee simple absolute) by the owner of an individual residential building lot zoned for residential uses unless adequate, legally binding covenants are in place which insure proper maintenance of the areas as a streetscape. Any required buffer or streetscape for a residential development shall not be credited toward meeting the lot size requirements. The preferred method is that the residential streetscape be a separate lot and owned by a separate entity (e.g. homeowners association).
12. No Development within the Required Streetscapes
The required streetscape shall not contain any development, impervious surfaces, or site features that do not function to meet the standards of this Section or that require removal of existing vegetation, as permitted in this Ordinance. No grading, development, or land-disturbing activities shall occur within the streetscape or within the tree protection fence area unless approved by the Zoning Administrator or the City Council. Sidewalks and trails may be placed in streetscapes provided that damage to existing vegetation is minimized.
Access drives and roadways may be permitted within streetscapes. Utilities are not permitted in streetscapes unless no reasonable alternative exists. If utilities are placed in a buffer, they shall be located and installed in a way that minimizes disturbance of the buffer area (for example, installed not parallel but perpendicular or not less than at a 75 degree angle). Streets may not be placed within a buffer except to cross the buffer where necessary to connect to adjoining properties.
E. Tree Survey
1. Purpose and Intent
Preserving existing healthy vegetation on a site during development enhances the visual character of the community by screening and softening the impact of buildings and controlling surface water runoff. The purpose of a tree survey is to identify those areas of vegetation, including specimen trees and significant vegetation, before development plans are so far advanced that it is impractical to modify the plans to protect the vegetation identified to be saved. Preserving specimen trees or significant vegetation on a site should not prevent a particular site from being developed for reasonable uses, given existing zoning.
2. Tree Survey Requirements
A tree survey is prepared by the developer and is a description of the existing vegetation on a site. This is necessary to ensure protection of native ornamental trees and significant vegetation within required protection areas. The survey:
(a) Identifies the native ornamental species and significant vegetation found within the first ten feet of the interior part of the required buffers and other undisturbed areas (This is done to protect this
Mebane UDO, Article 6 6-27
February 4, 2008; amended April 7, 2008; amended September 11, 2017; amended July 7, 2019
vegetation during construction through proper location of tree protection fencing).
(b) Provides a written description of the forest stand(s) and understory vegetation within buffer areas and other undisturbed areas that includes the composition of the tree species typically characteristic of the forest stand and typical size (average diameter at breast height [DBH]), typical spacing between trees and an indication of the general health and vigor of the stand or specimen trees.
(c) Locates all streetscapes and buffers as required under subsections C and D.
(d) Locates all tree protection fencing as required under subsection F, Tree Protection During Construction on landscape plan sheet and grading plan sheet.
(e) Locates all other important natural features influencing site design (including perennial and intermittent streams).
(f) Shows buffers required under other Sections of this Ordinance and other areas proposed for preservation.
(g) Shows other important natural features influencing site design, such as the location of wetlands, rock outcroppings, streams, lakes and other bodies of water should be shown on the survey.
F. Tree Protection During Construction
1. During development of the property, the owner shall be responsible for the erection of barriers necessary to protect any existing or installed vegetation located within the preservation or undisturbed buffer areas from damage both during and after construction.
Tree Protection Fencing
All existing vegetation that is to be preserved, including buffers, shall be fenced with a sturdy and visible fence before grading begins. Fencing of these areas adjacent to existing and proposed roadways is also required. Fencing is required on all City and NCDOT road projects that are adjacent to protected streetscapes or buffers. The fencing must be a minimum 4 feet high and of durable construction and must be placed outside of the drip line of the tree to be protected. Passive forms of tree protection, such as continuous rope or flagging, may be used to delineate tree save areas that are remote from the area of land disturbance.
Both applicant and the Zoning Administrator, in determining the exact location of any tree protection fencing, will consider the existing site conditions. The fence shall be maintained on the site until all site work is completed. It shall be removed before final site inspection for the certificate of occupancy.
Mebane UDO, Article 6 6-28
February 4, 2008; amended April 7, 2008; amended September 11, 2017; amended July 7, 2019
Tree Protection Zone Signs
Tree Protection Zone signs must be installed on the tree protection fence visible on all sides of the fenced in area (minimum one on each side and/or every 300 linear feet).
G. Landscaping for Parking Areas
1. Purposes
The requirements of this subsection are intended to ensure attractive views of a property from streets and adjacent properties; to block views of parking lots from the adjacent rights-of-way, to moderate temperatures of impervious areas and abate glare from parking lots or service areas; to filter automotive exhaust; and to encourage the preservation of stands of existing trees.
2. Landscaping requirements in parking areas:
(a) Within the parking area: All parking areas must have at least one canopy tree trunk within 60 feet of each parking space. Two understory trees may be used instead of one canopy tree only if overhead or underground utility lines will impair the canopy tree's growth to mature habit. (Amended December 5, 2011)
(b) Screening the parking area: All parking areas shall be screened from adjacent properties and streets by evergreen plantings that will attain a height of three feet within three years. The use of shrubs and ground covers is encouraged in parking area islands and along the borders of parking areas.
3. Existing vegetation
Existing healthy, well-formed, canopy trees may be counted toward the requirements of this subsection, provided that these trees are protected, in accordance with subsection F, before and during development of the site and maintained after development in a healthy growing condition.
4. Design standards
The design of the parking area with landscaped areas, and the selection of plant materials, shall meet the standards noted below. Parking area trees are in addition to required streetscape trees.
(a) All parking spaces shall be within 60 feet of the trunk of a canopy tree, or 30 feet from small trees if needed due to overhead utilities or with special circumstances. There shall be a minimum of one canopy tree every 2,500 square feet and one understory tree every 1400 square feet of parking area.
(b) All planting medians and/or islands in parking areas should be at least ten feet long by ten feet wide with a minimum of 300 square feet of space per canopy tree where these trees are proposed. This dimension must be measured from the back of the curbs. Linear planting strips between the length of parking isles are strongly
Mebane UDO, Article 6 6-29
February 4, 2008; amended April 7, 2008; amended September 11, 2017; amended July 7, 2019
encouraged rather than numerous small one tree islands. If linear planting strips are used then the distance of parking spaces from a trunk of a canopy tree may be increased to 70 feet.
(c) A minimum 10 foot wide continuous planted median shall be installed in off-street parking areas approximately every 250 linear feet in one direction for vehicular surface areas exceeding 75,000 square feet. Other design options may be approved provided that the intent of breaking up large areas of parking is met.
(d) All sidewalks shall be at least 6 feet from the trunks of canopy trees, unless otherwise approved by the Zoning Administrator. For example, when the placement of the sidewalk would require the removal of an existing canopy tree to meet this requirement or where there is not enough space on the site to accommodate both the tree and the sidewalk this requirement may be modified.
(e) Parking lots shall be graded so that landscape islands do not impound water, unless surface impoundment is required as a method of on-site retention of stormwater. Landscape islands should be thoroughly cultivated and amended so as to support healthy plant growth.
(f) Preservation of existing groups or stands of trees, as well as isolated islands with single trees, is strongly encouraged (see subsection I, Incentives)

(h) Evergreen shrubs shall be at least 24 inches in height and minimum three-gallon container size at the time of installation.
(i) Adequate drainage and mulching shall be provided for landscaped medians and islands.
(j) The property owner or developer shall provide for continuous maintenance of the landscaped areas after occupancy of the building. The property owner shall ensure that performance criteria within this ordinance and/or included on the approved development plan are met. Failure to correct deficiencies in a timely manner shall result in a citation for violation of this Ordinance.
(k) Parking lots shall be designed and constructed so as to prevent vehicles from striking trees or overhanging shrubs.
(l) The size of the planting area and size of plant material at maturity shall allow for a 2.5-foot vehicle overhang from the face back of the curb. Barriers, such as curbs or wheel stops, shall be provided between parking lots and loading areas and landscaped areas.
Mebane UDO, Article 6 6-31
February 4, 2008; amended April 7, 2008; amended September 11, 2017; amended July 7, 2019
H. Other Landscape Requirements
1. Required Foundation Plantings for Nonresidential Buildings
With the exception of buildings in the B-1 Central Business District, foundation plantings are required on all non-loading and non-service sides of non-residential buildings unless an exception is approved by the Zoning Administrator. If deemed appropriate, the Zoning Administrator may allow the use of planter boxes for permanent vegetation.
2. Standards for New Planting
Canopy trees shall be at least 10 feet high above ground level and a minimum of two and one-half inches in caliper, and understory trees shall be at least 8 feet high above ground level and a minimum of 2 inches in caliper at the time of installation, and shall have an expected mature height based on the buffer type. All shrubs shall be healthy, measure at least 24 inches above ground level and shall reach the height required for performance within five years after installation.
3. Easements
Nothing shall be planted or installed within an underground or overhead utility easement or a drainage easement without the consent of the City and the easement holder at the time of site plan approval.
4. Design standards for Berms
All berms used in a perimeter buffer (or in a streetscape or streetfront landscape area) shall meet all of the following design standards:
(a) The slope of all berms shall not exceed a 2:1 ratio (horizontal to vertical), shall have a top width at least one-half the berm height, and a maximum height of 4 feet above the toe (top) of the berm. The Zoning Administrator shall approve all berms. Berms proposed to be greater than four feet in height may be permitted if deemed appropriate by the Zoning Administrator.
(b) Proposed berms to be placed over an existing or proposed utility easement(s) shall be approved by the Zoning Administrator;
(c) All berms, regardless of size, shall be stabilized with a ground cover or other suitable vegetation;
(d) Berms shall be vegetated as required by this subsection. Berms must be stabilized with ground cover to prevent erosion and sedimentation. It is strongly discouraged to use berms as a substitute for existing healthy vegetation. However, if berms are allowed to replace existing vegetation which already meets the standards in this Section then they must also meet the buffer standards and must be approved by the Zoning Administrator; and
(e) Berms shall in no case damage the roots of existing healthy vegetation designated to be preserved.
Mebane UDO, Article 6 6-32
February 4, 2008; amended April 7, 2008; amended September 11, 2017; amended July 7, 2019
5. Screening of Stormwater Devices
Culverts, rip rap structures, holding ponds, and other stormwater-related devices must be landscaped to reduce their visual impacts. This landscape screening must consist of evergreen plantings and be part of the approved landscape plan.
6. Designated Utility Corridor
In order to reduce the damage to root systems of existing vegetation within streetscapes, buffers or any other tree save areas, designation of planned utility connection corridors is required to be shown on all development plans to coordinate the location of electrical, telephone, cable and other similar utilities.
I. Incentives
1. Purpose
The purpose of this section is to allow alternative ways to meet the standards set forth in this ordinance. This subsection provides flexibility provided that the overall intent of this Section is met. These incentives are discretionary and are subject to approval of the Zoning Administrator.
2. Incentives
The following incentives are provided to encourage the preservation of existing healthy vegetation and innovation in site design. The Zoning Administrator may approve use of these incentives unless otherwise noted.
(a) Existing healthy vegetation and the area of land used to maintain the vegetation may be counted towards meeting the performance criteria for buffers, streetscapes, and parking areas set out in subsections C, Perimeter Buffers and subsection G, Landscaping for Parking Areas.
(b) A five to twenty percent reduction in the number of parking spaces required on the site shall be allowed to the extent that the reduction in the amount of required pavement will: (i) preserve existing healthy trees in an undisturbed natural condition, or (ii) allow an existing development to retrofit parking to conform to these regulations. The amount of reduction can be determined only after taking any unique site conditions and the impact of the reduction on parking needs for the use into account and must be agreed upon by both the applicant and the Zoning Administrator.
(c) City Council may reduce the width of streetscapes required under subsection D, Streetscape Landscaping and buffers under subsection C, Perimeter Buffers. Buffer reductions between uses may be considered based on the use of innovative site/building design concepts. Council may make exceptions to the minimum buffer widths for developments within the downtown area and for redevelopment sites. Reducing widths of streetscapes and buffers should be done only when meeting the required width prevents reasonable use of the property based on the zoning and/or
Mebane UDO, Article 6 6-33
February 4, 2008; amended April 7, 2008; amended September 11, 2017; amended July 7, 2019
additional existing healthy vegetation or open space is provided elsewhere on the site.
(d) The area used for preserving existing healthy vegetation (specimen trees preferred) interior to the site may be used as credits for required perimeter buffers and/or interior buffers at a rate of 1.5 times. For example, if the area taken up by the preserved vegetation is 1,200 square feet then the applicant may remove an area equal to 1,800 square feet elsewhere and/or grade into required existing buffer areas an area equal to 1,800 square feet.
(e) Interior buffer areas may be relocated provided (i) the square footage of area is relocated elsewhere on site (preferably to save more existing vegetation) and (ii) parking lot landscape areas are designed in a combined linear fashion instead of small isolated pockets.
J. Mechanical, Utility, and Trash Containment Areas
1. Mechanical and Utility Equipment in Nonresidential Developments
Heating, ventilation, air conditioning, and other mechanical and utility equipment, which is located on, beside, or adjacent to any building or development shall be fully screened from the view of streets and adjacent property. The screen shall exceed the height of the equipment, shall not interfere with the operation of the equipment, and shall use building materials and design which are compatible with those used for the exterior of the principal building. Where mechanical and utility equipment is [are] located on the roof of a structure, all devices will be fully screened from the view of streets or adjacent property after grading or other improvements are made outside or adjacent to the site.
Utility equipment and facilities associated with on-site electric, cable, telephone, gas or other similar utility shall be screened, to the extent possible, with evergreen plantings or other acceptable alternative approved by the Zoning Administrator. It is noted that certain areas around this equipment and facilities must remain clear based on each utility company's guidelines.
2. Trash Containment Areas
All trash containment devices, including compactors and dumpsters, shall be located and designed so as not to be visible from the view of adjacent streets and properties. If the device is not visible from off the site, then it need not be screened. The type of screening used shall be determined based on the proposed location of the trash containment area, existing site conditions, and the type and amount of existing and proposed vegetation on the site. All trash containment devices shall meet the following standards:
(a) All trash containment areas shall be enclosed so as to not be seen off-site and be enclosed with solid gates to contain windblown litter.
Mebane UDO, Article 6 6-34
February 4, 2008; amended April 7, 2008; amended September 11, 2017; amended July 7, 2019
(b) The enclosure shall be at least 8 feet tall or 2 feet taller than (whichever is greater) the highest point of the compactor or dumpster.
(c) The enclosure shall be made of a material that is opaque and compatible with the design and materials of the principal building. The preferable material is masonry with solid metal gates; however, wood and other similar material may be used as long as the material used protects the enclosure from damage caused by unloading the trash container.
(d) All compactors and dumpsters shall be placed on a concrete pad that is large enough to provide adequate support and allows for positive drainage.
(e) The enclosure shall contain gates to allow for access and security (gates must be maintained in good working order).
K. Time for Installation of Required Landscaping
1. Time Limit
All landscaping, including mulching and seeding shall be completed in accordance with the approved development plan before a certificate of occupancy for the site is issued unless the Zoning Administrator grants an exception. If an exception is granted, a performance bond or other type of security is required to ensure required landscaping will be done at a predetermined later date. The amount of the bond shall be two times the cost of the plant material yet to be installed, based on the highest estimate received.
2. Extensions and Exceptions
Extensions and exceptions to the above time limit may be granted under the following conditions:
(a) Unusual environmental conditions, such as drought, ice, over-saturated soil, or inappropriate planting season for the plant species (plantings between June through August are strongly discouraged).
(b) Substitution or unavailability of plant species or acceptable plant size as specified on the site plan.
(c) Circumstances beyond the developer's or property owner's control, such as incomplete construction or utility work to occur in a proposed landscaped area within 30 days after expected site completion.
L. Implementation of Landscape Plan; Inspections
1. Inspections before Certificate of Occupancy: The Zoning Administrator shall inspect the site before the issuance of a permanent certificate of occupancy for the development and shall not issue the permanent
Mebane UDO, Article 6 6-35
February 4, 2008; amended April 7, 2008; amended September 11, 2017; amended July 7, 2019
Certificate of Occupancy if the landscaping required under this Section is not living or healthy or is not installed in accordance with the standards set forth in this Section and in accordance with the approved site plan.
M. Maintenance Responsibility
1. In order for any landscaping and screening to fulfill the purpose for which it was established, it must be properly maintained. The owner of the property and any tenant on the property where screening is required will be jointly and severally responsible for the maintenance of all landscaping and screening materials required under this Ordinance. Maintenance includes actions necessary to keep screening materials healthy, neat and orderly in appearance and free of litter and debris.
2. The landscaping and screening requirements of this Ordinance are intended to be performance-oriented and the failure of trees and planting materials to achieve adequate growth and development shall constitute noncompliance. All screening and landscaping areas must be protected from damage by motor vehicles or pedestrians which could reduce the effectiveness of the screening.
3. Any dead, unhealthy, or missing vegetation, or vegetation disfigured by severe or excessive pruning, shall be replaced with locally adapted vegetation that conforms to the standards of this Ordinance and the approved site and/or subdivision plan. In the case of removal of existing original vegetation from required vegetation protection areas, the replacement requirements of subsection O below shall apply.
4. In the event that any vegetation or physical element functioning to meet the standards of this Ordinance is severely damaged due to an unusual weather occurrence or natural catastrophe, or other natural occurrence such as damage by wild or domestic animals, the owner may be required to replant if the buffer standards are not being met. The owner shall have one growing season to replace or replant after reconstruction is complete. The Zoning Administrator shall consider the type and location of the landscape buffer or required vegetation area as well as the propensity for natural revegetation in making a determination on the extent of replanting requirements.
5. Any appeals of the Zoning Administrators decision relating to the amount of required revegetation shall be made to the City Council within ten days following the notice of decision, and the City Council shall consider reduction requests at the next available regular meeting.
6. All required buffers, streetscapes, vehicular use areas, and other landscaped areas shall be free of refuse and debris, shall be treated for pest/diseases in accordance with the approved site and/or subdivision plan, and shall be maintained so as to prevent mulch, straw, dirt, or other materials from washing onto streets and sidewalks.
7. The owner should take actions to protect trees and landscaping from unnecessary damage during all facility and site maintenance operations. Plants must be maintained in a way that does not obstruct sight distances
Mebane UDO, Article 6 6-36
February 4, 2008; amended April 7, 2008; amended September 11, 2017; amended July 7, 2019
at roadway and drive intersections, obstruct traffic signs or devices, and/or interfere with the use of sidewalks or pedestrian trails. Viable plants shall not be removed, damaged, cut or severely pruned so that their natural form is impaired (shrubs within existing vehicle use areas and streetscapes may be pruned, but must maintain the minimum required height).
8. In the event that existing required vegetation located within any required buffers, streetscapes, vehicular use or other landscape areas poses an immediate or imminent threat to improved structures on private or public property, severe pruning and/or removal of the vegetation is allowable provided prior approval from the Zoning Administrator is obtained, and the performance standard of the landscape area is maintained consistent with this Ordinance.
9. Unapproved removal of vegetation and/or severe or excessive pruning in non-emergency situations will result in a violation of this Ordinance.
10. The owner of the property on which a required fence or wall is located shall maintain the fence or wall in a safe and attractive condition. This shall mean the following:
(a) No fence or wall shall have more than 20 percent of its surface area with disfigured, cracked, ripped or peeling paint or other material;
(b) A fence or wall shall not stand with bent or broken supports, including loose or missing appendages; and
(c) Fences and walls shall be plumb (vertical) to the ground.
N. Replacement of Disturbed and Damaged Vegetation
1. The disturbance or damage of vegetation within any required buffers, streetscapes, vehicular use areas, or other landscape areas required by this Ordinance, or by zoning condition, shall constitute a violation of this Ordinance.
2 The natural death of existing vegetation within any required landscape area does not constitute a violation and would not require revegetation to replace the plant material unless the required landscape area no longer achieves the required performance standards of this Ordinance.
3. All disturbed or damaged landscaped areas and natural vegetation shall be replanted so as to meet the standards of this Ordinance, as well as the approved site and/or subdivision plat, if applicable. A replacement planting plan shall be submitted for review and approval by the Zoning Administrator prior to replacement. This plan will ensure proper replacements are made.
In situations where existing required vegetation on a developed site or vacant site with an approved site and/or subdivision plat has been removed or damaged in violation of this Ordinance, the Zoning Administrator may require that the entire site be reviewed and revegetated consistent with the current provisions of this Ordinance.
Mebane UDO, Article 6 6-37
February 4, 2008; amended April 7, 2008; amended September 11, 2017; amended July 7, 2019
O. Failure to Comply
Failure to substantially comply with the standards and requirements of Section 6-3, including the maintenance of required landscaping materials and replacement of damaged vegetation shall result in the revocation of the zoning or special use permit. Permit revocation shall follow with the procedures delineated in Section 11-6.
6-4 Parking, Stacking, and Loading
6-4.1 General Requirements
1. Parking, Stacking and Loading Space Required

For enlargements, modifications, or increase in capacity, the requirements of this Section shall apply only to such enlargements, modifications or increases in capacity. Parking requirements for uses in the B-1 Central Business District shall be reviewed on a case-by-case basis and deviations in the number of required parking spaces may be made in accordance with the provisions of Section 6-4.3, E.
2. Required Number
The minimum number of required off-street parking, stacking and loading spaces is indicated in subsection 6-4.3 (parking and stacking) and subsection 6-4.7 (loading). In cases of mixed occupancy, the minimum number of off-street parking, stacking and loading spaces shall be the cumulative total of individual use requirements unless otherwise specified.
3. Handicapped Spaces
Spaces for the physically handicapped shall be provided as required by the NC Building Code, Volume I-C and the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990.
4. Minimum Number of Parking Spaces
In all instances, except for residential and accessory uses, where less than five off-street parking spaces is required by Table 6-4-1, a minimum of five parking spaces shall be provided.
5. Reduction of Minimum Requirements
Unless there is a change in use requiring fewer spaces, the number of spaces shall not be reduced below the minimum requirements of this Article.
6. Maintenance
All parking, stacking and loading facilities shall be permanently maintained by the owners or occupants as long as the use they serve exists.
7. Access
All parking, stacking and loading facilities shall have vehicular access to a public street or approved private street.
8. Use for No Other Purpose
Land used to provide required parking, stacking, and loading shall not be used for any other purposes, except for authorized temporary events. If such land is
Mebane UDO, Article 6 6-38
February 4, 2008; amended April 7, 2008; amended September 11, 2017; amended July 7, 2019
devoted to any other purpose, the Certificate of Occupancy of the affected principal use shall immediately become void.
9. Compliance with Air Quality Standards
The construction of or modification to (i) open parking lots containing 1,500 or more spaces or (ii) parking decks and garages containing 750 or more spaces shall comply with the concentrated air emissions standards of the NC Division of Environmental Management.
10. Parking of Vehicles in Residential Districts
Parking vehicles in excess of one ton rated capacity shall be prohibited in a residential zoning district except for loading and unloading purposes, for emergency home service, or for use in the conduct of a legal nonconforming use; and then parking of such vehicles shall be permitted only on the property occupied by the legal nonconforming use. In no case shall parking of such a vehicle be permitted on the street.
11. On-street Parking Restrictions
See Chapter 34 of the City of Mebane Code of Ordinances for specific regulations regarding parking restrictions on public streets, including prohibitions against the on-street parking or storage of certain types of motor vehicles and the on-street parking of oversized motor vehicles.
6-4.2 Parking Requirements for Change in Use
If a change in use causes an increase in the required number of off-street parking, stacking or loading spaces, such additional spaces shall be provided in accordance with the requirements of this Ordinance; except that if the change in use would require an increase of less than five percent in the required number of parking spaces, no additional off-street parking shall be required.
6-4.3 Number of Parking and Stacking Spaces Required
A. The minimum number of required off-street parking and stacking spaces is indicated in Table 6-4-1. However, in no event shall a nonresidential use or the nonresidential component of a mixed use development provide more than 120 percent of the minimum parking spaces established in Table 6.4.1 except through the approval by the Zoning Administrator of a parking demand study, prepared by a qualified professional, which demonstrates the need for parking spaces in excess of 120 percent of the minimum requirement established in Table 6-4-1.
B. Whenever the number of parking spaces required by Table 6-4-1 results in a requirement of a fractional space, any fraction of one-half or less may be disregarded while a fraction in excess of one-half shall be counted as one parking space.
Mebane UDO, Article 6 6-39
February 4, 2008; amended April 7, 2008; amended September 11, 2017; amended July 7, 2019
C. For any use not specifically listed in Table 6-4-1, the parking and stacking requirements shall be those of the most similar listed use, as determined by the Zoning Administrator.
D. All developments in all zoning districts shall provide a sufficient number of parking spaces to accommodate the number of vehicles that ordinarily are likely to be attracted to the development in question.
E. The City Council recognizes that, due to the particularities of any given development, the inflexible application of the parking standards set forth in Table 6-4-1 may result in a development either with inadequate parking space or parking space far in excess of its needs. Therefore, the permit-issuing authority may permit deviations from the requirements of Table 6-4-1 and may require more parking or allow less parking whenever it finds that such deviations are more likely to satisfy the general standard delineated in subsection D above. The permit-issuing authority may allow deviations, for example, when it finds that a residential development is irrevocably oriented toward the elderly, disabled or other population that demonstrates a lesser parking need or when it finds that a business or service is primarily oriented to walk-in trade. The permit-issuing authority may also, for example, require additional overflow or visitor parking in cases where the proposed lot sizes are such that anticipated parking needs for occasional visitors can not be accommodated on individual lots. Whenever the permit-issuing authority allows or requires a deviation from the requirements of Table 6-4-1, it shall enter on the face of the permit the parking requirement that it imposes and the reasons for allowing or requiring the deviation.

2. Minimize delay and interference with traffic on public streets and access drives;
3. Maximize sight distances from parking lot exits and access drives; and
4. Allow off-street parking spaces in parking lots to have access from parking lot driveways and not directly from streets.
B. Dimensional Requirements
Parking facilities shall be designed and constructed to meet the minimum parking space dimensions, aisle dimensions and other standards found in Table 6-4-2.

(b) Parking areas for tracked heavy construction equipment, skid-mounted equipment and similar equipment, provided they are constructed with an all-weather surface.
4. Parking lots containing 12 or more spaces shall also include curbing and storm drainage facilities. Driveway aprons shall be constructed to extend to the improved roadway. Provided, however, upon application the City Council may waive the requirement of curbing and/or storm drainage facilities where it is clearly demonstrated that curbing would be detrimental to the environment due to erosion or run off concerns or that the strict requirement of curbing and storm drainage would be unduly burdensome and financially not feasible.
5. All facilities shall be graded, properly drained, stabilized and maintained to minimize dust and erosion.
6. All parking spaces and stacking lanes shall be clearly identified with paint lines, bumper guards, curbs, or similar treatment.
7. All parking spaces shall be provided with wheel guards or curbs located so that no part of the parked vehicle will extend beyond the property line or encroach more than two feet into a required planting area.
8. Concrete pads for stationary refuse containers shall be provided beneath and in the approach to each container.
9. Parking lots shall be designed and constructed such that walkways shall maintain a minimum unobstructed width of four feet (vehicle encroachment is calculated as two feet beyond curb).
6-4.5 Location
1. Off-site Parking Lots
When required off-street parking is permitted to be located off-site, it shall begin within five hundred feet of the zone lot containing the principal use. Required off-street parking shall not be located across an intervening major or minor thoroughfare.

February 4, 2008; amended April 7, 2008; amended September 11, 2017; amended August 13, 2018
2. Parking in Nonresidential Districts
Automobile parking for any use may be provided in any nonresidential district.
3. Nonresidential Parking in Residential Districts
Surface parking in a residential zoning district for any use not permitted in that district is allowed under the following conditions:
1. Property on which the parking is located must abut the lot containing the use that the parking serves. The property must be under the same ownership or subject to a parking encumbrance agreement. All access to such property shall be through nonresidentially-zoned property;
2. Parking shall be used only during daylight hours;
3. Parking shall be used by customers, patrons, employees, guests, or residents of the use that the parking serves;
4. No parking shall be located more than one hundred twenty feet into the residential zoning district.

6. Long-term or dead storage, loading, sales, repair work or servicing of vehicles is prohibited.
7. The parking lot complies with the landscaping and screening requirements of Section 6-3, G.
6-4.6 Combined Parking
1. Separate Uses
The required parking for separate or mixed uses may be combined in one facility.
2. Shared Parking
A maximum of fifty percent of the parking spaces required for a church, theater, auditorium or assembly hall or other similar use may also serve as required spaces for another use located on the same zone lot. Shared spaces may also be located off-site as allowed in Section 6-4.5, A, Off-site Parking Lots. In either case, the Zoning Administrator must determine that the various activities will have peak parking demand at different periods of the day or week. Otherwise, no off-street parking required for one building or use shall be applied toward the requirements of any other building or use. A shared parking plan shall be enforced through a written agreement between the owners of record of all properties involved. The agreement shall be submitted to the Zoning Administrator prior to the issuance of a building permit for any use served by the shared parking area.
3. Reassignment
Required off-street parking spaces shall not be leased or otherwise assigned to another use except as provided in subsection B.

Parking lots shall provide landscaping and screening in accordance with the standards delineated in Section 6-3, G, Landscaping for Parking Areas.
6-4.9 Excessive Illumination in Parking Lots and Loading Areas
Lighting within any parking and loading area that unnecessarily illuminates any other lot and substantially interferes with the use or enjoyment of such other lot is prohibited. Floodlights, spotlights, or any other similar lighting shall not be used to illuminate parking and loading areas.
All parking and loading area lighting shall be designed and located in accordance with the requirements of Section 6-5, Outdoor Lighting.
6-5 Outdoor Lighting
A. General Requirements
1. All exterior lighting, such as that used in and around buildings, recreation areas, parking lots, and signs, shall be designed to protect against the spillover of light to adjacent properties. It shall also be designed to protect against glare onto public rights-of-way thereby impairing the vision of motorists and adjoining properties.
2. All exterior lighting shall be shielded from adjacent properties by thick evergreen vegetated buffers, berms, walls, or fences, and/or the use of directional lighting, lighting shields, special fixtures, timing devices, appropriate light intensities, luminaries, and mountings at appropriate heights.
Mebane UDO, Article 6 6-49
February 4, 2008; amended April 7, 2008; amended September 11, 2017; amended August 13, 2018
3. Exterior lighting shall be architecturally integrated with the buildings style, materials, and colors in the selection and design of light poles, brackets, and fixtures.
B. Lighting Plan Required
1. A lighting plan indicating illumination intensities shall be submitted with site plans and subdivision plats. The Zoning Administrator is authorized to waive this requirement for small independent development projects on less than an acre if the fixture types are specified on the site plan or plat.
2. Any changes to the lighting plan must be approved by the Zoning Administrator through a site and/or subdivision plat revision.
C. Exterior Lighting Standards
1. General standards:
(a) Outdoor lighting shall be designed, located and mounted at heights no greater than:
(1) 18 feet above grade for non-cut-off lights.
(2) 35 feet above grade for cut-off lights.
(b) All outdoor lighting shall be designed and located such that the maximum illumination measured in foot candles at a property line shall not exceed 0.4 for non cut-off lights and 1.5 for cut-off lights. Cut-off lighting shall be designed to direct light downward (e.g., shoe box style).
(c) For parking lots, the minimum light level shall be no less than 0.2 foot-candles. The average foot-candle maintained to the minimum foot-candles ratio shall be no greater than 4:1 (upper to lower limits).
(d) All outdoor lighting fixtures shall be located a minimum of 10 feet from a property or right-of-way line and should not be within a required perimeter buffer or streetscape unless it is located at the interior edge.
(e) A lighting plan is required for site plan approval for all but single family residential developments.
(f) Floodlights, spotlights or any other similar lighting shall not be used to illuminate buildings or other site features unless approved as an integral architectural element on the development plan. On-site lighting may be used to accent architectural elements and not be used to illuminate entire portions of building(s).
2. Lighting for Canopies
Mebane UDO, Article 6 6-50
February 4, 2008; amended April 7, 2008; amended September 11, 2017; amended August 13, 2018

6-7 Recreation and Open Space Requirements
The City Council declares the purposes and intent of the recreational and open space regulations adopted and prescribed in this Section to be as follows:
 To provide adequate active recreational areas and passive open space;
 To encourage the preservation of existing trees and vegetation;
 To encourage the retention of environmentally fragile areas;
 To encourage the protection of air and water quality;
 To enhance flood control; and
 To provide higher quality development.
6-7.1 Minimum Public Recreational Space Requirements
The subdivider of land for residential purposes shall be required to dedicate a portion of land or pay a fee in lieu thereof for public recreational development to serve the needs of the residents of the subdivision or development. The decision to accept a land dedication or an in lieu of fee rests solely with the City Council.
A. All residential subdivisions of 6 or more lots shall provide, through reservation or dedication, recreational space as required in subsection B. or pay a fee in lieu thereof in accordance with the provisions of subsection F. The requirements of Section 6-7.1 shall be applicable to each of the following types of residential development:
1. Traditional detached single-family, attached single-family, two-family, and manufactured home subdivisions.
2. Residential cluster developments.
3. Townhouse developments.
4. Patio home developments.
5. Condominium developments.
6. Individual residential components of a Planned Unit Development or a Traditional Neighborhood Development that include the subdivision of property for sale to individual owners.
7. Subdivided developments that include live/work combination dwellings.
B. At least 1/35 of an acre shall be dedicated or reserved for each dwelling unit proposed in the subdivision plat or development plan, except that any land to be dedicated that lies within a Flood Hazard Area or that has slopes greater than 15 percent shall be dedicated at a rate of at least 1/20 of an acre per dwelling unit.
The following example illustrates the practical application of this formula for a proposed 25-lot single-family subdivision where the average acreage per lot equals one-third acre:
Mebane UDO, Article 6 6-68
February 4, 2008; amended April 7, 2008; amended September 11, 2017; amended August 13, 2018
Formula Example
Total number of proposed dwellings 25 dwellings
multiplied by X
0.0285714 acres per dwelling 1,244.57 square feet
equals equals
Public recreational area required 31,114.25 square feet or 0.71-acre
In this example, a proposed 25-lot residential subdivision would be required to provide a minimum 0.71-acre of public recreational space.
C. Multifamily and two-family residential developments do not have to comply with the recreational dedication requirements of Section 6-7.1 unless the dwelling units are constructed for the purpose of sale to individual owners. Multifamily developments and two-family developments that do not include dwelling units for sale to individual owners shall provide private recreational space in accordance with Sections 6-7.2, C. and D, respectively.
D. Manufactured home parks shall provide private recreational space in accordance with Section 6-7.2, C.
E. The criteria for evaluating the suitability of proposed recreational areas shall include, but not be limited to, the following as determined by the City Council in consultation with the Director of the Mebane Recreation and Parks Department.
1. Unity. The dedicated land shall be a single parcel except where it is determined that two or more parcels would be in the public interest. The City Council may require that the parcels be connected and may also require a path at least thirty feet in width in addition to the land requirement.
2. Location. The dedicated land shall be located so as to serve the recreation needs of the immediate neighborhood within the subdivision.
3. Physical Characteristics. The shape, topography and subsoils of the dedicated land shall be such as to be suitable for the intended use.
4. Accessibility. Public access to the dedicated land shall be provided either by an abutting street or public easement. Such public easement shall be at least thirty feet in width.
F. Fees in lieu of dedication. In lieu of the dedication of land as required in subsection B above, a developer may provide funds in the amount of the assessed value of the land required to be dedicated to the City of Mebane. The assessed value shall be the current value of the land as assessed for property tax purposes. The City may use the funds to purchase recreational land or areas to serve the subdivision or development in the immediate area. This may be done in lieu of providing the land required in subsection B above
Mebane UDO, Article 6 6-69
February 4, 2008; amended April 7, 2008; amended September 11, 2017; amended August 13, 2018
if so approved by the City Council. If the City Council determines that a combination dedication and partial payment in lieu of dedication is in the best interest of the citizens of the area to be served, such an arrangement is authorized.
G. Fees in lieu of dedication shall be paid by the subdivider prior to final plat approval or as otherwise approved by the City Council.
H. The City of Mebane planning and zoning jurisdictional area shall be divided into recreational districts for the purpose of distributing funds that are collected from the cash-in-lieu-of-land payments. These funds shall be spent only on capital improvements to city-owned recreational facilities. The expenditure of recreation funds paid by the subdivider to the City in lieu of the dedication of land shall be determined by the City Council
I. The City Council may, in cases of an unusual or exceptional nature, allow adjustments in the dedication requirements established in this Section. Such adjustments shall be reviewed by the Director of the Mebane Recreation and Parks Department and the City Council. An unusual or exceptional nature may include, but not be limited to, land within the development set aside for private recreation or proposed expenditures for recreational facilities or equipment.
J. The dedication of public recreational land shall be reviewed as part of the preliminary plat review process. The subdivider shall designate on the preliminary subdivision plat the area or areas of land proposed to dedicated. Upon receipt of the preliminary plat, the Director of the Mebane Recreation and Parks Department shall review the proposed dedication and shall forward a recommendation as to the acceptance or rejection of the proposed dedication to the City Council.
K. The City Council shall have the authority to accept or reject offers for land dedications made as a requirement of this Section. Land proposed by the developer as public recreational space on a subdivision plat shall be considered to be offered for dedication until such offer is officially accepted by the City Council. The offer may be accepted by the City through:
1. Written acceptance by the City Council; or
2. Written acceptance by an administrative officer designated by the City Council.
L. If the land required for donation in a particular section of a subdivision exceeds the requirement in subsection B above, the difference may be applied to future sections or to any private open space requirements as delineated in Section 6-7.3.
M. At the subdividers request, the City Council may accept a land dedication located elsewhere in the towns jurisdiction in lieu of a land dedication at the site of the proposed development.
Mebane UDO, Article 6 6-70
February 4, 2008; amended April 7, 2008; amended September 11, 2017; amended August 13, 2018
N. After offered land dedications are officially accepted by the City Council, an executed general warranty deed conveying the dedicated land to the City of Mebane and a reproducible and electronic copy of a boundary survey shall be submitted to the City Manager no later than two years after the approval of the preliminary subdivision plat or by the time that 50 percent of the certificates of occupancy have been issued, whichever is earlier. The City Council may grant an extension of time after the initial two years following subdivision plat approval has elapsed.
O. Recreational space that is accepted by the City Council for public dedication shall be identified on the recorded subdivision plat.
6-7.2 Minimum Private Recreational Space Requirements
A. The developer of manufactured home parks and two-family and multifamily developments that include the construction of dwelling units not intended for sale to individual owners shall be required to reserve a portion of land for private recreational development to serve the needs of the residents of the development. The purpose of this requirement is to ensure that unsubdivided residential developments provide adequate active recreational facilities to serve the residents of the development.
B. The following are illustrative of the types of facilities that shall be deemed to serve active recreational needs and therefore count toward compliance with the private recreational space requirements of this Section: tennis courts, racquetball courts, swimming pools, sauna and exercise rooms, meeting or activity rooms with clubhouses, swings, slides, and play apparatus. Each development shall install the types of recreational facilities and equipment that are most likely to be suited to and used by the age bracket of persons likely to reside in the development.

6-7.5 Flexibility in Administration Authorized
A. The requirements set forth in Sections 6-7.1 through 6-7.3 concerning the amount, size, location and nature of open space and recreational space to be provided in connection with residential developments are established by the City Council as standards that presumptively will result in the provision of that amount of open space and recreational space that is consistent with generally recognized standards relating to the need for such areas. The City Council recognizes, however, that due to the particular nature of a tract of land, or the particular type or configuration of development proposed, or other factors, the underlying objectives of the recreational and open space requirements may be achieved even though the standards are not adhered to with mathematical precision. Therefore, the permit-issuing board is authorized to permit minor deviations from these standards whenever it determines that (i) the objectives underlying these standards can be met without strict adherence to them and (ii) because of peculiarities in the developers tract of land or the particular type or configuration of the development proposed, it would be unreasonable to require strict adherence to these standards.
B. Whenever the permit-issuing board authorizes some deviation from the standards set forth in Sections 6-7.1 through 6-7.3 pursuant to subsection A above, the official record of action taken on the development application shall contain a detailed statement of the reasons for allowing the deviation.

SUBDIVISION PROCEDURES AND DESIGN STANDARDS
7-1 PURPOSE AND INTENT
The purpose of this Article is to establish procedures and standards for the development and subdivision of real estate within the corporate limits and extraterritorial jurisdiction of the City of Mebane in an effort to, among other things, insure proper legal description, identification, monumentation and recordation of real estate boundaries; further the orderly layout and appropriate use of the land; provide safe, convenient and economic circulation of vehicular traffic; provide adequate building sites which are readily accessible to emergency vehicles; assure the proper installation of streets and utilities; promote the eventual elimination of unsafe or unsanitary conditions because of undue concentration of population; and help conserve and protect the physical and economic resources of the City of Mebane and its environs.
7-2 REGULATION OF SUBDIVISIONS IN GENERAL

7-6 SUBDIVISION DESIGN STANDARDS
7-6.1 Subdivision Design Standards Purpose
The subdivision design standards, adopted and prescribed in this Section, are found by the City Council to be necessary and appropriate to:
A. Provide for suitable residential and nonresidential developments with adequate streets and utilities and appropriate building sites;
B. Provide for the distribution of population and traffic in a manner which shall avoid congestion and overcrowding;
C. Provide for the coordination of streets within subdivisions with existing or planned streets and with other public facilities;
D. Provide for the dedication or reservation of rights-of-way or easements for street and utility purposes;
E. Provide for the dedication or reservation of adequate spaces for public lands and buildings;
F. Encourage design that is protective of environmental quality and that provides a balance between the built environment and natural and fragile natural resources; and
G. Provide for the dedication or reservation of recreation, park, and open space areas; and
7-6.2 General Subdivision Standards
A. Design
All proposed subdivisions, including group developments where the transfer of building sites to separate owners is proposed, shall comply with this Ordinance, shall be designed to promote beneficial development of the community, and shall bear a reasonable relationship to the approved plans of the City.
B. Development Name
In no case shall the name of a proposed development duplicate or be phonetically similar to an existing development name in the Mebane Planning and Zoning Jurisdiction unless the proposed development lies adjacent or in proximity to the existing
Mebane UDO, Article 7 7-14
February 4, 2008; Amended June 5, 2017
development.
C. Reasonable Relationship
All required improvements, easements, and rights-of-way (other than required reservations) shall substantially benefit the development or bear a reasonable connection to the need for public facilities attributable to the new development.
Whenever a tract to be subdivided includes or adjoins any part of a thoroughfare or collector street as designated by an officially adopted City Thoroughfare Plan, that part of such proposed public right-of-way shall be dedicated as public right-of-way within the subdivision plat in the location and to the width recommended by the Thoroughfare Plan or this Article.
D. Establishment of Private Deed Restrictions
The subdivider is encouraged to prepare and record private deed restrictions (restrictive covenants) to establish development standards to address particular development and land use issues and/or to establish more desirable development standards that exceed the City of Mebane requirements. For example, subdividers may establish deed restrictions that address such issues as architectural design, building materials, minimum building floor area, parking of recreational vehicles, home-based businesses, etc. Deed restrictions are private agreements between the subdivider and lot buyers. Enforcement of deed restrictions is a private matter and is solely the responsibility of the lot owners and/or a property owners association. Deed restrictions cannot be enforced by the City of Mebane. The Zoning Administrator or any other official of the City of Mebane will not be involved in the enforcement of private deed restrictions.
E. Subdivision Signs
Permanent signs announcing the name of a subdivision shall comply with the standards for identification signs delineated in Section 6-6.7, F.
7-6.3 Suitability of the Land
A. Land which the City has determined, either through its own investigations or the investigations of other public agencies, to be unsuitable for development because of flooding, poor drainage, steep slopes, poor soil conditions and other such physical features which may endanger health, life, or property or necessitate the excessive expenditure of public funds for the provision and/or maintenance of public services shall not be approved for subdivision unless methods are formulated by the developer for mitigating the problems created by the subdivision of such land. Areas that have been used for disposal of solid waste shall not be subdivided unless tests by the applicable County Health Department, a structural engineer, and a soils expert determine that the land is suitable for the type of construction proposed.
Mebane UDO, Article 7 7-15
February 4, 2008; Amended June 5, 2017
B. All subdivisions located in public water supply watershed areas shall comply with the requirements and standards of Section 5-2, Watershed Overlay District requirements.
C. All subdivisions located in flood hazard areas shall comply with the requirements of Section 5-3, Flood Hazard Overlay District requirements. Required public utilities and facilities in all subdivisions shall be installed so as to minimize flood damage.
7-6.4 Lot Dimensions and Standards
The size, shape, and orientation of lots shall be appropriate for the location of the proposed subdivision and for the type of development contemplated and shall conform to the following:
A. Conformance to Other Regulations
Every lot shall have sufficient area, dimensions, and street access to permit a principal building to be erected thereon in compliance with all zoning district and other use, density, intensity, and dimensional requirements of this Ordinance (see Article 4, Use Regulations, Density and Dimensional Standards, and Development Standards for Individual Uses). Table 4-2-1 delineates minimum density, intensity, and dimensional requirements for each zoning district.
B. Minimum Buildable Area
Every lot shall have at least forty percent of its total area, or 3,000 square feet, whichever is less, of contiguous buildable area of a shape sufficient to hold a principal building.
C. Lot Line Configuration
Side lines of lots should be at or near right angles or radial to street lines. No intersecting lot lines shall have an angle of less than 60 degrees.
D. Lot Lines and Drainage
Lot boundaries shall coincide with natural and pre-existing man-made drainageways to the extent practicable to avoid lots that can be built upon only by altering such drainageways. Lots shall have a minimum of one percent grade to streets and/or drainageways. The City recognizes that topographical conditions may exist where the requirement may not be practicable. The absolute minimum for such conditions as approved by the City Engineer shall be 0.5 percent. Utility and drainage easements shall be provided as required in Section 7-6.7, G.
E. Lots on Streets with Capacity Deficiencies
1. Major and minor subdivisions shall not be approved that propose individual residential lots with direct vehicular access to streets that have, in the opinion of the City Engineer and NCDOT (if applicable), capacity deficiencies that warrant the prohibition of the platting of lots with direct
Mebane UDO, Article 7 7-16
February 4, 2008; Amended June 5, 2017
vehicular access.
2. Whenever a proposed subdivision abuts any major or minor thoroughfare or a major collector (as delineated on the latest adopted Thoroughfare Plan), the Planning Board, based upon the recommendation of the City Engineer or NCDOT, may prohibit the platting of lots with direct vehicular access to such roads. The Planning Boards decision to require alternative access shall be based upon the need to provide safe access to proposed lots, reduce interference with the existing traffic pattern and flow, and provide buffering of the proposed lots from adverse effects from traffic noise. Whenever a subdivision fronts on an arterial road or highway, the Planning Board may require a marginal access street to provide access to lots fronting on the arterial road or highway.
3. In order to reduce traffic congestion, commercial and industrial subdivisions may be required by the Planning Board, after consultation with the City Engineer or NCDOT, to provide a frontage road or other suitable means of access along major thoroughfares, as shown on the adopted thoroughfare plan, unless the Planning Board determines that no practicable alternative for access exists. Where a frontage road is required, intersections with public streets shall be spaced no closer than 800 feet. Frontage roads may be permitted within the rights-of- way of existing streets subject to the approval of the City Engineer or the NCDOT, as applicable.
4. Access to lots in proposed subdivisions located in HCO, Highway Corridor Overlay Districts shall comply with the requirements of Section 5-6, Highway Corridor Overlay District Requirements.
5. Subdivisions that propose lot layouts such that buildings will front on an interior street and which will have rear yards directly adjacent to major thoroughfare roads shall provide a minimum 30- foot wide Type B streetscape that complies with the planting requirements of Section 6-3, D, adjacent to the major thoroughfare road.
F. Access Requirements
All lots must have public street access and frontage meeting the requirements set forth in Section 4-4, B. The following exceptions may be approved:
1. Lots and units located in developments with Owners' Associations or in group developments in which permanent access is guaranteed by means of approved private streets and/or drives designed in accordance with the requirements of Section 7-6.5, H.
Mebane UDO, Article 7 7-17
February 4, 2008; Amended June 5, 2017

(a) A flag lot shall serve only one single-family dwelling and its uninhabited accessory structures;
(b) The maximum flagpole length shall be 300 feet;
(c) The minimum flagpole width shall be 25 feet;
(d) The maximum lot size in areas with public sewer shall be one acre. The maximum lot size without public sewer shall be three acres. (Note: the flagpole portion of the lot is not used to calculate area, width, depth, coverage, and setbacks of the lot or to provide off-street parking);
(e) The minimum separation between the flagpole portion of the lot and that of another flag lot shall be 150 feet;
(f) Where public water is available, any building on the flag lot must be within 500 feet of a hydrant. This distance shall be measured along the street, then along the flagpole, then in a straight line to the building location;
(g) Use of a single driveway to serve a flag lot and an adjoining lot is permitted and encouraged. The preferred location for the driveway is on the flagpole portion of the flag lot, with the conventional lot granted an access easement over the flagpole;
(h) No resubdivision of a flag lot shall be permitted unless access to the proposed new lot(s) can be provided from an approved public or private street; and
(i) Flag lots shall be approved only where the configuration of the parcel or site features warrant such a lot design. Authorizing a flag lot design is intended to accommodate a particular extenuating circumstance which makes traditional lot design infeasible. Therefore, flag lots should be judiciously approved.
G. Water and Sewage Disposal
1. Every subdivision lot intended for building purposes shall be served by a water supply system and a sewage disposal system that (i) is adequate to accommodate the reasonable
Mebane UDO, Article 7 7-18
February 4, 2008; Amended June 5, 2017
needs of the proposed use of the lot and (ii) complies with all applicable city water and sewer requirements and/or county health department regulations.
2. Water and sewer systems shall be designed in accordance with all city and state requirements, the City of Mebane Standard Design Details prepared by the City Engineer, and the requirements of this Ordinance.

C. Street Access to Adjoining Property
1. Where, upon the recommendation of the TRC and City Engineer and the approval of the Planning Board, it is desirable to provide for street access to adjoining property, proposed subdivision streets shall be extended, dedicated, and, where appropriate, constructed to the boundary of such property. It is the intention of this section to promote the orderly development of a local street system that provides interconnection between developed or developing properties.
2. Factors that shall be evaluated when considering requiring the extension of streets or street rights-of-way to adjoining property include:
(a) the development potential of the adjoining land;
(b) the physiographical and man-made characteristics of the adjoining property, and
(c) the existing and proposed local street system and traffic flow of the entire area surrounding the subdivided tract and adjoining properties.
3. Generally, stub streets shall be required:
(a) where the zoning and/or land use on the adjoining property are compatible with the proposed subdivision,
(b) where there are no natural or man-made barriers that make the street extension impracticable,
(c) where the street extension will result in desirable traffic flows and patterns and where inappropriate levels of through traffic are avoided, and
(d) where the street extension will promote the overall orderly development of the area.
4. All stub streets shall be designed and, where required to be built, constructed in accordance with the appropriate standards as delineated in this Article.

undisturbed peak hour vehicle trips or 1,000 or more undisturbed
average daily trips (ADT), based on trip generation rates from the latest edition of the Institute of Transportation Engineers (ITE) Trip Generation Manual. A traffic impact study may be required for applications for preliminary plat, rezoning requests, or special use requests that rely upon roads experiencing congestion or safety concerns, as determined by the Technical Review Committee. The Technical Review Committee may use its discretion to waive the requirement to conduct a traffic impact study.
B. Study scope
When a traffic study is required, the City shall determine the type and
scope of the study jointly during a meeting with the applicant. The
Planning Director may also involve representatives of, or request assessments from, other agencies or departments. The elements to be determined during the scoping session shall include:
1. Definition of impact area
The points of access and key streets and intersections that may be affected by development of the subject tract constitute the impact area. Traffic recorder and turning movement assessment locations shall also be determined.
Mebane UDO, Article 7 7-38
February 4, 2008; Amended June 5, 2017

3. Analysis scenarios
Scenarios for analysis shall include existing conditions, and opening year with (Build) and without (No Build) development.
4. Assumptions
Trip generation and distribution assumptions including trip generation categories, diversion assumptions and distribution assumptions. Assumed rate of growth in background traffic, and developments in the area that have been approved or are under review shall also be included.
C. Traffic study elements
Where required during the scoping meeting, the following details shall be required:
1. Existing condition survey
(a) Street system description
The street system shall be described, including geometric features, lane usage, traffic control, signage, sight distances, and adjacent uses and curb cuts.
(b) Traffic volumes
Existing traffic volumes shall be provided for the impact area, including both average annual daily traffic (AADT) and peak hour volumes. AADT may be derived from current counts of the NCDOT, where available, and peak hour volumes shall be provided from field counts. Data shall be adjusted for daily and seasonal variations. Turning movement counts for peak hour shall be provided for critical intersections.
(c) Capacity analysis
Existing capacity of signalized and unsignalized intersections.
(d) Other details
Other details may be required at the discretion of the City depending upon the type and scale of the project. These may include, but are not limited to, queue length analysis, pedestrian counts, accident data or crash rates, bicycle and pedestrian access, traffic speeds (both 50th and 85th percentile), and stopping distances.
2. Future without development
Capacity analysis shall be based on the Highway Capacity
Mebane UDO, Article 7 7-39
February 4, 2008; Amended June 5, 2017
Manual or other methodology approved in advance by the City.
3. Future with development
(a) Projections of peak hour traffic generation shall be made using the latest edition of the ITE Trip Generation Manual, unless the City determines that locally-derived data will provide more accurate forecasts. Data from similar facilities may be used where the information is not available from ITE.
(b) Special analysis may be required to determine the need for signalization, minimum safe sight distances, gap analysis, turning radius requirements, queue length analysis, turning lane length analysis, curb cut locations or similar requirements.
D. Mitigation plan
Where the analysis indicates that the project will create deficiencies in the impact area, improvements shall be recommended, along with projected cost estimates. The design of improvements shall be in accordance with the City of Mebane or the NCDOT, as appropriate. Where a mitigation plan is not adequate to address the traffic impacts of the project, it may serve as a basis for denial of the rezoning, preliminary plat, site plan or Planned Development request.
E. Consultants
The City may require that an independent consultant be hired by the City to perform the required studies, or to review all or part of a study prepared by the applicant's consultant. The City is authorized to administer the contract for any such consultant.
1. The City shall determine the scope of services to be performed by the independent consultant and receive a cost estimate of such services.
2. The applicant shall provide an amount equal to the estimate to the City, who shall deposit the amount in an escrow or other special account set up for this purpose. Any funds not used shall be returned to the applicant in a timely manner, without interest.

An appeal from any final order or decision of the Zoning Administrator may be taken to the Board of Adjustment by any person with standing under G.S. 160A-393(d) or the City may appeal a decision to the board of adjustment The appeal system established in this Ordinance provides for a review of cases in which a decision or interpretation made by the Zoning Administrator is alleged to be erroneous. For example, an appeal may contest the Zoning Administrators decision regarding whether a particular use is permissible within a particular zoning district or the Zoning Administrators interpretation of the methodology for calculating maximum permissible sign surface area.
B. The notice of appeal, stating the grounds for the appeal, is filed with the city clerk. G.S. 160A-388(b1)(1). An appeal must be taken within thirty days after the date of the decision or order appealed from.
C. Whenever an appeal is filed, the Zoning Administrator shall forthwith transmit to the Board of Adjustment all the papers constituting the record relating to the action appealed from.
D. An appeal of a notice of violation or other enforcement order stays enforcement of the action appealed from unless the official who made the decision certifies to the board of adjustment after notice of appeal has been filed that because of the facts stated in an affidavit, a stay would cause imminent peril to life or property or because the violation is transitory in nature, a stay would seriously interfere with enforcement of the ordinance. In that case, enforcement proceedings shall not be stayed except by a restraining order, which may be granted by a court. If enforcement proceedings are not stayed, the appellant may file with the official a request for an expedited hearing of the appeal, and the board of adjustment shall meet to hear the appeal within 15 days after such a request is filed.
E. The Board of Adjustment may reverse or affirm (wholly or partly) or may modify the order, requirement or decision or determination appealed from and shall make any order, requirement, decision or determination that in its opinion ought to be made in the case before it. To this end, the Board of Adjustment shall have all the powers of the officer from whom the appeal is taken. Board of Adjustment action on appeal requests shall comply with the voting requirements of Section 8-8 A.
F. Evidentiary hearing procedures for appeal requests are delineated in Section 8-6. Hearing notice requirements are outlined in Section 8-7.

February 4, 2008, amended May 12, 2014
or interpretations of the Zoning Administrator may be appealed to the Board of Adjustment.
H. The administrative official who made the decision shall give written notice by personal delivery, electronic mail, or first-class mail to the owner of the property that is the subject of the decision and to the party that sought the decision if different from the owner. They have 30 days from receipt of the written notice to file an appeal. The administrative official shall be present at the hearing as a witness.

J. The parties to an appeal may agree to mediation or other forms of
alternative dispute resolution including without limitation mediation or
arbitration.
8-2 Variances
A. General
1. An application for a variance along with the required filing fee shall be submitted to the Board of Adjustment by filing a copy of the application with the Zoning Administrator.
2. A variance may be granted by the Board of Adjustment if it concludes that strict enforcement of this Ordinance would result in practical difficulties or unnecessary hardships for the applicant and that, by granting the variance, the spirit of this Ordinance will be observed, public safety and welfare secured, and substantial justice done. It may reach these conclusions if it finds that:
(a) Unnecessary hardship would result from the strict application of the ordinance. It shall not be necessary to demonstrate that, in the absence of the variance, no reasonable use can be made of the property.
(b) The hardship results from conditions that are peculiar to the property, such as location, size, or topography. Hardships resulting from personal circumstances, as well as hardships resulting from conditions that are common to the neighborhood or the general public, may not be the basis for granting a variance.
(c) The hardship did not result from actions taken by the applicant or the property owner. The act of purchasing property with knowledge that circumstances exist that may justify the granting of a variance shall not be regarded as a self-created hardship.
Mebane UDO, Article 8 8-3
February 4, 2008, amended May 12, 2014
(d) The requested variance is consistent with the spirit, purpose, and intent of the ordinance, such that public safety is secured, and substantial justice is achieved.
3. In granting variances, the Board of Adjustment may impose such reasonable conditions as will ensure that the use of the property to which the variance applies will be as compatible as practicable with the surrounding properties. Appropriate conditions, which must be reasonably related to the condition or circumstance that gives rise to the need for a variance, may be imposed on any approval issued by the Board of Adjustment.
4. A variance may be issued for an indefinite duration or for a specified duration only. Unless otherwise specified, any order or decision of the Board of Adjustment granting a variance shall expire if the applicant does not obtain a building permit or certificate of occupancy for such use within 60 calendar days from the date of the decision or if construction of the use has not commenced within 180 calendar days from the date of the issuance of a building permit.
5. The nature of the variance and any conditions attached to it shall be entered on the face of the zoning permit, or the zoning permit may simply note the issuance of the variance and refer to the written record of the variance for further information. All such conditions are enforceable in the same manner as any other applicable requirement of this Ordinance.
6. No change in permitted uses may be authorized by variance.
7. Evidentiary hearing procedures for variance requests are delineated in Section 8-6. Hearing notice requirements are outlined in Section 8-7.
B. Variances from Flood Hazard Overlay District Requirements
The Board of Adjustment is authorized to review and decide upon request for variances from the Flood Hazard Overlay District Requirements delineated in Section 5-3 pursuant to the provisions delineated in this section.
1. Variances may be issued by the Board of Adjustment for:
(a) The repair or rehabilitation of historic structures upon the determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a historic structure and that the variance is the minimum necessary to preserve the historic character and design of the structure.
(b) Functionally dependent facilities if determined to meet the definition as stated in Section 5-3.2, provided the provisions of subsections H, 2, 3, and 5 of that Section have been satisfied, and such facilities are protected by methods that minimize flood damages.
Mebane UDO, Article 8 8-4
February 4, 2008, amended May 12, 2014
(c) Any other type of development provided it meets the requirements stated in this section.
2. In passing upon variances, the Board of Adjustment shall consider all technical evaluations, all relevant factors, all standards specified in other sections of this Ordinance, and:
(a) The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the injury of others;
(b) The danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion damage;
(c) The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner;
(d) The importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to the community;
(e) The necessity to the facility of a waterfront location as defined under Section 5-3.2 as a functionally dependent facility, where applicable;
(f) The availability of alternative locations, not subject to flooding or erosion damage, for the proposed use;
(g) The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated development;
(h) The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan and floodplain management program for that area;
(i) The safety of access to the property in times of flood for ordinary and emergency vehicles;
(j) The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise, and sediment transport of the floodwaters and the effects of wave action, if applicable, expected at the site; and
(k) The costs of providing governmental services during and after flood conditions including maintenance and repair of public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical and water systems, and streets and bridges.
3. A written report addressing each of the above factors shall be submitted with the application for a variance.
4. Upon consideration of the factors listed above and the purposes of this Ordinance, the board of adjustment may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes of this Ordinance.
Mebane UDO, Article 8 8-5
February 4, 2008, amended May 12, 2014
5. Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice specifying the difference between the Base Flood Elevation (BFE) and the elevation to which the structure is to be built and that such construction below the Base Flood Elevation increases risks to life and property, and that the issuance of a variance to construct a structure below the Base Flood Elevation will result in increased premium rates for flood insurance up to $25.00 per $100.00 of insurance coverage. Such notification shall be maintained with a record of all variance actions, including justification for their issuance.
6. The Zoning Administrator shall maintain the records of all appeal actions and report any variances to the Federal Emergency Management Agency and the State of North Carolina upon request.
7. Conditions for Variances:
(a) Variances shall not be issued when the variance will make the structure in violation of other Federal, State, or local laws, regulations, or ordinances.
(b) Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway or non-encroachment area if the variance would result in any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge.
(c) Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief.
(d) Variances shall only be issued prior to development permit approval.
(e) Variances shall only be issued upon:
(1) A showing of good and sufficient cause;
(2) A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship; and
(3) A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, or extraordinary public expense, create nuisance, cause fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances.
C. Variances from Watershed District Overlay Requirements
1. Minor Variances. Minor variances, as defined in Section 12-4, to the provisions of Section 5-2 may be approved by the Board of Adjustment pursuant to the procedures outlined in this Article.

If the EMC approves the variance as proposed, the Board of Adjustment shall prepare a final decision granting the proposed variance. If the EMC approves the variance with conditions and stipulations, the Board of Adjustment shall prepare a final decision, including such conditions and stipulations, granting the proposed variance. If the EMC denies the variance request, the Board of Adjustment shall prepare a final decision denying the variance.
3. Notification Requirements. The hearing notice required in Section 8-7 shall also be sent by first class mail to all other local governments having watershed regulation jurisdiction in the particular watershed where the variance is being requested and to each entity using the water supply for consumption. Any comments submitted prior to a decision by the Board of Adjustment shall become a part of the record of proceedings of the Board of Adjustment.
D. Administrative Action on Insignificant or de minimus Variances

Impermissible conflicts include, but are not limited to, a member having a fixed opinion prior to hearing the matter that is not susceptible to change, undisclosed ex parte communications, a close familial, business, or other associational relationship with an affected person, or a financial interest in the outcome of the matter.

No testimony of any witness before the Board of Adjustment pursuant to a subpoena issued in exercise of the power conferred by NCGS 160A-388 (g) may be used against the witness in the trial of any civil or criminal action other than a prosecution for false swearing committed on the examination. Any person who, while under oath during a proceeding before the Board of Adjustment, willfully swears falsely, is guilty of a Class 1 misdemeanor. The chair shall issue requested subpoenas he or she determines to be relevant, reasonable in nature and scope, and not oppressive. The chair shall rule on any motion to quash or modify a subpoena. G.S. 160-A388(g).

A. In response to questions or comments by persons appearing at the hearing or to suggestions or recommendations by the Board of Adjustment, the applicant may agree to modify his application, including the plans and specifications submitted.
B. Unless such modifications are so substantial or extensive that the Board cannot reasonably be expected to perceive the nature and impact of the proposed changes without revised plans before it, the Board of Adjustment may approve the application with the stipulation that the permit will not be issued until plans reflecting the agreed upon changes are submitted to the Zoning Administrator.
8-11 Record
A. A record shall be made of all hearings required by Section 8-6, and such record shall be kept as provided by state law. Accurate minutes shall also be kept of all such proceedings, but a transcript need not be made.

In accordance with the requirements of NCGS 160A-381 (d), members of Planning Board shall not vote on recommendations regarding any zoning map or text amendment where the outcome of the matter being considered is reasonably likely to have a direct, substantial, and readily identifiable financial impact on the member.
9-4 City Council Review and Adoption
A. Prior to adopting or rejecting any zoning amendment, the City Council shall, in accordance with the provisions of NCGS 160A-383, adopt a statement describing whether its action is consistent with an adopted comprehensive plan and explaining why the Board considers the action taken to be reasonable and in the public interest. This consistency statement is not subject to judicial review.
B. Upon receipt of a recommendation from the Planning Board, the City Council shall review the proposed amendment at a public hearing. The public notice required for the public hearing shall be in accordance with Section 9-5.
Mebane UDO, Article 9 9-3
February 4, 2008; Amended November 5, 2018
C. At the conclusion of a public hearing on the proposed amendment, the City Council may proceed to vote on the proposed amendment, refer it to a committee for further study, or take any other action consistent with its usual rules of procedure.
D. If no written report is received from the Planning Board within 30 days of referral of the amendment to that board, the City Council may proceed in its consideration of the amendment without the Planning Board report. The City Council is not bound by the recommendations, if any, of the Planning Board that are before it at the time it takes action on a proposed amendment.
E. The City Council is not required to take final action on a proposed amendment within any specific period of time, but it should proceed as expeditiously as practicable on petitions for amendments since inordinate delays can result in the petitioner incurring unnecessary costs.
F. Voting on amendments to this Ordinance shall proceed in the same manner as other ordinances except that in the case of receipt of a qualified protest petition, a super majority vote is required in accordance with the provisions of Section 9-10.
G. In accordance with the requirements of NCGS 160A-381 (d), a member of the City Council shall not vote on any zoning map or text amendment where the outcome of the matter being considered is reasonably likely to have a direct, substantial, and readily identifiable financial impact on the member.
9-5 Public Hearing Requirements
A. No ordinance that amends any of the provisions of this Ordinance may be adopted until a public hearing has been held on such ordinance.
B. The Zoning Administrator shall publish a notice of the public hearing on any ordinance that amends the provisions of this Ordinance once a week for two successive weeks in a newspaper having general circulation in the city. The notice shall be published for the first time not less than ten days nor more than twenty-five days before the date fixed for the public hearing. In computing this period, the date of publication shall not be counted but the date of the public hearing shall be.
C. With respect to map amendments, the Zoning Administrator shall provide first class mail notice of the public hearing to the record owners for tax purposes of all properties whose zoning classification is changed by the proposed amendment as well as the owners of all properties within 300 feet of the property rezoned by the amendment. The first-class mail notice shall be deposited in the mail at least 10 but not more than 25 days prior to the date of the public hearing. The Zoning Administrator shall also post notices of the public hearing on the property proposed to be rezoned in accordance with subsection F and take any other action deemed by the Zoning Administrator to be useful or appropriate to give notice of the public hearing.
(Amended by Mebane City Council, 06/05/2017)
Mebane UDO, Article 9 9-4
February 4, 2008; Amended November 5, 2018
D. The notice required in subsection C. shall not be required if the zoning map amendment directly affects more than 50 properties, owned by a total of at least 50 different property owners. In this instance, the city may elect, in lieu of the mail notice specified in subsection C., to publish a notice of the hearing once a week for 2 consecutive weeks, published for the first time not less than ten days nor more than twenty-five days before the date fixed for the public hearing. In computing this period, the date of publication shall not be counted but the date of the public hearing shall be. Each of the advertisements shall not be less than one-half of a newspaper page in size. The advertisement shall only be effective for property owners who reside in the area of general circulation of the newspaper which publishes the notice. Property owners who reside outside of the newspaper circulation area, according to the address listed on the most recent property tax listing for the affected property, shall be notified according to the provisions of subsection C. of this section. The person or persons mailing the notices to adjoining property owners, as defined in NCGS 160A-384 (a), shall certify to the City Council that fact, and the certificate shall be deemed conclusive in the absence of fraud.
E. The notice required or authorized by this Section shall:
1. State the date, time, and place of the public hearing;
2. Summarize the nature and character of the proposed change;
3. If the proposed amendment involves a change in zoning district classification, reasonably identify the property whose classification would be affected by the amendment;
4. State that the full text of the amendment and maps of the area proposed to be rezoned can be obtained from the Zoning Administrator; and
5. State that substantial changes in the proposed amendment may be made following the public hearing.
F. When a zoning map amendment is proposed, the city shall prominently post a notice of the public hearing on the site proposed for rezoning or on an adjacent public street or highway right-of-way. When multiple parcels are included within a proposed zoning map amendment, a posting on each individual parcel is not required, but the city shall post sufficient notices to provide reasonable notice to interested persons.
9-6 Ultimate Issue before City Council on Amendments
In deciding whether to adopt a proposed amendment to this Ordinance, the central issue before the City Council is whether the proposed amendment advances the public health, safety or welfare. All other issues, except those issues related to a conditional zoning as delineated in Section 9-7, are irrelevant, and all information related to other issues at the public hearing may be declared irrelevant by the Chairman and excluded.
Mebane UDO, Article 9 9-5
February 4, 2008; Amended November 5, 2018
When considering proposed map amendments:
A. Except for conditional zoning requests submitted in accordance with Section 9-7, the City Council shall not consider any representations made by the petitioner that, if the change is granted, the rezoned property will be used for only one of the possible range of uses permitted in the requested classification. Rather, the City Council shall consider whether the entire range of permitted uses in the requested classification is more appropriate than the range of uses in the existing classification.
B. The City Council shall not regard as controlling any advantages or disadvantages to the individual requesting the change, but shall consider the impact of the proposed change on the public at large.
9-7 Conditional Zoning
A. There are circumstances in which a general zoning district designation allowing a use by right would not be appropriate for a particular property even though the use itself could, if properly planned, be appropriate for the property consistent with the objectives of this Ordinance and adopted land development plan, comprehensive plan, corridor plans, small area plans, and other land use policy documents. The rezoning process established in this Section provides for the accommodation of such uses by a reclassification of property into a conditional zoning district, subject to additional conditions which ensure compatibility of the proposed use with the use and enjoyment of neighboring properties. A conditional zoning district allows a particular use or uses to be established only in accordance with specified standards and conditions tailored to each individual development project. This is a voluntary rezoning procedure that is intended for firm development proposals. It is not intended or suited for securing early zoning for tentative proposals that may not be undertaken for some time.
B. The review and approval process for conditional zoning petitions involves a legislative hearing and legislative decision by the City Council. The review of conditional zoning petitions shall be undertaken in accordance with the provisions of Sections 9-3 through 9-5.
C. Property may be placed in a conditional zoning district only in response to a petition by the owners of all the property to be included. A petition for conditional zoning shall include:
1. A master site plan prepared in accordance with Appendix A;
2. Written supporting documentation that specifies the actual use or uses proposed for the property, and
3. Proposed rules, regulations, and conditions that, in addition to all predetermined requirements of this Ordinance, will govern the development and use of the property.
4. A statement analyzing the reasonableness of the proposed rezoning.
Mebane UDO, Article 9 9-6
February 4, 2008; Amended November 5, 2018
D. Conditional zoning districts, as established in Section 3-1, B, parallel general use zoning districts. Only those land uses (including uses by right, special uses, and conditional uses) permitted in a general use zoning district to which a conditional zoning district corresponds shall be allowed. All rules, regulations, and conditions of any corresponding general use district and all other requirements of this Ordinance apply to a conditional zoning district except as specifically modified by the City Council.
(Amended November 5, 2018)
E. Community Informational Meeting
During its initial review of a conditional zoning petition, the Planning Board shall consider whether or not a community informational meeting, to be organized and conducted by the petitioner, would be beneficial to making project information available to those most likely to be impacted by the proposed zoning change. If the Planning Board concludes that a community informational meeting should be held, the petitioner shall conduct such meeting in accordance with the following provisions:
1. The community informational meeting shall be held prior to the date of the next Planning Board meeting at which the petition will be reviewed.
2. Written notice of such a meeting shall be given to the property owners and organizations entitled to notice as determined by policies established by the city.
3. The petitioner shall file a written report of the community informational meeting with the Zoning Administrator. The petitioners report shall include, among other things, a listing of those persons and organizations contacted about the meeting and the manner and date of contact; the date; time and location of the meeting; a roster of the names, mailing addresses, and telephone numbers of the persons in attendance at the meeting; a summary of issues discussed at the meeting; and a description of any changes to the rezoning petition made by the petitioner as a result of the meeting.
4. The purpose of the community informational meeting is to (i) provide specific information regarding the proposed development including but not limited to a description of the proposed use(s) of the property, the proposed density and intensity of land uses, the location and arrangement of the proposed land use(s) on the property, the proposed development schedule, and proposed regulations or conditions, in addition to those required by this Ordinance, that will govern the development and use of the property and (ii) to receive comments and input from citizens likely to be impacted by the proposed zoning change and subsequent development of the property.
5. In the event the petitioner has not held at least one meeting pursuant to this subsection, the petitioner shall file a report with the Zoning
Mebane UDO, Article 9 9-7
February 4, 2008; Amended November 5, 2018
Administrator documenting efforts that were made to arrange such a meeting and stating the reasons such a meeting was not held.
6. The adequacy of a meeting held or report filed pursuant to this section shall be considered by the City Council but shall not be subject to judicial review.
F. Review and Approval Process
The review and approval of a petition for a conditional zoning district shall follow the same process as outlined in Sections 9-3 through 9-5 for a general use rezoning.
1. In the course of evaluating the proposed use, the City Council may request additional information deemed appropriate to provide a complete analysis of the proposal.
2. Conditional zoning district decisions are a legislative process subject to judicial review using the same procedures and standard of review applicable to general use district zoning decisions.
3. Conditional zoning district decisions shall be made in consideration of identified relevant adopted land use plans for the area, including, but not limited to, land development plans, comprehensive plans, strategic plans, district plans, small area plans, corridor plans, and other land development policy documents.
G. Conditions to Approval
Specific conditions applicable to the conditional zoning districts may be proposed by the petitioner or the city or its agencies, but only those conditions mutually approved by the city and the petitioner may be incorporated into the zoning regulations or permit requirements.
1. Conditions and site-specific standards imposed in a conditional zoning district shall be limited to those that address the conformance of the development and use of the site to city ordinances and an officially adopted comprehensive or other plan and those that address the impacts reasonably expected to be generated by the development or use of the site.
2. Any such conditions should relate to the relationship of the proposed use to surrounding property, proposed support facilities such as parking areas and driveways, pedestrian and vehicular circulation systems, screening and buffer areas, the timing of development, street and right-of-way improvements, water and sewer improvements, stormwater drainage, the provision of open space, and other matters that the City Council may find appropriate or the petitioner may propose. Such conditions to approval of the petition may include dedication to the city or state, as appropriate, of any rights-of-way or easements for streets, water, sewer, or other public utilities necessary to serve the proposed development.
Mebane UDO, Article 9 9-8
February 4, 2008; Amended November 5, 2018
3. The petitioner shall have a reasonable opportunity to consider and respond to any such conditions prior to final action by the City Council.
4. If for any reason any condition for approval is found to be illegal or invalid or if the petitioner should fail to accept any condition following approval, the approval of the site plan for the district shall be null and void and of no effect and proceedings shall be instituted by the City to rezone the property to its previous zoning classification or to another zoning district.
H. Effect of Approval
If a petition for conditional zoning is approved, the development and use of the property shall be governed by the predetermined ordinance requirements applicable to the districts classification, the approved site plan or master plan for the district, and any additional approved rules, regulations, and conditions, all of which shall constitute the zoning regulations for the approved district and are binding on the property as an amendment to this Ordinance and to the zoning map.
1. If a petition is approved, only those uses and structures indicated in the approved petition and site plan shall be allowed on the subject property. A change of location of the structures may be authorized pursuant to subsection I, 1 below provided that such change in building layout does not result in an increase in the number of structures.
2. Following the approval of the petition for a conditional zoning district, the subject property shall be identified on the zoning map by the appropriate district designation. A conditional zoning district shall be identified by the same designation as the underlying general district followed by the letters CD [for example R-15 (CD)].
3. No permit shall be issued for any development activity within a conditional zoning district except in accordance with the approved petition and site plan for the district
4. Any violation of the approved site plan or any rules, regulations and conditions for the district shall be treated the same as any other violation of this Ordinance and shall be subject to the same remedies and penalties as any such violation.
I. Alterations to Approval
Except as provided in subsection 1, below, changes to an approved petition or to the conditions attached to the approved petition shall be treated the same as amendments to this Ordinance or to the zoning map and shall be processed in accordance with the procedures in this Ordinance.
1. The Planning Director shall have the delegated authority to approve an administrative amendment to an approved site plan. The Planning Director shall have no authority to amend the conditions of approval of a petition. The standard for approving or denying such a requested
Mebane UDO, Article 9 9-9
February 4, 2008; Amended November 5, 2018
change shall be that the change does not significantly alter the site plan and that the change does not have a significant impact upon abutting properties. Any decision by the Planning Director must be in writing stating the grounds for approval or denial.
2. The Planning Director, however, shall always have the discretion to decline to exercise the delegated authority either because he is uncertain about approval of the change pursuant to the standard or because a rezoning petition for a public hearing and City Council consideration is deemed appropriate under the circumstances. If the Planning Director declines to exercise this authority, the applicant may file a rezoning petition for a public hearing and City Council decision in accordance with the provisions delineated in Sections 9-2 through 9-5.
3. Any request for an administrative amendment shall be pursuant to a written letter, signed by the owners of all of the property affected by the proposed change, detailing the requested change. Upon request, the applicant shall provide any additional information as deemed necessary by the Planning Director. Upon an approval of an administrative amendment, the applicant shall file a sufficient number of copies of the revised site plan as deemed necessary by the Planning Director.
4. If the Planning Director denies approval of the requested administrative amendment, the applicant may file a rezoning petition for a public hearing and City Council decision in accordance with the provisions delineated in Sections 9-2 through 9-5.
J. Review of Approved Conditional Zoning Districts
It is intended that property shall be reclassified to a conditional zoning district only in the event of firm plans to develop the property. Therefore, no sooner than one year (or two years if a vested right has been established in accordance with the provisions of Section 2-28) after the date of approval of the petition, the Planning Board may examine the progress made toward developing the property in accordance with the approved petition and any conditions attached to the approval.
1. If the Planning Board determines that substantial progress has not been made in accordance with the approved petition and conditions, the Planning Board shall forward to the City Council a report which may recommend that the property be rezoned to its previous zoning classification or to another zoning district. If the City Council concurs with the Planning Boards recommendation, the City Council may initiate the rezoning of the property in accordance with the procedures delineated in Sections 9-3 through 9-5.
2. If the Planning Board determines that substantial progress has been made to develop the property, the Planning Board may recommend that an extension of time be granted. The City Council, after reviewing the recommendation of the Planning Board, may approve an extension of time not to exceed an additional 12 months. Approval
Mebane UDO, Article 9 9-10
February 4, 2008; Amended November 5, 2018
of such a time extension by the City Council may be made without conducting a formal public hearing.
3. If, after the expiration of the extended time period, the Planning Board determines that no substantial progress has been made and the City Council concurs with that determination, the City Council shall proceed to (i) conduct a public hearing on the matter to evaluate whether or not another extension of time is warranted or (ii) initiate the rezoning of the property to its previous zoning classification or to another zoning classification using the procedures delineated in Sections 9-3 through 9-5.
4. For purposes of this Section, examples of substantial progress may include (i) the approval of construction plans for streets, utilities, and other infrastructure; (ii) the initiation of land preparation activities such as clearing and grading; (iii) the initiation of the construction of the principal building(s); and (iv) the initiation of the construction of streets, utilities, other infrastructure, or required site amenities.
9-8 Amendments to Flood Hazard Zoning and Flood Hazard Boundary Map
A. All requests for revisions of areas of special flood hazard boundaries and base flood elevations shall be reviewed and approved by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA).
B. The existing location of any area of special flood hazard as defined in Section 5-3 may be amended in cases where:
1. A flood control project of the federal, state, city or municipal government has substantially altered the flood hazard; or
2. Flood data indicates that the boundaries of either of the areas as shown on the official flood boundary and floodway map are no longer correct; or
3. A private individual, corporation, firm or municipal agency has submitted plans for a channel improvement or relocation requiring an amendment to the official flood hazard boundary map.
C. Applications for an amendment to the official flood boundary and floodway map shall be processed in the same manner as an amendment to the official zoning map. The applicant shall be responsible for submitting the proposed amendment and supporting documentation to the FEMA for its approval. The application for flood zone map amendments shall be deemed incomplete if not accompanied by a letter of approval from FEMA.
D. All amendments to the official flood boundary map and floodway map shall be filed in accordance with NCGS 143-215.56 (c).
9-9 Amendments to Watershed Protection Provisions
Mebane UDO, Article 9 9-11
February 4, 2008; Amended November 5, 2018
The Zoning Administrator shall keep a record of all text amendments to this Ordinance which involve regulations, standards, or procedures regarding public water supply watersheds as outlined in Section 5-2. Copies of all such amendments shall, upon adoption, be provided to the Supervisor of the Classification and Standards Group, Water Quality Section, N.C. Division of Environmental Management. Under no circumstances shall an amendment be adopted which would cause this Ordinance to violate the public water supply watershed rules as adopted by the NC Environmental Management Commission.
9-10 Protests to Zoning District Changes
A. If a petition opposing a change in the zoning classification of any property is filed in accordance with the provisions of this Section, then the proposed amendment may be adopted only by a favorable vote of three-fourths of the membership of the City Council.
B. To invoke the three-fourths vote requirement, the petition must:
1. Be signed by the owners of either (i) twenty percent (20%) or more of the area included in the proposed change or (ii) five percent (5%) of a 100 foot-wide buffer extending along the entire boundary of each discrete or separate area proposed to be rezoned. A street right-of-way shall not be considered in computing the 100-foot buffer area as long as that street right-of-way is 100 feet wide or less. When less than an entire parcel of land is subject to the proposed zoning map amendment, the 100-foot buffer shall be measured from the property line of that parcel. In the absence of evidence to the contrary, the city may rely on the city tax listing to determine the 'owners' of potentially qualifying areas.
2. Be in the form of a written petition actually bearing the signatures of the requisite number of property owners and stating that the signers do protest the proposed change or amendment.
3. Be received by the Zoning Administrator in sufficient time to allow the city at least two normal working days before the date established for a public hearing on the proposed amendment to determine the sufficiency and accuracy of the petition.
4. Be on a form provided by the Zoning Administrator and contain all the information requested on this form.
C. A person who has signed a protest petition may withdraw his or her name from the petition at any time prior to the vote on the proposed zoning amendment.
9-11 Withdrawal of Amendment Petition
The petitioner shall have the right to withdraw, in writing, an amendment petition at any time prior to a final decision by the City Council. However, petitions that have been withdrawn shall be reconsidered only as a new petition and shall adhere to the submission and review requirements of Sections 9-2 through 9-5.
Mebane UDO, Article 9 9-12
February 4, 2008; Amended November 5, 2018
9-12 Petition Resubmittal
If an amendment petition is denied by the City Council, the Zoning Administrator shall not accept a rezoning petition similar to that denied for the same property or a portion of the property within one year of the Board's action, except that the Zoning Administrator may accept a new rezoning petition within the one-year period if the Zoning Administrator determines that:
A. There has been a significant change in the zoning district classification of an adjacent property;
B. A new or updated land use plan that changes public policy regarding the property is adopted by the city;
C. Public facilities such as roads, water lines, sewer lines, or other infrastructure are constructed or expanded to serve the property and enable the proposed development to be accommodated; or
D. There has been some other significant change, other than a change in ownership of the property, which might justify waiving the one-year restriction on submitting a new petition.
9-13 Notification of Decision
Within five working days of any action by the City Council on an amendment petition, notice of such action shall be sent by first-class mail to the petitioner and any other persons who have indicated to the Zoning Administrator, in writing, that they would like the decision mailed to them. Additionally, within 15 days after the effective date of a zoning change to commercial or industrial zones within 660 feet of the right-of-way of an interstate or primary highway, written notice by registered mail shall be sent to the Raleigh offices of the North Carolina Department of Transportation in accordance with NCGS 136-136 and 136-153.

ARTICLE 10
NONCONFORMITIES
10-1 General
A nonconforming situation occurs when, on the effective date of this Ordinance, an existing lot or structure or use of an existing lot or structure does not conform to one or more of the regulations applicable to the district in which the lot or structure is located. Among other possibilities, a nonconforming situation may arise because a lot does not meet minimum acreage requirements, because structures exceed maximum height limitations, because the relationship between existing buildings and the land (in such matter as density and setback requirement) is not in conformity with this Ordinance, because signs do not meet the requirements of this Ordinance, or because land or buildings are used for purposes made unlawful by this Ordinance.
Unless otherwise specifically provided for in this Ordinance and subject to the restrictions and qualifications set forth in the remaining sections of this Article, nonconforming situations that were otherwise lawful on the effective date of this Ordinance may be continued. Whenever this Ordinance refers to the effective date of this Ordinance, the reference shall be deemed to include the effective date of any amendments to this Ordinance if the amendment, rather than this Ordinance as originally adopted, creates a nonconforming situation.
10-2 Nonconforming Lots
A. Single Lot of Record with Lot Area and/or Lot Width Nonconformity
1. When an undeveloped lot has an area or width which does not conform to the dimensional requirements of the district where located, but such lot was approved and of record at the time of adoption of this Ordinance or any subsequent amendment which renders such lot nonconforming, then such lot may be used for a use permitted in the district where located, provided that the setback dimensions and other requirements, except area or width, are complied with.
2. In residential zones, only a single-family dwelling shall be permitted on the nonconforming lot.
3. Nothing contained herein exempts a lot from meeting the applicable provisions of the Alamance County or Orange County Environmental Health Department regulations.
B. Lots with Contiguous Frontage in One Ownership
1. When two or more adjoining and vacant lots of record with contiguous frontage are in one ownership at the time of the adoption of this Ordinance or subsequent to adoption and said lots individually have a lot area or lot width which does not conform to the dimensional requirements of the district where located, such lots
Mebane UDO, Article 10 10-2
Table of Contents
February 4, 2008
shall be combined to create one or more lots that meet the standards of the district where located.
2. Nothing contained herein exempts the contiguous lots considered as a single buildable lot or lots from meeting the applicable provisions of the Alamance County or Orange County Environmental Health Department regulations.
C. Reduction of a Lot of Record
A lot of record reduced to less than the required area, width, or setback dimensions as the result of a condemnation or purchase by a local or state government agency shall become a nonconforming lot of record.
D. Lot of Record with Setback Nonconformity
When the use proposed for an undeveloped nonconforming lot is one that is conforming in all other respects except that the applicable setback requirements cannot reasonably be complied with, then the entity authorized by this Ordinance to issue a permit for the proposed use (the Zoning Administrator, City Council, or Board of Adjustment) may allow deviations from the applicable setback requirements if it finds that:
1. The property cannot reasonably be developed for the use proposed without such deviations;
2. The deviations are necessitated by the size or shape of the nonconforming lot; and
3. The property can be developed as proposed without any significantly adverse impact on surrounding properties or the public health or safety.
10-3 Nonconforming Use of Land
A. Continuance of Nonconforming Use of Land
Any nonconforming use legally existing at the time of adoption or amendment of this Ordinance may be continued so long as it remains otherwise lawful subject to conditions provided in this Section.
B. Conditions for Continuance
Such nonconforming use of land shall be subject to the following conditions:
1. No nonconforming use shall be changed to another nonconforming use unless such use is determined to be of equal or less intensity. In determining whether a nonconforming use is of equal or less intensity, the Board of Adjustment shall consider:
(a) Probable traffic of each use;
Mebane UDO, Article 10 10-3
Table of Contents
February 4, 2008
(b) Parking requirements of each use;
(c) Probable number of persons on the premises of each use at a time of peak demand;
(d) Off-site impacts of each use, such as noise, glare, dust, vibration or smoke and other impacts on surrounding properties or the public health or safety.
2. The number of dwelling units in a nonconforming residential use shall not be increased.
3. No such nonconforming use shall be moved in whole or in part to any portion of the lot or parcel other than that occupied by such use at the effective date of adoption or amendment of this Ordinance.
4. If any nonconforming use of land ceases for any reason for a continuous period of more than 180 days, any subsequent use of such land shall be a permitted use in the district in which such land is located. Recontinuance of any nonconforming use must be with the clear intent of being continuous and permanent.
5. The resumption of a nonconforming use of land shall not be permitted if such nonconforming use is superseded by a permitted use for any period of time.
6. No additional structure(s) not conforming to the requirements of this Ordinance shall be erected in connection with such nonconforming use of land.
C. Extension, Enlargement or Replacement of a Nonconforming Use
1. Except as provided for in subsections 2 through 5, no nonconforming use shall be extended, enlarged, or replaced.
2. Any single-family residential nonconforming use (which may be a manufactured home) may be enlarged or replaced with a similar single-family residential structure of the same size or of a larger size, so long as the enlargement or replacement is constructed in such a manner as to comply with the North Carolina Building Code and does not create new nonconformities or increase the extent of existing nonconformities with respect to setback requirements. (Amended February 13, 2012)
3. A nonconforming use may be extended throughout any portion of a completed building that, when the use was made nonconforming by this Ordinance, was manifestly designed or arranged to accommodate such use. However, a nonconforming use may not be extended to additional buildings or to land outside the original building unless specifically authorized in accordance with subsection 6.
4. A nonconforming use of open land may not be extended to cover more land than was occupied by that use when it became

nonconforming, except that a use that involves the removal of natural materials from the lot (e.g., a sand pit) may be expanded to the limits of the site plan upon which the mining permit was granted if ten percent or more of the natural materials had already been removed on the effective date of this Ordinance.
5. The volume, intensity, or frequency of use of property where a nonconforming use exists may be increased and the equipment or processes used at a location where a nonconforming use exists may be changed if these or similar changes amount only to changes in the degree of activity rather than changes in kind or use and no violations of other Sections of this Ordinance occur.
10-4 Nonconforming Structures
A. Continuance of Nonconforming Structure
Any nonconforming structure legally existing at the time of adoption or amendment of this Ordinance may be continued so long as it remains otherwise lawful.
B. Conditions for Continuance
Such nonconforming structures shall be subject to the following conditions:
1. No nonconforming structure may be enlarged or altered in any way which increases its dimensional deficiencies; however, any nonconforming structure or portion thereof may be altered to decrease its dimensional deficiencies. Any enlargement of the structure shall conform to the current dimensional requirements.
2. In the event of damage by fire or other causes to the extent exceeding sixty percent of its tax value prior to such damage as established by the Building Inspector, reconstruction of a nonconforming structure shall be permitted only in compliance with the dimensional provisions of this Ordinance.
3. In the event of damage by fire or other causes to the extent causing less than sixty percent of its tax value prior to such damage as established by the Building Inspector, reconstruction of a nonconforming structure shall be permitted provided it is constructed:
(a) In the same manner in which it originally existed subject to compliance with the requirements of the NC State Building Code; or
(b) In compliance with the dimensional requirements.
4. No nonconforming structure shall be moved or relocated unless it is made to comply with the dimensional and use requirements of the district in which it is relocated and with the requirements of the NC State Building Code.

C. Preservation of Safe or Lawful Conditions
Nothing in this Ordinance shall prevent the strengthening or restoration to a safe or lawful condition any part of any building declared unsafe or unlawful by the Building Inspector or other duly authorized official.
10-5 Miscellaneous Nonconforming Situations
A. Nonconforming Situation Resulting From Governmental Acquisition
Any lot reduced in size by municipal, city or state condemnation or purchase of land shall obtain nonconforming lot or building status to the extent that said condemnation or purchase causes noncompliance with any provisions of this Ordinance.
B. Nonconforming Parking Created By Change of Use
Whenever a change of use that does not involve the enlargement of an existing structure is proposed for a lot on which the parking requirements of this Ordinance for the proposed new use can not be met due to insufficient lot area, the proposed change of use shall not be regarded as an impermissible extension or enlargement of a nonconforming situation. However, the permit-issuing authority shall require that the parking requirements be satisfied to the extent possible utilizing the lot area that is available and may require that satellite parking space be obtained.
10-6 Nonconforming Projects
All nonconforming projects on which construction was begun at least 180 calendar days before the effective date of this Ordinance as well as all nonconforming projects that are at least ten percent completed in terms of the total expected cost of the project on the effective date of this Ordinance may be completed in accordance with the terms of their permits, so long as these permits were validly issued and remain unrevoked and unexpired. If a development is designed to be completed in stages, this Section shall apply only to the particular phase under construction. In addition, as provided in NCGS 160A-385 (b), neither this Ordinance nor any amendment to it shall, without the consent of the property owner, affect any lot with respect to which a building permit has been issued pursuant to NCGS 160A-417 prior to the enactment of the Article making the change so long as the building permit remains valid, unexpired, and unrevoked.
10-7 Nonconforming Signs
A. Continuance of Nonconforming Signs
1. Signs in existence on the effective date of this Ordinance which do not conform to the provisions of this Ordinance, but which were constructed, erected, affixed or maintained in compliance with all previous regulations, shall be regarded as nonconforming signs. Although it is not the intent of this Ordinance to encourage the continued use of nonconforming signs, nonconforming signs shall be allowed to continue and a decision as to the continued existence and use or removal of such signs shall be controlled as follows:
Mebane UDO, Article 10 10-6
Table of Contents
February 4, 2008
(a) No nonconforming sign shall be changed to another nonconforming sign.
(b) No nonconforming sign shall have any changes made in the words or symbols used or the message displayed on the sign unless the sign is specifically designed for periodic change of message.
(c) No nonconforming sign shall be structurally altered so as to change the shape, size, type or design of the sign other than to make the sign a conforming sign.
(d) No nonconforming sign shall be re-established after the activity, business or use to which it relates has been discontinued and such sign shall be removed.
(e) No nonconforming sign shall be re-established and all remains of the sign must be removed after damage or destruction, if the estimated expense of repairs exceeds sixty percent of the estimated total value of the sign at the time of destruction, as determined by the Building Inspector. If damaged by less than sixty percent, but repairs are not made within three months of the time such damage occurred, the nonconforming sign shall not be allowed to continue and must be removed.
(f) No nonconforming sign shall be relocated unless it is brought into conformance with the requirements of this Ordinance.
(g) Normal maintenance and repair of a nonconforming sign is permitted providing the shape, size, type or design of the sign is not altered.
2. Any nonconforming sign that is structurally altered, relocated or replaced shall immediately be brought into compliance with all the provisions of this Ordinance.
3. Any nonconforming sign which (i) is a menace to the public safety, (ii) has been abandoned, or (iii) which has not been properly maintained, including cleaning and painting of painted surface areas and replacement of damaged parts, shall be removed after due notice has been given by the Zoning Administrator.
B. Violations of Nonconforming Sign Provisions
The Zoning Administrator shall order the removal of any sign maintained in violation of the provisions of this Section for which removal procedures are herein prescribed, accordingly: the Zoning Administrator shall give ninety days written notice to the owner or lessee to remove the sign or to bring it into compliance with this Ordinance.

11-1 Violations
Any of the following shall be a violation of this Ordinance and shall be subject to the enforcement remedies and penalties provided by this Ordinance and by state law.

11-2 Enforcement Intent
It is the intention of this Ordinance, unless otherwise provided, that all questions arising in connection with the enforcement of this Ordinance shall be presented first to the Zoning Administrator and that such questions shall be presented to the Board of Adjustment only on appeal from the Zoning Administrator's final decision. An appeal from the decision of the Board of Adjustment shall be by proceedings in the nature of certiorari to the Superior Court as provided by law and must be filed with the Alamance or Orange County Clerk of Court within the 30-day appeal period described in Section 11-7.

Mebane UDO, Article 11 11-2
February 4, 2008; amended May 12, 2014
11-3 Enforcement Procedures
When the Zoning Administrator or designee discovers a violation of this Ordinance or receives a complaint alleging a violation of this Ordinance, it shall be his or her duty to attempt to immediately notify the owner and occupant of the land, building, structure, sign, or use of the violation.
A. Initial Notification
Upon discovery of the existence of a violation of this Ordinance, the Zoning Administrator shall by first-class mail, telephone, fax, email, or personal service attempt to notify the owner or occupant of the property of the nature of the violation, provide a citation of the Section(s) of the Ordinance violated, and describe the measures necessary to remedy the violation. The Zoning Administrator may also request that the owner or occupant of the property arrange a meeting with the Planning and Zoning Department staff to further discuss the violation and options for remedying the violation. Any recipient of notifications under this subsection shall not be considered a person aggrieved for appeal purposes.
B. Order of Compliance
If the owner or occupant of the land, building, sign, structure, or use in violation fails to take prompt corrective action, the Zoning Administrator shall give the owner or occupant written notice, by certified or registered mail, to his last known address, or by personal service, or by personal service or by posting notice of the violation and order of compliance conspicuously on the property:
1. That the land, building, sign, structure, or use is in violation of this Ordinance;
2. The nature of the violation, and citation of the Section of this Ordinance violated; and
3. The measures necessary to remedy the violation.
C. Appeal
Any owner or occupant who has received a Notice of Violation and Order of Compliance may appeal, in writing as a person aggrieved, the final decision of the Zoning Administrator to the Board of Adjustment, in accordance with the provisions of Section 8-1 within ten days following the date of receipt or posting of the Notice of Violation and Order of Compliance. The Board of Adjustment shall hear an appeal within a reasonable time, and it may affirm, modify, or revoke the Notice of Violation and Order of Compliance. In the absence of an appeal, the remedies and penalties sought by the Zoning Administrator in the Notice of Violation and Order of Compliance shall be final.
D. Order of Corrective Action by the Board of Adjustment
If upon a hearing held pursuant to an appeal as prescribed above, the Board of Adjustment shall find that the owner or occupant is in violation of this Ordinance, the Board of Adjustment shall issue an order in writing to the owner or occupant affirming the violation and ordering compliance.
Mebane UDO, Article 11 11-3
February 4, 2008; amended May 12, 2014
E. Failure to Comply with an Order
If the owner or occupant of a property fails to comply with a Notice of Violation and Order of Compliance from which no appeal has been taken, or an Order of Corrective Action following an appeal, the owner or occupant shall be subject to such remedies and penalties as may be provided for by the NC General Statutes and Section 11-4. If the owner or occupant fails to comply with the remedies and penalties prescribed, enforcement shall be sought through an order of a court of competent jurisdiction.
F. Emergency, Dangerous, or Hazardous Situations
In the event that the Zoning Administrator determines that a violation creates an immediate hazard to the public safety, health, or welfare, the standard notice requirements delineated in subsection A above may be waived. The Zoning Administrator is authorized to make a reasonable attempt to notify the person responsible for the violation, property owner, or other person that has an identifiable relationship to the violation and/or property owner and to order the immediate remedying of the violation. In the case of a safety hazard created by a sign or sign structure, the Zoning Administrator is authorized to immediately remove such sign or sign structure, at the expense of the property owner. In the case of a safety hazard created by the use or occupancy of a building or land, the Zoning Administrator shall consult with the city attorney for guidance concerning immediate enforcement actions.
11-4 Penalties and Remedies

C. Denial of Permit or Certificate
The Zoning Administrator may withhold or deny any permit, certificate, occupancy or other form of authorization on any land, building, sign, structure or use in which there is an uncorrected violation of a provision of this Ordinance or of a condition or qualification of a permit, certificate or other authorization previously granted.
D. Conditional Approval
The Zoning Administrator may condition the authorization of any permit or certificate upon the correction of the deficiency, payment of civil penalties within a specified time, or the posting of a compliance security approved by the city attorney.
Mebane UDO, Article 11 11-4
February 4, 2008; amended May 12, 2014
E. Revocation of Permits
In accordance with Section 11-6, permits shall be revoked for any substantial departure from the approved applications, plans, or specifications; refusal or failure to comply with the requirements of state or local laws; or for false statements or misrepresentations made in securing the permit. Any permit mistakenly issued in violation of an applicable state or local law may also be revoked.
F. Criminal Penalties
Any violation of this Ordinance shall be a misdemeanor or infraction as provided by NCGS 14-4.
G. State and Common Law Remedies
In addition to other enforcement provisions contained in this Ordinance, the City Council may exercise any and all enforcement powers granted to it by state law or common law.
H. Penalties for Transferring Lots in Unapproved Subdivisions
In accordance with the provisions of NCGS 160A-375, any person who, being the owner or agent of the owner of any land located within the planning and zoning jurisdiction of the City of Mebane, subdivides his land in violation of the requirements of this Ordinance or transfers or sells land by reference to, exhibition of, or any other use of a plat showing a subdivision of the land before the plat has been properly approved under the provisions of this Ordinance and recorded in the office of the appropriate register of deeds, shall be guilty of a Class 1 misdemeanor. The description by metes and bounds in the instrument of transfer or other document used in the process of selling or transferring land shall not exempt the transaction from this penalty. The City of Mebane may bring an action for injunction of any illegal subdivision, transfer, conveyance, or sale of land, and the court shall, upon appropriate findings, issue an injunction and order requiring the offending party to comply with the provisions of this Ordinance. Building permits required pursuant to NCGS 160A-417 may be denied for lots that have been illegally subdivided. In addition to other remedies, the City of Mebane may institute any appropriate action or proceedings to prevent the unlawful subdivision of land, to restrain, correct, or abate the violation, or to prevent any illegal act or conduct.
The provisions of this subsection shall not, however, prohibit any owner or its agent from entering into contracts to sell or lease by reference to an approved preliminary plat for which a final plat has not yet been properly approved or recorded with the register of deeds provided that the contract does all of the following:
1. Incorporates as an attachment a copy of the preliminary plat referenced in the contract and obligates the owner to deliver to the buyer a copy of the recorded plat prior to closing and conveyance.
2. Plainly and conspicuously notifies the prospective buyer or lessee that a final subdivision plat has not been approved or recorded at the time of the contract, that no governmental body will incur any obligation to the prospective buyer or lessee with respect to the approval of the final subdivision plat, that changes between the
Mebane UDO, Article 11 11-5
February 4, 2008; amended May 12, 2014
preliminary and final plats are possible, and that the contract or lease may be terminated without breach by the buyer or lessee if the final recorded plat differs in any material respect from the preliminary plat.
3. Provides that if the approved and recorded final plat does not differ in any material respect from the plat referred to in the contract, the buyer or lessee may not be required by the seller or lessor to close any earlier than five days after the delivery of a copy of the final recorded plat.
4. Provides that if the approved and recorded final plat differs in any material respect from the preliminary plat referred to in the contract, the buyer or lessee may not be required by the seller or lessor to close any earlier than 15 days after the delivery of the final recorded plat, during which 15-day period the buyer or lessee may terminate the contract without breach or any further obligation and may receive a refund of all earnest money or prepaid purchase price.
The provisions of this subsection also shall not prohibit any owner or its agent from entering into contracts to sell or lease land by reference to an approved preliminary plat for which a final plat has not been properly approved under these regulations or recorded with the register of deeds where the buyer or lessee is any person who has contracted to acquire or lease the land for the purpose of engaging in the business of construction of residential, commercial, or industrial buildings on the land, or for the purpose of resale or lease of the land to persons engaged in that kind of business, provided that no conveyance of that land may occur and no contract to lease it may become effective until after the final plat has been properly approved under this Ordinance and recorded with the register of deeds.
11-5 Civil Penalties-Assessment and Procedures
A. Penalties
Any person who violates any provisions of this Ordinance shall be subject to assessment of the maximum civil penalty allowed by law.
B. Notice
No civil penalty shall be assessed until the person alleged to be in violation has been notified of the violation in accordance with Section 11-3 A. If after receiving a notice of violation under Section 11-3 A, the owner or other violator fails to take corrective action, a civil penalty may be imposed under this Section in the form of a citation. The citation shall be served in the manner of a Notice of Violation. The citation shall state the nature of the violation, the civil penalty to be imposed upon the violator and shall direct the violator to pay the civil penalty within fifteen days of the date of the notice.
C. Responsible Parties
The owner or occupant of any land, building, structure, sign, or use of land or part thereof and any architect, builder, contractor, agent or any other person who participates or acts in concert, assists, directs, creates, or maintains any condition that is in violation of the requirements of this
Mebane UDO, Article 11 11-6
February 4, 2008; amended May 12, 2014
Ordinance may be held responsible for the violation and subject to the civil penalties and remedies herein provided.
D. Continuing Violation
For each day the violation is not corrected, the violator will be guilty of an additional and separate offense and subject to additional civil penalty.
E. Demand for Payment
The Zoning Administrator shall make written demand for payment upon the property owner or the person in violation, and shall set forth in detail a description of the violation for which the civil penalty has been imposed.
F. Nonpayment
If payment is not received or equitable settlement reached within thirty days, after demand for payment is made, the matter shall be referred to legal counsel for institution of a civil action in the appropriate division of the General Courts of Justice for recovery of the civil penalty. Provided however, if the civil penalty is not paid within the time prescribed, the Zoning Administrator may have a criminal summons or warrant issued against the violator. Nothing herein shall preclude the Zoning Administrator from exercising other enforcement rights simultaneously.
11-6 Permit Revocation
A. General
A zoning, sign, or special use permit may be revoked by the permit-issuing authority (in accordance with the provisions of this Section) if the permit recipient fails to develop or maintain the property in accordance with the approved plans, the requirements of the Ordinance, or any additional requirements lawfully imposed by the permit-issuing authority.
No person may continue to make use of land or buildings in the manner authorized by any zoning, sign, or special use permit after such permit has been revoked in accordance with this Section.
B. Special Use Permit Revocation
Before a special use permit may be revoked, all of the notice and hearing requirements of Section 2-18 shall be complied with. The notice shall inform the permit recipient of the alleged grounds for the revocation.
C. Zoning or Sign Permit Revocation
Before a zoning or sign permit may be revoked, the Zoning Administrator shall give the permit recipient ten days notice of intent to revoke the permit and shall inform the recipient of the alleged reasons for the revocation and of his right to obtain an informal hearing on the allegations. If the permit is revoked, the Zoning Administrator shall provide to the permittee a written statement of the decision and the reasons therefor.
11-7 Judicial Review
A. Appeal to Superior Court
Every decision of the City Council granting or denying a special use permit and every final decision of the Board of Adjustment shall be subject to
Mebane UDO, Article 11 11-7
February 4, 2008; amended May 12, 2014
review by the Superior Court of Alamance or Orange County by proceedings in the nature of certiorari pursuant to G.S. 160A-393.
B. Timing of Appeal
