City of Atlantic City pursuant to paragraphs one through 10, inclusive,
hereof and shall permit inspection of their books and records for purposes
of investigation to ascertain compliance with the program.

the city may direct as a means of enforcing the provisions of paragraphs one
through 10 herein, including penalties and sanctions for noncompliance.

hearing on the record that the contractor or subcontractor has failed to

ARTICLE I
City Employment
[Adopted 7-9-2014 by Ord. No. 34-2014]
§ 15A-1. Policy.
The City will conduct background checks on applicants. Applicants will
be considered for employment opportunities on the merits of their skills
and experience related to the position sought, and will not be denied
employment solely or in part because of a prior conviction, unless the City
determines that the conviction is job related. The background check will be
conducted after the City has selected the best candidate for the position.
If a background check yields information that is of concern to the City,
the applicant will be provided an individualized assessment. The applicant
will be given an opportunity to review the background check findings and
present information regarding inaccuracy, mitigating circumstances, and
rehabilitation.
§ 15A-2. Definitions.
As used in this article, the following terms shall have the meanings
indicated:
ADVERSE ACTION — To refuse to hire, to not promote, to discharge a
person, or to revoke an applicant's conditional offer of employment.
APPLICANT — A person who has filed an application for examination to a
City job position.
CITY — The City, department, agency, or office thereof.
§ 15A-3. Compliance with existing laws.
A. The City will comply with state and federal law requiring background
checks for certain positions and dictating certain disqualifying offenses
and other existing law. An employer's use of an individual's arrest and
conviction record in making employment decisions to automatically
disqualify applicants may violate the prohibition against employment
discrimination under federal law, Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of
1964.
B. The U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) guidance
recommends employers adopt the following best practices to avoid
violating federal law. The employer should only consider job-related
convictions, taking into account length of time since the conviction. In
addition, the guidelines recommend that the employer perform an
individualized assessment on the applicant, which would allow the
applicant to demonstrate that the conviction history is inaccurate or
provide evidence of mitigating circumstances or of rehabilitation.
C. The federal Fair Credit Reporting Act, 15 U.S.C. § 1681 et seq., governs
the use of commercially prepared background reports. The subject of
§ 15A-1 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 15A-3
1:97
§ 15A-4. Process for considering conviction history in employment
decisions.
the background report must authorize the report. These reports should
not include information on arrests older than seven years, and the
applicant should be provided a copy of the report prior to any adverse
action.
A. Identifying position as requiring background check. A Human
Resources Analyst performs an initial review of the position to
determine if the position is of such sensitivity that a background check
is warranted or if a background check is required by law.
B. Posting job announcements. All job announcements and position
descriptions shall contain the following statement if the position
requires a background check, unless otherwise required by law: "This
position is subject to a background check for any convictions directly
related to its duties and responsibilities. Only job-related convictions
will be considered and will not automatically disqualify the candidate."
C. Job applications. Job applications shall not inquire into an applicant's
conviction history.
D. Examination process. A list of eligible applicants will be created based
on examination results, and the list will be sent to the hiring
department. The hiring department will conduct interview(s) and select
an individual from the list of eligible applicants.
E. Notice of rights. Once an individual has been selected, the hiring
department shall notify Human Resources (HR), and HR shall send the
individual a conditional offer letter, notice of rights under this policy,
and a request for authorization to conduct a background check, if so
required.
F. Limitation to conviction history. HR shall not use or access the following
criminal records in relation to a background check: records of arrest
not followed by a valid conviction, sealed, dismissed, or expunged
convictions, misdemeanor convictions where no jail sentence can be
imposed, and infractions.
G. Conviction history inquiry. If required, HR shall consider job-related
convictions only. If a statute explicitly requires that certain convictions
are automatic bars to employment, then those convictions shall be
considered as well. Otherwise, no person shall be disqualified from
employment, solely or in part because of a prior conviction, unless it is a
job-related conviction. In determining if a conviction is job related, HR
shall consider:
(1) Whether the conviction is directly related to the duties and
responsibilities of that employment position;
§ 15A-3 ATLANTIC CITY CODE § 15A-4
1:98
(2) Whether the position offers the opportunity for the same or a
similar offense to occur;
(3) Whether circumstances leading to the conduct for which the
person was convicted will recur in the position; and
(4) The length of time since the offense occurred.
H. Pre-adverse action notice. If an applicant's conviction history contains
information that may be the basis for an adverse action, HR shall:
(1) Identify the conviction item(s) that are the basis for the potential
adverse action;
(2) Provide a copy of the conviction history report, if any;
(3) Provide examples of mitigation or rehabilitation evidence that the
applicant may voluntarily provide; and
(4) Provide the applicant with an individualized assessment as
described below.
I. Individualized assessment. A job-related conviction shall not be the
basis for an adverse action if the applicant can show evidence of
mitigation or rehabilitation and present fitness to perform the duties of
the position sought. The applicant shall have 10 business days, after
issuance of the notice, to respond with any information rebutting the
basis for the adverse action, including challenging the accuracy of the
information and submitting mitigation or rehabilitation evidence. HR
shall hold the position open until it makes the final employment
decision based on an individualized assessment of the information
submitted by the applicant and the factors recommended by the EEOC.
J. Evidence of mitigation or rehabilitation. Evidence of mitigation or
rehabilitation may be established by:
(1) Evidence showing that at least one year has elapsed since release
from any correctional institution without subsequent conviction of
a crime; and evidence showing compliance with terms and
conditions of probation or parole; or
(2) Any other evidence of mitigation or rehabilitation and present
fitness provided, including, but not limited to, letters of reference.
K. Final notice. If HR makes an adverse decision, the applicant shall be
informed of the final decision, the appeal process, and that the
applicant may be eligible for other City positions.
L. Appeal. Applicants may appeal the final decision to the Director of
Human Resources.
M. Confidentiality. Any information pertaining to an applicant's
background check obtained in conjunction with the hiring process shall
remain confidential, and shall not be used, distributed, or disseminated
§ 15A-4 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 15A-4
1:99
by the City or any of its agencies, or its vendors, to any other entity,
except as required by law.
N. Data collection.
(1) The Human Resources Department shall maintain a record of the
number of positions requiring background checks and, for those
positions, shall maintain a record of the number of applicants:
(a) For a position;
(b) Who were found eligible for a position; and
(c) Who were provided a conditional offer for a position.
(2) In addition, the Department shall maintain a record of the number
of applicants with a record for a position:
(a) Who were provided a pre-adverse action notice;
(b) Who provided evidence of mitigation or rehabilitation;
(c) Who were provided a final adverse notice; and
(d) Who were hired.
(3) The Department shall also regularly conduct a confidential,
anonymous survey of employees in positions in which background
checks are not conducted to determine the number of people with
records hired.
O. Audit. The Human Resources Department shall conduct a quarterly
audit and submit a report to the City Council which will review the
City's hiring practices in an effort to ensure that people with records
are not unreasonably denied employment with the City.

ARTICLE I
Precautionary Principle
[Adopted 7-10-2013 by Ord. No. 40-2013]
§ 21A-1. Findings.
A. Every Atlantic City resident has an equal right to a healthy and safe
environment. This requires that our air, water, land, and food be of a
sufficiently high standard that individuals and communities can live
healthy, fulfilling, and dignified lives. The duty to enhance, protect and
preserve Atlantic City's environment rests on the shoulders of
government, residents, citizen groups and businesses alike.
B. Historically, environmentally harmful activities have only been stopped
after they have manifested extreme environmental degradation or
exposed people to harm. In the case of PCBs, DDT, lead, and asbestos,
for instance, regulatory action took place only after disaster had struck.
The delay between first knowledge of harm and appropriate action to
deal with it can be measured in human lives cut short.
C. Atlantic City is a leader in making choices based on the least
environmentally harmful alternatives, thereby challenging traditional
assumptions about risk management. The City will implement
numerous ordinances which will include the Integrated Pest
Management Ordinance, the Resource Efficient Building Ordinance,
the Healthy Air Ordinance, the Resource Conservation Ordinance, and
the Environmentally Preferable Purchasing Ordinance in order to
obtain a precautionary approach to specific City purchases and
activities. Internationally, this model is called the Precautionary
Principle.
D. As the City builds a framework for future legislation, the Precautionary
Principle approach will serve as a policy framework to develop and
implement laws for a healthier and more just Atlantic City. In this way,
the City will create and maintain a healthy, viable community
environment for current and future generations, and will become a
model of sustainability.
E. Science and technology are creating new solutions to prevent or
mitigate environmental problems. However, science is also creating
new compounds and chemicals that are already finding their way into
mother's milk and causing other new problems. New legislation may be
required to address these situations, and the Precautionary Principle is
intended as a tool to help promote environmentally healthy alternatives
while weeding out the negative and often unintended consequences of
new technologies.
F. A central element of the precautionary approach is the careful
assessment of available alternatives using the best available science.
An alternatives assessment examines a broad range of options in order
to present the public with the consequences of each approach. The
§ 21A-1 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 21A-1
1:135
§ 21A-2. Policy.
The following shall constitute the City's Precautionary Principle policy. All
officers, boards, commissions, and departments of the City shall implement
the Precautionary Principle in conducting the City's affairs: The
Precautionary Principle requires a thorough exploration and a careful
analysis of a wide range of alternatives. Based on the best available science,
the Precautionary Principle requires the selection of the alternative that
presents the least potential threat to human health and the City's natural
systems. Public participation and an open and transparent decisionmaking
process takes short-term versus long-term effects or costs into
consideration, and evaluates and compares the adverse or potentially
adverse effects of each option, giving preference to those options with
fewer potential hazards. This process allows fundamental questions to
be asked: "Is this potentially hazardous activity necessary?" "What less
hazardous options are available?" and "How little damage is possible?"
G. The alternatives assessment is also a public process because, locally or
internationally, the public bears the ecological and health consequences
of environmental decisions. A government's course of action is
necessarily enriched by broadly based public participation when a full
range of alternatives is considered based on input from diverse
individuals and groups. The public should be able to determine the
range of specific alternatives to be examined. For each alternative, the
public should consider both immediate and long-term consequences, as
well as possible impacts to the local economy.
H. This form of open decisionmaking is in line with Atlantic City's historic
Sunshine Act,59 which allows citizens to have full view of the legislative
process. One of the goals of the Precautionary Principle is to include
citizens as equal partners in decisions affecting their health and
environment.
I. Atlantic City looks forward to the time when the City's power is
generated from renewable sources, when all our waste is recycled,
when our vehicles produce only potable water as emissions, when the
area is free from toxins, and the oceans are free from pollutants. The
Precautionary Principle provides a means to help us attain these goals
as we evaluate future laws and policies in such areas as transportation,
construction, land use, planning, water, energy, health care, recreation,
purchasing, and public expenditure.
J. Transforming our society to realize these goals and achieving a society
living respectfully within the bounds of nature will take a behavioral as
well as technological revolution. The precautionary approach to
decisionmaking will help Atlantic City speed this process of change by
moving beyond finding cures for environmental ills to preventing the
ills before they can do harm.

process are critical to finding and selecting alternatives. Where threats
of serious or irreversible damage to people or nature exist, lack of full
scientific certainty about cause and effect shall not be viewed as sufficient
reason for the City to postpone cost-effective measures to prevent the
degradation of the environment or protect the health of its citizens. Any
gaps in scientific data uncovered by the examination of alternatives will
provide a guidepost for future research, but will not prevent the City from
taking protective action. As new scientific data become available, the City
will review its decisions and make adjustments when warranted. Where
there are reasonable grounds for concern, the precautionary approach to
decisionmaking is meant to help reduce harm by triggering a process to
select the least potential threat. The key elements of the Precautionary
Principle approach to decisionmaking include:
§ 21A-3. Review.
No later than three years from the effective date of this article, and after a
public hearing, the Department of Planning and Development shall submit a
report to the City Council on the effectiveness of the Precautionary Principle
policy.
A. Anticipatory action: There is a duty to take anticipatory action to
prevent harm. Government, business, and community groups, as well as
the general public, share this responsibility.
B. Right to know: The community has a right to know complete and
accurate information on potential human health and environmental
impacts associated with the selection of products, services, operations
or plans. The burden to supply this information lies with the proponent,
not with the general public.
C. Alternatives assessment: An obligation exists to examine a full range of
alternatives and select the alternative with the least potential impact on
human health and the environment, including the alternative of doing
nothing.
D. Full cost accounting: When evaluating potential alternatives, there is a
duty to consider all the reasonably foreseeable costs, including raw
materials, manufacturing, transportation, Precautionary Principle
Policy statement use, cleanup, eventual disposal, and health costs even
if such costs are not reflected in the initial price. Short- and long-term
benefits and time thresholds should be considered when making
decisions.
E. Participatory decision process: Decisions applying the Precautionary
Principle must be transparent, participatory, and informed by the best
available science and other relevant information.
§ 21A-2 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 21A-4
1:137
§ 21A-4. List of ordinances and resolutions required.
The Business Administrator shall produce and maintain a list of all City
ordinances and resolutions which affect or relate to the environment and
shall post this list on the City website.
§ 21A-5. Liability.
The City Council of the City of Atlantic City encourages all City employees
and officials to take the Precautionary Principle into consideration and
evaluate alternatives when taking actions that could impact health and the
environment, especially where those actions could pose threats of serious
harm or irreversible damage. This article does not impose specific duties
upon any City employee or official to take specific actions. In adopting
and undertaking the enforcement of this article, the City of Atlantic City
is assuming an undertaking only to promote the general welfare. It is not
assuming, nor is it imposing on its officers and employees, an obligation for
breach of which it is liable in money damages to any person who claims
that such breach proximately caused injury nor may this article provide any
basis for any other judicial relief, including, but not limited to, a writ of
mandamus or an injunction. In adopting this article, City Council does not
intend to authorize or require the disclosure to the public of any proprietary

services or equipment. All such decisions made by the Office of
Landlord - Tenant Affairs may be appealed to the Board. Tenants are not
limited to the remedies stated herein. Tenants may avail themselves of

more per month, was repealed 12-14-2005 by Ord. No. 102-2005.
§ 41-8 ATLANTIC CITY CODE § 41-10

charge monthly, it shall be prorated among all of the tenants in the
following manner; the total cost of the capital improvement is divided
by the expected life of the capital improvement. This figure represents
the annualized rate. The annualized rate is divided by the number of
apartments in the building. This figure represents the amount each
apartment pays as their pro rata share of the capital improvement.
Five percent of the pro rata improvement is added to this amount. This
represents the amount intended to be a fair return on the landlord's
investment. The pro rata increase is added to the current rent paid by
the tenant and becomes part of the base rent. Commencing with the
month following the approval of the capital improvement increase by
the Office of Landlord - Tenant Affairs, each tenant shall pay his share
of the capital improvement increase in 12 equal monthly payments as
computed herein for each year.
B. Capital improvements increases for individual units. A landlord may
seek a capital improvement increase for any contemplated capital
improvements for an individual unit by applying to the Office of
Landlord-Tenant Affairs. The amount of capital improvement increase
for the individual unit the landlord may charge shall be determined as
follows: the total cost of the improvement shall be divided by the
expected life of the capital improvement. This figure represents the
annualized rate. Five percent of the improvement is added to the
annualized rate. This total represents the per annum charge to the
tenant for the capital improvement to the individual unit. This total is
added to the current rent of the tenant and becomes part of the base
rent. Commencing with the month following the approval of the capital
improvement increase by the Office of Landlord - Tenant Affairs, the
tenant shall pay the capital improvement increase in 12 equal monthly
payments as computed herein.
C. Notice provisions to tenant. A landlord seeking a capital improvement
surcharge shall petition the Landlord - Tenant Affairs Office prior to
performing the work, after first informing all of the tenants by certified
mail or personal service of his intention to seek a capital improvement
surcharge. The landlord shall inform the tenant in the body of the notice
of the calculations involved in determining the increase. The landlord
shall provide a copy of the notice to the tenant to the Office of Landlord
- Tenant Affairs. The Office of Landlord - Tenant Affairs, upon receipt of
the completed application, shall give reasonable opportunity to be
heard to both the landlord and the tenant before making its
determination. Any decision made by the Office of Landlord - Tenant
Affairs regarding capital improvement increase may be appealed to the
Landlord - Tenant Affairs Board by either the landlord or the tenant.
D. Approval of capital improvement increase. Upon the approval of a
capital improvement increase, the landlord must provide to the Office of
Landlord - Tenant Affairs copies of all permits, approvals and final
certificates issued by the Division of Construction of the City of Atlantic

income (NOI)/gross maximized annual income ratio is less than 40%, or

average of three prior years' net operating income to gross maximized
annual income ratio, the landlord may make application to the Office of
Landlord - Tenant Affairs for a hardship increase in rent.
B. It shall be presumed that the rent(s) charged in the three-year base
period yielded a fair net operating income.
C. Upon the establishment by the landlord of the factors set forth in this
section, the Office of Landlord - Tenant Affairs will grant a hardship
surcharge equal to the lesser of:
(1) An increase necessary to provide a current NOI/gross maximized
annual income ratio equal to the average three prior years' net
operating income to gross maximized annual income ratio; or
(2) An increase necessary to provide a current net operating income/
gross maximized annual income ratio of 40%.
D. In all such applications, the landlord shall specifically allege that:
(1) He is an efficient operator of the residential property involved;

from any local health and housing maintenance code violations
which would cause a unit or a structure to become less livable; and

tenants rights.
E. If at any time during the course of a consideration of a hardship
increase pursuant to the provisions of this chapter the Office of

substantial compliance with any or all of the above, the Administrator
may temporarily withhold further consideration of the application for a
hardship increase until such time as the landlord has corrected any
such deficiency.

(2) Repairs and maintenance shall be limited to arm's length
transactions and shall be reasonable and necessary so as not to
cause over-maintenance of the premises. Cost of service contracts

building, but in no event shall painting be prorated over a period of
more than three years for the exterior of common areas;
(3) Purchase of new equipment shall be reflected and prorated over
the useful life of the item;
(4) Legal and accounting expenses shall be limited to reasonable and
necessary costs of the operation of the property;

documentation and shall justify the request for an increase based
on hardship.
H. The landlord shall make application to the Office of Landlord - Tenant
Affairs, together with all necessary certifications, to demonstrate that
he is not earning a fair net operating income. The application shall
include the amount of increase and percentage of increase requested,
together with all facts and figures of at least three years of income and
expenses, if available. At the time of application, the landlord shall
notify all tenants effected by certified mail or personal service that an
application is being made. The landlord shall adhere to the notice
provisions of § 41-10C. The landlord shall also make available to the
tenants and to the Office of Landlord - Tenant Affairs all record's and
books supporting the application. Any interested tenants or group of
tenants or association of tenants who wish to be heard at the public
meeting held in connection with a landlord's application may notify the
Office of Landlord - Tenant Affairs, who will permit that tenant, group of
tenants or association of tenants to be heard. This provision shall be
liberally construed so as to afford ample opportunity for all interested
parties to present their views before the Office of Landlord - Tenant
Affairs.
I. If, due to no fault of the landlord, the Office of Landlord - Tenant Affairs
shall not hear the application within the time parameters set forth in

rent, the landlord shall be limited to only 10% until the Office of
Landlord - Tenant Affairs has reached a final determination. The Office
of Landlord - Tenant Affairs may stay the increase if, in fact, the
landlord has contributed to the delay. Any increase paid by the tenant
shall be without prejudice. If the Office of Landlord - Tenant Affairs
determines that a lesser amount of increase or no increase shall be
allowed, the tenant paying the increase shall be entitled to an
immediate credit against rents due and owing. The credit shall be equal
to the excess rents paid after written notice to the landlord of the
amount involved.
J. The Office of Landlord - Tenant Affairs shall, within 15 days after an
application for a hardship increase is filed, convene a prehearing
conference, which shall include the landlord and tenants for the

under a fair net operating income formula shall be prorated to all of the
units within the structure.
A. Each time a subject apartment is voluntarily vacated by its tenant(s) or
becomes vacant as the result of a court-ordered eviction, the new rent
shall be determined by the landlord. The new rent will become the legal
base rent from which increases will be determined as applications for
which increases are made. The landlord shall notify the Office of
Landlord - Tenant Affairs after each change in tenancy and register the
new rent.
B. The landlord shall also advise the Office of Landlord - Tenant Affairs as

provided current, updated information to the Office, then the
Administrator would have the power to double the base fees, in its
discretion.

Outside Employment of Off-Duty Police Officers
[Adopted 8-12-2015 by Ord. No. 56-2015]
§ 52-31. Outside employment permitted with approval from Chief of
Police.
Police officers may work for outside private contractors and entities on
their off-duty hours with the approval of and provided the Chief of Police
determines, in his discretion, that there are sufficient police personnel
available, that the outside employment assignment will not interfere with
the needs of the City, and that sufficient funds have been deposited in
advance in an escrow account with the City's Chief Financial Officer to
cover the anticipated costs of such off-duty assignments. The City's Chief
Financial Officer shall remit invoices to all outside private contractors and
entities upon notification from the Police Chief on all outside employment.
§ 52-32. Establishment of escrow account.
A. The City shall establish an escrow account dedicated to the payment of
off-duty police officers for outside employment by private contractors or
private entities. Any prospective contractor or private entity must apply
to the Chief of Police, requesting off-duty police services. The Chief of
Police will then notify the Business Administrator and Chief Financial
Officer of the request and forward to them the completed application,
when received. The written application shall include the following
information:
(1) The dates that off-duty police services and police vehicle(s) will be
needed.
(2) An estimate of the number of hours the contractor or private entity
anticipates using the off-duty police officer(s) and, if appropriate,
police vehicles.
(3) A check to cover the cost of off-duty police services and use of any
City vehicles based on the estimated number of hours shall be
submitted before the start of off duty employment in accordance
with state and Division of Local Government Services regulations.
No police officer shall work off duty for any private contractor or
entity prior to clearance of the funds in the escrow account.
B. If the contractor's or private entity's needs exceed the estimated sum in
the escrow account, the City's Chief Financial Officer (or designee)
shall immediately notify the contractor or outside entity that the funds
in the escrow account are insufficient to pay for continued off-duty
police services. The contractor or private entity shall then either
replenish the escrow account with a check sufficient to pay for
continued services or the Chief of Police shall immediately terminate
provision of the off-duty police services to the contractor or private
entity.
§ 52-31 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 52-32
1:225
§ 52-33. Timing of requests and payments.
§ 52-34. Rates for off-duty services.
C. If the contractor's or private entity's estimated costs exceed the actual
costs incurred, then the City shall, upon proper notice to the City's
Chief Financial Officer, refund the remainder of the escrow account.
A. All requests for off-duty police services must be made no later than
1600 hours on the day prior to the request, except in an emergeny
situation.
B. In event of an emergency situation, where written application for offduty
police services cannot be made prior to the date such service is
required, payment for such service must be made to the City within 24
hours after the emergency situation has been resolved or concluded.
For the purpose of this section, "emergency situation" shall mean any
construction, maintenance or repair required to be performed as a
result of an unforeseen event or act of God, whereby the private
contractor had no prior notice of the condition, and off-duty police
services are required for the public safety and welfare, which
determination is left in the sole discretion of the Chief of Police.
A. Rates for off-duty police services are:
(1) The rate of pay for all off-duty police work for a for-profit business
is up to $____ per hour. The rate of pay for all off-duty police work
for a nonprofit entity is $____per hour.
(2) The failure of a contractor or private entity to contact the Police
Department at least 12 hours in advance of the start of an
assignment to cancel the request for off-duty police services will
result in a two-hour minimum charge to the contractor or private
entity. If an officer accepts an off-duty detail for specific hours and
the detail is not worked to completion due to circumstances with
the contractor, the officer may accept full compensation for the
hours scheduled from the contractor. However, this does not
guarantee the officer compensation for all scheduled hours.
(3) In addition to the amounts noted above, a per-hour administrative
fee of 15% will be charged to the contractor or private entity.
B. When a City police vehicle is available and being utilized as an active
traffic control device, the fee charged for use within the City is ____$
per hour with a minimum of $____, but not to exceed $____. The Atlantic
City Board of Education, religious institutions and not-for-profit
organizations within the City shall be exempt from the fees charged for
the use of police vehicles.
§ 52-32 ATLANTIC CITY CODE § 52-35
1:226
§ 52-35. Insurance; indemnification.

Police Department for the services of a police officer during his or her offduty
hours to engage in police-related activities, that outside entity must
comply with the following:
§ 52-36. Provision of other personnel and signage.
In the event a contractor determines not to use off-duty police officers, the
contractor must provide for its own traffic control personnel and signage.
If the Chief of Police determines that the contractor must utilize off-duty
police officers for documented safety purposes, he will notify the contractor,
in writing, and will notify the Business Administrator and Chief Financial
Officer. In no event does this provision preclude the Chief of Police from
using on-duty police officers, at any time, to perform these functions.
A. The employer shall hold the municipality harmless from any and all
claims that may arise as the result of activities or actions of the police
officers hired by the employer, which arise during the course of
employment. The employer shall provide the municipality, prior to
utilization of the municipality's police officers, with a certificate of
insurance from an insurance company acceptable to the municipality
evidencing not less than a minimum of $1,000,000 in comprehensive
general liability (including personal injury with exclusion of A & C
deleted), but not less than the employer covers, and $300,000 in
property damage, as well as a hold harmless agreement inuring to the
benefit of the municipality and shall maintain said coverage at all times
that a police officer of the municipality is employed by the employer.
Such indemnity agreement shall be in a form acceptable to the City
Solicitor.
B. Indemnity shall cover any claim or amount arising out of or recovered
under workers' compensation law. In consideration of hiring off-duty
officers, the outside entity agrees to waive all rights of subrogation
against the City of Atlantic City, its officers, officials, agents and
employees for losses arising from the work performed by the off-duty
police officer.

action shall then be issued by the STC to the City administration for
consideration. Subsequently, a formal determination shall be made by

premises or other factors, which render systematic inspections of
such buildings necessary in the interest of public health and safety.

Beach Protection Code
[Adopted 6-7-1989 by Ord. No. 22-1989]
§ 92-31. Legislative findings.
§ 92-32. Definitions.
As used in this article, the following terms shall have the meanings
indicated:
ACCRETION — Includes either natural or artificial land. "Natural accretion"
is the buildup of land solely by action of the forces of nature on a beach
by deposition of waterborne or airborne material. "Artificial accretion" is a
similar buildup of land by reason of an act of man, such as the accretion
formed by a breakwater or beachfill deposited by mechanical means.
BEACH — Gently sloping, unvegetated areas of sand or other
unconsolidated material that extends landward from the mean high-water
line to where there is a marked change in the material of physiographic
form, i.e., dune or boardwalk.
A. It has been clearly demonstrated that well established and protected
sand dunes, together with properly maintained beach and dune areas,
are an effective protection against high tides and flooding and against
property damage by the ocean under storm conditions and provide
desirable protection of the coastal areas adjacent thereto, and the State
of New Jersey, along with its political subdivisions and their inhabitants,
has an interest in the continued protection and preservation thereof
and in the restoration of them in the event of property damage or
destruction.
B. The developed coastal area of New Jersey, including developed barrier
islands and adjacent shorefront areas, represents a unique and
invaluable social, economic, recreational and aesthetic resource.
C. Given the present degree of commercial and residential development in
these areas, given the measurable and intangible benefits that accrue
to the residents of the State of New Jersey and the public at large from
the beach, boating, fishing and vacation facilities that this diversely
developed coastal area offers and given the present extensive
knowledge of the protective and restorative nature of beach
nourishment, dune creation, dune restoration and other selected
coastal engineering programs, it is hereby declared that it is
appropriate, essential, feasible and in the public interest to preserve,
protect and enhance these coastal regions in their developed state.
D. It is the purpose of this article to define the areas so affected and to
establish regulations to assure their continued effectiveness. The
Article is declared to be an exercise of the police power in the interest
of safety and welfare and for the protection of persons and property.
§ 92-31 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 92-32
1:403
DUNE — A wind- or wave-deposited formation of vegetated or drifting
windblown sand, generally parallel and landward between the inland limit
of the beach and the foot of the most inland dune slope, including primary,
secondary and tertiary dunes where they exist. Formations of sand
immediately adjacent to beaches that are stabilized by retaining structures,
such as snow fences, planted vegetation and other measures, are
considered to be natural "dunes," regardless of the degree of modification
of the dune by wind or wave action or disturbance by development. A "dune"
shall not include loose windblown sand found in a street, on part of a
structure or against any structures such as comfort stations, lifeguard tents,
pavilions or the Boardwalk as a result of wind or storm activity.
DUNE DEVELOPMENT DISTRICT (DDD) — An area located seaward of the
Boardwalk delineating a beach zone presently without dunes. The width
of the "DDD" will extend an average of 50 feet from the boardwalk line
toward the ocean. Placement of fence and planting of vegetation will be
completed in an effort to trap windblown sand and develop a dune. The
"DDD" is considered to have dynamic boundaries which move in response to
seasonal winds and storms. Consequently, the boundaries of the "DDD" will
be reviewed every 12 months and following any storm which damages large
portions of the District. The boundary review process will be conducted by
the City Council, the Department of Public Works and representatives of the
New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection, Division of Coastal
Resources.
EROSION — The wearing away of land by the action of natural forces; on a
beach, the carrying away of beach sediments by wave action, tidal currents,
littoral currents and wind.
MEAN SEA LEVEL — The 1929 datum established by the United States
Coast and Geodetic Survey or such other datum as may be established by
the United States Army Corps of Engineers or other properly authorized
agencies.
PERSON — Natural persons, partnerships, firms, associations, joint-stock
companies, syndicates and corporations and any receiver, trustee,
conservator or other officer appointed pursuant to law or by any court,
state or federal. "Person" also means the State of New Jersey, counties,
municipalities, authorities, other political subdivisions and all departments
and agencies within the aforementioned governmental entities.
SAND FENCE — Includes the term snow fence and shall mean a barricade
established in a line or pattern to accumulate sand and aid in the formation
of a dune. It shall include and normally be limited to the commercial variety
of light, wooden picket fence held together by wire and secured by posts.
SHOREFRONT PROTECTION AREA — That area which extends from the
mean high water line to the seaward toe of the dune, as herein before
defined.

The City of Atlantic City hereby declares and finds that there exists in
the municipality a building or buildings, or parts thereof, which are unfit
for human habitation or occupancy or use due to dilapidation, defects
increasing the hazards of fire, accident or other calamities, lack of
ventilation, light or sanitary facilities or due to other conditions rendering
such building or buildings, or part thereof, unsafe or insanitary or
dangerous or detrimental to the health or safety or otherwise inimical to
the welfare of the residents of the municipality, and the City of Atlantic City
desires to exercise the powers set forth in N.J.S.A. 40:48-2.3 et seq. and the
several supplements and amendments thereto.
A. Structures that are vacant for an extended period of time and in a state
of disrepair or boarded (hereinafter referred to as "vacant buildings")
can be considered public nuisances and unfit buildings because they
are the breeding ground for vermin, create targets for vandals and
arsonists, serve as temporary refuge for derelicts, vagrants, and
criminals, become attractive nuisances to children and become a venue
for crime; and
B. Vacant buildings cause a decrease in neighboring property values,
make it more difficult or impossible for neighboring property owners to
secure homeowner's insurance and contribute to blight; and
C. The property surrounding vacant buildings invites the dumping of
garbage and rubbish, increases the incidents of weeds, high grass and
unsightly and rubbish-strewn grounds, and otherwise harms the
aesthetic environment of the community; and
D. The City recognizes the "broken window" concept: that even a single
broken window, left unrepaired, can lead to more broken windows and
to further vandalism and disrepair by giving the appearance that no one
cares for or protects the property so that the building becomes
increasingly dilapidated; and

The Director of Licensing and Inspections, having charge of the Division of
Construction and Division of Code Enforcement, is hereby designated as the
public officer to exercise the powers prescribed by this chapter.
§ 108-3. Enforcement procedures.
E. The abatement of the nuisance caused by vacant buildings left
unoccupied for extended periods of time is in the best interests of the
citizens of Atlantic City.
F. Structures that are wholly or partially boarded up ("partially boarded
buildings"), where the boards are uncut to fit the openings, unpainted
(or covered with exterior weathertight material) and do not comply with
established and industry-approved design standards, are public
nuisances as they are the breeding ground for vermin, create targets
for vandals and arsonists, serve as temporary refuge in parts for
derelicts, vagrants and criminals, become attractive nuisances to
children, and become a venue for crime. Partially boarded buildings
cause a decrease in neighboring property values, make it more difficult
or impossible for neighboring property owners to secure homeowners
insurance, and contribute to blight. The City recognizes the "broken
window" concept that even a single window in disrepair or boarded
over, left in that condition, can lead to further vandalism and disrepair.
The abatement of the nuisance caused by partially boarded buildings
left in that state for an extended period of time is in the best interests of
the citizens of Atlantic City [Added 4-11-2012 by Ord. No. 2-2012]
A. Whenever a petition is filed with the public officer by a public authority
or by at least five residents of the municipality charging that any
building is unfit for human habitation or occupancy or use or whenever
it appears to the public officer (on his own motion) that any building is
unfit for human habitation or occupancy or use, the public officer shall,
if his preliminary investigation discloses a basis for such charges, issue
and cause to be served upon the owner of and parties in interest in such
building a complaint stating the charges in that respect and containing
a notice that a hearing will be held before the public officer (or his
designated agent) at a place therein fixed not less than 10 days nor
more than 30 days after the serving of said complaint; that the owner
and parties in interest shall be given the right to file an answer to the
complaint and to appear in person, or otherwise, and give testimony at
the place and time fixed in the complaint; and that the rules of evidence
prevailing in the courts shall not be controlling in hearings before the
public officer.
B. If, after such notice and hearing, the public officer determines that the
building, buildings or parts thereof are unfit for human habitation or
occupancy or use, he shall state in writing his findings of fact in support
§ 108-1 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 108-3
1:441
of such determination and shall issue and cause to be served upon the
owner thereof and parties in interest an order requiring the repair,
alteration or improvement of said building, buildings or part thereof
to be made by the owner within a reasonable time, which time shall
be set forth in the order, or, at the option of the owner, to vacate or
have said building vacated and closed within the time set forth in the
order; and if the building, buildings or parts thereof are in such a
condition as to make it dangerous to the health and safety of persons
on or near the premises, and the owner fails to repair, alter or improve
said building, buildings or parts thereof within the time specified in
the order, then the owner shall be required to remove or demolish
said building, buildings or parts thereof within a reasonable time as
specified in said order of removal.
C. If the owner fails to comply with an order to repair, alter or improve or,
at the option of the owner, to vacate and close the building, the public
officer may cause such building to be repaired, altered or improved or
to be vacated and closed, the public officer may cause to be posted on
the main entrance of any building so closed a placard with the following
words: "This building is unfit for human habitation or occupancy or use;
the use or occupation of this building is prohibited and unlawful." It
shall be unlawful for any person to own, have, keep, maintain or live in
any building on which there has been posted a placard as herein
provided for or to remove or cause the removal of any such posted
placard. [Amended 10-24-2007 by Ord. No. 84-2007]
D. If the owner fails to comply with an order to remove or demolish the
building, the public officer may cause such building, buildings or parts
thereof to be removed or demolished or may contract for the removal or
demolition thereof after advertisement for and receipt of bids therefor.
The removal or demolition thereof shall be in accordance with
Ordinance No. 12 of 1963 and any amendments thereto.137 [Amended
5-16-1984 by Ord. No. 28-1984]
E. The amount of the cost of the filing of legal papers, expert witnesses'
fees, search fees and advertising charges incurred in the course of any
proceeding taken under this chapter and determined in favor of the
municipality, and such cost of such repairs, alterations or
improvements, or vacating and closing, or removal or demolition,
including grading and seeding, if any, or the amount of the balance
thereof remaining after deduction of sum, if any, realized from the sale
of materials derived from such building or from any contract removal or
demolition thereof, and the amount so charged, with an additional
administrative fee of $100, shall forthwith become a lien upon the lands
and shall be added to and become and form part of the taxes next to be
assessed and levied upon such lands, the same to bear interest at the
same rate as taxes, and shall be collected and enforced by the same
officers and in the same manner as taxes. If the building is removed or

demolished by the public officer, he shall sell the materials of such
building. There shall be credited against the cost of the removal or
demolition thereof the proceeds of any sale of such materials or any
sum derived from any contract of the removal or demolition of the
building. If there are no such credits or if the total sum of such costs
exceeds the total of such credits, a detailed statement of the aforesaid
costs and the amounts so due shall be filed by the municipal tax
assessor or other custodian of the records of tax liens, and a copy
thereof shall be forwith forwarded to the owner by registered mail.
If the total credits exceed such costs, the balance remaining shall be
deposited in the Superior Court by the public officer, shall be secured in
such manner as may be directed by such Court and shall be disbursed
according to the order or judgment of the Court to the persons found to
be entitled thereto by final order or judgment of such Court; provided,
however, that nothing in this section shall be construed to impair or
limit in any way the power of the municipality to define and declare

expeditiously as possible. The public officer shall require all property
inspections be done immediately and a report issued within 24 hours.
[Amended 10-24-2007 by Ord. No. 84-2007]
A. Whenever a petition is filed with the public officer by a public authority
or by at least five residents of the municipality charging that any vacant
building as defined in this chapter is a public nuisance or whenever it
appears to the public officer (on his own motion) that any vacant
building is a public nuisance as defined in § 104-1, the public officer
shall, if his preliminary investigation discloses a basis for such charges,
issue and cause to be served upon the owner of and parties in interest
in such building a complaint stating the charges in that respect and
containing a notice that a hearing will be held before the public officer
(or his designated agent) at a place therein fixed not less than 10 days
nor more than 30 days after the serving of said complaint; that the
owner and parties in interest shall be given the right to file an answer to
the complaint and to appear in person, or otherwise, and give testimony
at the place and time fixed in the complaint; and that the rules of
§ 108-3 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 108-3.1
1:443
evidence prevailing in the courts shall not be controlling in hearings
before the public officer.
B. If, after such notice and hearing, the public officer determines that the
vacant building is a public nuisance, he shall state, in writing, his
findings of fact in support of such determination and shall issue and
cause to be served upon the owner thereof and parties in interest an
order requiring the repair, alteration or improvement of said building,
buildings or part thereof to be made by the owner within a reasonable
time, which time shall be set forth in the order; and if the owner fails to
repair, alter or improve said building, as the case may be, within the
time specified in the order, then the owner shall be required to remove
or demolish said building, buildings or parts thereof within a
reasonable time as specified in said order of removal.
C. If the owner fails to comply with an order to remove or demolish the
building, the public officer may cause such building, buildings or parts
thereof to be removed or demolished or may contract for the removal or

including grading and seeding, if any, or the amount of the balance
thereof remaining after deduction of the sum, if any, realized from the
sale of materials derived from such building or from any contract for
removal or demolition thereof, shall be a municipal lien against the real
property upon which such cost was incurred. If the building is removed
or demolished by the public officer, he shall sell the materials of such
building. There shall be credited against the cost of the removal or
demolition thereof the proceeds of any sale of such materials or any
sum derived from any contract for the removal or demolition of the
building. If there are no such credits or if the total sum of such costs
exceeds the total of such credits, a detailed statement of the aforesaid
costs and the amount so due shall be filed with the municipal tax
assessor or other custodian of the records of tax liens, and a copy
thereof shall be forthwith forwarded to the owner by registered mail. If
the total credits exceed such costs, the balance remaining shall be
deposited in the Superior Court by the public officer, shall be secured in
such manner as may be directed by such Court and shall be disbursed
according to the order or judgment of the Court to the persons found to
be entitled thereto by final order or judgment of such Court; provided,
however, that nothing in this section shall be construed to impair or
limit in any way the power of the municipality to define and declare
nuisances and to cause their removal or abatement by summary
proceedings or otherwise. Any owner or party in interest may, within 60
days from the date of the filing of the lien certificate, proceed in a
summary manner in the Superior Court to contest the reasonableness

§ 109-4. Documents to accompany application for license.

§ 109-5. Fingerprinting; criminal history investigation. [Amended
8-23-1989 by Ord. No. 42-1989]
A. Every applicant for a license pursuant to § 109-1 hereof shall be
fingerprinted by Sagem Morpho, Inc. To provide for a timely and
efficient criminal history background review, the City of Atlantic City
will be utilizing the state-police-coordinated, non-criminal-justice
fingerprinting process known as "Live Scan." The State of New Jersey
has contracted with a vendor, Sagem Morpho, Inc., to perform this
service. The company has established permanent sites throughout the
state as well as several mobile units available to meet its contractual
agreement. Sagem Morpho charges a fee for the fingerprinting for
which the applicant will be responsible. There will be an additional fee
of $20 payable to the City of Atlantic City, for the processing of the
fingerprint documentation required by Sagem Morpho. The Chief of
Police or his designee shall conduct a criminal history background
check upon any such applicant to determine whether the applicant has
been convicted, whether by trier of fact or a plea of guilty, under the
laws of the State of New Jersey of an offense involving dishonesty or of
a crime of the third degree or above, pursuant to New Jersey law, or
under the laws of another state or of the United States of an offense or a
crime which, if committed in the State of New Jersey, would be such an
offense or crime. No license shall be issued to any applicant found to
have a criminal history of conviction of such offenses or crimes.

Police or his designee shall forthwith advise the Director of Revenue
and Finance regarding such finding. Thereafter the Director of Revenue
and Finance or his designee shall give written notice to the applicant
regarding his or her ineligibility for licensure, which notice shall also
state the reason therefore.

proposed new location is in compliance, the prior license shall be
surrendered by the licensee and a new license setting forth the new location
shall be issued to the licensee upon the receipt of a two-hundred-dollar
license fee. Should the Land Use Administrator determine that the proposed
new location is not in compliance with local land use regulations, no license
shall be issued for such new location. For any such move sought after July
1 but prior to January 1 of the licensing year, the applicant or licensee

Chapter 115
CURFEW
§ 115-1. Title.
This chapter may be cited as the "Juvenile Curfew Act of 2006."
§ 115-2. Findings and purpose.
A. The City Council of the City of Atlantic City ("Council") has determined
that there has been an increase in juvenile violence, juvenile gang
activity and crime by persons under the age of 18 years in the City of
Atlantic City and that much of said activity takes place during night and
evening hours.
B. The Council has further determined that there has been a significant
breakdown in the supervision and guidance normally provided by
parents and guardians for persons under the age of 18 years, resulting
in juveniles being involved in a wide range of unacceptable behavior
and illegal activities. [Amended 7-9-2014 by Ord. No. 35-2014]
C. The Council has further determined that persons under the age of 18
years are particularly susceptible, because of their lack of maturity and
experience, to involvement in unlawful activities and to be victims of
perpetrators of crime.
D. The Council has further determined that the offensive and illegal
activities of minors are not easily controlled by existing laws and
ordinances because the activities are easily concealed whenever police
officers are present, and the establishment of reasonable curfew
regulations will enable the community to better control the free and
unobstructed access to the streets and public places by the majority of
residents and will enable the police to act reasonably and fairly to
prevent the violation of laws and ordinances by juveniles. [Amended
7-9-2014 by Ord. No. 35-2014]
E. The Council has further determined that a curfew for persons under the
age of 18 years meets a local need and that curfew ordinances in other
communities have been a significant factor in minimizing juvenile
delinquency. A curfew in the City of Atlantic City is particularly
appropriate in view of the high population density and the mixed use of
residential and commercial areas. The regulation of juveniles is an
attempt to minimize danger to juveniles and the community during
nighttime hours when criminal activity is more prevalent. [Amended
7-9-2014 by Ord. No. 35-2014]
F. The Council determines that passage of a curfew will protect the
welfare of juveniles by: [Amended 7-9-2014 by Ord. No. 35-2014]

profit to which the public is invited, including but not limited to any place of

parent or is responsible for the care and welfare of the juvenile.
JUVENILE — An individual who is under the age of 18 years.[Added
7-9-2014 by Ord. No. 35-2014143]

21 years of age who is authorized by the natural parent, adoptive parent,

PUBLIC PLACE — Any place to which the public or a substantial group of
the public has access, including but not limited to a public street, road,

or digging and within a fence of at least six feet in height separated
by at least three feet from the confined area. The owner of a
potentially dangerous dog shall securely lock the enclosure to
prevent the entry of the general public and to preclude any release

individual. The potentially dangerous dog shall be confined in the
enclosure or, if taken out of the enclosure, securely muzzled and
restrained with a tether approved by the Animal Control Officer

direct supervision of the owner.
B. May require the owner to comply with the following conditions:
(1) To maintain liability insurance in an amount determined by the

potentially dangerous dog. The liability insurance, which may be
separate from any other homeowner policy, shall contain a
provision naming the City of Atlantic City as an additional insured

ARTICLE I
Statutory Authority; Findings; Purpose and Objectives
§ 132-1. Statutory authority.
The Legislature of the State of New Jersey has, in N.J.S.A. 40:48-1 et
seq., delegated the responsibility to local governmental units to adopt
regulations designed to promote public health, safety, and general welfare
of its citizenry. Therefore, the City Council of the City of Atlantic City, of
Atlantic County, New Jersey, does ordain as follows.
§ 132-2. Findings of fact.
§ 132-3. Statement of purpose.
It is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health, safety, and
general welfare, and to minimize public and private losses due to flood
conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to:
A. The flood hazard areas of the City of Atlantic City are subject to periodic
inundation which results in loss of life and property, health and safety
hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services,
extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief, and
impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public
health, safety, and general welfare.
B. These flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions in
areas of special flood hazard which increase flood heights and
velocities, and when inadequately anchored, cause damage in other
areas. Uses that are inadequately floodproofed, elevated or otherwise
protected from flood damage also contribute to the flood loss.
A. Protect human life and health;
B. Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects;
C. Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding
and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
D. Minimize prolonged business interruptions;
E. Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas
mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located
in areas of special flood hazard;
F. Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the second use and
development of areas of special flood hazard so as to minimize future
flood blight areas;
G. Ensure that potential buyers are notified that property is in an area of
special flood hazard; and
§ 132-1 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 132-3
1:537
§ 132-4. Methods of reducing flood losses.
In order to accomplish its purposes, this chapter includes methods and
provisions for:
H. Ensure that those who occupy the areas of special flood hazard assume
responsibility for their actions.
A. Restricting or prohibiting uses which are dangerous to health, safety,
and property due to water or erosion hazards, or which result in
damaging increases in erosion or in flood heights or velocities;
B. Requiring that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which serve
such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction;
C. Controlling the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and
natural protective barriers, which help accommodate or channel
floodwaters;
D. Controlling filling, grading, dredging, and other development which
may increase flood damage; and
E. Preventing or regulating the construction of flood barriers which will
unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards in
other areas.

Definitions
§ 132-5. Word usage.
Unless specifically defined below, words or phrases used in this chapter
shall be interpreted so as to give them the meaning they have in common
usage and to give this chapter its most reasonable application.
§ 132-6. Terms defined.
As used in this chapter, the following terms shall have the meanings
indicated:
ADVISORY BASE FLOOD ELEVATION (ABFE) — The elevation shown on
a community's Advisory Flood Hazard Map that indicates the advisory
stillwater elevation plus wave effect (ABFE equals SWEL plus wave effect)
resulting from a flood that has a one-percent or greater chance of being
equaled or exceeded in any given year.
ADVISORY FLOOD HAZARD AREA (AFHA) — The land in the floodplain
within a community subject to flooding from the one-percent annual chance
event depicted on the Advisory Flood Hazard Map.
ADVISORY FLOOD HAZARD MAP — The official map on which the Federal
Emergency Management Administration has delineated the areas of
advisory flood hazards applicable to the community.

community's Digital Flood Insurance Rate Map (DFIRM) with a one-percent
annual or greater chance of flooding to an average depth of one to three feet
where a clearly defined channel does not exist, where the path of flooding
is unpredictable and where velocity flow may be evident. Such flooding is
characterized by ponding or sheet flow.
AREA OF SPECIAL FLOOD HAZARD — The land in the floodplain within
a community subject to a one-percent or greater chance of flooding in any
given year.
BASE FLOOD — The flood having a one-percent chance of being equaled or
exceeded in any given year.

ground level) on all sides.
BREAKAWAY WALL — A wall that is not part of the structural support of
the building and is intended through its design and construction to collapse
under specific lateral loading forces without causing damage to the elevated
portion of the building or supporting foundation system.
COASTAL HIGH HAZARD AREA — An area of special flood hazard
extending from offshore to the inland limit of a primary frontal dune along
§ 132-5 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 132-6
1:539
an open coast and any other area subject to high velocity wave action from
storms or seismic sources.
DEVELOPMENT — Any man-made change to improved or unimproved real

on which the Federal Insurance Administration has delineated both the
areas of special flood hazard and the risk premium zones applicable to the
community.
ELEVATED BUILDING — A nonbasement building built, in the case of a
building in an area of special flood hazard, to have the top of the elevated
floor or, in the case of a building in a coastal high-hazard area, to have
the bottom of the lowest horizontal structural member of the elevated
floor, elevated above the base flood elevation by means of piling, columns
(posts and piers), or shear walls parallel to the flow of the water, and
adequately anchored so as not to impair the structural integrity of the
building during a flood up to the magnitude of the base flood. In an area of
special flood hazard "elevated building" also includes a building elevated by
means of fill or solid foundation perimeter walls with openings sufficient to
facilitate the unimpeded movement of floodwaters. In areas of coastal high
hazard, "elevated buildings" also includes a building otherwise meeting the

include land preparation, such as clearing, grading and filling nor does
it include the installation of streets and/or walkways, nor does it include
excavation for a basement, footings or piers, or foundations or the erection
of temporary forms, nor does it include the installation on the property
of accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling
units or not part of the main structure. For a substantial improvement, the
"actual start of construction" means the first alteration of any wall, ceiling,
floor, or other structural part of a building, whether or not that alteration
affects the external dimensions of the building.

damage;
(c) The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to
flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual
owner;
(d) The importance of the services provided by the proposed
facility to the community;
(e) The necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where
applicable;
(f) The availability of alternative locations for the proposed use
which are not subject to flooding or erosion damage;
(g) The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and
anticipated development;
(h) The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive
plan and floodplain management program of that area;
(i) The safety of access to the property in times of flood for
ordinary and emergency vehicles;
(j) The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise, and
sediment transport of the floodwaters and the effects of wave
action, if applicable, expected at the site; and
(k) The costs of providing governmental services during and after
flood conditions, including maintenance and repair of public
§ 132-16 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 132-16
1:549
utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water
systems, and streets and bridges.
(5) Upon consideration of the factors of Subsection A(4) and the
purposes of this chapter, the Construction Board of Appeals may
attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems
necessary to further the purposes of this chapter.
(6) The Construction Official shall maintain the records of all appeal
actions, including technical information, and report any variances
to the Federal Insurance Administration upon request.
B. Conditions for variances.
(1) Generally, variances may be issued for new construction and
substantial improvements to be erected on a lot of 1/2 acre or less
in size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing
structures constructed below the base flood level, providing items
in Subsection A(4)(a) through (k) have been fully considered. As the
lot size increases beyond the 1/2 acre, the technical justification
required for issuing the variance increases.
(2) Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic
structures upon a determination that the proposed repair or
rehabilitation will not preclude the structure's continued
designation as a historic structure and the variance is the minimum
necessary to preserve the historic character and design of the
structure.
(3) Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the
variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard,
to afford relief.
(4) Variances shall only be issued upon:
(a) A showing of good and sufficient cause;
(b) A determination that failure to grant the variance would result
in exceptional hardship to the applicant; and
(c) A determination that the granting of a variance will not result
in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety,
extraordinary public expense, create nuisances, cause fraud on
or victimization of the public as identified in Subsection A(4),
or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances.
(5) Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written
notice that the structure will be permitted to be built with a lowest
floor elevation below the base flood elevation and that the cost of
flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk
resulting from the reduced lowest floor elevation.

issued by the zoning construction officer for changes to the interior of a
structure.
B. A certificate of appropriateness shall not be required for exterior
repainting or interior painting of existing structures. If an exterior
material, finish or surface is to be painted which was not previously
painted, a certificate of appropriateness will be required.
C. A certificate of appropriateness shall not be required if, in the opinion of
the Historic Administrative Officer or Minor Work Review Committee,
the work contemplated constitutes "ordinary maintenance and repair"
as defined by this chapter. In such cases, and if a permit is required for
the proposed work, the Commission shall promptly notify the zoning/

repairs which do not alter the exterior appearance.
E. A certificate of appropriateness shall not be required for any changes,
additions or alterations not visible from a public right-of-way, except for
relocation or demolition.
F. Work may be performed when an historic landmark requires immediate
emergency repair to preserve the continued habitability of the
landmark and/or the health and safety of its occupants or others.
(1) Such emergency repairs may be performed, in accordance with
City building codes, without the necessity of first obtaining the
Commission's review.
(2) Under such circumstances, the repairs performed shall only be
such that are necessary to maintain the habitability of the
structure.
(3) A request for the Commission's review shall be made as soon as
possible and no additional work shall be performed upon the
structure until an appropriate request for approval is made and

appropriateness may present a proposal for informal concept review
and comment by the Commission and shall first hold an informal
informational meeting with the Historic Commission Administrative
Officer to review any design proposals or related issues.
B. Persons proposing to make application to the Commission in connection
with any action that requires a certificate of appropriateness are
encouraged to first hold an informal informational meeting with the
Commission Administrative Officer to review any design proposals or
related issues before making application.
C. Neither the applicant nor the Commission shall be bound by any such
review. Informal concept or informational review shall not relieve the
necessity for Commission review for a certificate of appropriateness
pursuant to this chapter.
A. Pursuant to N.J.S.A. 40:55D-110, the City Planning Board and Zoning
Board of Adjustment shall refer to the Historic Preservation
§ 148-16 ATLANTIC CITY CODE § 148-18
1:658
§ 148-19. Procedures for Commission review of work on historic
sites, landmarks and within historic districts.

Board that involves development involving historic landmarks or
involves properties located within historic districts identified in the
City's Historic Preservation Element of its Master Plan, as updated by
regular surveys.
(1) This referral shall be made when the application for development is
deemed complete or is scheduled for a hearing, whichever occurs
sooner.
(2) Failure to refer an application as required shall not invalidate any
hearing or proceeding.
(3) The Historic Preservation Commission may provide its advice on
said application, through oral testimony at the hearing, and/or
through written report(s) that the Commission may provide to the
Board concerning the proposed application.
B. On all matters referred to the Historic Preservation Commission which
require approval by the City Planning Board and Zoning Board of
Adjustment, the decision of the Commission shall be advisory only.

applicable, shall consider the testimony and/or written report(s)
presented and may disapprove or change any of the
recommendations made by the Commission by a vote of a majority
of its full authorized membership and shall record in its minutes the
reasons for not following such recommendations.
C. Yard variances.
(1) It is in the public interest to retain a neighborhood's historic
appearance by approving variances to normal yard requirements.
(2) Where it is deemed that such variance will not adversely affect
neighboring properties, the appropriate board may grant such
variance to standard requirements if so recommended by the
Historic Preservation Commission.
D. An approval by the City Planning Board and Zoning Board of
Adjustment, as the case may be, does not relieve the applicant of the
requirement of obtaining a certificate of appropriateness from the
Commission for those historic aspects of the work not addressed as part
of the application for development.

Historic Commission Administrative Officer shall classify the
application as a major application and follow the process as set forth in
§ 148-21 below.
D. If the action for which the certificate of appropriateness is requested
meets the definition of a minor work application, then the Historic
Commission Administrative Officer shall classify the application as a
minor application and be guided by the process as set forth in § 148-20
below.

the proposed addition, removal or alteration is not sufficiently
visible from any viewing-point normally accessible to the
public to adversely impact the historic viewscape, the
Commission may by majority vote of the full authorized
§ 148-21 ATLANTIC CITY CODE § 148-21
1:662
§ 148-22. Standards and criteria for review.
membership grant a certificate of appropriateness on that
basis.
(2) In any instance where the Commission disapproves an application,
the Commission, through the Historic Commission Administrative
Officer, shall notify the applicant with a certified copy of the
resolution of that determination. A summary of the Commission's
action, with the full language of the resolution, shall be published
in the official minutes of the Commission, and be made available on
request.
(3) All decisions of the Historic Preservation Commission, whether
approval, approval with conditions or denial, shall be published in
the official newspaper of record as a summary of the Commission's
action.
G. A certificate of appropriateness shall be valid for a period of two
calendar years from the date it is issued by the Commission's
Administrative Officer.
A. The purpose of this section is to provide uniform standards and criteria
for the regulation of historic landmarks and historic districts for use by
the Historic Preservation Commission.
B. All projects requiring a certificate of appropriateness and all
applications for development on historic landmarks or in historic
districts shall, in interpreting and applying the standards and criteria
set forth herein, be guided by the principles contained in the most
current versions of The Secretary of the Interior's Standards for the
Treatment of Historic Properties with Guidelines for Preserving,
Rehabilitating, Restoring and Reconstructing Historic Buildings. These
standards are adopted as the Commission's design criteria and
guidelines pursuant to N.J.S.A. 40:55D-65.1.
C. In utilizing The Secretary of the Interior's Standards, the Commission
shall be guided by the provisions thereof including, but not limited to,
the following:
(1) A property shall be used for its historic purpose or be placed in a
new use that requires minimal change to the defining
characteristics of the building and its site and environment.
(2) The historic character of a property shall be retained and
preserved. The removal of historic materials or alteration of
features and spaces that characterize a property shall be avoided.
(3) Each property shall be recognized as a physical record of its time,
place and use. Changes that create a false sense of historical
development, such as adding conjectural features or architectural
elements from other buildings, shall not be undertaken.
§ 148-21 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 148-22
1:663
(4) Most properties change over time; those changes that have
acquired historic significance in their own right shall be retained
and preserved.
(5) Distinctive features, finishes, and construction techniques or
examples of craftsmanship that characterize a property shall be
preserved.
(6) Deteriorated historic features shall be repaired rather than
replaced. Where the severity of deterioration requires replacement
of a distinctive feature, the new feature shall match the old in
design, color, texture and other visual qualities and, where
possible, materials. Replacement of missing features shall be
substantiated by documentary, physical, or pictorial evidence.
(7) Chemical or physical treatments, such as sandblasting, that cause
damage to historic materials shall not be used. The surface
cleaning of structures, if appropriate, shall be undertaken using the
gentlest means possible.
(8) Significant archeological resources affected by a project shall be
protected and preserved. If such resources must be disturbed,
mitigation measures shall be undertaken.
(9) New additions, exterior alterations, or related new construction
shall not destroy historic materials that characterize the property.
The new work shall be differentiated from the old and shall be
compatible with the massing, size, scale and architectural features
to protect the historic integrity of the property and its environment.
(10)New additions and adjacent or related new construction shall be
undertaken in such a manner that if removed in the future, the
essential form and integrity of the historic property and its
environment would be unimpaired.
D. In reviewing applications for certificates of appropriateness, the
Historic Preservation Commission shall consider the siting,
arrangement, exterior design, design quality, bulk, arrangement,
density, texture, details, style, scale, setbacks, stepbacks, shape, height,
massing, lot coverage, rhythm, directional emphasis, proportions,
building elements, materials, finishes and relationships to the
streetscape and/or landscape views of the proposed work and the
relationship of those characteristics to the historical significance of the
historic landmark or historic district.
E. Criteria for review.
(1) The following criteria shall be given consideration when the
Commission reviews historic sites/landmarks:
(a) The historical value of the landscape or streetscape;
§ 148-22 ATLANTIC CITY CODE § 148-22
1:664
§ 148-23. Demolitions and relocations.
(b) The historical value of a building, structure, site, object,
improvement or district and its relationship to property of the
surrounding area;
(c) The general compatibility of the proposed use to the historical
value of the surrounding historic district. In regard to an
application for new construction, alterations, additions or
replacements affecting an historic site or an improvement
within an historic district, and in addition to the criteria set
forth in § 148-22D above, the following factors shall be
considered in relation to its setting and context, including:
[1] Height.
[2] Massing.
[3] Proportion of the width and height of the building's
facades.
[4] Proportion of openings within the building.
[5] Rhythm of spacing of buildings on streets.
[6] Rhythm of solids to voids on facades fronting on public
places.
[7] Relationship of materials and texture.
[8] Construction in range of design and style options which
are consistent with neighboring buildings in the historic
district.
(d) The general compatibility of the exterior design, arrangement,
texture and materials proposed to be used with the historical
value of the surrounding area. In carrying out its design review
under these guidelines, the following criteria shall be utilized:
[1] All exterior elevations, including the roof, must be
maintained and new construction must be compatible with
existing structures, districts and surrounding areas.
[2] In-kind or similarly compatible building materials must be
utilized.
(2) For noncontributing structures/sites, only the criteria in
§ 148-22E(1)(d) shall be considered by the Commission.
A. Criteria.
(1) In regard to an application to demolish or relocate an historic
landmark or an historic district resource, the following matters
shall be considered:
§ 148-22 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 148-23
1:665
(a) Its importance to the City and the extent to which its historical
or architectural value is such that its removal would be
detrimental to the public interest.
(b) Its status with regard to the New Jersey and National Registers
of Historic Places; i.e., whether it is individually listed or
eligible to be listed; whether it is a part of a registered or
eligible historic district; and whether, within that district, it is a
key, contributing or noncontributing building.
(c) Its current and potential use for those purposes currently
permitted by the zoning ordinance or for the use proposed.
(d) The probable impact of its removal upon the ambiance of the
historic landmark or historic district.
(e) Whether the site contains any extant archaeological resources.
(f) Whether the historic landmark represents the last or best
remaining example of its kind in the City that possesses
research potential or public education values.
(g) Whether the historic landmark can be preserved by protecting
its location from disturbance.
(h) Whether redesign of the development proposal to avoid impact
can result in the preservation of the building or structure in
question.
(i) The structural soundness and integrity of the building,
structure, site, object or improvement and the economic
feasibility of restoring or rehabilitating same so as to comply
with the requirements of the applicable construction codes.
(j) The compelling reasons for not retaining the building,
structure, site, object or improvement at its present location,
the proximity of the proposed new location and its accessibility
to residents of the municipality, and the probability of
significant damage to the building, structure, site, object or
improvement as a result of the relocation.
(k) The compatibility, nature and character of the current and the
proposed surrounding areas as they relate to the intent and
purposes of this article and whether the proposed new location
is visually compatible in accordance with the standards set
forth herein.
B. Procedure.
(1) In the event that the Commission determines that preventing
demolition is not feasible and recommends that the demolition of a
listed or contributing historic landmark be approved, the following
steps shall be taken:
§ 148-23 ATLANTIC CITY CODE § 148-23
1:666
(a) The applicant shall be responsible for preparing and
submitting to the Commission a completed set of drawings and
photographs of the historic landmark that meet the standard
established by the Historic American Buildings Survey (HABS),
as administered through the United States Department of the
Interior.
[1] The photographs are to be taken by a professional
photographer, shall be eight-inch-by-ten-inch black and
white prints made on archival quality photographic paper
and be taken from large format (four-inch-by-five-inch
minimum size) negatives.
[2] The drawings and photographs shall be submitted to the
Commission for review and acceptance.
(b) Prior to the City's Department of Licensing and Inspection
authorizing the demolition, the applicant shall have submitted
two sets of drawing prints and digital copy of the drawings as
well as two sets of eight-inch-by-ten-inch black and white
photographic prints and the large-format negatives from which
the prints were made.
(c) These requirements may be waived by the Historic District
Commission if the demolition involves a noncontributing
building or structure within a designated historic district.
(d) No assignment of the rights granted by a certificate of
appropriateness to demolish shall be permitted.
(2) If the Historic Preservation Commission disapproves an application
for a certificate of appropriateness to demolish an historic
landmark or a building, structure, site, object or improvement
located in an historic district, the owner shall, nevertheless, as a
matter of right, be entitled to raze or demolish same provided that
all of the following requirements have been fully met:
(a) Appeal to Zoning Board of Adjustment. The owner has applied
for the necessary certificate of appropriateness and has
received notice of the Commission's denial of same from the
Historic Administrative Officer and has appealed to the Zoning
Board of Adjustment, which has affirmed such denial.
(b) Sale for fair market value. Following Zoning Board affirmation
of the Commission's determination of denial, an owner who
desires to further pursue demolition approval has, for a period
of at least 180 days (the "offer period"), and at a price
reasonably related to its fair market value, made a bona fide
offer to sell such building, structure, site, object or
improvement and the land pertaining thereto to any person,
entity, organization, government or political subdivision
thereof which gives reasonable assurance that it is willing to
§ 148-23 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 148-23
1:667
preserve the building, structure, site, object or improvement
and the land pertaining thereto.
(c) Demolition notice posted and publication.
[1] Notice of any proposed demolition shall be posted on the
exterior premises of the building, structure, site, object or
improvement throughout the offer period in a location
such that it is clearly readable. In addition, the applicant
shall cause to be published in the official newspaper of the
City a notice setting forth the following:
[a] The applicant's intent to demolish, including a
description of the subject property (by block and lot as
well as by physical location) and a description of the
building, structure, site, object or improvement to be
demolished; and
[b] The applicant's proposed use of the property following
demolition; and
[c] The anticipated time frame(s) associated with the
demolition; and
[d] A statement indicating that the applicant shall
consider any and all bona fide offers to sell the
property to any person who wishes to preserve the
building, structure, site, object or improvement; and
[e] The applicant's name and address, along with a
telephone number where the applicant may be
reached during normal business hours by any
interested person who wishes to discuss the proposed
demolition and/or to make an offer to purchase the
property as set forth above.
[2] The notice shall be published as follows:
[a] At least once within the first 10 days of the offer
period; and
[b] At least once within the period of time that is not less
than 10 nor more than 15 days prior to the expiration
of the offer period; and
[c] At least once each 20 days between the above first and
last notifications.
[3] At the conclusion of the offer period, if the applicant still
wishes to demolish the subject building, structure, site,
object or improvement, it shall, prior to performing the
demolition, perform the following:
§ 148-23 ATLANTIC CITY CODE § 148-23
1:668
§ 148-24. Effect of approval/denial of certificate of appropriateness.
[a] Advise the Commission, writing, of its intention to
proceed with the demolition; and
[b] Certify, in writing, to its compliance with the
provisions of the 180-day offer period; and
[c] Provide the Commission with a copy of the notice that
appeared in the official newspaper of the City and a
listing of all dates on which the said notice appeared
in the newspaper; and
[d] Advise the Commission, in writing, as to whether any
interested persons submitted an offer or offers to
purchase the property, whether during the 180-day
"offer period" or following the newspaper noticing
referenced above, and set forth the terms and
conditions relating to said offer(s) and the results of
any negotiations pertaining thereto; and
[e] File copies of the affidavits of publication relating to
the newspaper noticing with the Commission.
(d) Offer period. The period of time during which notice must be
given in the manner herein before set forth shall be known as
the "notice period" which shall commence on the 10th day
following the date of the notice of denial of the appeal from the
zoning board of adjustment and such notice period shall run for
a period of time of 180 days.
(3) Expiration of approval.
(a) In cases where demolition is permitted, the certificate of
appropriateness shall be valid for one year from the date of
Historic Preservation Commission approval of the application.
The one-year period shall not be extended.
(b) At the time of issuance of the certificate of appropriateness to
demolish, the Historic Administrative Officer shall designate
the period of time (within the one-year approval period) within
which demolition must be completed.
(4) The Commission may at any time during the offer period, if a
significant change in circumstances occurs, approve a certificate of
appropriateness to demolish, in which event a permit from the

initiated within one year from the date that the certificate is granted.
§ 148-23 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 148-24
1:669
(1) If a construction permit is required for such work, the certificate of
appropriateness shall be valid for the life of the construction permit
and any extensions thereof.
(2) For the purposes of this section, a certificate of appropriateness
shall be deemed invalid if the work ceases for a period of six
months after commencement of work. Reasonable extensions may
be granted by the Historic District Commission based upon
appropriate persuasive evidence.
B. An applicant for a certificate of appropriateness who is dissatisfied with
the actions of the Historic Administrative Officer or Commission in
denying the certificate of appropriateness or in issuing the certificate of
appropriateness with objectionable conditions may appeal that action
to the City Zoning Board of Adjustment within 30 calendar days from
the date of receiving the written decision.
(1) This right of appeal is limited to the applicant only.
(2) Appeals should be made under N.J.S.A. 40:55D-70(a).

§ 148-25. Violations.
A. If any person shall undertake any construction activity on an historic
landmark or on a property located within an historic district without
first having obtained a certificate of appropriateness as provided in this
chapter or where such construction activity is not in compliance with a
certificate of appropriateness previously issued, such person shall be
deemed to be in violation of this chapter.
(1) Notwithstanding the foregoing, it shall not be a violation of this
chapter in circumstances where the Construction Official has
issued a construction permit but has not advised the recipient of
the construction permit to have first made application to the
Commission.
B. After learning of the violation, the Historic Administrative Officer shall
personally serve a notice describing the violation in detail upon the
owner of the lot where on the violation is occurring.
(1) If the owner cannot be personally served within the City with said
notice, a copy thereof shall be posted on the site in question and a
copy shall be sent by certified mail, return receipt requested, to to
owner at his or her last known address as it appears on the
municipal tax rolls.

Preventative Maintenance; Notice of Violations
§ 148-28. Maintenance.
A. It is a high priority of the City Council of Atlantic City to encourage
preventative maintenance to ensure the continued useful life of the
City's historic buildings, structures, objects and sites.
B. In the event that any historic landmark or any building, structure,
object or site located within an historic district deteriorates to the point
that, in the best estimate of the Historic Administrative Officer, the cost
of correcting the outstanding code violations equals more than 25% of
the cost of replacing the entire building, structure, object or site on
which the violation occurs, the Administrative Officer shall:
(1) Serve personally or by certified mail, return receipt requested, a
notice on the owner of the property listing the violations, the
estimate for their abatement and the replacement cost of the
improvements; and
(2) Stating that, if the owner does not take all necessary remedial
action within 60 days, or such extensions, the Historic
Administrative Officer may enter upon the property and arrange
the abatement of such violations and cause the cost thereof to
become a lien on the property.
C. Upon receipt of such notice, the owner may, within 20 days after such
receipt, notify the Historic Administrative Officer of his or her
intentions to have a hearing as to the allegations and estimates set forth
in the notice.
(1) Such hearing shall be conducted by the Historic Preservation
Commission and shall, so far as possible, be a formal adversary
proceeding in which the Historic Administrative Officer shall
establish the matters alleged in the notice by a preponderance of
the evidence.
(2) If a hearing is requested, the Administrative Officer will, within 10
days following the hearing, serve on the owner an opinion, in
writing, setting forth his or her conclusions and the reasons
therefor.
D. If the owner does not request a hearing, the findings of the Historic
Administrative Officer set forth in the notice issued in § 148-27 shall be
binding, and the Historic Administrative Officer may take such
necessary action as granted by the provisions of this chapter.
E. If the owner does not comply with the findings of the Historic
Administrative Officer, the Historic Administrative Officer may enter
onto the premises and, by use of municipal labor or outside contractors,
or both, perform such work as is necessary to abate all violations.
§ 148-28 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 148-28
1:675
(1) The Historic Administrative Officer shall then certify to the City
Council the cost of such work performed, plus all administrative,
clerical, architectural, engineering and legal costs and overhead
attributable thereto, and shall present the same to the City Council.
(2) City Council may by resolution vote to cause the sum so certified to
become a lien upon the property, payable with the next quarter's
property taxes and, if not then paid, bearing interest at the same
rate as delinquent taxes, and/or become subject to tax foreclosure
in accordance with the state statutes governing the same.

Interpretive Statement
§ 148-29. Interpretation.
A. Nothing contained within this chapter shall supersede the powers of
other local legislative or regulatory bodies or relieve any property
owner of complying with the requirements of any other state statutes or
municipal ordinances or regulations.
B. In the event of any inconsistency, ambiguity or overlapping of
requirements between the provisions of this chapter and any other
requirements enforced by the municipality, the more restrictive shall
apply, to the effect that state and/or federal legislation has not
preempted the municipality's power to enforce more stringent
standards.
C. These chapter requirements should not be viewed as requiring or
prohibiting the use of any particular architectural style. The purpose is
to honor and preserve the City's past in a manner that keeps it
compatible with and relevant to the present. To that end, new
construction in or near an historic building, structure, object or site
should not necessarily duplicate the style of the past but should be
compatible with and not detract from the historic building, structure,
site, object, neighborhood and its environment.

the Chief of Police has investigated and determined that there is no question
as to the ownership of such secondhand motor vehicle, part or accessory.

Commercial District Regulations
§ 163-59. Commercial districts.
A. Purpose. The commercial districts established by § 163-52D of this
chapter are intended to provide and maintain commercial areas serving
the purposes hereinafter stated:
(1) The Neighborhood Commercial Districts are established to provide
for groups of small business establishments located to serve
frequent retail and personal service needs of residents within
convenient traveling distance, with an option of moderate density
multiple-family residential development located above such
business establishments. These districts are not intended to permit
major commercial or service establishments which would attract
substantial amounts of trade from outside the neighborhood.
(2) The Resort Service District is established as a commercialresidential
district for those parts of the City enjoying the
advantages of proximity to the Central Business District, the
oceanfront and of access to active casino development. The mixture
of residential and commercial uses is encouraged as a means of
achieving space and energy efficiency and of achieving diversity in
activity within these areas. The mixture is also intended to
accommodate uses which support and are integral to nearby casino
operations, including but not limited to hotel and garage
developments. [Amended 6-15-1988 by Ord. No. 1-1988]
(3) The CBD Central Business District is established to preserve and
enhance commercial, financial, retail and similar activities and
services of importance to the existing central business district. The
district is intended to accommodate a wider variety of commercial
uses than any other district. High land values, space limitations and
public convenience justify greater intensity of use than in any other
commercial district.
(4) The Mixed Use Recreation District has been established to
integrate residential, commercial, cultural, transportation and
transient oriented uses. Water-based uses that provide alternative
modes of transportation to other locations throughout the City are
encouraged. Public access along the waterfront is a major
component of the district plan, to provide a scenic venue and
pedestrian links to the Walk. The permitted uses, structures and
requirements are set forth in the attached Land Use Schedule229
229. Editor's Note: See Schedule III, Schedule of Permitted and Conditional Uses.

for commercial uses, of a limited range and locations which abut or
front and which have access to heavily traveled multilaned major
roadways. Uses in this district include facilities related
predominantly to the traveler or highway user as well as
commercial uses which require large land areas, do not depend
upon adjoining uses for their operation and do not compete with
similar activities in other districts in the City.
(6) The AC Area Commercial District is established to provide for
commercial uses and services of a limited range at locations which
abut or front and have access to heavily traveled multilaned major
roadways. Uses in this district include facilities related to area
residents and visitors by providing for the development of larger
consolidated commercial facilities for diversified retail uses.

are marine related, including both recreational and commercial
marine activities. Uses in the district are predominantly marinerelated
activities which can only be conducted in areas having
waterfront access. Limited development of uses not requiring
waterfront, such as residential, are permitted as components of
projects having as major elements a water-related commercial or
recreational use. Public or semipublic access to all or a portion of
waterfront parcels under development within this district is a
purpose of this district. [Added 6-15-1988 by Ord. No. 1-1988]

ARTICLE XVII
District Regulations of General Applicability
§ 163-65. Regulations applicable to district boundary lots.
[Amended 5-7-1981 by Ord. No. 32-1981; 6-15-1988 by Ord. No.
1-1988; 9-19-2001 by Ord. No. 46-2001; 3-10-2004 by Ord. No.

A. Purpose. It is the intent of this chapter to provide for gradual
transitions between commercial or industrial uses and residential uses
to the end that the juxtapositioning of such incompatible uses may be
minimized. When possible, such transitions are achieved through
careful mapping of districts. However, in some cases it is not feasible to
avoid the juxtapositioning of districts which permit incompatible uses.
To further the goal of providing for gradual transitions between
commercial or industrial uses, this section establishes additional
standards and regulations for the use of lots located at the boundaries
between such districts. The requirements of this section shall not apply
to commercial planned development of piers pursuant to § 163-165.
B. (Reserved)
C. Commercial, resort commercial or industrial district boundary lots
bordering more restrictive districts. In any case where a commercial,
resort commercial or industrial district boundary lot has a lot line in
common with a residential district or where such district boundary lot
is in any part directly across a street or private road from a lot in a
residential district, such commercial, resort commercial or industrial
district boundary lot shall, for a distance of 100 feet from the residential
district boundary lot in question, be subject to all of the regulations of
the residential district, except that, upon compliance with following
additional requirements, such portion of such commercial, resort
commercial or industrial district boundary lot may be devoted to uses
permitted or permissible in the district in which it is located.
(1) No such use shall be established unless and until a site plan
therefore has first been approved as provided in Part 5, Articles XIX
through XXV, of this chapter.
(2) No such use shall be located closer to the residential district
boundary line in question than the minimum front yard setback
required in the adjacent district in question, plus 1/2 of the width of
any street or private road separating such lot from such adjacent
district.
(3) Except as provided in Subsection C(2) above, any such use shall
comply with the yard, space and bulk requirements applicable in
the adjacent district in question.
247. Editor's Note: Ordinance No. 53-2005, adopted 7-13-2005, ratified, confirmed and
readopted this ordinance for the reasons set forth in Res. Nos. 157 of 2004 and 566 of
2005. The full text of these resolutions is on file in the City offices.
§ 163-65 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 163-65
1:811
§ 163-66. Group family households.
(4) Any perimeter landscaped open space shall be provided along
every lot line in any residential district.
(5) Except as modified by this section, any such use shall comply with
all of the regulations applicable in the district in which it is located.
(6) The limitations of this section shall not apply to any use located
more than 100 feet from the district boundary line in question.
D. District boundary height regulations. In any case where a commercial
or industrial district boundary line has any lot line in common with a
residential district which is more restrictive in height or is directly
across the street or private road from a lot in said more restrictive
residential district and where Subsection C(3) of this section does not
impose a more restrictive regulation on the bulk of the permitted
building, the following regulations shall apply;
(1) No structure on such lot in the commercial or industrial district
shall encroach upon the building envelope defined by the following
planes:
(a) A vertical plane at the lot building line up to the maximum
height permitted in the more restrictive district.
(b) Above the height, a plane slanted at 60° of the vertical up to
the maximum height permitted in the district within which said
lot is located.
(2) The described building envelope is illustrated in the diagram at the
end of this chapter.248
A. Purpose. Modern religious, cultural and social thought recognizes value
in relations having many aspects in common with the traditional family
relationship but not based exclusively on ties of blood or marriage. If
properly regulated to avoid possible adverse physical effects on
residential neighborhoods, stable groups formed on the basis of such
nontraditional relationships can provide a valid alternative lifestyle
which should be permitted within the City. The purpose of this section is
to define, permit and regulate the occupancy of dwelling units by group
family households.
B. Authorization. Subject to the standards hereinafter established and
subject to the issuance of a certificate of land use compliance as
hereinafter required, group family households may occupy dwelling
units within the City located in districts other than the R-1 and R-2
Residential Districts. [Amended 4-24-1980 by Ord. No. 44-1980]
C. Definition.

1:812
(1) A "group family household" is a group of four or more persons, not
constituting a family as defined in § 163-15 of this chapter, living
together in a dwelling unit as a single housekeeping unit, under a
common housekeeping management based on an intentionally
structured relationship of mutual responsibility and providing an
organization and stability essentially equivalent to that found in
families based on relationships of marriage and blood.
(2) In determining whether or not a group of individuals constitute a
group family household, the Land Use Administrator shall consider
all available information and, specifically, the following factors:
(a) Whether the group contains within it and is formed around one
or more families as defined in this chapter.
(b) The extent to which the group recognizes one or more of its
members as the head or heads of the household.
(c) Whether the group includes children, as well as adults, and, if
so, the group's mechanism for carrying out the child-rearing
function.
(d) The extent to which group membership is based upon express
covenants or agreements of unlimited duration, including the
past stability of group membership and expectations for
stability in the future.
(e) The extent to which a group decision making process controls
not only housekeeping arrangements but also personal aspects
of the members' lives.
(f) The extent to which the group functions as a single economic
unit, with members sharing financial resources and
obligations.
(g) The extent and nature of the division of labor within the group
regarding such common household activities as food
preparation, housecleaning and laundry.
(h) The extent to which household possessions, such as furniture,
appliances and automobiles, are commonly owned and shared
by all members of the group.
(i) The extent to which all members of the group have free access
to all areas of the dwelling unit.
(j) The extent to which some religious, moral or other common
belief forms the basis of the group's association.
(3) In determining whether a group constitutes a group family
household, the Land Use Administrator shall consider all facts and
circumstances, and the presence or absence, in whole or in part, of
any particular factor shall not be deemed controlling.

1:813
§ 163-67. Home occupations.

compliance certifying the compliance of such occupancy with the
provisions of this section and other applicable provisions of this chapter
shall have first been issued as provided in Part 6, Article XXXVI, of this
chapter.249
A. Purpose. The regulations of this section dealing with home occupations
are designed to protect and maintain the residential character of
established neighborhoods while recognizing that certain professional
and limited business activities have traditionally been carried on in the
home. This section recognizes that, when properly limited and
regulated, such activities can take place in a residential structure
without changing the character of either the neighborhood or the
structure.
B. Authorization. Except as otherwise expressly provided or limited in this
section, any home occupation that is customarily incidental to the
principal use of a building as a dwelling shall be permitted in any
dwelling unit. Any question of whether a particular use is permitted as a
home occupation by the provisions of this section shall be determined
by the Land Use Administrator pursuant to his authority to interpret the
provisions of this chapter.
C. Definition. A "home occupation" is a business, profession, occupation or
trade conducted for gain or support entirely within a residential
building or a structure accessory thereto, which is incidental and
secondary to the use of such building for dwelling purposes and which
does not change the essential residential character of such building.
D. Certificate of land use compliance required. No home occupation shall
be established or maintained unless a certificate of land use compliance
evidencing the compliance of such home occupation with the provisions
of this section and other applicable provisions of this chapter shall have
first been issued in accordance with Part 6, Article XXXVI, of this
chapter.
E. Use limitations. In addition to all of the use limitations applicable in the
district in which it is located, no home occupation shall be permitted
unless it complies with the following restrictions:
(1) Not more than one person who is not a resident on the premises
shall be employed, and then only as a clerical assistant.
(2) No more than 25% or 400 square feet of the floor area of the
dwelling unit, whichever is less, shall be devoted to the home
occupation.

chapter is changed thereafter to a new use, parking
facilities shall be provided as required herein for such new
use, except that, in any district other than a resort
development district, when any such existing use was
deficient in required parking spaces on such effective date,
such new use may be established with a deficiency in
required parking spaces equal in number to not more than
such preexisting deficiency. Lawfully existing commercial
uses not subject to Subsection A(1)(a)[3] hereof located in

[3] Whenever the intensity of use of any building, structure or
use is increased through the addition of dwelling units,
gross floor area, seating capacity or other units of
measurement specified herein for required parking
facilities, parking facilities as required herein shall be
provided for such increase in intensity of use; provided,
however, that in any district, no building, structure or use
lawfully existing on the effective date of this chapter or
any amendment of it establishing parking requirements
with respect to such building, structure or use shall be
required to provide any additional parking facilities
pursuant to this subsection unless and until the aggregate
increase in units of measurement shall equal more than
10% of the units of measurement existing upon such
effective date, in which event parking facilities as required

not limited to hours and staging of operation, is attached to such
variance.
A. Purpose. The regulation of signs by this chapter is intended to promote
and protect the public health, safety and welfare by reducing the
depreciation of property values caused by signs which are incompatible
with surrounding land uses; by creating a more attractive economic and
business climate within the commercial, resort and industrial areas of
the City; by enhancing and protecting the physical appearance of all
areas of the City; and by reducing the distractions, obstructions and
hazards to pedestrian and auto traffic caused by the indiscriminate
placement and use of signs.

erection, enlargement, expansion, alteration, operation, maintenance,
relocation and removal of all signs within the City visible from any
street, road, sidewalk, public or private property. Any sign not expressly
permitted by these regulations shall be prohibited. The regulations of
this section relate to the location of signs, by function and type, within

with the provisions of Part 6, Article XXXVI, of this chapter;
provided, however, that routine sign maintenance, changing of
parts designed to be changed or changing the content of a sign in
any manner which does not change the functional classification of
the sign shall not, standing alone, be considered an alteration of
the sign requiring the issuance of a certificate of land use
compliance hereunder.
(2) In addition to the information and documents required by Part 6,
Article XXXVI, of this chapter, every application for a certificate of
land use compliance for a sign shall be accompanied by a copy of
plans and specifications showing the method of construction,
illumination and support of such sign and a sketch, drawn to scale,
showing signs faces, exposed surfaces and the proposed message
and design accurately represented as to size, area, proportion and
color; by black and white photographs of the street sides of the
property in question, showing all existing signs on the property; by

signs:
(1) Illumination. In no event shall a sign be illuminated by other than a
shielded or otherwise indirect, nonflashing light, preferably a white
light or a light from the interior of a sign with a translucent face. In
no event shall an illuminated sign be placed or directed so as to
permit the beams and illumination therefrom to be directed or
beamed upon any adjacent public or private premises so as to
cause glare or reflection that may constitute a nuisance or traffic
hazard. No illuminated sign located on a lot adjacent to or across
the street from any residential district and visible from such
residential district shall be illuminated between the hours of 11:00
p.m. and 7:00 a.m., unless the use to which the sign pertains is
open for business.
(2) Electrical elements. All wiring, fittings and materials used in the
construction, connection and operation of electrically illuminated
signs shall be in accordance with the provisions of the Atlantic City
Electrical Code.261 An Underwriters' Laboratories label shall be
affixed to every sign having any electrical component.
(3) Structural elements. The construction and structural components
of all signs shall be in accordance with the standards and
regulations of the Atlantic City Building Code.262 In no case shall
the structural elements of a pole sign extend above the top of the
sign face. Any movable parts of a sign shall be securely fastened by
screws or hinges.
(4) Obstruction of accessways. No sign or sign structure shall obstruct
free ingress to or egress from a fire escape, door, window or other
required accessway. No sign of any kind shall be attached to a
standpipe or fire escape.

A. Purpose. Conversion of existing buildings to increase the number of
dwelling units contained in them presents problems not encountered
when new buildings are designed and constructed for the same number
of units. Such conversions can adversely affect a neighborhood
originally designed for low-density development through overcrowding
and its concomitant problems of inadequate recreational space,
inadequate parking and overtaxed municipal services. These in turn
may contribute to the physical decline and deterioration of the area.
The intent of this section is to establish standards to prevent the
overcrowding of dwelling units and overly dense development of
neighborhoods and to ensure satisfactory amenities in neighborhoods
as conversions take place.
B. Certificate of land use compliance required. No dwelling unit
conversion shall be undertaken unless a certificate of land use
§ 163-71 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 163-72
1:859
§ 163-73. Performance standards.
compliance shall have first been issued in accordance with Part 6,
Article XXXVI, of this chapter, evidencing the compliance of such
conversion with the provisions of this section and other applicable
provisions of this chapter.
A. Purpose. It is the intent of these regulations to prevent land or
structures, including those permitted by right or special approval, from
being used or occupied in any manner so as to create any dangerous,
injurious, noxious or otherwise objectionable fire, explosive, radioactive
or other hazardous condition; noise or vibration; smoke, dust, odor or
other form of air pollution; electrical or other disturbance, glare or
heat; liquid or solid refuse or wastes; or other substance, condition or
elements in a manner or amount so as to adversely affect the
surrounding area.
B. Other regulations. Compliance with the requirements of this section
shall not be interpreted as authorizing any practice or operation which
would constitute a violation of any other provisions of this chapter or
any other applicable law, ordinance, rule or regulation.
C. Application. All uses in all districts shall conform in operation, location
and construction to the performance standards herein specified.
D. Electromagnetic radiation.
(1) Planned or intentional sources. It shall be unlawful to operate or
cause to be operated any planned or intentional source of
electromagnetic radiation for such purposes as communication,
experimentation, entertainment, broadcasting, heating, navigation,
therapy, vehicle velocity measurement, weather survey, aircraft
detection, topographical survey, personal pleasure or any other use
directly or indirectly associated with these purposes which does
not comply with the then-current regulations of the Federal
Communications Commission regarding such sources of
electromagnetic radiation.
(a) Abnormal degradation. Such operation, even when in
compliance with the Federal Communications Commission
regulations, shall be unlawful if such radiation causes an
abnormal degradation in performance of other
electromagnetic radiators or electromagnetic receptors of
quality and proper design because of proximity, primary field,
blanketing, spurious reradiation, harmonic content,
modulation or energy conducted by power or telephone lines.
(b) Determination. The determination of abnormal degradation in
performance and of quality and proper design practices shall
be as defined in the latest principles and standards of the
§ 163-72 ATLANTIC CITY CODE § 163-73
1:860
American Institute of Radio Engineers and the Electronic
Industries Association.
(c) Conflict in standards. In case of any conflict between the latest
standards and principles of the above groups, the following
precedence in the interpretation of the standards and
principles shall apply:
[1] American Institute of Electrical Engineers.
[2] Institute of Radio Engineers.
[3] Electronic Industries Association.
(2) Unplanned electromagnetic interference. It shall be unlawful to
operate or to cause to be operated any source of electromagnetic
interference, the radiation or transmission from which exceeds the
maximum values tabulated below:

(1) Sound levels, in no event shall the sound-pressure level of noise
radiated continuously from a use or activity in any district exceed,
at the lot line, the values given in the Maximum Sound Level Table
below in any octave band of frequency. However, where the lot line
§ 163-73 ATLANTIC CITY CODE § 163-73
1:864
adjoins or lies within 25 feet of the boundary of a residential
district, the sound-pressure levels of noise radiated shall not
exceed, at the lot line, the values given in the Residential Sound
Level Table below in any octave band of frequency.

NOTE: If the noise is not smooth and continuous or if it is
nighttime noise, one or more of the corrections below shall be
added to or subtracted from each of the decibel levels given in the
sound level tables above. Only one of the additional corrections
may be made for any noise source.
(a) For noise radiated between the hours of 9:00 p.m. and 7:30
a.m., five decibels must be subtracted.
(b) If the noise sources operates less than 20% of any one-hour
period, five decibels may be added.
§ 163-73 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 163-73
1:865
(c) If the noise source operates less than 5% of any one-hour
period, 10 decibels may be added.
(d) If the noise source operates less than 1% of any one-hour
period, 15 decibels may be added.
(e) If the noise is of an impulsive character (hammering, etc.), five
decibels must be subtracted.
(f) If the noise is of a periodic character (varying hum, screech,
etc.), five decibels must be subtracted.
(2) Noise measurement procedure. Measurement of noise shall be
made with a sound level meter and octave band analyzer meeting
the standards prescribed by the American Standards Association.
The instruments shall be maintained in calibration and good
working order. Octave band corrections may be employed in
meeting the response specification. A calibration check shall be
made of the system at the time of any noise measurement.
Measurements recorded shall be taken so as to provide a proper
representation of the noise source. The microphone, during
measurement, shall be positioned so as not to create any unnatural
enhancement or diminution of the measured noise. A windscreen
for the microphone shall be used when required. Traffic, aircraft
and other transportation noise sources and other background
noises shall not be considered in taking measurements, except
where such background noise interferes with the primary noise
being measured.
(3) Measurements for impulsive or periodic noise. Impulsive and
periodic-type noises shall be subject to the sound level standards if
those noises are capable of being accurately measured with the
equipment specified in Subsection H(2) above. Noises capable of
being so measured, for the purpose of this chapter, shall be those
noises which cause rapid fluctuations of the needle of the sound
level meter with a variation of no more than plus or minus two
decibels. Noises incapable of being so measured, but objectionable
because of intermittence, beat, frequency or shrillness, shall be
muffled and controlled so as not to become a nuisance to adjacent
uses.
(4) Exception. Nothing in this subsection shall apply to noises not
directly under the control of the property user, such as noises
resulting from the construction and nonroutine maintenance of
buildings and facilities, including site preparation; noises of
infrequent safety signals or wiring devices; and noises of motor
vehicles, except when they are being serviced.
I. Odorous matter.
(1) Regulation. Any condition or operation which results in the
creation of odors of such intensity and character as to be
§ 163-73 ATLANTIC CITY CODE § 163-73
1:866
detrimental to the health and welfare of the public or which
interferes unreasonably with the comfort of the public shall be
removed, stopped or so modified as to remove the odor.
(2) Odor threshold. No continuous, frequent or repetitive emission of
odors or odor-causing substances shall exceed the odor threshold
at or beyond the lot line of the tract on which the odor emission is
initiated. An odor emitted no more than fifteen 15 minutes in any
one day shall not be deemed as continuous, frequent or repetitive
within the meaning of these regulations.
(3) Determination of threshold. The odor threshold as herein referred
to shall be determined by observation by a person or persons. In
any case where the owner or operator of an odor-emitting use or
activity disagrees with the enforcing inspector or where specific
measurement of odor concentration is required, the method and
procedures specified by the American Society for Testing and
Materials, ASTM D 1391-57, entitled "Standard Method for
Measuring Odors in Atmosphere," shall be used.
(4) Backup safeguard system. Any process which may involve the
creation or emission of odors which would be in violation of this
subsection shall be provided with both a primary and a secondary
safeguard system so that control will be maintained if the primary
safeguard system fails.
J. Handling, discharge and disposal of radioactive materials. The handling
of radioactive materials, the discharge of such materials into air and
water and the disposal of radioactive wastes shall be in conformance
with the following:
(1) The applicable regulations of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission.
(2) The applicable regulations of any instrumentality of the State of
New Jersey.
K. Smoke, particulate matter and other air contaminants.
(1) Visible emissions. No use or activity in any district shall cause,
create or allow the emission of air contaminants for more than
three minutes in any one hour which, at or beyond the emission
point, are as dark or darker in shade as that designated as No. 1 on
the Ringlemann Smoke Chart, as published by the United States
Bureau of Mines.
(2) Dust and other particulated air contaminants. Open storage and
open processing operations, including on-site transportation
movements which are the source of windborne dust and other
particulate matter or which involve dust or other particulate aircontaminant
generating equipment, such as used in paint spraying,
grain handling, sand or gravel processing or storage or
sandblasting, shall be so conducted that dust and other
§ 163-73 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 163-73
1:867
particulated air contaminants so generated are not transported
across the lot line of the tract on which the use is located.
L. Vibration.
(1) Steady-state vibrations. At no point on or beyond the lot line of any
tract shall the ground-transmitted, steady-state vibration caused by
any use or activity on that tract exceed the limits established in the
table below:
Maximum Permitted Steady-State Vibration Displacement
Frequency
(cycles per
second)
Commercial and
Industrial Zones
(inches)

40 through 49 0.0001 0.0001
50 and over 0.0001 0.0001
(2) Discrete pulses. Discrete pulses shall not cause displacement in
excess of twice the values established in the table above for steadystate
vibration.
(3) Impact vibrations. At no point at or beyond the lot line of any tract
shall the impact vibration caused by any use or activity on that tract
exceed the limits established in the table below:
Maximum Permitted Impact Vibration Displacements
Frequency
(cycles per
second)
Commercial and
Industrial Zones
(inches)

40 through 49 0.0002 0.0001
50 and over 0.0002 0.0001
(4) Method of measurement. For the purpose of measuring vibrations,
a three-component measuring system shall be used. A threecomponent
measuring system denotes instrumentation which can
measure earth-borne vibrations in three directions, each of which
occurs at right angles to the other two.

§ 163-74. Urban design standards.
A. Placement of structures.
(1) The predominant axes of all structures hereafter erected shall be
either parallel or perpendicular to the axes of adjoining public or
private streets.
(2) The largest dimension of any structure abutting the Boardwalk and
extending higher than 60 feet above the level of the Boardwalk
shall be oriented perpendicular to the Boardwalk; provided,
however, that the Planning Board, as part of the site plan/
subdivision review process, may authorize the largest dimension of
such a structure to be oriented parallel to the Boardwalk where
such orientation is justified as part of an energy conservation
design for such structure. In no event, however, shall a structure
built with its largest dimension parallel to the Boardwalk be more
than 250 feet in length along the Boardwalk.
B. Sun control angles along the boardwalk. No structure or any part
thereof, other than overhangs and balconies projecting not more than
five feet, shall encroach upon the Boardwalk side of an imaginary plane
extending upward from the landside edge of the Boardwalk at an angle
of 30° from the vertical plane; provided, however, that this regulation
shall apply only above a height of 35 feet above the level of the
Boardwalk. A diagram depicting the plane herein described is set forth
in the diagram at the end of this chapter.271
C. Minimum distance between buildings. For principle structures located
on the same lot, the minimum distance between walls containing
openings for light and air shall be equal to 1/3 of the height of the tallest
structure, but not less than the rear yard requirement applicable to the
structure.
D. (Reserved)272
E. Uses at sidewalk levels in RS-C, CBD, RMC-4 and RS Districts. In all RSC,
CBD, RMC-4 and RS Districts, every face of a structure fronting on a
public sidewalk shall, at the sidewalk level adjacent to said structure,
be designed predominantly for entrance lobbies and retail commercial
uses. Parking, mechanical equipment, storage and similar uses shall not
be allowed along any such frontage. [Amended 6-15-1988 by Ord.
No. 1-1988]
F. Standards for boardwalk frontage. Every structure having a frontage on
the Boardwalk and located in a district permitting commercial or resort
uses shall comply with the following standards as to said frontage:
271. Editor's Note: The diagram described in this section will be included at the end of this
chapter upon review by the City.

§ 163-74 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 163-74
1:869
(1) The floor level of the abutting structure shall be at the same level
as the Boardwalk or not more than two steps above or below the
Boardwalk level.
(2) The entire Boardwalk frontage of the structure, with the exception
of entrance lobbies, shall be designed for Boardwalk-oriented retail
shops and services. Such shops shall have a depth of not less than
25 feet measured perpendicular to the Boardwalk. Restaurants,
cafeterias and bars shall occupy no more than 30% of the total
length of the Boardwalk frontage.
(3) All uses fronting on the Boardwalk shall be directly accessible from
the Boardwalk.
(4) Decorative walls, veneers or any other architectural feature which
seals the facade of the building along the Boardwalk or prevents its
active use by pedestrians on the Boardwalk are strictly prohibited.
G. Treatment of structure surfaces.
(1) At least 50% of the total exposed surface of all flat roofs, including
but not limited to decks, balconies and parking garage roofs, shall
be landscaped as roof gardens. The landscaping may be either
distributed on every exposed roof surface or concentrated in
selected areas.
(2) The balance of flat surfaces should be developed in such a manner
as to be totally acceptable from an aesthetic point of view and built
of nonreflective materials in order to secure agreeable visual
conditions in the roofscaping of the City. Rooftops at the level of
385 feet above sea level are not subject to landscape treatments
since they are not visible.
(3) Side surfaces should be treated with nonreflective materials. The
use of reflective materials may be allowed, provided that reflective
surfaces do not have adverse impacts on surrounding uses, such as
increasing the cooling loads of the structures upon which they
reflect heat, causing visual discomfort and the like.

Part 5
Subdivisions
ARTICLE XIX
Site Plans and Subdivisions Review
§ 163-79. Authority.
The Planning Board shall, subject to the procedures, standards and
limitations hereinafter set forth, have authority to review and approve or
disapprove site plans and subdivision plats for the uses listed in § 163-81
below; provided, however, that, except as limited by § 163-153, the
resolution of the Board of Adjustment shall substitute for that of the
Planning Board whenever the Board of Adjustment has jurisdiction over a
site plan or subdivision pursuant to § 163-170G(1)(a) of this chapter.
§ 163-80. Purpose.
A. It is the purpose of this Part to provide a unified set of procedures and
standards to govern site plan and subdivision reviews. In keeping with
the spirit and structure of the New Jersey Municipal Land Use Law275
and to simplify land use administration in the City of Atlantic City, this
chapter makes no distinction between cases where subdivision
approval is required and those where site plan approval is required.
Rather, for all developments made subject to site plan subdivision
approval pursuant to § 163-81 below, it is the purpose of the provisions
of this article to assure that development will occur only as consistent
with the Master Plan, the capital improvements program, the Official
Map and this chapter and that adequate consideration will be given to
critical on-tract and off-tract engineering, planning and design
elements so as to assure the least possible adverse effect upon and the
greatest possible benefit to the public health, safety and welfare as a
result of public and private development. In particular, it is the purpose
of Articles XIX through XXV of this Part to assure that all developments
subject to its provisions are located, planned, designed, laid out,
constructed and serviced to:
(1) Provide for adequate light, air and privacy.
(2) Secure safety from fire, flood and other danger.
(3) Be served by or provide adequate public improvements, public sites
and rights-of-way and essential public and quasi-public services
and facilities.
(4) Provide the most beneficial relationship between the uses of land
and buildings and the circulation of traffic, having particular
regard to the avoidance of congestion in the streets and highways
and the adequate provision for pedestrian traffic movements.
275. Editor's Note: See N.J.S.A. 40:55D-1 et seq.
§ 163-79 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 163-80
1:877
(5) Prevent the pollution of air, water and land.
(6) Assure the adequacy of drainage facilities.
(7) Safeguard the water table.
(8) So use and manage natural resources as to preserve the integrity,
stability and beauty of the City and the value of the land.
(9) Preserve the natural beauty of the City and to ensure appropriate
development with regard to its natural features.
(10) Provide for open spaces through the most efficient design and
layout of the land.
(11) Provide an orderly layout and design of new subdivisions and
resubdivisions.
(12) Provide, in the case of subdivisions for the purpose of
conveyancing, proper legal descriptions and proper monumenting
of the land.
B. The procedures established by Articles XIX through XXV of this Part are
intended to serve as the principal development review mechanism for
all significant developments in the City, whether those developments
are permitted as of right as permitted uses in the zoning districts where
proposed or require some special, discretionary approval, such as
planned development, conditional use or variance approval. In cases
where such discretionary approval is required, the procedures of
Articles XIX through XXV are designed to mesh with the procedures
made applicable to such approvals by other Articles of this Part so that
the applications for such approvals and for site plan/subdivision
approval will be processed concurrently without the need for separate
notices or hearings.
C. The standards made applicable by Articles XIX through XXV to all
applications for site plan subdivision approval are intended as minimum
standards to be met by all developments subject to review pursuant to
Articles XIX through XXV and are designed to assure that developments
permitted as of right as permitted uses in the various zoning districts
will be adequately planned, designed and serviced to protect the public
health, safety and welfare. Where a development requires site plan/
subdivision approval in connection with another, discretionary approval
pursuant to other Articles of this Part 5, additional standards made
applicable to such discretionary approvals by other Articles of this Part
5 must also be met, and those standards are generally more demanding
than the minimum standards of Articles XIX through XXV of this Part 5,
in light of the fact that developments which are made subject to such
discretionary approvals are generally those which are expected to have
unusual impacts either on their immediate neighborhood or on the City
in general and to provide special benefits to their developers not

pursuant to Article XXVI of this Part 5. [Amended 6-15-1988 by
Ord. No. 1-1988]
(3) For any development requiring planned development approval
pursuant to Article XXVII of this Part 5. [Amended 6-15-1988 by
Ord. No. 1-1988]
(4) For any development requiring a use variance pursuant to Article
XXVIII of this Part 5. [Amended 6-15-1988 by Ord. No. 1-1988]

§ 163-128. Adequacy of public improvements.
A. General standard. No application for site plan/subdivision plat approval
shall be granted unless the Planning Board shall find, pursuant to the
provisions of this section, that the proposed use in the proposed
location is or can and will be, by reason of the developer's compliance
with conditions imposed pursuant to the provisions of this section,
adequately served by and will not impose an undue burden upon the
public improvements, sites and rights-of-way by which it will be served
or benefited or which exist or are planned for installation within its
boundaries or their immediate vicinity.
B. Determination of necessary public improvements and special benefits.
(1) Whenever an application for site plan/subdivision plat approval is
filed with the Planning Board pursuant to Articles XIX through XXV,
the Board shall determine what, if any, public improvements,
whether on tract or off tract, will have to be installed, constructed,
improved or rehabilitated to serve or benefit the proposed
development and shall also determine whether any part of the
subject property should be reserved for use as a public site or rightof-
way. The Planning Board shall base its determination on the
nature and scope of the proposed development; the provisions of
this chapter specifically applicable to the type of development
being proposed; the provisions of the Master Plan, capital
improvements program, Official Map and any other plans,
programs or maps adopted by or under consideration pursuant to
public notice by the City or other governmental agencies having
jurisdiction to guide growth and development; the provisions of this
chapter and other development regulations adopted by the City or
other governmental agencies having jurisdiction, with particular
attention to any such provisions specifically applicable to the type
§ 163-127 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 163-128
1:909
of development being proposed or the area in which it is proposed
and special restrictions or conditions on such developments or
areas, and the studies, reports and opinions of City departments,
officials and consultants having special knowledge, expertise or
responsibility with respect to the development, improvements or
conditions under consideration.
(2) In determining whether the installation, construction,
improvement or rehabilitation of a public improvement is
necessary to serve the proposed development, the Planning Board
shall be guided by the principle that no new development should be
allowed to utilize existing capacity of a public improvement unless
such improvement, in its existing condition or with such
improvements as have already been authorized for completion as
general improvements to be paid for out of public funds already
appropriated for the purpose, has adequate capacity to meet the
full demands that would be placed upon it if all reasonably
foreseeable public and private development planned or permitted
pursuant to the Master Plan and chapter were to occur.
(3) In the event that the Planning Board shall determine, pursuant to
Subsection B(1) above, that one or more on-site public
improvements are necessary to serve the proposed development, it
shall proceed, as provided in Subsection C below, to estimate the
cost thereof and to require the installation of such improvements as
a condition to the approval of any site plan/subdivision plat
submitted to it pursuant to Article XVIII and Part 5.
(4) In the event that the Planning Board shall determine, pursuant to
Subsection B(1) above, that either a public site or a public right-ofway
or public improvement that will not serve the subject
development is required on the subject tract, it shall proceed as
provided in Subsection D below.
(5) In the event that the Planning Board shall determine, pursuant to
Subsection B(1) above, that one or more off-tract public
improvements are necessary to serve the subject development, it
shall determine, as to each such improvement, whether the
improvement will specially benefit only the subject property or will
benefit other properties in addition to the subject property.
(6) In the case of any such improvement that will benefit only the
subject property, the Planning Board shall proceed, as provided in
Subsection E below, to estimate the cost thereof and to require the
installation of such improvement.
(7) In the case of any such improvement that will benefit other
properties in addition to the subject property, the Planning Board
shall determine the extent to which each specially benefited
property, including the subject property, is specially benefited and
also the extent to which the improvement results in a general
§ 163-128 ATLANTIC CITY CODE § 163-128
1:910
benefit not specifically attributable to any specific property and
shall then proceed, as provided in Subsection F below, to estimate
and apportion the cost of such improvement and to require its
installation.
(8) In determining which properties are specifically benefited by a
public improvement, the Planning Board shall be governed by the
interpretation given by the New Jersey Supreme Court to the term
"special or peculiar benefit" in N.J.S.A. 40:56-27. In apportioning
the benefit among the specially benefited properties and the
general benefit, the Planning Board shall be generally guided by
the principles applicable to the apportionment of special benefits in
connection with local improvements subject to N.J.S.A. 40:56-1 et
seq.
(9) When, in performing its duties hereunder, the Planning Board
determines that a property, other than the subject property, will be
specially benefited by an improvement to be installed as a condition
of its approval of the subject application, it shall give the owner of
each such property, as shown in the latest property tax records,
notice thereof and a reasonable opportunity to be heard thereon
and shall either delay approval of the subject application pending
such notice and hearing, or shall condition such approval to permit
revisions in its determination made pursuant to this subsection
based upon information obtained at such hearing.
(10) In performing its duties hereunder, the Planning Board may seek
and accept the assistance of the City Engineer or such other City
officials, employees and consultants as have special knowledge or
expertise in estimating and apportioning the costs and benefits of
public improvements.
(11) The requirements for public improvements and the developers'
responsibility with respect to their provision and installation
pursuant to this subsection shall be deemed to be the minimum
requirements applicable to all developments requiring site plan/
subdivision approval but otherwise permitted as a matter of right in
the zoning district proposed. Additional requirements applicable to
developments requiring certain discretionary approvals pursuant
to the provisions of this chapter may be imposed pursuant to
§ 163-129 below.
C. On-tract public improvements serving the subject development.
(1) The developer of every proposed development shall be required, as
a condition to the grant of any approval pursuant to Articles XIX
through XXV, to provide all on-tract, whether on site or off site,
public improvements to which the subject development will be
connected or by which it will be served or benefited. Except as
noted in Subsection C(2) below, all such improvements shall be
designed, sized and installed in accordance with the Master Plan,
§ 163-128 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 163-128
1:911
the capital improvements program, the Official Map, this chapter,
and such other plans, programs, maps and ordinances adopted by
or under consideration pursuant to public notice by the City or
other governmental agencies having jurisdiction to guide growth
and development at the time the first application in connection
with such development is filed. In the absence of any such plan,
program, map or ordinance, the public improvements shall be
required, designed, sized and installed in accordance with the City
Engineer's determination based on good engineering practice and
all available information concerning present and future needs. The
cost of providing and installing such improvements shall be paid in
accordance with the provisions of Subsection C(3) below.
(2) The Planning Board may, as a condition of any approval required to
be given by it pursuant to Articles XIX through XXV, require the
installation of a public improvement of greater size or capacity than
required by Subsection C(1) above when it deems such greater size
or capacity to be necessary in light of factors not known or
considered at the time the aforesaid plan, program, map or
ordinance was adopted or placed under consideration. If such
factors relate solely to the development under consideration, the
increased cost due to installing such greater size or capacity public
improvement, rather than installing the improvement as required
by Subsection C(1) above, shall be paid in accordance with the
provisions of Subsection C(3) below. If such factors do not relate
solely to such development, such increased cost shall be paid in the
same manner as provided in Subsection F below for off-tract
improvements benefiting more than one tract.
(3) Except as provided in Subsection C(2) above, it shall be a condition
of every approval granted pursuant to Articles XIX through XXV
that all public improvements required to be installed pursuant to
this subsection shall be installed at the sole cost and expense of the
developer. The City Engineer shall, as part of his review of detailed
plans, specifications and cost estimates pursuant to § 163-110 of
Part 3, estimate the cost of all such improvements, and the
developer shall, as a condition to final plan/plat approval, provide
performance and maintenance guaranties pursuant to § 163-136 of
this chapter, to ensure the timely and proper installation of such
improvements. The developer shall be responsible for installing all
improvements required pursuant to this Subsection, and for that
purpose shall engage only such properly licensed and qualified
contractors and subcontractors as have been approved by the City
Engineer for the type of work involved; provided, however, that
where an ongoing or proposed City public improvements program
offers a more efficient and orderly vehicle for installing such
improvements, the Planning Board may require such improvements
to be installed by the City as part of such program and require the
developer to pay the cost thereof.
§ 163-128 ATLANTIC CITY CODE § 163-128
1:912
D. On-tract public sites and on-tract public rights-of-way and public
improvements not serving the subject development.
(1) Whenever the Master Plan, the capital improvements program, the
Official Map or other plan, program, map or ordinance adopted, or
under consideration pursuant to official notice, by the City provides
for the reservation on the subject property of a public site not
associated with a public improvement or for the reservation of a
public right-of-way or the installation of a public improvement,
which right-of-way or improvement will not serve or benefit the
subject tract, the Planning Board may, pursuant to the procedure
set out in Subsection D(3) below and as a condition of any approval
required pursuant to Articles XIX through XXV, require such site,
right-of- way or improvement to be shown on the plans or plats of
the proposed development in a manner, size and location consistent
with the City plan, program, map or ordinance in question and may
reserve the necessary land areas for such site, right- of-way or
improvement for a period of one year or such further time as may
be agreed to by the developer following final site plan subdivision
plat approval. Unless during such period or an agreed extension
thereof the City shall have entered into a contract to purchase, or
shall have instituted condemnation proceedings according to law to
acquire, the fee or a lesser interest in the reserved land area, the
developer shall not be bound by such reservation and may proceed
to use such land for private use in accordance with applicable
development regulations.
(2) The developer shall be entitled to just compensation for the actual
loss found to be caused by any temporary reservation and
deprivation of use pursuant to Subsection D(1) above. Unless a
lesser amount has been mutually agreed upon, just compensation
shall be deemed to be the fair market value of an option to
purchase the land reserved for the period of reservation, provided
that determination of such fair market value shall include, but not
be limited to consideration of the real property taxes apportioned
to the land reserved and prorated for the period of reservation. The
developer shall also be compensated for the reasonable increased
cost of legal, engineering or other professional services incurred as
a result of the reservation in connection with obtaining site plan/
subdivision approval. The compensation payable pursuant to this
subsection shall be determined in accordance with the provisions
of Subsection D(3) below.
(3) Upon submission to the Planning Board of an application for site
plan/subdivision approval for a land area subject to reservation
pursuant to Subsection D(1) above, the Land Use Administrator
shall, in addition to the usual distribution of such application,
forward a copy thereof to the City Council with a report
summarizing the provisions of the City plan, program, map or
ordinance, indicating the need for the reservation; providing a
§ 163-128 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 163-128
1:913
currant assessment of the public need for such reservation and
setting forth the date upon which the Planning Board is expected
to take final action on the application. Before such date, the City
Council shall decide upon, and give the Planning Board notice of,
one of the following courses of action to be followed.
(a) The City shall forego the right to reserve the land area in
question, and the Planning Board shall consider the proposed
development as if no such right existed.
(b) The City Council has, prior to the date set for final action on the
application, negotiated a price fro the acquisition of any
interests in land necessary, a program for the installation of
any public improvements and an agreement as to any
incidental compensation which may be due, and all approvals
granted by the Planning Board shall reflect such agreements.
(c) The Planning Board shall exercise the right of reservation
pursuant to Subsection D(1) above, and the City Council shall
negotiate just compensation for the reserved land or shall
institute condemnation proceedings during the reservation
period.
(4) Should the City Council fail to so notify the Planning Board, the
Planning Board shall proceed as if notified in pursue the course of
action set out in Subsection D(3)(a) above. Should the City Council
elect to proceed pursuant to Subsection D(3)(c) above and then fail
to negotiate compensation or to institute condemnation
proceedings during the reservation period, the reservation shall
expire and the City Council shall, within 30 days following the end
of the reservation period, tender to the developer an amount
considered by it to be just compensation for all compensable claims
of the developer, pursuant to Subsection D(1) above, arising out of
the temporary reservation. The developer shall either accept and,
in writing, acknowledge his acceptance of such tender in full
settlement of his claim for compensation or shall institute an
appropriate action for judicial determination and enforcement of
his claim.
E. Off-tract public improvements specially benefiting only the subject
development.
(1) The developer of every proposed development shall be required, as
a condition of the grant of any approval pursuant to Articles XIX
through XXV, to provide all off-tract public improvements which are
necessary to serve or which benefit the subject property and which
provide no special benefit to any other property. Except as noted in
Subsection E(2) below, all such improvements shall be required,
designed, sized and installed in accordance with the Master Plan,
the capital improvements program, the Official Map, this chapter
and such of her plans, programs, maps and ordinances adopted by
§ 163-128 ATLANTIC CITY CODE § 163-128
1:914
or under consideration pursuant to public notice by the City or
other governmental agencies having jurisdiction to guide growth
and development at the time the first application in connection
with such development is filed. In the absence of any such plan,
program, map or ordinance, the public improvements shall be
required, designed, sized and installed in accordance with the City
Engineer's determination based on good engineering practice and
all available information concerning present and future needs. The
cost of providing and installing such improvements shall be paid in
accordance with the provisions of Subsection E(3) below.
(2) The Planning Board may, as a condition of any approval required to
be given by it pursuant to Articles XIX through XXV, require the
installation of a public improvement of greater size or capacity than
required by Subsection E(1) above when it deems such greater size
or capacity to be necessary in light of factors not known or
considered at the time the aforesaid plan, program, map or
ordinance was adopted or placed under consideration. If such
factors relate solely to the development under consideration, the
increased cost due to installing such greater size or capacity public
improvement, rather than installing the improvement as required
by Subsection E(1) above, shall be paid in accordance with the
provisions of Subsection E(3) below. If such factors do not relate
solely to such development, such increased cost shall be paid in the
same manner as provided in Subsection F below for off-tract
improvements benefiting more than one tract.
(3) Except as provided in Subsection E(2) above, it shall be a condition
of every approval granted pursuant to Articles XIX through XXV
that all public improvements required to be installed pursuant to
this subsection shall be installed at the sole cost and expense of the
developer. The City Engineer shall, as part of his review of detailed
plans, specifications and cost estimates pursuant to § 163-110 of
Part 3, estimate the cost of all such improvements, and the
developer shall, as a condition to final plan or plat approval,
provide performance and maintenance guaranties pursuant to
§ 163-136 of this chapter to ensure the timely and proper
installation of such improvements. The developer shall be
responsible for installing all improvements required pursuant to
this subsection, and for that purpose shall engage only such
properly licensed and qualified contractors and subcontractors as
have been approved by the City Engineer for the type of work
involved; provided, however, that where an ongoing or proposed
City public improvements program offers a more efficient and
orderly vehicle for installing such improvements, the Planning
Board may require such improvements to be installed by the City as
part of such program and require the developer to pay the cost
thereof.
§ 163-128 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 163-128
1:915
F. Off-tract improvements specifically benefiting more than the subject
development.
(1) Except as provided in Subsection F(3) below, the developer of every
proposed development shall be required, as a condition of the grant
of any approval pursuant to Articles XIX through XXV, to provide all
off-tract public improvements which are necessary to serve, or
which benefit, the subject property, even though such
improvements may also specially benefit other properties. Except
as noted in Subsection F(2) below, all such improvements shall be
required, designed, sized and installed in accordance with the
Master Plan, the capital improvements program, the Official Map,
this chapter and such other plans, programs, maps and ordinances
adopted by or under consideration pursuant to public notice by the
City or other governmental agencies having jurisdiction to guide
growth and development at the time the first application in
connection with such development is filed. In the absence of any
such plan, program, map or ordinance, the public improvements
shall be required, designed, sized and installed in accordance with
the City Engineer's determination based on good engineering
practice and all available information concerning present and
future needs. The cost of providing and installing such
improvements shall be paid in accordance with the provisions of
Subsection F(3) below.
(2) The Planning Board may, as a condition of any approval required to
be given by it pursuant to Articles XIX through XXVI require the
installation of a public improvement of greater size or capacity than
required by Subsection F(1) above when it deems such greater size
or capacity to be necessary in light of factors not known or
considered at the time the aforesaid plan, program, map or
ordinance was adopted or placed under consideration. The costs
due to installing such greater size or capacity shall be apportioned
and paid in the same manner as other costs pursuant to Subsection
F(3) below.
(3) Subject to the right of the developer to petition the City Council for
approval of an alternative financing arrangement pursuant to
Subsection F(4) below, it shall be a condition of every approval
granted pursuant to Articles XIX through XXV that all public
improvements required to be installed pursuant to this subsection
shall be installed at the sole cost and expense of the developer.
Such approval shall, however, provide that the developer shall be
entitled to reimbursement, in the manner and to the extent
authorized by Subsection F(5) below, up to a maximum amount
equal to the difference between the amount of such cost and
expense paid by such developer and such developer's pro rata
share of the cost of such improvement. Said pro rata share shall be
an amount equal to the sum of the special benefit realized by such
developer's property from such improvement plus such developer's
§ 163-128 ATLANTIC CITY CODE § 163-128
1:916
property's pro rata share, based upon the ratio between its special
benefit and the total of all special benefits, of the cost of such
improvement not reflected in a special benefit to any tract.
(4) Petition for alternative financing.
(a) Whenever any approval required pursuant to Articles XIX
through XXV is conditioned upon the developer providing and
installing any improvement required by this subsection at his
sole cost and expense or at any cost and expense to such
developer greater than his pro rata share of the cost of such
improvement as specified in Subsection F(3) above, the
developer may, in lieu of accepting such condition, petition the
City Council within 45 days following the granting of such
approval, for an alternative method of financing such
improvement. The developer shall notify the Land Use
Administrator and the Planning Board upon filing such a
petition.
(b) Within 45 days following receipt of such petition, the City
Council shall enter one or a combination of the following
decisions and notify the developer, the Land Use Administrator
and the Planning Board of its decision:
[1] The petition is denied, or partially denied, and the
developer shall be required to pay the full initial cost and
expense of providing the improvement or specified
portions of the improvements in question, subject to the
right of reimbursement as provided in Subsection F(3) and
(5) hereof.
[2] The petition is granted, or partially granted, and the cost
and expense of improvement or specified portions of the
improvements, up to a maximum amount equal to the total
of the special benefits to be conferred by the
improvements or portions thereof, on all properties,
including the subject property, shall be financed and paid
as a general improvement at the general expense of the
City. In any such case, the developer shall remain
responsible for the payment and the guaranty pursuant to
§ 163-136 of this chapter of the amount by which the total
cost and expense of providing said improvement exceeds
the total value of the special benefits conferred on specific
properties, including the subject property. In any case
where the Council determines that all or part of any
improvement is to be financed as provided in this
Subsection, it shall determine the manner, method and
timing of the installation of such improvements and shall
adopt an ordinance authorizing and providing for the
financing of such improvement in a manner consistent
with such determination, with the developer's obligation
§ 163-128 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 163-128
1:917
for a portion of the cost and expense thereof as herein
provided and with the provisions of law in such cases made
and provided.
[3] The petition is granted, or partially granted, and the cost
and expense of the improvements, or specified portion of
the improvements, up to a maximum amount equal to the
total of the special benefits to be conferred by the
improvement or portion thereof, on all properties, other
than the subject property, shall be financed and paid as a
local improvement, the cost of which is to be assessed, in
the manner provided by law, against the properties, other
than the subject property, specially benefited thereby. In
any such case, the developer shall remain responsible for
the payment and the guaranty pursuant to § 163-136 of
this chapter, of an amount equal to the value of the special
benefit conferred upon the subject property, plus the
amount by which the total cost and expense of providing
said improvement exceeds the total value of the special
benefits conferred on specific properties, including the
subject property. In any case where the Council
determines that all or part of any improvement is to be
financed as provided in this Subsection, it shall determine
the manner, method and timing of the installation of such
improvements and shall adopt an ordinance authorizing
and providing for the financing of such improvement in a
manner consistent with such determination, with the
developer's obligation for a portion of the cost and expense
thereof as herein provided and with the provisions of law
in such cases made and provided.
(c) When a petition is filed pursuant to this Subsection, all time
limits otherwise applicable to the processing of approvals or
permits related to the subject development shall be extended
by a period of time equal to the time between the date of the
approval giving rise to the petition, and the date on which the
City Council enters its decision on the petition as hereinabove
provided and every such petition filed hereunder shall include
a statement of the applicant consenting to such extension.
(5) Determination of reimbursement.
(a) Whenever a public improvement, or any portion thereof,
required to be installed pursuant to this Subsection is installed
at the sole cost and expense of a developer, or at any cost and
expense to such developer greater than his pro rata share of
the cost of such improvement as specified in Subsection F(3)
above, the developer shall be entitled to reimbursement, up to
the maximum amount specified in Subsection F(3) above, of his
costs and expenses if, when and as other properties
determined to be specifically benefited by such improvement
§ 163-128 ATLANTIC CITY CODE § 163-128
1:918
subsequently seek approval for any development that will be
served or benefited by such improvement.
(b) In any such case, the approval of the application for the subject
property shall include a determination by the Planning Board,
pursuant to § 163-128B(5) above, of all properties specially
benefited by the improvement and of the value of the special
benefit to each such property. The results of said determination
and notice of the obligations on each specially benefited
property pursuant thereto shall be recorded by the Land Use
Administrator in the records of the Atlantic County Recorder
with respect to each such specially benefited property.
(c) Subsequent development; formulas for computation of amount
to be paid to original developer.
[1] Thereafter, no approval or permit required by this chapter
or any other ordinance of the City with respect to any
subsequent development resulting in the use of,
connection to or enjoyment of any benefit from such
improvement by any such specially benefited property
shall be granted or issued unless and until the subsequent
developer of such specially benefited property shall have
paid the original developer and any other prior developers
contributing to the cost and expense of such improvement
an amount calculated pursuant to the following formula:
Where
X = The amount to be recaptured by prior
developers from subsequent developer.
A = The total project cost.
B = The total project general benefit (total project
cost minus the sum of all special benefits).
Cn = The subsequent developer's special benefit.
n-1
EC
= The total of all prior developer's special
benefits.
i=1
n-1
= The total number of prior developers
contributing to the cost of the improvements.
n = n-1, plus current developer.
§ 163-128 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 163-128
1:919
§ 163-129. Elimination of impacts of specified developments.
[2] The amount thus computed and paid by the subsequent
developer shall be divided among all prior developers
pursuant to the following formula:
Where
Yi = The share of the total payment being
distributed due to prior developer.
X = The total payment being distributed.
Ci = The prior developer i's special benefit.
n
EC1
i-1
= The sum of all prior developer's special
benefits.
n = The total number of prior developers entitled
to a share of the payment X.
[3] An example of the calculations required in connection with
this subsection is on file and open to public inspection in
the office of the City Clerk.
A. General standard.
(1) The requirements set out in § 163-128 above for public
improvements and public sites shall be deemed the minimum
requirements necessary to protect the public health, safety and
welfare in connection with all developments requiring site plan/
subdivision approval but otherwise permitted as a matter of right
as permitted uses in the various zoning districts established by this
chapter. In addition to such requirements, the Planning Board shall
have authority, in connection with its review and approval of any
site plan/subdivision plat for any proposed development requiring
planned development, conditional use or variance approval, to
impose as a condition on any of said discretionary approvals and on
any related site plan/subdivision approval pursuant to Articles XIX
through XXV additional requirements intended and designed to
eliminate or ameliorate the physical, economic and social impacts
of the proposed development on its immediate environs and on the
general health, safety and welfare of the City and its residents and
visitors.
§ 163-128 ATLANTIC CITY CODE § 163-129
1:920
(2) No application for such a development shall be granted unless the
Planning Board shall find, pursuant to the provisions of Subsection
B below and the provisions of this chapter applicable to the
granting of the aforesaid discretionary approvals, that the
proposed use in the proposed location will not result in any undue
adverse physical, economic or social impacts upon its immediate
environs or the general health, safety and welfare of the City, its
residents and its visitors, which will not be eliminated by reason of
the developer's compliance with conditions imposed pursuant to
Subsection B below and the provisions of this chapter applicable to
the aforesaid discretionary approvals.
B. Determination of need for special conditions.
(1) Whenever an application for site plan/subdivision approval for a
development requiring planned development, conditional use or
use variance approval is filed with the Planning Board pursuant to
Articles XIX through XXV, the Board shall determine what, if any,
conditions on those approvals, in addition to or in lieu of conditions
to be imposed pursuant to § 163-128 above, are necessary to
eliminate any undue, adverse physical, economic or social impacts
of the proposed development on its immediate environs and on the
general health, safety and welfare of the City, its residents and
visitors. Such conditions may relate to the provisions of public
improvements; public sites and rights-of-way; on-tract and on-site
improvements, facilities, landscaping and amenities and services;
and contributions to general public programs and projects
designed to respond to the adverse impact in question; or any other
matter found by the Planning Board to be reasonably necessary to
eliminate any undue adverse physical, economic or social impact
which would be imposed by or have a rational nexus with the
proposed development. In any case where the developer declines to
accept such condition, the planned development, conditional use or
use variance approval sought shall be denied, the site plan/
subdivision approval sought shall be denied to the extent it is
dependent upon the aforesaid discretionary approvals and the
developer shall, unless he shall subsequently apply for and receive
another such discretionary approval, be limited to those uses
permitted in the zoning district where the property is located
without the need for the aforesaid discretionary approvals.
(2) The Planning Board shall base its determination on the nature and
scope of the proposed development; the provisions of this chapter
specifically applicable to the type of development being proposed
and the specific type of discretionary approval being sought; the
provisions of the Master Plan, capital improvements program,
Official Map and any other plans, programs or maps adopted by or
under consideration pursuant to notice by the City or other
governmental agencies having jurisdiction to guide growth and
development; the provisions of this chapter and other development
§ 163-129 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 163-129
1:921
regulations adopted by the City or other governmental agencies
having jurisdiction, with particular attention to any such provisions
specifically applicable to the type of development being proposed
or the area in which it is proposed and any special restrictions or
conditions on such development or areas; and the studies, reports
and opinions of City departments, officials and consultants having
special knowledge, expertise or responsibility with respect to the
development, improvements or conditions under consideration.
(3) In determining whether conditions are necessary to eliminate
adverse impacts of a development requiring planned development,
conditional use or use variance approval, the Planning Board shall
be guided by the principles set forth in § 163-128 above and by the
additional principles that such approvals are discretionary, that the
uses permitted as of right without such approvals in the various
zoning districts reflect a careful balancing of the rights of the
owners against the lawfully cognizable concerns of the public, that
uses requiring such approvals are placed in a special category
because they impose unusual burdens on the public while
conferring special benefits on the owner and that the public has the
right and duty to insist that those seeking such special benefits
accept the responsibility for responding to and eliminating those
unusual burdens which are found to have a rational nexus with the
special approval sought or the development proposed. Neither the
fact that a specific condition could have been imposed pursuant to
§ 163-128 above nor the fact that such a condition is not authorized
by said subsection shall prevent its imposition pursuant to this
section in the case of any development requiring planned
development, conditional use or use variance approval pursuant to
the provisions of this chapter.
(4) In the event that the Planning Board shall determine, pursuant to
this section, that conditions are required to eliminate any undue
adverse physical, economic or social impacts of a development
requiring planned development, conditional use or use variance
approval, it shall condition its grant of the aforesaid approvals and
its grant of site plan/subdivision approval pursuant to Articles XIX
through XXV as necessary to eliminate such impacts.
C. The cost of meeting any condition imposed pursuant to this section shall
be borne solely by the developer upon which the condition is imposed,
unless the Planning Board shall find that just cause exists for
authorizing a petition to the City Council as provided in § 163-128D
above or for granting rights of reimbursement to the extent and in the
manner provided in § 163-128E above on the basis of the extent of the
cost and expense of meeting the condition imposed in relation to the
value of the development for which discretionary approval is sought,
the degree to which the condition will specifically benefit other specific
properties and the degree to which the subject property has or is likely
to benefit, without cost or expense, from similar conditions imposed
§ 163-129 ATLANTIC CITY CODE § 163-129

§ 163-130. Installation of public improvements, sites and rights-ofway.
General standard. No application for site plan/subdivision approval shall be
granted unless the Planning Board shall find that the proposed development
is adequately served by public improvements, either existing or to be
provided by the developer pursuant to § 163-128 or 163-129 above, which
are in compliance with the provisions of the Master Plan, the capital
improvements program, the Official Map and this chapter.
§ 163-131. Standards for visibility at street corners.
upon other properties seeking similar discretionary approvals. In the
event that the Planning Board shall make either such determination,
the provisions of § 163-128 above with respect thereto shall apply
thereto.294
A. Standards for visibility across corners. Except as provided in
§ 163-71D(7)(b) of this chapter with respect to sign poles, no building,
structure, landscaping or other obstruction to sight shall be located
more than 2 1/2 feet above grade and less than nine feet above the
grade at the curb or street line within a triangle formed by connecting
the center lines of any two intersecting streets as herein provided. The

unless the Planning Board shall find that, in addition to meeting the
specific standards set forth in §§ 163-127 through 163-132 above, the
proposed development is not subject to any of the deficiencies specified
in this section. Compliance with the aforesaid specific standards shall
create a presumption that no such deficiency exists, and the Planning
Board shall not deny any application pursuant to this section except on
the basis of specific written findings fully documenting one or more of
the following deficiencies:
(1) The application is incomplete in specified particulars or contains or
reveals violations of this chapter or other applicable development
regulations which the applicant has, after written request, failed or
refused to supply or correct.
(2) In the case of a site plan/subdivision plat submitted in conjunction
with an application for a planned development, a conditional use or
a use variance, the site plan fails to adequately meet specified
standards required by this chapter with respect to such
development or use.
(3) The proposed development interferes unnecessarily, and in
specified particulars, with easements, roadways, rail lines, utilities
and public or private rights-of-way.
(4) The proposed development unnecessarily, and in specified
particulars, destroys, damages, detrimentally modifies or interferes
with the enjoyment of significant natural, topographic or physical
features of the site.

§ 163-134. Authority to grant exceptions. [Amended 6-15-1988 by
Ord. No. 1-1988]
When acting upon applications for preliminary site plan/subdivision plat
approval or for minor subdivision approval pursuant to the provisions of
Articles XIX through XXV, the Planning Board shall have the power to grant
such exceptions from the standards established pursuant to §§ 163-70,
163-73, 163-74 and 163-127 through 163-133 hereof as may be reasonable
and within the general purpose and intent of the provisions of Articles XIX
through XXV; provided, however, that no such exception shall be granted
unless the Planning Board shall, on the basis of written findings and
conclusions in the form required by § 163-23 of this chapter, find that the
literal enforcement of the standard in question is impracticable or will exact
an undue hardship because or peculiar conditions pertaining to the subject
property.
§ 163-135. Ancillary Powers of Planning Board; simultaneous
review and approval.
(5) The proposed development unnecessarily, and in specified
particulars, in injurious or detrimental to the use and enjoyment of
surrounding property.
(6) The circulation elements of the proposed site plan unnecessarily,
and in specified particulars, create hazards to safety on or off tract,
disjointed pedestrian or vehicular circulation paths on or off tract,
undue dependence on automobile travel or undue interferences
and inconveniences to pedestrian travel.
(7) The screening of the site does not provide adequate shielding from
or for nearby uses which may be incompatible with the proposed
use.
(8) The proposed structures or landscaping unnecessarily, and in
specified particulars, is lacking amenity in relation to or is
incompatible with nearby structures and uses.
(9) The proposed development unnecessarily, and in specified
particulars, creates drainage or erosion problems.
B. In citing any of the foregoing deficiencies, other than those of
Subsection A(1) above, as the basis for declining to approve a site plan/
subdivision plat, the Planning Board shall suggest alternate site plan/
subdivision plat approaches which could be developed to avoid the
specified deficiency or shall state the reasons why such deficiency
cannot be avoided consistent with the applicant's objectives.
A. Variances. When reviewing applications for approval of site plans or
subdivision plats pursuant to Articles XIX through XXV, the Planning
Board shall have the power to grant, to the same extent and subject to
§ 163-133 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 163-135
1:925
the same provisions, conditions and limitations as applicable to the
Board of Adjustment:
(1) Variances, pursuant to § 163-166 of this chapter, from bulk, space
and yard requirements. [Amended 6-15-1988 by Ord. No.
1-1988]
(2) Variances and directions, pursuant to § 163-168D(1) of this chapter,

area reserved pursuant to § 163-46B of this chapter.
(3) Variances and directions, pursuant to § 163-168D(2) of this chapter,
for issuance of a permit for a building or structure not abutting a
street.
B. Conditional uses and planned developments. When reviewing
applications for approval of site plans or subdivision plats pursuant to
Articles XIX through XXV, the Planning Board shall have the power to
review and approve or deny applications for conditional use permits,
pursuant to Part 5, Article XXVI, of this chapter, and applications for
planned development approvals, pursuant to Part 5, Article XXVII, of
this chapter.
C. Applications for additional approvals. Whenever, in addition to approval
of a site plan or subdivision plat pursuant to Articles XIX through XXV,
the applicant will, in connection with the proposed development,
require any of the approvals authorized by Subsections A and B of this
section, the applicant shall indicate that fact at the prehearing
conference required by Part 5, Article XX, of this chapter and shall, at
the time of filing an application for preliminary site plan/subdivision
plat approval, file applications for all other required approvals.
D. Notice of applications for additional approvals. Whenever, in connection
with an application for site plan/subdivision plat approval pursuant to
Articles XIX through XXV, the applicant files an application for other
approvals pursuant to this section, all required notices shall include
reference to the request for any and all additional approvals.
E. Procedures and action by Planning Board. Whenever, in conjunction
with an application for site plan/subdivision plat approval, an applicant
files applications for other approvals pursuant to this section, the
Planning Board shall review and process all such applications at the
same public hearing. In reviewing such combined applications, the
Planning Board shall, except as hereinafter provided with respect to
limitations on the time for taking action, comply with all of the
provisions of this chapter applicable to each of the applications. Where,
pursuant to the ancillary jurisdiction granted by this section, the
Planning Board is reviewing an application subject to the primary
jurisdiction of the Board of Adjustment, all provisions of this chapter
applicable to the Board of Adjustment in reviewing such an application
§ 163-135 ATLANTIC CITY CODE § 163-135
1:926
§ 163-136. Guaranties.
shall be deemed to refer to and to apply to the Planning Board. The
Planning Board shall act on any such combined application within the
longest time period, not to exceed 120 days, applicable to any one of the
individual applications included in the combined application or within
such further time as may be consented to by the applicant. Failure of
the Planning Board to act within such period of time shall constitute
approval of the application. The Land Use Administrator shall issue
notices and certificates of such action or failure to act in accordance
with the provisions of this chapter applicable to the various applications
involved. [Amended 6-15-1988 by Ord. No. 1-1988]
A. Guaranties required. Unless expressly waived by the Planning Board in
granting final site plan/subdivision plat approval, the applicant shall not
be entitled to receive or record a copy of the final plan/plat bearing the
required signatures of the Planning Board Chairman and Secretary or
the Land Use Administrator or his designee nor shall the applicant be
entitled to receive a certificate of approval by inaction pursuant to
§ 163-115 of this chapter unless and until the applicant shall have
submitted to the Land Use Administrator performance and
maintenance guaranties as herein required. Such guaranties shall be in
form approved by the City Solicitor and in an amount based upon the
City Engineer's estimate of the cost of the work and improvements
covered by the guaranty. If not in cash, such guaranties shall be secured
by a corporate surety licensed to do business in the State of New Jersey
and approved by the City Council. [Amended 6-15-1988 by Ord. No.
1-1988]
B. Performance guaranties. The applicant shall furnish a performance
guaranty in the favor of the City in an amount equal to 120% of the City
Engineer's estimate of the cost of installing all improvements, facilities
and work required to be installed by the applicant as a condition of final
plan/plat approval, whether on site, off site, on tract or off tract. Such
improvements, facilities and work shall include, without limitation, all
public improvements, grading, improvement of public and private
common open spaces and surveyor's monuments. Such performance
guaranty shall guarantee the installation of said improvements,
facilities and work in a good and workmanlike fashion in accordance
with the approved final plan or plat within the time specified in the
approved staging plan or, if no such time is specified, within two years
following the date of final plan or plat approval.
C. Maintenance guaranty. The applicant shall furnish a maintenance
guaranty in favor of the City, covering all improvements, facilities and
work required to be covered by the performance guaranty required in
Subsection B above. The maintenance guaranty shall remain in full
force and effect for a period of two years following final acceptance of
the improvement, facility or work in question and shall be in an amount
equal to 15% of the cost of such improvement, facility or work.
§ 163-135 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 163-136
1:927
D. Exception. In the event that a governmental agency or public utility,
other than the City of Atlantic City, will automatically own the
improvements, facilities or work to be installed pursuant to the
approved final plan or plat or in the event that such improvements,
facilities or work are covered by a performance or maintenance
guaranty required by a governmental agency other than the City of
Atlantic City, no additional performance or maintenance guaranty
covering such improvements, facilities or work shall be required
pursuant to this section.
E. Inspection of improvements, facilities and work during construction
and following completion; stop orders.
(1) All improvements, facilities and work required to be constructed
pursuant to an approved final plan or plat shall be regularly
inspected by the City Engineer and the Land Use Administrator for
compliance with the approved plans, the provisions of this chapter
and the requirements of all other applicable federal, state, county
and City laws, ordinances and regulations. If, as a result of such
inspections, the City Engineer or the Land Use Administrator shall
determine that any improvement, facility or work is not in
compliance with said plans, laws, ordinances or regulations, they
shall have authority to order that all or any part of the work on the
development shall be stopped until such time as necessary steps
are taken to correct any defects or deficiencies.
(2) In order to facilitate the regular inspection program herein
required, the applicant shall notify the City Engineer at least 48
hours prior to the surfacing of any street or private road, the
installation of any curbing or gutters or the grading or backfilling of
any open trench or excavation in which any public improvement
has been installed. Within 48 hours following the receipt of such
notice, the City Engineer shall conduct an on-site inspection of such
work.
F. Reduction of guaranties; notice of default to obligor and surety.
(1) If, as a result of the foregoing regular inspection program, the City
Engineer shall determine that portions of the required
improvements, facilities or work have been completed so as to
justify a reduction in the amount of the performance guaranty
posted by the applicant, he shall certify such facts to the City
Council, which may, thereupon, reduce the amount of the
performance guaranty to a sum not less than 120% of the cost of
the improvements, facilities and work yet to be completed.
(2) If, as a result of the foregoing regular inspection program, the City
Engineer determines that any of the required improvements,
facilities or work has not been or is not being performed or
corrected in accordance with the approved plans and applicable
laws, ordinances and regulations, he shall notify the City Council of
§ 163-136 ATLANTIC CITY CODE § 163-136
1:928
such fact, and the Board may, thereupon, take such action as
it shall deem appropriate to compel performance or may, in the
alternative, declare a forfeiture of the performance guaranty, and
the obligor and surety shall thereupon be liable upon the
performance guaranty to the City for the reasonable cost of the
improvements, facilities and work not completed or corrected, and
the City may, either prior to or after the receipt of the proceeds of
the performance guaranty, complete or correct such improvements,
facilities or work by the employment of such City personnel or
private contractor as it shall deem appropriate.
G. Completion and final inspection. When all of the required
improvements, facilities and work within a stage or unit of the
development have been completed, the obligor shall send written notice
of such completion to the City Council by certified mail, addressed in
care of the City Clerk. A copy of such notification shall also be sent to
the City Engineer. Upon receipt of such notice, the City Engineer shall
inspect all of the improvements, facilities and work and shall file a
detailed written report with the City Council, indicating either his
approval, partial approval or rejection of the improvements and
facilities. Such report shall contain detailed reasons in support of any
rejection. In case part of the improvements, facilities or work is
approved and part rejected, the report of the City Engineer shall set
forth the cost of the improvements, facilities and work required for
acceptance of the rejected improvements, facilities and work.
H. Action by City Council.
(1) Upon receipt of the report of the City Engineer, the City Council
shall either approve, partially approve or reject the improvements,
facilities and work on the basis of said report and shall notify the
obligor, in writing, by certified mail, of the contents of said report
and the action of the City Council with relation thereto. A copy of
such notice shall also be sent to the surety. Said notice shall be
given not later than 65 days following receipt of the notice from the
obligor that the improvements have been completed. Failure of the
City Council to send or provide such notification to the obligor
within said 65 days shall be deemed to constitute approval of the
improvement.
(2) Upon such approval or the expiration of such a period of time
without action, the obligor and surety shall be released from all
liability pursuant to the performance guaranty. Where partial
approval is granted, the obligor and surety shall be released from
all liability pursuant to the performance guaranty as to the
improvements, facilities and work approved, but shall not be
released as to any improvements, facilities or work rejected.
(3) If all or any portion of the required improvements, facilities or work
is rejected, the City Council shall require the obligor to complete
such improvements, facilities and work and to again give notice of
§ 163-136 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 163-136
1:929
§ 163-137. Building and other permits. [Amended 6-15-1988 by
Ord. No. 1-1988]
Except as otherwise expressly provided in § 163-108 of this chapter, upon,
but not before, receiving notice from the Land Use Administrator that the
approved final plan or plat has been recorded and upon application by
the applicant, all appropriate officials of the City may issue building and
other permits to the applicant for development, construction and other work
in the areas encompassed by the approved final plan or plat; provided,
however, that no such permit shall be issued unless the appropriate official
is first satisfied that the requirements of any codes or ordinances of the
City, in addition to this chapter, which are applicable to the permit sought
have been satisfied. No certificate of occupancy shall be issued for any
use or structure within such area until all improvements, facilities and
work required to be guaranteed pursuant to § 163-136 hereof have been
completed and accepted as therein provided.
§ 163-138. Amendments to final plan or plat. [Amended 6-15-1988
by Ord. No. 1-1988]
During construction of a development and before the issuance of any
certificate of occupancy, amendments to the final plan or plat may be
permitted as follows:
such completion pursuant to this section within a period of time
to be fixed by the City Council. In the alternative, if any required
improvements, facilities or work are not completed or not
corrected in accordance with the approved final plan and
applicable laws, ordinances and regulations, the City may declare a
forfeiture of the performance guaranty, and, thereupon, the obligor
and surety shall be liable upon the performance guaranty to the
City for the reasonable cost of the improvements, facilities or work
not completed or corrected, and the City may, either prior to or
after the receipt of the proceeds of the performance guaranty,
complete or correct such improvements or facilities by the
employment of such City personnel or private contractors as it shall
deem appropriate.
A. Minor amendments.
(1) The Planning Board may, upon written request of the applicant or
owner and without public hearing, authorize minor amendments to
the final plan or plat when such amendments appear necessary in
light of technical or engineering considerations first discovered
during actual development or of changes in conditions beyond the
control of the developer which have occurred since the date of final
approval. Such minor amendments shall be limited to the following:
(a) Altering the volume or any dimension of any structure by not
more than 10%.
§ 163-136 ATLANTIC CITY CODE § 163-138
1:930
§ 163-139. Inspections.
(b) Altering the location of any one structure or group of
structures by not more than 20 feet or 1/4 of the distance
shown on the final plan or plat between such structure or
structures and any other structure or any vehicular circulation
element or any boundary of the development, whichever is
less.
(c) Altering the location of any circulation element by not more
than 20 feet or 1/4 of the distance shown on the final plan or
plat between such circulation element and any structure,
whichever is less.
(d) Altering the location of any open space by not more than 100
feet.
(e) Reducing the total amount of open space by not more than 5%
or reducing the yard area or open space associated with any
single structure by not more than 10%.
(f) Altering any final grade by not more than 10% of the originally
planned grade.
(g) Altering the location, type or quality of landscaping elements.
(2) Such minor amendments shall be consistent with the intent and
purpose of the Master Plan, the capital improvements program, the
Official Map and the approved final plan or plat; shall not violate
any applicable standard or provision of this chapter or any other
law, ordinance or regulation; and shall be the minimum necessary
to overcome the particular difficulty.
B. Major amendments. Any other amendments to an approved final plan or
plat shall be considered major amendments and shall be granted only in
the same manner and subject to the same standards and conditions as
established pursuant to Articles XIX through XXV for the original
review and approval of site plans and subdivision plats.
A. Inspections by Land Use Administrator. Following final plan or plat
approval, the Land Use Administrator shall, in addition to the
inspections required pursuant to § 163-136 of this chapter in
connection with the installation of improvements and facilities, at least
once every six months until the completion of the development and
continually thereafter following completion of the development review
all permits issued and construction undertaken and compare actual
development with the approved plans for development and with the
approved development schedule. [Amended 6-15-1988 by Ord. No.
1-1988]
B. Action by Land Use Administrator. If the Land Use Administrator finds
that development is not proceeding in accordance with the approved
§ 163-138 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 163-139
1:931
schedule or that it fails in any other respect to comply with the plans
or plats as finally approved, he shall immediately notify the Planning
Board of such fact and may, if he finds it necessary to ensure
compliance with the approved plan or plat and the provisions of this
chapter, issue an order stopping any or all work on the development
until such time as any noncompliance is cured.
C. Action by Planning Board. Within 30 days following such notice, the
Planning Board shall take one or more of the following actions as it shall
deem appropriate:
(1) Revoke, by resolution, the final plan or plat approval and all prior
approvals and related or resulting permits;
(2) Commence such steps as it shall deem necessary to compel
compliance with the final plan or plat approval;
(3) Require the owner or applicant to seek an amendment in the final
plan or plat as provided in § 163-138 of this chapter; or
(4) Pursue such other remedies as may be available to enforce
compliance with this chapter and to punish any failure to comply.

ARTICLE XXVI
Conditional Uses
§ 163-140. Authority.
The Planning Board shall, subject to the procedures, standards and
limitations hereinafter set forth, have authority to review and approve or
disapprove the issuance of permits authorizing the development of uses
listed in § 163-142 below as conditional uses; provided, however, that,
except as limited by § 163-153 of this chapter, the resolution of the Board
of Adjustment shall substitute for that of the Planning Board whenever the
Board of Adjustment has jurisdiction over a conditional use pursuant to
§ 163-170G of this chapter.
§ 163-141. Purpose.
Conditional uses are those uses having some special impact or uniqueness
which require a careful review of their location, design, configuration and
special impact to determine, against fixed standards, the desirability of
permitting their establishment on any given site. They are uses which may
or may not be appropriate in a particular location depending on a weighing,
in each case, of the public need and benefit against the local impact and
effect, giving effect to the proposals of the developer for ameliorating any
adverse impacts or effect through special site planning and development
techniques and contributions to the provision of public improvements, sites,
rights-of-way and services.
§ 163-142. Conditional uses.
Subject to the procedures, standards and limitations set forth in this
section, the following uses, and none others, may be allowed as conditional
uses in the zoning districts indicated:
A. Any use specifically listed as a conditional use in the regulations
applicable to the district in which it is to be located.
B. Planned developments, subject to the additional procedures, standards
and limitations set out in Part 5, Article XXVII, of this chapter.
C. Signs in or over public rights-of-way, but only when in compliance with
all of the applicable provisions of § 163-71 of this chapter.
D. The use of a nonconforming lot of record for a use other than a
detached single-family dwelling, but only in compliance with all of the
provisions of Part 5, Article XXVIII, of this chapter.
E. In any district, public, private and parochial schools, elementary
through high school, subject to the following additional standards:
(1) Access. For schools other than elementary schools, access to
parking area for over 50 cars and to service areas shall be from
arterial or collector streets or service roads.
§ 163-140 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 163-142
1:933
(2) Buffer. All outdoor areas of concentrated activity shall be separated
from adjoining residential property by a minimum of 30 feet or by a
buffer found sufficient by the Planning Board to ensure visual and
auditory privacy.
F. Any of the following uses in any district:
(1) Public parks, playgrounds and community centers, subject to the
additional standard that all outdoor areas of concentrated activity
shall be separated from adjoining residential property by a
minimum of 30 feet or by a buffer found sufficient by the Planning
Board to ensure visual and auditory privacy to such properties.
(2) Public utility stations, subject to the following additional standards:
(a) All buildings and structures shall either have exteriors which
give the appearance of a structure permitted in the district
where located or shall be screened from view from any private
property located in any residential district, and any such
screening located in or adjoining any front yard shall be limited
to vegetation which provides effective year-round screening.
(b) All such uses shall be fenced where any hazard to the safety of
human or animal life is present.
(c) No service or storage yard or building shall be permitted

applicable to the proposed development by the provisions of this
chapter; or that the proposed use, if developed in the manner

standards applicable to it pursuant to the provisions of this chapter,
or that the adverse impacts of the development, after taking into
consideration any proposals of the applicant to ameliorate those
adverse impacts and any conditions that might be imposed by the
Planning Board pursuant to the provisions of this chapter to
ameliorate those adverse impacts, outweigh any public or private
benefits of the proposal and require denial of the conditional use

publish notice and mail a certificate of such decision or failure to
act to all parties entitled thereto as provided by § 163-200 of this

Subsection H(1) and (2) of this section, the applicant shall indicate
that fact at the prehearing conference required by Subsection A
of this section and shall, at the time of filing an application for
issuance of a conditional use permit, file applications for all other

(4) Notice of applications for additional approvals. Whenever, in
connection with an application for issuance of a conditional use
permit pursuant to this article, the applicant files an application for
other approvals pursuant to this section, all required notices shall
include reference to the request for any and all additional

permit, an applicant files applications for other approvals pursuant
to this section, the Planning Board shall review and process all such
applications at the same public hearing. In reviewing such
combined applications, the Planning Board shall, except as
hereinafter provided with respect to limitations on the time for

Use Administrator shall issue notices and certificates of such action
or failure to act in accordance with the Provisions of this chapter
applicable to the various applications involved. [Amended
6-15-1988 by Ord. No. 1-1988]
A. Use standards. No application for issuance of a conditional use permit
shall be approved unless the Planning Board shall find that the
proposed conditional use is appropriate in the location proposed based
upon its consideration of the following criteria in light of the provisions
of Subsection E below:
(1) The proposed use shall be in harmony with the general purpose,
goals, objectives and standards of the Master Plan, the capital
improvements program, the Official Map and any other plan,
program, map or ordinance adopted or under consideration
§ 163-144 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 163-145
1:939
pursuant to official notice by the City or other governmental
agencies to guide growth and development. The proposed use shall
be of such a nature and shall be so planned and developed as to
avoid any domination of the immediate vicinity or any interference
with the development and use of neighboring property in
accordance with the applicable district regulations and as to avoid
any destruction, loss or damage of natural, scenic or historic
features of significant importance.
(2) There shall be a community need for the proposed use at the
proposed location in light of existing and proposed uses of a similar
nature in the area and the need to provide or maintain a proper mix
of uses, both within the City and also within the immediate area of
the proposed use. The Planning Board shall not grant any
conditional use permit unless it is able to find that the proposed use
in the proposed location will not result in either a detrimental
overconcentration of a particular use within the City or within the
immediate area of the proposed use and that the area proposed for
the proposed use is not, and is not likely to become, as a result of
the implementation of the policies and provisions of the Master
plan, the capital improvements program, the Official Map, this
chapter or any other plan, program, map or ordinance adopted or
under consideration pursuant to official notice by the City or other
governmental agency having jurisdiction, necessary or more
appropriate for the development of uses other than the use
proposed.
(3) The proposed use at the proposed location shall not result in a
substantial or undue adverse effect upon adjacent property, the
character of the neighborhood, traffic conditions, parking, public
improvements, public sites or rights-of-way or other matters
affecting the public health, safety and general welfare either as
they now exist or as they may in the future be developed as a result
of the implementation of provisions and policies of the Master Plan,
the capital improvements program, the Official Map, this chapter
or any other plan, program, map or ordinance adopted or under
consideration pursuant to official notice by the City or other
governmental agency having jurisdiction to guide growth and
development.
B. Infrastructure standards.
(1) No application for issuance of a conditional use permit shall be
approved unless the Planning Board shall find, in light of the
provisions of Subsection E below, that the proposed use in the
proposed location is adequately served by and will not impose and
undue burden upon any of the improvements, facilities, utilities and
services specified in this subsection. Where any such
improvements, facilities, utilities or services are not available or
adequate to service the proposed use in the proposed location, the
applicant shall, as part of his application and as a condition to
§ 163-145 ATLANTIC CITY CODE § 163-145
1:940
approval of the proposed conditional use permit, be responsible
for establishing his ability, willingness and binding commitment
to provide such improvements, facilities, utilities and services in
sufficient time and in a manner consistent with the Master Plan,
the capital improvements program, the Official Map, this chapter
and other plans, programs, maps and ordinances adopted by the
City to guide its growth and development, and the approval of
the conditional use permit shall be conditioned upon such
improvements, facilities, utilities and services being provided and
guaranteed by the applicant pursuant to the provisions of
§§ 163-127 through 163-133 and § 163-136 of this chapter.
(2) The criteria to be met pursuant to this subsection are as follows:
(a) The proposed use shall be served adequately by and shall
provide or contribute to public improvements, sites and rightsof-
way to the extent specified in § 163-128B of this chapter.
(b) The proposed use shall be served by or shall provide proper
pedestrian and public transportation linkages, both within the
immediate area of the proposed development and with other
parts of the City and region.
(c) Essential municipal and quasi-public services, such as
transportation, police and fire protection, social and health
services, education, recreation and sanitation, shall be
adequate to serve the needs of the proposed development in
the proposed location, and the proposed development shall be
so designated and planned as not to overburden such services
in light of existing limitations and probable future demands.
(d) The proposed use shall be served by adequate public and
private open space, both in the immediate vicinity of the
proposed use and throughout the City. The Planning Board
shall, in considering this criterion, consider the adequacy of
such open spaces both in terms of site design and buffering
and in terms of open space needs of the permanent or transient
population likely to be generated by the proposed use.
(e) The existing, or proposed to be developed, housing stock shall
be adequate in terms of price, location, size of dwellings and
availability to house the projected work force of any proposed
industrial, commercial or resort use.
C. Site design standards. No application for issuance of a conditional use
permit shall be approved unless the Planning Board shall find, in light of
the provisions of Part 5, Articles XIX through XXV, of this chapter, that
the site plan/subdivision plat of the proposed use addresses and is
consistent with the standards established by §§ 163-127 through
163-133 of this chapter for site plan/subdivision plat approval.
§ 163-145 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 163-145
1:941
D. Other regulations. No application for issuance of a conditional use
permit shall be approved unless the Planning Board shall find that, in
addition to complying with each of the general standards made
applicable to all conditional uses by this section and each of the specific
standards made applicable to the proposed conditional use by the
provisions of this chapter applicable to the particular conditional use
being proposed, the proposed conditional use complies with all of the
standards applicable to site plans and subdivision plats pursuant to Part
5, Articles XIX through XXV, of this chapter; all of the standards, except
to the extent waived, varied or modified pursuant to the provisions of
this chapter, applicable in the zoning district in which the proposed
conditional use will be located; and all other standards made applicable
to the proposed conditional use by other federal, state, county and City
laws, ordinances and regulations to which it is subject.
E. General considerations. In determining whether the evidence
establishes that the foregoing standards have been met, the Planning
Board shall consider the following:
(1) Existing conditions.
(2) Planned and proposed public and private developments which are
likely to develop in time to remedy, compensate for or ameliorate
any adverse impacts of the proposed use on or as a result of
existing conditions.
(3) Planned and proposed public and private developments which may
be adversely affected by the proposed use.
(4) Proposals by the applicant to remedy, compensate for or ameliorate
any adverse impacts of the proposed development on or as a result
of existing conditions or planned and proposed developments.
(5) Whether and to what extent the proposed use at the particular
location requested is necessary or desirable to provide a service or
a facility which is in the interest of the public convenience or which
will contribute to the general welfare of the neighborhood or the
City.
(6) Whether and to what extent such public goals can be met by the
location of the proposed use at some other site or in some other
area which may be more appropriate than the proposed site.
(7) Whether and to what extent all steps possible have been taken by
the developer to minimize any adverse effects of the proposed use
on the immediate vicinity and on the general health, safety and
welfare of the City through building and site design, installation of
public improvements and contributions to public and private
programs designed to respond to the impacts of the proposed use.
§ 163-145 ATLANTIC CITY CODE § 163-146
1:942
§ 163-146. Additional standards.
Where the district regulations authorizing any conditional use in a
particular district impose additional standards to be met by such use in such
district or where other provisions of this chapter or other laws, ordinances
or regulations authorizing the particular use proposed or regulating such
use or the particular land area proposed for its development impose special
standards on the planning, design, construction or operation of such use or
the development or use of such land, a permit for such use shall be granted
only if evidence is presented to establish compliance with such additional
standards.
§ 163-147. Restrictions and conditions on conditional use approval.
§ 163-148. (Reserved)300
§ 163-149. Effect of issuance of conditional use permit.
The issuance of a permit for a conditional use shall not authorize the
establishment or extension of any use nor the development, construction,
reconstruction, alteration or moving of any building or structure, but shall
merely authorize the preparation, filing and processing of applications for
A. The Planning Board may, in approving the issuance of any conditional
use permit, impose such restrictions and conditions upon such
approval, the proposed use and the premises to be developed or used
pursuant to such approval as may be necessary to ensure the
compatibility of the proposed use and development with surrounding
development; the compliance and consistency of the proposed use and
development with the standards of this chapter and the general
purposes, goals and objectives of this chapter, the Master Plan, the
capital improvements program and the Official Map; and to prevent or
minimize adverse effects from the proposed use and development upon
other properties in the neighborhood and upon the general health,
safety and welfare of the entire City.
B. Every conditional use approval shall be conditioned upon the filing and
final approval of a final site plan/subdivision plat pursuant to Part 5,
Articles XIX through XXV, of this chapter and upon the developer's
continuing compliance with all applicable laws, ordinances and
regulations and all conditions imposed upon such approval.
C. All conditions imposed upon any conditional use approval, except to the
extent made applicable to such approval by the express terms of this
chapter, shall be expressly set forth in the resolution granting such
approval. The violation of any condition upon any such approval shall be
a violation of this chapter and grounds for revocation of such permit
pursuant to § 163-152 below.

provisions of this chapter, such permit may be amended, varied or altered
only pursuant to the standards and procedures established by this article
for its original approval.
§ 163-152. Revocation of permit.
In addition to the other penalties and remedies for violations of this chapter,
it shall be a condition of every conditional use approval that such approval
may be revoked for violation of any condition imposed upon such approval
either by the provisions of this chapter or by the provisions of the resolution
granting such approval; provided, however, that no such permit shall be
revoked except by resolution of the Planning Board, in the form specified
by § 163-23 of this chapter, adopted following a public hearing, advertised
and conducted by the Planning Board in same manner as provided for the
original approval of the permit, whereat the existence of such violation is

plan or plat is required, for a period longer than one year from the date
of issue, unless a building permit is issued and construction is actually
begun within that period and is thereafter diligently pursued to
completion or an occupancy permit is obtained and a use commenced
within that period.

ARTICLE XXVII
Planned Developments
§ 163-153. Authority.
The Planning Board shall, subject to the procedures, standards and
limitations hereinafter set forth, have authority to review and approve or
disapprove applications for planned development approval for the uses
and developments noted in § 163-156 of this chapter. In no case shall any
resolution of the Board of Adjustment substitute for that of the Planning
Board as to any approval required in connection with a planned
development.
§ 163-154. Purpose; objectives. [Amended 5-7-1981 by Ord. No.
32-1981]
A. This Article establishes special procedures and special substantive
regulations with respect to all types of planned developments permitted
in the City of Atlantic City, including residential cluster developments,
residential planned unit developments, resort planned developments,
commercial planned developments, industrial planned developments,
mixed use planned developments and commercial planned
developments of piers. The substantive and procedural provisions of
this article, taken in combination, are intended to substitute flexible
substantive standards and procedural protections for inflexible
substantive regulations in recognition of the fact that traditional
regulations governing use, density and intensity and physical
configuration of land use, which may be useful in protecting the
character of substantially developed and stable areas, may impose
inappropriate preregulations and rigidities upon the development or
redevelopment of parcels or areas which lend themselves to an
individual, planned approach. The substantive and procedural
regulations are also intended to give reasonable assurance to the
developer that he will receive expeditious ultimate approval before
expending substantial moneys on final plans while, at the same time,
providing the City with assurances that the project will retain the
character set forth at the time the planned development is first
approved.
B. Planned developments may be established pursuant to the provisions of
this article to achieve the following objectives:
(1) A development pattern in harmony with the objectives of the
various plans, maps, programs and ordinances adopted or
approved by the City to guide its growth and development.
(2) A more desirable environment than would be possible through the
strict application of other land use and development regulations of
the City.
§ 163-153 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 163-154
1:945
(3) A creative use of land and related physical development which
allows an orderly transition from one land use to another.
(4) An efficient use of land resulting in smaller networks of utilities and
streets and thereby lower development and housing costs.
(5) Diversification in the uses permitted and variation in the
relationship of uses, structures, open spaces and heights of
structures in developments conceived as cohesive unified projects.
(6) Higher standards of site and building design through the use of
trained and experienced land planners, architects, landscape
architects and engineers, to the end that the type, design and
layout of residential, resort, commercial, industrial, mixed use and
commercial pier developments may be substantially and efficiently
related to the particular site and its environs.
(7) The preservation and enhancement of desirable natural site
characteristics, including environmental and ecological systems
and amenities.
(8) The provision of man-made amenities.
(9) The preservation of and provision for the functional and beneficial
use of natural and landscaped open areas.
(10) Innovations and flexibility in residential development, to the end
that the growing demands for housing at all economic levels may
be met by greater variety in tenure, design and siting of dwellings
and by the conservation and more efficient use of land in
residential developments.
(11) More convenience in location of residential uses and related
accessory, commercial and service areas.
(12) Attractive, efficient and economic resort, commercial and
industrial developments designed to enhance the economic wellbeing
of the City without unnecessary or undue disruption of its
residential areas.
(13) Promotion and control of development associated with an active
resort, convention and tourist industry.
(14) Accomplishment of maximum practicable energy efficiency
through efficient use of land, siting and design of structures and
utilization of renewable energy sources and technology
economizing depletable sources.
(15) The adaptive reuse, reconstruction or restoration of existing piers
as viable environmental, commercial, cultural, recreational or
traditional boardwalk design elements.

the general standards applicable to all planned developments pursuant to
§ 163-158 of this chapter and the standards applicable pursuant to the
provisions of this article to the particular type of planned development
proposed. Every planned development authorized pursuant to this article

relating to conditional uses and to all the provisions of Part 5, Articles XIX
through XXV, of this chapter relating to site plan/subdivision approval.
§ 163-156. Authorized planned developments.

chapter, including an application for preliminary site plan/subdivision
approval pursuant to Part 5, Articles through XXV, of this chapter.
A pre-application conference pursuant to Part 5, Article XX, of this
chapter shall be required prior to the filing of an application for planned
development approval. The request for a prehearing conference shall
indicate the need for planned development approval pursuant to this
article and contain statements indicating the particular provisions of
this article authorizing the proposed planned development and
preliminary statements addressing the general and specific standards
applicable to the proposed planned development pursuant to the
provisions of this article. [Amended 6-15-1988 by Ord. No. 1-1988]
B. Authority to vary regulations. Except as limited by the provisions of this
article, the Planning Board may, in approving planned development
conditional use permits and plans or plats, change, alter, vary or modify
any provision of this chapter which would otherwise be applicable to
the use and development of the subject property; provided, however,
that no such change, alteration, variation or modification shall be
approved unless the Planning Board shall find that such change,
alteration, variation or modification will not, if permitted, violate the
standards and conditions for planned developments established by this
article; conditional uses as established by Part 5, Article XXVI, of this
chapter; or site plan/subdivision approval as established by Part 5,
Articles XIX through XXV, of this chapter; or violate the general
purposes, goals and objectives of this chapter, the Master Plan, the
capital improvements program and the Official Map, and will, if
permitted, result in a development providing compensating amenities
to the City and contributing to the overall advancement of the purposes
for which planned developments may be established pursuant to the
Article.
C. Findings for planned development. No application for planned
development approval shall be granted unless, in addition to making
the findings required by Part 5, Article XXVI, of this chapter for
conditional use approval and the findings required by Part 5, Articles
XIX through XXV, of this chapter for site plan/subdivision approval, the
Planning Board finds that the proposed development meets each of the
standards made applicable to it by this article and also finds that any
variations from the zoning regulations otherwise applicable to the
subject property authorized pursuant to this article conform to the
provisions of Subsection B above.
A. Use, infrastructure and site design standards. No application for
planned development approval shall be granted unless the Planning
Board shall find that the use, infrastructure and site design standards
§ 163-157 ATLANTIC CITY CODE § 163-158
1:948
made applicable to all conditional uses by § 163-145 of this chapter
have been met.
B. Ownership. No application for planned development approval shall be
granted unless the Planning Board shall find that the entire tract
proposed for planned development treatment is in single ownership or
under such unified control as to ensure that the entire tract will be
developed as a unified whole. All owners of the tract shall be included
as joint applicants on all applications, and all approvals shall bind all
owners. The violation of any owner as to any tract shall be deemed a
violation as to all owners and all tracts.
C. Minimum tract size. Sections 163-159 through 163-165 establishing
standards for particular types of planned developments establish the
minimum area required for each type of planned development;
however, no application for planned development approval shall be
granted unless the Planning Board shall find that, in addition to
satisfying any such specific standard, the tract in question is, giving
consideration to the type and scope of development proposed, of
sufficient size and shape to be planned and developed as a unified
whole, capable of meeting the objectives for which planned
developments may be established pursuant to this article.
D. Common open space and facilities. No application for planned
development approval shall be granted unless the Planning Board shall
find that all of the requirements of this subsection are met as to all
common open space and facilities, if any, to be provided in connection
with the proposed development:
(1) The amount and location of all common open space and facilities to
be provided in a planned development shall be consistent with the
minimum standards as established by the appropriate section of
this article for the particular type of planned development, with the
standards of Part 5, Articles XIX through XXV, of this chapter
relating to site plans/subdivision plats and with its intended
function as set forth in the application and plans for planned
development approval. When any stage of a planned development
intended to be developed in stages covering more than one
construction season will contain a proportion of common open
space or facilities less than its proportion of other development, the
developer shall provide a bond, credit, escrow or other assurance
satisfactory to the Planning Board to ensure the later provision and
development of at least an amount of common open space which
bears the same proportion to the total common open space as the
development in such stage bears to the total development.
(2) All common open space shall be either owned and maintained by a
landowner's organization established in accordance with this
subsection or may be, by mutual agreement of the developer and
the City Council, dedicated to the City or to another appropriate
§ 163-158 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 163-158
1:949
governmental agency willing and able to accept the dedication and
to maintain the open space for its intended purposes.
(3) No private common open space shall be used for the construction
of any structure or improvement, except such structures and
improvements as may be approved as part of the final site plan/
subdivision plat as appropriate to the intended aesthetic, leisure
and recreational uses for which the open space is intended. As a
condition of the approval of the conditional use permit for a
planned development, adequate safeguards, including recorded
covenants or dedication of development rights, shall be provided to
prevent the subsequent use of the open space for any other
structure, improvement or development.
(4) The approval of the conditional use permit for a planned
development shall be conditioned upon the final site plan/
subdivision plat, including such provisions for the ownership and
maintenance of private common open space and facilities as are
reasonably necessary to ensure their continuity, care, conservation,
maintenance and operation, in accordance with predetermined
standards, by a landowners' organization formed for the purpose
and to ensure that remedial measures will be available to the City if
the open space or facilities are permitted to deteriorate or are not
maintained by such organization in a condition consistent with the
best interests of the planned development or the City. Such
organization shall not be dissolved and shall not dispose of any
open space, by sale or otherwise, except to an organization which
will own and maintain the open space for the benefit of the
development in accordance with the provisions of this subsection.
No such organization or successor organization shall dispose of any
open space held by it except in compliance with the provisions of
this chapter and except after having first offered to dedicate such
open space to the City.
(5) Every landowners' organization, and the covenants and
declarations creating and regulating every landowners'
organization, formed or intended to own or maintain private
common open space or facilities pursuant to the requirements of
this chapter shall meet each of the following standards:
(a) The regulations governing the organization must be
established prior to the sale of any property within the planned
development or the area within the planned development
designated to have the exclusive use or benefit of the proposed
open space or facilities. [Amended 6-15-1988 by Ord. No.
1-1988]
(b) Tentative bylaws and rules of the oganization and all covenants
and restrictions to be recorded must be available at the time of
the application for final site plan/plat approval prior to
§ 163-158 ATLANTIC CITY CODE § 163-158
1:950
becoming effective. [Amended 6-15-1988 by Ord. No.
1-1988]
(c) The organization must be responsible for casualty and liability
insurance, taxes and the maintenance of the open space and
facilities to be deeded to it or maintained by it.
(d) Membership must be mandatory for each landowner and any
successor buyer having a right to the use, enjoyment or benefit
of the open space or facilities.
(e) Landowners having a right to the use, enjoyment or benefit of
the open space or facilities must pay their pro rata share of the
costs of the organization by means of an assessment, to be
levied by the organization, which meets the requirements for
becoming a lien on the property in accordance with the
statutes of the State of New Jersey.
(f) The organization must have the right to adjust the assessment
to meet changed needs. The membership vote required to
authorize such adjustment shall be fixed at not more than 2/3
of the members voting on the issue.
(g) The open space restrictions must be permanent and not for a
given period of years.
(h) The City shall have the right to enforce the covenants.
(6) In the event that such organization shall fail to maintain the private
open space or facilities in reasonable order and condition, the Land
Use Administrator may serve written notice upon such organization
or upon the owners of the development, setting forth the manner in
which the organization has failed to maintain the open space or
facilities in reasonable condition and demanding that such
maintenance deficiencies be cured within 35 days following the
date of the notice. The notice shall state the date, time and place
for a hearing, to be held by the Planning Board within 15 days
following the date of the notice, for the purposes of considering any
and all deficiencies in the maintenance of the open space or
facilities and the formulation of a program to eliminate all such
deficiencies. A copy of this subsection shall accompany each such
notice. Upon the conclusion of the hearing, the Planning Board may
modify the terms of the original notice as to deficiencies and may
give a reasonable extension of time, not to exceed 65 days, within
which they shall be cured.
(7) If the deficiencies set forth in the original notice or in the
modification thereof shall not have been cured within said 35 days
or any permitted extension thereof, the City, in order to preserve
and maintain the open space and facilities, may enter upon and
maintain such land or facilities for a period not to exceed one year.
The cost of such maintenance shall be assessed against the
§ 163-158 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 163-158
1:951
properties within the development that have a right of use,
enjoyment or benefit of the open space or facilities and shall
become a lien and tax on said properties, pro rata in accordance
with their respective assessed valuations at the time the lien is
imposed, and shall be added to and be a part of the taxes to
be levied and assessed thereon and enforced and collected, with
interest, by the same officers and in the same manner as other
taxes.
(8) At least 30 days prior to the conclusion of the year of maintenance
by the City or sooner at the request of the organization, the
Planning Board shall call a public hearing, upon 15 days' written
notice to such organization and to the owners of the development,
at which hearing the organization and the owners of the
development shall show cause why the City should not continue
such maintenance for a succeeding year. If the Planning Board shall
determine that the organization is ready and able to maintain its
open space and facilities in reasonable condition, the City shall
cease maintenance at the end of the year for which it had assumed
maintenance responsibility or, by mutual agreement of the Board
and the organization, at such other date as may be convenient. If
the Planning Board shall determine that such organization is not
ready and able to maintain said open space or facilities in
reasonable condition, the City may, at its option, continue its
maintenance during the next succeeding year and from year to year
thereafter, subject to a similar hearing and determination in each
succeeding year.
E. Private streets. Private streets shall not be permitted in planned
developments except with the express approval of the City Council.
When allowed, private streets shall, unless the City Council shall
determine that special circumstances relating to the use or location of
the street justify a variation, comply with all standards applicable to
similar public streets, including establishment of easements of the
same width as required rights-of-way. The land area devoted to private
streets and their associated easements shall be excluded in calculations
of allowable density or intensity of development in the same manner as
if dedication of a public street had been required.
F. Guaranties of completion. No application for planned development
approval shall be granted unless the Planning Board shall find that the
applicant has the financial and technical capacity to complete the
development as proposed, has made adequate provision pursuant to
§ 163-136 of this chapter to guarantee the installation and maintenance
of all public improvements and other facilities required to be provided
as a condition of any approval granted pursuant to this chapter, has
made adequate provision to guarantee performance of all other
conditions of the planned development approval and has made
adequate provision to guarantee the provision and development of any
common open space associated with the proposed development.
§ 163-158 ATLANTIC CITY CODE § 163-158
1:952
§ 163-159. Residential cluster developments (RCD).
G. Other regulations. No application for planned development approval
shall be granted unless the Planning Board shall find that, in addition to
complying with each of the general standards made applicable to all
planned developments by this section and each of the specific standards
made applicable to the proposed development by the section of this
article applicable to the particular type of development being proposed,
the proposed development complies with all of the standards applicable
to conditional uses pursuant to Part 5, Article XXVI, of this chapter; all
of the standards applicable to site plans/subdivision plats pursuant to
Part 5, Articles XIX through XXV, of this chapter; all of the standards,
except to the extent waived, varied or modified pursuant to the
provisions of this chapter, applicable in the zoning district in which the
proposed development will be located; and all other standards made
applicable to the proposed development by other federal, state, county
and City laws, ordinances and regulations to which it is subject.
H. All utilities shall be placed underground to the maximum extent feasible
for all new major development. For the purpose of this subsection,
"major development" shall be defined as a major subdivision, the
development of four or more existing lots, and/or the creation of four or
more dwelling units. [Added 10-16-2019 by Ord. No. 42-2019]
A. Purpose. Pursuant to N.J.S.A. 40:55D-45, the New Jersey Municipal
Land Use Law, the standards of this section are intended to permit
approval of residential cluster developments (RCD), permitting minor
modifications of the lot area and dimension, yard, setback, bulk and
space requirements, other than minimum lot area per unit and per
bedroom requirements and lot coverage requirements, applicable in
the various districts established by this chapter, in order to permit the
grouping of structures pursuant to a preconceived plan of development.
While all of the procedural requirements applicable to other planned
developments are applicable to residential cluster developments, it is
anticipated that, because neither use nor density may be modified,
many applications for such development will be uncomplicated and
readily expedited through the required administrative process.
Requests for waiver of submission requirements as authorized by the
provisions of Part 5, Articles XIX through XXV, of this chapter
applicable to site plans/subdivision approval will, whenever appropriate
in light of the nature of the application, be favorably received by the
Planning Board.
B. Minimum tract size. No residential cluster development shall be
approved for development on a tract containing less than two acres.
C. Use standards. No use shall be authorized by a residential cluster
development permit except uses permitted or permissible in the district

to the provisions of this chapter shall not excuse the requirement of
obtaining such special approval.
D. Density and coverage standards. No permit for a residential cluster
development shall authorize any increase in the overall density or
intensity of development nor any increase in the overall lot coverage
permitted by the district regulations applicable in the district in which
such development is to be located.
E. Open space. No dwelling unit in a residential cluster development shall
be located on a lot having less than the minimum lot area required by
the regulations of the district in which it is located, unless an area at
least equal to any deficiency below said minimum is provided and
maintained as part of a common open space for the benefit of the
inhabitants of said unit pursuant to the provisions of § 163-158D of this
chapter.
F. Other standards. The standards set forth in this section are in addition
to all other standards made applicable to the particular residential
cluster development being proposed by the provisions of this chapter,
and no application for approval of a residential cluster development
shall be approved unless all such other standards, including but not
limited to those relating to conditional uses, planned developments, site
plan/subdivision approval and the district in which the proposed
development will be located, have been met or, where permitted,
waived pursuant to the applicable provisions of this chapter. Except to
the extent expressly varied by the provisions of this article or any
approval granted pursuant to them, the standards of the district in
which the residential cluster development is located shall govern.
A. Purpose. The standards of this section are intended to permit approval
of residential planned unit developments (RPUD) to provide for the
development of residential planned developments as a single entity,
according to a plan, containing one or more residential clusters,
together with appropriate commercial, public and quasi-public uses,
intended primarily for the benefit of the residential development.

§ 163-164. Residential mid-rise planned unit developments (RMRPUD).
[Amended 6-15-1988 by Ord. No. 1-1988]
Industrial District. Approval of an industrial planned development for
a use requiring any special approval pursuant to the provisions of this
chapter shall not excuse the requirement of obtaining such approval.
D. Yards, screening and landscaping. The yard, screening and landscaping
requirements made applicable to industrial developments by the L-I
District regulations may be waived by the Planning Board in approving
an industrial planned development; provided, however, that no such
waiver shall be granted with respect to yards abutting the perimeter of
the industrial planned development tract.
E. Other standards. The standards set forth in this section are in addition
to all standards made applicable to the particular industrial planned
development being proposed by the provisions of this chapter, and no
application for approval of an industrial planned development shall be
approved unless all such other standards, including but not limited to
those relating to conditional uses, planned developments, site plan/
subdivision approval and the district in which the proposed
development will be located, have been met or, where permitted,
waived pursuant to the applicable provisions of this chapter. Except to
the extent expressly varied by the provisions of this chapter or any
approval granted pursuant to them, the standards applicable in the L-I
District shall govern industrial planned developments.
A. Purpose. The standards of this section are intended to serve as an
overlay district for the Riverside RM-1 District. The district is generally
bounded by Absecon Boulevard, Grammercy Avenue, Penrose Canal
and the Clam Thoroughfare. The purpose of providing the planned unit,
mid-rise residential development program outlined herein is to
maximize the ability of utilizing large tracts of land with waterfront and
highway orientation common to this district. The ability to provide
comprehensive development planning, incorporating the last remaining
resources of vacant parcels of land oriented to water and highway
conditions is an important ingredient in planned unit development.
Accordingly, the overlay district is presented to provide for the planned
development of such limited land resources.
B. Minimum tract size. No residential planned unit development of this
nature shall be approved for development on a tract containing less
than five acres.
C. Use standards. Except as provided in the following subsection, no use
shall be authorized by a residential planned unit development permit
except uses permitted as herein indicated:
(1) Residential development in the form of townhouses, multifamily
dwellings and mid-rise residential structures, not exceeding 100
feet in height.
§ 163-163 ATLANTIC CITY CODE § 163-164
1:960
§ 163-165. Commercial planned developments of piers. [Added
5-7-1981 by Ord. No. 32-1981]
(2) Commercial facilities shall be permitted which are supportive of
the residential facilities in the complex. These shall include but not
be limited to retail sales and service facilities to neighborhood
service centers.
(3) Marina facilities providing both dockage and first echelon services,
such as gas, supplies, etc., to service marina users and accessory
clubhouse facilities shall be permitted as part of an overall
residential mid-rise planned unit development (RMR-PUD).
D. Density standards. Density for the Residential Mid-Rise Planned Unit
Development District shall not exceed 26 units per gross acre. Given
the comprehensive planned unit development approach to the design
and development of such a district, the commercial and marina land
mass shall not be deducted from the total residential permitted density
since these are supportive facilities which will be designed to function
collectively.
E. Building heights. The following heights shall be applicable within the
Residential Mid-Rise Planned Unit Development Overlay District:
(1) Mid-rise residential structures: 100 feet.
(2) Low-rise residential structures: as applicable in the RM-1 Zone.
(3) Commercial structures: as applicable in the Neighborhood
Commercial District, but not to exceed 35 feet in height.
F. Urban design considerations. The implementation of planned unit
residential development requires that design considerations, dealing
with siting, layout, landscaping, incorporation of design features,
creation of water's edge conditions, energy conservation, be initiated to
make a substantial contribution to the overall appearance and aesthetic
quality of the facility. The ability to utilize mid-rise towers at critical
locations on the site, incorporating them in the overall lot and building
arrangement, requires that strong consideration be given to
landscaping, signage, building orientation, water's edge treatment,
traffic and circulation, etc.
G. Other standards. Standards applying to parking, landscaping, energy
conservation and other applicable urban design standards incorporated
in this chapter shall pertain herein.
A. Purpose. The standards of this section are intended to permit approval
of the commercial planned development of piers existing in the Beach
District and the upgrading of existing piers in the district as viable
environmental, commercial, cultural, recreational or traditional
boardwalk elements, which may be referred to herein as a "commercial
planned development pier."
§ 163-164 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 163-165
1:961
B. Other standards. The standards set forth in this section are in addition
to the standards set forth in Subsections A, B, C, E, F and G of § 163-158
of this chapter. The standards set forth in Subsections D and E of
§ 163-158 of this chapter shall not be applicable to commercial planned
developments of piers.
C. Minimum tract size. There shall be no minimum tract size for a
commercial planned development pier. The size of such a planned
development shall be determined by the property lines of the tract of
which the existing pier is a part.
D. Uses. The permitted and conditional uses on a commercial planned
development pier are indicated, according to major generic use
categories, on the schedule appearing in the schedule at the end of this
chapter.303 Permitted uses are indicated by the letter "P" and
conditional uses are indicated by the letter "C."
E. Space, bulk and yard requirements. [Amended 8-6-1997 by Ord. No.
45-1997]
(1) The maximum height of structures shall not exceed 100 feet above
the Boardwalk level, except that at a point commencing at the
midpoint of the pier, the maximum permitted height shall be 200
feet for unique entertainment and recreational features having as
the basic component thematic and amusement attributes subject to
approval by the Planning Board.
(2) No front setback from the Boardwalk is required up to a height of
35 feet. Above 35 feet, the "front yard setback" is defined as an
imaginary plane extending upward from the Oceanside edge of the
Boardwalk at an angle of 30% from the vertical plane. Up to a
height of 80 feet above the Boardwalk level, a minimum side
setback of 12 feet per side shall be provided. Above a height of 80
feet, an additional 18 feet per side shall be required. A rear setback
of at least 30 feet shall be provided at the oceanside edge of the
pier from pier level up to height of 80 feet. Above 80 feet, an
additional 20 feet shall be required.
(3) For purposes of the above, the following terms shall have the
meanings herein ascribed to them:
FRONT LOT LINE — The Boardwalk line separating the pier from
the Boardwalk.
REAR LOT LINE — The lot line which is parallel to and most distant
from the front lot line, as defined above, and representing the outer
edge of the building plate of the pier along the south edge.
SIDE LOT LINE — The line representing the outer edge of the
building plate of the pier along the east and west edges.
303. Editor's Note: See Schedule III, Schedule of Permitted and Conditional Uses.
§ 163-165 ATLANTIC CITY CODE § 163-165
1:962
(4) The floor area ratio shall be no greater than three.
(5) These requirements are not conditional use standards and thus,
any relief sought from their application will be subject to the
standards set forth in § 163-168B or § 163-168C, as applicable.
F. Accessory uses. Accessory uses are permitted on a commercial planned
development pier subject to the provisions of § 163-68 of this chapter.
G. Sales of alcoholic beverages. The sale of alcoholic beverages shall be
allowed on a commercial planned development pier in accordance with
appropriate state and local laws and regulations.
H. Loading and delivery. The applicant shall make adequate provisions for
loading and delivery. [Amended 6-15-1988 by Ord. No. 1-1988]
I. Parking.
(1) Patrons. No parking for patrons shall be required unless the
Planning Board finds that the uses included on the commercial
planned development pier generate substantial parking needs
beyond the rates customary for Boardwalk activities and the
parking tolerance of the Boardwalk area, in which case the
Planning Board shall prescribe the necessary parking
requirements.
(2) Employees. Parking for employees shall be provided at the rate
prescribed for employees in § 163-70A(3) of this chapter, unless the
Planning Board finds that the parking required for employees
should be reduced on the basis of mitigating circumstances.
(3) Location. Required patron parking, if any per Subsection I(1), and
employee parking shall be provided as per the provision set forth at
§ 163-70A(1)(c)[2]. [Amended 6-15-1988 by Ord. No. 1-1988;
8-6-1997 by Ord. No. 45-1997]
J. Signs. All signs shall be subject to the regulations applicable to the
Resort Commercial District. [Amended 6-15-1988 by Ord. No.
1-1988]
K. Development over a period of years. A commercial planned
development pier may be completed in phases or units.304
L. Heliports/helistops. Heliports and helistops shall only be built upon
commercial planned developments at a location which is at least 300
feet oceanward of the average low-tide line. For the purpose of this
section, the "average low-tide line" shall be defined as the mean low
tide line within 500 feet of both the east and west side of the pier

2-28-1990 by Ord. No. 1-1990]
M. Casino hotels. The following additional standards for casino hotels
apply; however, casinos and casino hotels are not permitted on Garden
Pier: [Added 8-6-1997 by Ord. No. 45-1997]
(1) The pier and the land-based casino hotel facility located in the
Boardwalk RSC District and abutting the Boardwalk shall be
physically connected.
(2) The connecting component, i.e., the structural element between
the pier and the casino hotel, is subject to the following limitations:
(a) Enclosed space above the Boardwalk.
(b) Above grade connectors will be designed only for pedestrian
movement with a maximum width of 20 feet and a maximum
height of 15 feet, not including structural load bearing
members. The connectors shall have a minimum height of 14
feet six inches above the Boardwalk. Only one above grade
connector over the Boardwalk per pier will be permitted.
(c) To the maximum extent possible, the connectors should be
constructed of transparent material and designed in such a
fashion to convey a feeling of spaciousness and openness.
Further, to the maximum extent possible, any signature or
architectural theme associated with the casino hotel or pier
should be incorporated into the design elements of the
connectors.
(3) In furtherance of the purpose in Subsection A, a casino room shall
not occupy more than 25% of the total floor area of the pier.
However, an additional 10% of the total floor area may be used for
casino room space if it is demonstrated, to the satisfaction of the
Planning Board, that a unique family entertainment theme is being
provided as a major component of the comprehensive pier
development. If the existing use of the pier includes youth-oriented
entertainment facilities, then the application for development of
the pier hereunder shall provide youth-oriented entertainment
facilities, either at a readily accessible on-site or at an appropriate
off-site location, which youth-oriented entertainment facilities shall
be completed within six months of the completion of the project
proposed to be developed on such pier. It is understood that the
applicant need not replicate the existing youth entertainment
facilities, but rather provide such facilities which may reflect
traditional and/or nontraditional technological advanced youthoriented
activities designed to further the purpose of this section. If
the casino room is at the Boardwalk level of the pier, then it shall
have a minimum setback of 25% of the pier's length from the
Boardwalk entrances to the pier.
§ 163-165 ATLANTIC CITY CODE § 163-165
1:964
(4) Hotel rooms shall be limited to 15% of the total floor area of the

casino space, the combined total of these two uses shall not exceed
50% of total floor area.
(5) Remaining square footage shall emphasize themed entertainment
and recreational uses.
(6) Pedestrian promenades having a minimum width of 12 feet shall be
provided along the exterior wall of the pier at each floor containing
public space. Although no specific length or pedestrian access
location are established by this section, those elements should be
designed in such a fashion as to encourage the public to partake in
this unique pedestrian experience and view perspective that only a
pier which is perpendicular to the Boardwalk and extending out
over the beach and ocean can offer.
(7) Building elevations should contain design elements combining
windows, entrances, setbacks or any combination of architectural
elements and lighting schemes designed to avoid a monolithical
architectural form. The Planning Board reserves the right to
undertake architectural review of all pier design elements.

ARTICLE XXVIII
Variances
§ 163-166. Authority.
The Board of Adjustment shall, subject to the procedures, standards and
limitations hereinafter set forth, have authority to review and grant or deny
variances from the strict application of this chapter; provided, however, that
the resolution of the Planning Board shall substitute for that of the Board
of Adjustment whenever the Planning Board has jurisdiction, pursuant to
§ 163-135 or 163-144H of this chapter, over a variance from the space, bulk
and yard requirements of this chapter or the requirements of § 163-46C and
D of this chapter in conjunction with its review of an application for site
plan/subdivision approval or conditional use approval.
§ 163-167. Purpose.
The variance procedure is intended to provide a narrowly circumscribed
means by which relief may be granted from unforeseen particular
applications of the provisions of this chapter, where such provisions create
peculiar and exceptional practical difficulties or exceptional and undue
hardships or where special reasons exist for varying the use and structure
restrictions of such provisions. Only where no other procedure exists to
remedy such difficulty or hardship or to respond to such special reasons is
an application for relief pursuant to this article appropriate.
§ 163-168. General regulations concerning the granting of
variances.
A. General prohibitions. As set forth in § 163-169 of this chapter, the
variance procedure of this article exists for the narrow purpose of
responding to hardships, difficulties and special reasons of a unique
nature which were unforeseen at the time of the adoption of this
chapter. In adopting this chapter, the City has provided not only
specific, preordained regulations but also, in Article XVIII, Part 5 and
Part 3 of this chapter, a variety of administrative procedures whereby
specific properties and uses may be given individual attention within
the confines of a well-structured overall plan of development
regulation. The variance procedure is essentially a procedure that
operates outside of that structured plan and is, by its very purpose and
definition, destructive of that plan. Therefore, the City Council hereby
finds as a fact and states as its policy that no relief pursuant to this
article can be validly granted in any case where relief pursuant to any
other Article of this Part 5 or any Article of Part 3 of this chapter is or
might be available. [Amended 6-15-1988 by Ord. No. 1-1988]
B. Nonuse variances.
(1) Subject to the general prohibition of Subsection A above and to the
other terms and provisions of this article, the Board of Adjustment
may grant a variance from the strict application of any provision of
§ 163-166 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 163-168
1:967
this chapter, other than the provisions hereof restricting the uses
to which land and structures may be devoted or the types of
structures which may be located in a district and other than the
provisions hereof restricting the erection of buildings and
structures in public areas mapped on the Official Map or on lots not
abutting a street, upon a showing that:
(a) By reason of exceptional narrowness, shallowness or shape of a
specific piece of property; or by reason of exceptional
topographic conditions or physical features uniquely affecting
the subject property; or by reason of an extraordinary and
exceptional situation uniquely affecting a specific piece of
property or the structures lawfully existing thereon, the strict
application of any regulation pursuant to this act would result
in peculiar and exceptional practical difficulties to or
exceptional and undue hardship upon the developer of such
property. [Amended 6-15-1988 by Ord. No. 1-1988]
(b) Granting the requested variance would not result in a
substantial detriment to the public good or a substantial
impairment of the goals and purposes of the Master Plan, the
Official Map, the capital improvements program and this
chapter.
(2) No variance shall be granted pursuant to this subsection which
would allow a structure or use in a district restricted against such
structure or use. Any variance which would permit, on any lot or
parcel, one or more dwelling units in addition to the number that
would be permitted by a strict application of the provisions of this
chapter shall be considered to be within the prohibition of this
subsection.
(3) No variance shall be granted pursuant to this subsection which
would permit the erection of a building or other structure within
the bed of a street or public drainageway, flood control basin or
public area shown on the Official Map of the City or which would
permit erection of a building on a lot which does not abut a street
giving access to such building or structure.
(4) No variance shall be granted by the Board of Adjustment pursuant
to this subsection where the proposed development for which such
variance is sought also requires site plan/subdivision approval or
conditional use approval by the Planning Board in conjunction with
which the Planning Board is required to review a request for a
variance pursuant to § 163-135 or 163-144H of this chapter. In such
cases, the application for variance shall be made and shall be
reviewed by the Planning Board pursuant to § 163-135 or 163-144H
of this chapter, whichever is applicable,
C. Use variances.
§ 163-168 ATLANTIC CITY CODE § 163-168
1:968
(1) Subject to the general prohibition of Subsection A above and to the
other terms and provisions of this article, the Board of Adjustment
may grant a variance to permit a use of a parcel of land or a
structure or the location of a structure in a zoning district
restricted against such use or structure upon a showing that:
(a) There are special reasons justifying the variance; and
(b) Granting the requested variance would not result in a
substantial detriment to the public good or a substantial
impairment of the goals and purposes of the Master Plan, the
Official Map, the capital improvements program or this
chapter.
(2) No variance shall be granted pursuant to this subsection except by
the affirmative vote of at least 2/3 of the full authorized
membership of the Board of Adjustment.
D. Official Map variances. Subject to the general prohibition of Subsection
A above and to the other terms and provisions of this article, the Board
of Adjustment may grant the following variances from the application of
§ 163-46B and C of this chapter upon the terms and conditions
hereinafter specified:
(1) Variance to permit erection of a building or other structure within
reserved public area. Whenever one or more parcels of land, upon
which is located the bed of a mapped street or public drainageway,
flood control basin or other public area reserved pursuant to
§ 163-46B of this chapter, cannot yield a reasonable return to the
owner unless a building permit is granted, the Board of Adjustment
may grant a variance from the application of said subsection and
direct the issuance of a permit for a building or structure in such
reserved area. Every such variance shall be limited so as to
increase the cost of opening such street or developing such
drainageway, flood control basin or other public area as little as
practicable and to cause the minimum possible change in the
Official Map.
(2) Variance to permit erection of a building or other structure which
does not abut a street. Where the enforcement of § 163-46C of this
chapter, requiring that no building permit be issued for any
building or structure not abutting a street, would entail practical
difficulty or unnecessary hardship or where circumstances do not
require the proposed building or structure to be related to a street,
the Board of Adjustment may grant a variance from the application
of said subsection and direct the issuance of a building permit for
the proposed building or structure. Every such variance shall be so
conditioned as to assure that adequate access to such building or
structure will be provided for fire-fighting equipment, ambulances
and other emergency vehicles necessary for the protection of
health and safety and so as to protect any future street layout

law or appeal such decision pursuant to Part 5, Article XXXI, of this
chapter or abandon the application.
G. Ancillary powers of the Board of Adjustment; simultaneous review and
approval of applications.
(1) Site plan/subdivision approval and conditional use approval. When
reviewing applications for a use variance pursuant to § 163-168C of
this chapter, the Board of Adjustment shall have the power to grant,
to the same extent and subject to the same provisions, conditions
and limitations as applicable to the Planning Board and subject to
referral to and recommendation by the Planning Board pursuant to
Subsections B, C and D of this section, the following:
(a) Site plan/subdivision approval pursuant to Part 5, Articles XIX
through XXV, of this chapter.
(b) Except as limited by § 163-153 of this chapter, conditional use
approval pursuant to Part 5, Article XXVI, of this chapter.
(2) Applications for additional approvals. Whenever, in addition to
approval of an application for a use variance pursuant to this
article, the applicant will, in connection with the proposed
development, require any of the approvals authorized by
Subsection G(1) of this section, the applicant shall, prior to filing an
application pursuant to this article, request a prehearing
conference with the Board of Adjustment pursuant to Part 5, Article
XX, or § 163-144 of this chapter, as the case may be, and shall, at
the time of filing an application for a use variance, file applications
for all other required approvals.
(3) Notice of applications for additional approvals. Whenever, in
connection with an application for a use variance pursuant to this
article, the applicant files an application for other approvals
pursuant to this section, all required notices shall include reference
to the request for any and all additional approvals.
(4) Procedures and action by Board of Adjustment. Whenever, in
conjunction with an application for a use variance, an applicant
files applications for other approvals pursuant to this subsection,
the Board of Adjustment shall review and process all such
applications at the same public hearing. In reviewing such
combined applications, the Board of Adjustment shall, except as
hereinafter provided with respect to limitations on the time for
taking action, comply with all of the provisions of this chapter
§ 163-170 ATLANTIC CITY CODE § 163-170
1:974
§ 163-171. Restrictions and conditions on variance approval.
§ 163-172. (Reserved)306
applicable to each of the applications included in the combined
application. Where, pursuant to the ancillary jurisdiction granted
by this subsection, the Board of Adjustment is reviewing an
application subject to the primary jurisdiction of the Planning
Board, all provisions of this chapter applicable to the Planning
Board in reviewing such an application shall be deemed to refer to
and to apply to the Board of Adjustment. The Board of Adjustment
shall act on any such combined application within 120 days after
submission of a complete application or within such further time
as may be consented to by the applicant. Failure of the Board
of Adjustment to act within such period of time shall constitute
approval of the application. The Land Use Administrator shall issue
notices and certificates of such action or failure to act in
accordance with the provisions of this chapter applicable to the
various applications involved.
A. The Board of Adjustment may, in approving the grant of any variance,
impose such restrictions and conditions upon such approval, the
proposed use and the premises to be developed or used pursuant to
such approval as may be necessary to ensure the compatibility of the
proposed use and development with surrounding development; to
ensure the compliance and consistency of the proposed use and
development with the standards of this chapter and the general
purposes, goals and objectives of this chapter, the Master Plan, the
capital improvements program and the Official Map; and to prevent or
minimize adverse effects from the proposed use and development upon
other properties in the neighborhood and upon the general health,
safety and welfare of the entire City to the end that no variance granted
pursuant to this article shall result in a substantial detriment to the
public good or a substantial impairment of the land use plans and
policies of the City.
B. Every variance granted shall be conditioned upon the developer's
continuing compliance with all applicable laws, ordinances and
regulations and all conditions imposed upon such approval.
C. All conditions imposed upon any variance, except to the extent made
applicable to all variances by the express terms of this chapter, shall be
expressly set forth in the resolution granting such variance. The
violation of any condition upon any such variance shall be a violation of
this chapter and grounds for revocation of such variance pursuant to
§ 163-175 below.
D. A variance less than or different from that requested may be granted
when the record supports the applicant's right to some relief but not to
the relief requested.
§ 163-170 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 163-173
1:975
§ 163-173. Effect of variance approval.
The grant of variance shall not authorize the establishment or extension
of any use nor the development, construction, reconstruction, alteration
or moving of any building or structure, but shall merely authorize the
preparation, filing and processing of applications for any permits and
approvals which may be required by the codes and ordinances of the City
and other governmental agencies having jurisdiction, including but not
limited to a certificate of land use compliance, a building permit and a
certificate of occupancy.
§ 163-174. Limitations. [Amended 6-15-1988 by Ord. No. 1-1988]
No variance granted pursuant to this chapter shall be valid for a period
longer than one year from the date of issue, unless a building permit
is issued and construction is actually begun within that period and is
thereafter diligently pursued to completion or an occupancy permit is
obtained and a use commenced within that period.
§ 163-175. Revocation.
In addition to the other penalties and remedies for violations of this chapter,
it shall be a condition of every variance granted pursuant to this article that
such variance may be revoked for violation of any condition imposed upon
such variance either by the provisions of this chapter or by the provisions
of the resolution granting such variance; provided, however, that no such
variance shall be revoked except by resolution of the Board of Adjustment,
in the form specified by § 163-33 of this chapter, adopted following a public
hearing, noticed and conducted by the Board of Adjustment in the same
manner as provided for the original granting of the variance, whereat the
existence of such violation is established.

ARTICLE XXIX
Interpretations
§ 163-176. Authority. [Amended 6-15-1988 by Ord. No. 1-1988]
The Board of Adjustment may, subject to the procedures, standards and
limitations set forth in this article, render interpretations of any provision
of this chapter or any rule or regulation issued pursuant to it, including
interpretations of the various district permitted use lists to permit uses not
expressly mentioned in this chapter to be located in a particular district.
§ 163-177. Purpose.
The provisions of this article are intended, first, to provide a simple and
expeditious method for clarifying ambiguities in the text of this chapter, the
Zoning Map which it incorporates and the rules and regulations adopted
pursuant to it and, second, to provide a simple, yet circumscribed,
procedure for overcoming the inadvertent rigidities and limitations inherent
in the promulgation of finite use lists in a world characterized by infinite
permutations of essentially similar uses.
§ 163-178. Procedure for requesting interpretation.
A. Written request for nonuse interpretation. Except as provided in
Subsection B below, a request for interpretation of any provision of this
chapter, the Zoning Map or any rule or regulation adopted pursuant to
this chapter shall be submitted, in writing, to the Land Use
Administrator in such number of duplicate copies as he may from time
to time require. No fee shall be required in connection with any such
request. Each such request shall set forth the specific provision or
provisions to be interpreted, the facts of the specific situation giving
rise to the request for an interpretation and the precise interpretation
claimed by the applicant to be correct. Before the rendering of any
interpretation, the Board of Adjustment may require such further facts
and information as are necessary to a meaningful interpretation of the
provision in question. [Amended 6-15-1988 by Ord. No. 1-1988]
B. Application for use interpretation. Applications for a use interpretation
shall be submitted to the Land Use Administrator in such number of
duplicate copies as he may from time to time require. A nonrefundable
application fee, as established by Part 1, Article III, of this chapter, to
help defray administrative costs shall accompany each application. The
application shall be in such form and contain such information as shall
be prescribed from time to time by the Land Use Administrator, but
shall in all instances contain at least the following information and
documentation:
(1) The applicant's name and address and his interest in the subject
property.
§ 163-176 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 163-178
1:977
(2) The owner's name and address, if different than the applicant, and
the owner's signed consent to the filing of the application.
(3) The names and addresses of all professional consultants advising
the applicant with respect to the interpretation.
(4) The street address and legal description of the subject property.
(5) The names and addresses of all owners of property located within
200 feet of the subject property as shown on the most recent
property tax records.
(6) The zoning classification and present use of the subject property.
(7) A complete description of the proposed use.
(8) The uses permitted in the present zoning classification which are
most similar to the proposed use.
(9) Documents, statements and other evidence demonstrating that the
proposed use will comply with all use limitations established for the
district in which it is proposed to be located.
(10) Such other and further information or documentation as the Land
Use Administrator may deem to be necessary or appropriate to a
full and proper consideration and disposition of the particular
application.
C. Action by the Board of Adjustment. [Amended 6-15-1988 by Ord. No.
1-1988]
(1) Within 120 days following the filing of a complete application for
interpretation, the Board of Adjustment shall render its decision, in
the manner and form specified by § 163-33 of this chapter. The
Board of Adjustment shall state the specific precedent and the
reasons and analysis upon which such interpretation is based.
(2) The failure of the Board of Adjustment to act within 120 days or
such longer period of time as may be agreed to by the applicant
shall be deemed to be a rejection of the applicant's proposed
interpretation.
(3) Within 10 days following such a decision or the expiration of such a
period without any decision, the Land Use Administrator shall
publish notice and mail a certificate of such decision or failure to
act to all parties entitled thereto as provided by § 163-200 of this
chapter.307

§ 163-179. Conditions governing issuance of use interpretations.
[Amended 6-15-1988 by Ord. No. 1-1988]
The following conditions shall govern the Board of Adjustment in issuing the
interpretations:
§ 163-180. Effect of favorable use interpretation.
No use interpretation finding a particular use to be permitted or
conditionally permitted in a specific district shall authorize the
establishment of such use nor the development, construction,
reconstruction, alteration or moving of any building or structure, but shall
merely authorize the preparation, filing and processing of applications for
any permits and approvals which may be required by the codes and
ordinances of the City or other governmental agencies having jurisdiction,
including but not limited to a conditional use permit, site plan/subdivision
approval, a certificate of land use compliance, a building permit and a
certificate of occupancy.
§ 163-181. Limitations.
A. No use interpretation shall allow the establishment of any use which
was previously considered and rejected by the Planning Board or by the
Board of Adjustment on an application for amendment or on an
application for a use variance.
B. No use interpretation shall permit a use listed as a prohibited use in any
district to be established in any such district or any more restrictive
district.
C. No use interpretation shall permit a use listed as a permitted or
conditional use in any district to be established in any district in which
such use is not so listed.
D. No use interpretation shall permit any use in any district unless
evidence shall be presented which demonstrates that it will comply with
each use limitation established for the particular district.
E. No use interpretation shall permit any use in a particular district unless
such use is substantially similar to other uses permitted in such district
and is more similar to such other uses than to uses permitted or
conditionally permitted in a less restrictive district.
F. If the proposed use is most similar to a use permitted only as a
conditional use in the district in which it is proposed to be located, then
any use interpretation permitting such use shall be conditioned on the
issuance of a permit for a conditional use permit pursuant to Part 5,
Article XXVI, of this chapter.
A. No use interpretation finding a particular use to be permitted or
conditionally permitted in a specified district shall be valid for a period
longer than one year from the date of issue, unless a building permit is

1:979
§ 163-182. Maintenance of records; annual report. [Amended
6-15-1988 by Ord. No. 1-1988]
The Land Use Administrator shall keep a record of each use interpretation
rendered and shall include a report of all such interpretations in his annual
report. The report shall include a recommendation of the Land Use
Administrator that this chapter be amended to add new uses to the various
use lists established by this chapter to reflect each use interpretation given
pursuant to this article.308
§ 163-183. Failure to amend regulations.
In any case where, upon the expiration of one year following the receipt of
the recommendations of the Land Use Administrator pursuant to § 163-182
above, the City Council shall have failed to adopt an ordinance amendment
with respect to any use interpretation included in such recommendation:
issued and construction actually begun within that period and is
thereafter diligently pursued to completion or an occupancy permit is
obtained and a use commenced within that period.
B. A use interpretation finding a particular use to be permitted or
conditionally permitted in a specified district shall be deemed to
authorize only the particular use at the particular location for which it
was issued, and such permit shall not be deemed to authorize any
allegedly similar use for which a separate use interpretation has not
been issued. [Amended 6-15-1988 by Ord. No. 1-1988]
A. Any use authorized pursuant to such interpretation, but not yet
established or under construction, shall not be established.
B. Any use authorized and established pursuant to such interpretation
shall be allowed to continue but shall be subject to the provisions of
Part 7 of this chapter.
C. No similar use interpretation shall be given in the future.

the record upon which the action appealed from was taken.
B. Stay of proceeding. An appeal to the Board of Adjustment shall stay all

appealed order, decision, requirement or refusal was made, unless the
Land Use Administrator or the Building Inspector, as the case may be,
certifies to the Board of Adjustment, after the notice of appeal shall
have been filed, that, by reason of facts stated in the certificate, a stay
would, in his opinion, cause imminent peril to life or property. In such

a variance, but only in strict compliance with each provision of said Article.
§ 163-188. Effect of conditions and limitations on appeals granted.

conditions and limitations upon any right, any such right granted by the

of Adjustment shall render its decision on the appeal in the manner
and form specified in § 163-33 of this chapter. Such decision may

order, decision, requirement or refusal.
(2) The failure of the Board of Adjustment to render a decision within
the aforesaid 120 days or such longer period of time as may be
agreed to by the applicant shall constitute a decision favorable to
the applicant. Within 10 days following such decision or the
expiration of such period without a decision, the Land Use
Administrator shall publish notice and mail a certificate of such
decision or failure to act to all parties entitled thereto as provided
in § 163-200 of this chapter.

defective plans.

Nonconformities
ARTICLE XXXVIII
General Provisions
[Amended 6-15-1988 by Ord. No. 1-1988]
§ 163-223. Applicability.
The provisions of this article shall apply to nonconformities in the manner
set forth in § 163-224 hereof.
§ 163-224. Nonconforming buildings and uses.
The following provisions shall apply to all buildings and uses existing on the
effective date of this article, which buildings and uses do not conform to the
requirements set forth in this chapter; to all buildings and uses that became
nonconforming by reason of any subsequent amendment to this chapter and
the Zoning Map which is a part thereof; and to all conforming uses:
A. Except as provided in Subsection E hereinafter, any type of
nonconforming use of buildings or open land may be continued
indefinitely, but:
(1) Shall not be enlarged, extended or placed on a different portion of
the lot or parcel of land occupied by such use on the effective date
of this article or of any applicable amendment thereof, nor shall any
external evidence of such use be increased by any means
whatsoever; except whereby through such alteration it is changed
to a conforming use.
(2) Shall not be changed to another nonconforming use without a
special permit from the Board of Adjustment.
(3) Shall not be reestablished after the physical operation thereof has
ceased and discontinued, based upon a finding by the Land Use
Administrator of intentional abandonment.
B. Except as provided in Subsection D hereinafter, no building which
houses a nonconforming use shall be:
(1) Structurally altered or enlarged; or
(2) Moved to another location where such use continues to be
nonconforming.
C. Any building which houses a nonconforming use and which is damaged,
from any cause, may be repaired or restored but not enlarged, and the
nonconforming use reinstated within 12 months of such damage; if the
restoration of such building is not completed within said twelve-month
period, the physical operation of the nonconforming use of such
building shall be deemed to have ceased, unless such nonconforming
§ 163-223 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 163-224
1:1009
use shall have been carried on without interruption in the undamaged
portion of such building. Should a nonconforming structure or
nonconforming portion of a structure be destroyed by any means to
an extent of more than 80% of its replacement cost at the time of
destruction, it shall not be reconstructed except in conformity with the
provisions of this chapter.
D. Any building housing a conforming use but which does not conform to
other than use regulations as set forth in this chapter may be rebuilt, if
damaged or partially destroyed, but shall not be altered or enlarged so
as to increase the degree of nonconformity thereof.
E. Where nonconforming use status applies to a structure and premises in
combination, removal or destruction of the structure shall eliminate the
nonconforming status of the land. "Destruction" for the purpose of this
subsection is defined as damage to an extent of more than 80% of the
replacement cost at the time of destruction.
F. Nothing in this article shall be deemed to prevent normal maintenance
and repair of any building, or the carrying out, upon issuance of a
building permit, of major structural alterations or demotions necessary
in the interest of public safety. In granting such a permit the
Superintendent of Buildings shall state the precise reason(s) to the
Board of Adjustment why such alterations were deemed necessary.
G. Nonconforming lots of record. In any district in which single-family
dwellings are permitted, a single-family dwelling and customary
accessory buildings may be erected on any single lot of record at the
effective date of adoption or amendment of this article, notwithstanding
limitations imposed by other provisions of this chapter. Such lots must
be in separate ownership and not of contiguous frontage with other lots
in the same ownership. This provision shall apply even though such lot
fails to meet the requirements for area or width, or both, that are
generally applicable in the district, provided that yard dimensions and
requirements other than these applying to area and width shall conform
to the regulations for the district in which such lot is located. Variance
of yard requirements shall be obtained only through action of the Board
of Adjustment. If two or more lots or combinations of lots and portions
of lots with continuous frontage in single ownership are of record at the
time of passage or amendment of this article and if all or part of the lots
do not meet the requirements established for lot width and area, the
lands involved shall be considered to be an undivided parcel for the
purposes of this chapter, and no portion of said parcel shall be used or
sold in a manner which diminishes compliance with lot width and area
requirements established by this chapter, nor shall any division of any
parcel be made which creates a lot with width of area below the
requirements stated in this chapter.

§ 163-225. Deconversion of illegal nonconforming residential uses.
[Added 9-14-1994 by Ord. No. 64-1994; amended 11-25-2008 by
Ord. No. 104-2008]
The following provisions shall apply to the practices and procedures for
the identification of illegal nonconforming residential uses and the
deconversion of such uses:
A. No residential building shall be sold, transferred, altered, renovated or
reconstructed without a certificate of land use compliance. While this
provision is in no way intended to limit the uses of a certificate of land
use compliance, as more fully set forth in this Municipal Land Use
Ordinance of the City of Atlantic City, the purpose of this requirement is
to ensure compliance with the Land Use Code as it currently exists.
B. Any City employee vested with the responsibility of making inspections,
whether they be building inspections, construction inspections,
mercantile inspections, land use inspections or any other type of
inspection, is required to report, in writing, any activity or situation
which in his or her judgment may be in violation of the Zoning
Ordinance.321 The Land Use Administrator shall notify all employees
subject to this section.
C. Any designated representative of the City who makes an inspection in
order to issue a certificate of land use compliance shall determine the
appropriate zone where the property is located and shall refuse to issue
any report or document, or cause to be issued a certificate of land use
compliance, if the property use(s) does not conform with the zoning
designation of the particular district. Any nonconforming use shall be
referred to the Land Use Administrator or his designated
representative, whereupon one of the following determinations shall be
made:
(1) In those cases where City records support lawful preexistence of
the current nonconforming use a letter will be sent to the property
owner advising him or her of the necessity of obtaining a certificate
of nonconformity from the Zoning Board of Adjustment.
(2) In those cases where City records do not support the existence of
the current nonconforming use a letter will be sent by certified mail
to the property owner advising him or her to take one of the
following three steps:
(a) File for a certificate of nonconformity with the Zoning Board of
Adjustment.
(b) File for a zoning variance with the Zoning Board of
Adjustment.
(c) Deconvert the nonconforming dwelling unit(s).
321. Editor's Note: See Part 4, Zoning.
§ 163-225 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 163-225
1:1011
D. Any individual and/or entity who receives written notice from the Land
Use Administrator and does not file an appropriate application with the
Zoning Board of Adjustment as per Subsection C(2)(a) or (b) within 30
days of receipt of that letter must commence the deconversion of the
nonconforming dwelling unit(s).
E. Deconversion process.
(1) The following rules shall apply to the process of deconversion:
(a) The Land Use Administrator shall forward a letter advising the
property owner that the nonconforming use(s) must be
deconverted. The letter will specifically state that the kitchen
in any illegal unit shall be completely removed and the original
room configuration must be returned. All dead bolts on all
interior entry doors must be removed, holes filled in and doors
painted or finished. All separate doorbells, mailboxes,
doorknockers and separate utility meters must be removed.
(b) Said letter shall provide that the deconversion shall be
completed within 90 days.
(c) At the termination of the ninety-day period the Land Use
Administrator shall cause to be made an inspection of the
property.
(2) If the steps of deconversion are not followed precisely, then a
summons shall be issued along with a certified letter advising the
property owner that a penalty of $2,000 per violation will be sought
by the City in Municipal Court in the event that the owner is found
guilty.
(3) If the deconversion is successfully completed, the Land Use
Administrator shall note that fact in a ledger to be maintained by
him/her and shall diary a follow-up inspection one year from the
date of the conversion. The Land Use Administrator shall also issue
a form letter to all utilities advising said utilities of:
(a) The legal use of the building.
(b) The actions taken by the City to deconvert the building to its
proper use.
(c) That any action to return the building to an illegal use should
be reported to the Land Use Administrator.
(4) If multiple units in excess of three are to be deconverted, the Land
Use Administrator may extend for an additional 60 days the period
of time to deconvert.

commercial handbill permits and three off-Boardwalk commercial
handbill permits, regardless of the number of mercantile licenses
an applicant may hold. The applicant shall designate a maximum of
10 individuals authorized to hand out or distribute commercial
handbills in the City. Said individuals must register their names and
addresses with the mercantile licensing bureau, which bureau will
issue identification badges to said individuals. The individual
identification badge will indicate the name of the applicant
(licensee) designating the individual. Said individual must wear his
or her identification badge and the applicant's permit badge at all
times when commercial handbills are being distributed upon the
Boardwalk or off the Boardwalk. [Amended 11-29-2006 by Ord.

Boardwalk may only do so at street ends within the area
bounded by the curblines of said streets as if extended onto the
Boardwalk. No contact with pedestrians may be initiated by a
permittee outside of the area so designated. However, where
an applicant is either the owner in fee or the lessee in
possession of property having unobstructed Boardwalk level
frontage from street end to street end, all three of that
applicant's permittees may distribute commercial handbills
within that area bounded by the street ends. For purposes of
this exception, only those street ends having an adjacent
address divisible equally by 100 qualifies for this exception.
(c) No more than four permittees, including no more than two
permittees of any one license holder, may operate in any street
end at any one time. The police and/or mercantile inspectors
are authorized to issue summonses to all permittees at any one
location found in violation of either provision of this
subsection.
(d) A permit holder may accompany an individual and/or
individuals to his/her place of business only with permission of
the individual and following an initial contact pursuant to
Subsection C(2)(a) and (b) herein.
(3) For purposes of this chapter, an "applicant" or a "licensee" includes
all corporations, partnerships, proprietorships, individuals or any
other form of enterprise advertising or otherwise commercially
publicizing any establishment, premises, location or business,
regardless of the number of different corporations, partnerships,
proprietorships, individuals or other forms of enterprises related to
or having any interest in the establishment, premises, location or
business. The test is product (i.e., handbill) specific.
(4) It shall be unlawful for any person to stand or walk or cause or
permit any person to stand or walk on the Boardwalk, on a sidewalk
or street or in the entrance of any store or building for the purpose
of calling attention of passersby to business or commercial activity
or solicit for any such business or commercial activity or attempt by
the use of mechanical or sound making devices to entice or
persuade passersby to enter any location where a business or
commercial enterprise is being conducted.

MARINE OFF-LOADING FACILITIES
GENERAL REFERENCES
Beaches, Boardwalk and oceanfront — See
Ch. 92.
Boats — See Ch. 99.
Noise — See Ch. 186.
§ 178-1. Findings and purpose.
The City Council finds that regulation of the hours of operation of marine
off-loading facilities is necessary for the following reasons: because marine
commercial off-loading facilities are now operating in close proximity to
residential areas of the City and constitute a nuisance to residents; because
various neighborhoods in the City are being redeveloped, and residential
use of areas near marine facilities is increasing and would cause a greater
nuisance to residents if unregulated; and because the safety of nearby
residents and workers in this industry would be increased if the hours of
these facilities are limited to the times set forth herein.
§ 178-2. Definitions.
As used in this chapter, the following terms shall have the meanings
indicated:
COVERED AREA(S) — Areas of the City known as "Delta Basin" and
"Gardners Basin."
MARINE OFF-LOADING FACILITY — A commercial facility involved in
marine related businesses, including but not limited to repair of boats,
clamming, fishing and other enterprises dealing with fruits of the sea.
§ 178-3. Hours of operation.
The daily hours of operation of marine off-loading facilities in covered areas
shall be 6:00 a.m. to 11:00 p.m. In the event that a small craft warning
or a higher state of maritime alert is issued by the National Weather
Service for maritime areas utilized by commercial craft operating out of
marine facilities located in the City, and actual weather conditions which
precipitate such warnings are such that commercial craft are delayed in
docking or are unable to complete off-loading activities by 11:00 p.m.,
the hours of operation for commercial craft which are so affected may be
extended for two hours until 1:00 a.m., for the date in question.

§ 184-2D hereof. During such ten-day period, the distributor shall have
the right to a hearing before the City Engineer or his duly designated
representative to determine whether such violation has occurred and
333. Editor's Note: This ordinance also provided that within 21 days of the passage of this
ordinance, all distributors of newsracks shall be in compliance with this ordinance;

334. Editor's Note: This ordinance also provided that within 21 days of the passage of this
ordinance, all distributors of newsracks shall be in compliance with this ordinance;
thereafter, the appropriate penalties or actions by the City shall apply.
§ 184-3 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 184-5
1:1077
whether the nature of such claimed violation warrants removal prior
to final determination. At such hearing, the distributor shall have the
right to examine the evidence upon which the City Solicitor's office
acted, to cross-examine any witness who may have appeared before
it and to offer any evidence which may tend to show that the subject
newsrack does not violate any provisions of this chapter and that the
claimed violation is not of a nature which warrants removal prior to
final determination. The Hearing Officer shall promptly review such
evidence, notify the distributor of its decision with respect thereto and
afford the distributor a reasonable opportunity to comply with such
determination.
B. If said violation is not corrected within such ten-day period or such
further reasonable period as is contained in the superseding notice by
the City Engineer, the Director of Public Works shall be notified and
requested by the City Engineer to remove such newsrack and place it in
storage in a secure place. The cost of the removal and storage shall be
billed to the distributor, and, in the event of nonpayment, a civil suit for
money damages may be brought by the City Solicitor's office.
C. If such newsrack is not claimed within 60 days of the date of the

D. In the event that a distributor desires to abandon a newsrack, he shall
completely remove the newsrack and mount and restore the public
right-of-way to a safe and sightly condition, leaving no hole or
projection in the pavement. If a newsrack has no publication in it for a
period of seven consecutive days, the distributor shall be notified to
properly remove the same and if he does not do so within 10 days after
such notification, the City shall do so and charge the costs thereof to
said distributor.
E. Any distributor or other person aggrieved by a finding, determination,
notice or action taken under the provisions of this chapter may appeal
and shall be apprised of his right to appeal to a Board which shall
consist of the Business Administrator, the Director of Public Works and
the City Engineer or their duly designated representatives. An appeal
shall be made in writing and must be within 10 days after receipt of
written notice of any protested decision or action by filing with the
office of the City Solicitor a letter of appeal briefly stating therein the
basis for such appeal. A hearing thereon shall be scheduled to be held
on a date no more than 10 days after receipt of such letter. The
appellant shall be given at least five days' notice of the time and place of
the hearing. The Board shall give the appellant or any other interested
person a reasonable opportunity to be heard in order to show cause
why the determination or action appealed from should not be upheld.
The burden of proof shall be upon the appellant to show that such
determination or action was not supported by substantial evidence. The
Board shall make a final determination at the conclusion of the hearing
or as soon thereafter as is practicable. In the event that a distributor is
successful in reversing a determination that the claimed violation was

§ 184-6. Construal of provisions.
This chapter, while regulating newsracks in public rights-of-way, is not to be
construed as a sanction of them. The First Amendment to the Constitution
of the United States has been interpreted by the courts as prohibiting the
banning of newsracks. Therefore, nothing contained in this chapter shall be
construed as the City's acquiescence in, liability for or assuming the risks of
the placement of newsracks in the City, whether they are in conformity with
the provisions of this chapter or not.

device or element of design incorporated in any motor vehicle for the
purpose of noise control. No person shall operate a motor vehicle or
motorcycle which has been so modified. A vehicle not meeting these
requirements shall be deemed in violation of this provision if it is
operated stationary or in motion in any public space or public right-ofway.
B. No motorcycle shall be operated stationary or in motion unless it has a
muffler that complies with and is labeled in accordance with the federal
noise regulations under 40 CFR Part 205.
C. Personal or commercial vehicular music amplification or reproduction
equipment shall not be operated in such a manner that it is plainly

a civil penalty for each offense of not more than $3,000. If the violation
is of a continuing nature, each day during which it occurs shall

C. Upon identification of a violation of this chapter, the Noise Control
Officer or Noise Control Investigator shall issue an enforcement
document to the violator. The enforcement document shall identify the
condition or activity that constitutes the violation and the specific
provision of this chapter that has been violated. It shall also indicate
whether the violator has a period of time to correct the violation before
a penalty is sought.
D. If the violation is deemed by the Noise Control Officer or Noise Control
Investigator to be a minor violation (as defined in § 186-1 of this
chapter), a NOV shall be issued to the violator.
(1) The document shall indicate that the purpose of the NOV is
intended to serve as a notice to warn the responsible party/violator
of the violation conditions in order to provide him or her with an
opportunity to voluntarily investigate the matter and voluntarily
take corrective action to address the identified violation.
§ 186-9 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 186-10
1:1089
§ 186-11. Severability; repealer; effect on other laws.
(2) The NOV shall identify the time period (up to 90 days), pursuant to
the Grace Period Law, N.J.S.A. 13:1D-125 et seq., where the
responsible party's/violator's voluntary action can prevent a formal
enforcement action with penalties issued by the Health
Department. It shall be noted that the NOV does not constitute a
formal enforcement action, a final agency action or a final legal
determination that a violation has occurred. Therefore, the NOV
may not be appealed or contested.
E. If the violation is deemed by the Noise Control Officer or Noise Control
Investigator to be a nonminor violation, the violator shall be notified
that if the violation is not immediately corrected, a NOPA with a civil
penalty of no more than $3,000 will be issued. If a nonminor violation is
immediately corrected, a NOV without a civil penalty shall still be
issued to document the violation. If the violation occurs again (within
12 months of the initial violation), a NOPA shall be issued regardless of
whether the violation is immediately corrected or not.
F. The violator may request from the Noise Control Officer or Noise
Control Investigator an extension of the compliance deadline in the
enforcement action. The Noise Control Officer or Noise Control
Investigator shall have the option to approve any reasonable request for
an extension (not to exceed 180 days) if the violator can demonstrate
that a good faith effort has been made to achieve compliance. If an
extension is not granted and the violation continues to exist after the
grace period ends, a NOPA shall be issued.
G. The recipient of a NOPA shall be entitled to a hearing in a municipal
court having jurisdiction to contest such action.
H. The Noise Control Officer or Noise Control Investigator may seek
injunctive relief if the responsible party does not remediate the
violation within the period of time specified in the NOPA issued.
I. Any claim for a civil penalty may be compromised and settled based on
the following factors:
(1) Mitigating or any other extenuating circumstances;
(2) The timely implementation by the violator of measures which lead
to compliance;
(3) The conduct of the violator; and
(4) The compliance history of the violator.
A. If any provision or portion of a provision of this chapter is held to be
unconstitutional, preempted by federal or state law or otherwise invalid
by any court of competent jurisdiction, the remaining provisions of this
chapter shall not be invalidated.

received five qualifying calls within a sixty-day period, the public officer
shall notify the property owner and tenant/occupant, in the same
manner as provided in Subsection B and C above, of the fact so that the
property owner can take appropriate action to abate the nuisance. This
notification shall be made even though the multifamily dwelling has not
received the required number of qualifying calls within a sixty-day
period which would trigger a notice of violation.
E. The public officer may also, but is not required to, notify the owner,
tenant or occupant of any property at any time that the number of
qualifying calls to that property is in excess of 50% of the number
specified in the schedule in § 190-9.

shall determine at the hearing whether the subject property received
qualifying calls during the subject sixty-day period in excess of that as
indicated in § 190-9 for the type of property being considered. If so, the
hearing officer shall confirm that the property was on probationary
nuisance status from the date of the complaint. If the Director of
Licensing and Inspections also finds that there were qualifying calls
made to the subject property during the time that the property was on
probationary nuisance status, the Director shall so state in his findings
and enter an order against the property owner or, if a requisite number
of qualifying calls involve the same tenant or occupant on the property,
against the owner and each involved tenant/occupant, as follows:
(1) The Director shall determine the time that the subject property was
on probationary nuisance status;
(2) The Director shall determine the number of qualifying calls made to
the subject property during that probationary nuisance status
period; and
(3) The Director shall assess a reasonable cost for the litigation against
the property owner to include an administrative fee of $100. He/
she shall also assess a user fee of $300 for each qualifying call
made to the property during the sixty-day period in excess or the
qualifying amount shown on the schedule in § 190-9 herein, which
user fee shall be entirely assessed against the property owner
unless a requisite number of qualifying calls involve the same
tenant or occupant on the property, in which case the user fee shall
be divided and assessed, in equal parts, against the owner and each
involved tenant/occupant.
(4) The order shall also indicate that each qualifying call made to the
property subsequent to the date of the hearing but within 12
months from the date of the complaint shall be a further violation of
this article and the property owner and tenant/occupant, if
applicable under the conditions of Subsection B(3) above, shall be
liable for a user fee of $300 for each such violation. In the case of a
casino hotel property, the order shall indicate that each qualifying
call made to the property subsequent to the date of the hearing but
within 12 months from the date of the complaint, that is greater
than a reasonable baseline number as determined by the Director,
shall be a further violation of this article and shall be liable for a
user fee of $300 for each such violation. A summons and complaint
for a proceeding in the Atlantic City Municipal Court shall be issued
in connection with each such subsequent qualifying call, each
being a separate violation. The penalty to be imposed upon a
finding or plea of guilty to each such violation shall be the required
payment of the user fee of $300 by the appropriate party(ies).

money owed to the municipality by any owner of property against which
costs, fee or penalties was assessed in accordance with the provisions of
this article, the total cost established is hereby assessed as a lien against
the subject property. The assessment shall be collected and the lien may
be enforced in the same manner as real estate tax amounts and liens are
assessed, collected and enforced. Such enforcement of unpaid moneys due
under this article shall include the right by the municipality to revoke,
suspend or not issue or renew municipal licenses or permits related to the
subject property in accordance with N.J.S.A. 40:52-1.2.
§ 190-13. Remedies aggrieved persons.

and Inspections under this article may file an appeal with the New Jersey
Superior Court, Law Division, within 45 days from the date of the adoption
of the resolution in accordance with Rule 4:69 of the New Jersey Rules of
Court.

applicable, tenant and occupant, personally or by regular and
certified mail, return receipt requested, by mailing the order to
their last known address.

the power of the municipality to define and declare nuisances and to
cause their removal or abatement, by summary proceedings or
otherwise, nor is anything in this section intended to limit the authority
of the enforcing agency or construction official under the State Uniform

Abandoned Property
[Adopted 12-23-2015 by Ord. No. 92-2015]
§ 207-6. Statutory authority.
§ 207-7. Findings and purpose.
§ 207-8. Definitions.
As used in this article, the following terms shall have the following
meanings unless the context clearly indicates that a different meaning is
intended.
ABANDONED PROPERTY — Any property that is determined to be
abandoned pursuant to P.L. 2003, c. 210 (N.J.S.A. 55:19-78 et seq.).
LIENHOLDER or MORTGAGE HOLDER — Any person or entity holding a
note, mortgage or other interest secured by the building or any part thereof.
A. The New Jersey Urban Redevelopment Act, N.J.S.A. 55:19-20 et seq.,
was amended and Abandoned Properties Rehabilitation Act, N.J.S.A.
55-19-78 et seq., was adopted to authorize a qualified municipality to
designate a public officer, pursuant to ordinance, to perform certain
functions set forth in these state statutes.
B. The Abandoned Property Rehabilitation Act (APRA) was enacted into
law on January 8, 2004. It offers New Jersey's municipalities additional
means by which they can gain control of abandoned properties to
restore them to productive use.
A. The governing body of the City finds and declares that there are
properties within the City which qualify as abandoned properties
pursuant to state law. The continued presence of these buildings within
the community acts as a significant barrier to urban revitalization and
to regeneration of the neighborhoods where they are located.
B. Abandoned properties create a wide range of negative secondary
effects in the neighborhoods where they are located, such as fostering
criminal activity, creating public health problems, and otherwise
diminishing the quality of life for residents and business operators in
those areas. Furthermore, abandoned properties diminish property
values of neighboring properties, increase the risk of property damage
through arson and vandalism, and discourage neighborhood stability
and revitalization.
C. The purpose of these regulations is to implement and utilize the powers
afforded to local government by the adoption of the Abandoned
Properties Rehabilitation Act and to further the revitalization of the City
and improve economic and social conditions.
§ 207-6 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 207-8
1:1183
MUNICIPALITY — Any borough, city, town, township or village situated
within the boundaries of this state and shall include a qualified
rehabilitation entity that may be designated by the municipality pursuant
to N.J.S.A. 55:19-90 to act as its agent to exercise any of the municipality's
rights pursuant thereto.
OWNER — The holder or holders of the title to an abandoned property.
PROPERTY — Any building or structure and the land appurtenant thereto.
PUBLIC OFFICER — The person designated by the municipality pursuant to
N.J.S.A. 40:48-2.5.
QUALIFIED REHABILITATION ENTITY — Any entity organized or
authorized to do business under the New Jersey statutes which shall have
as one of its purposes the construction or rehabilitation of residential
or nonresidential buildings, the provision of affordable housing, the
restoration of abandoned property, the revitalization and improvement of
urban neighborhoods, or similar purpose, and which shall be well qualified
by virtue of its staff, professional consultants, financial resources, and prior
activities set forth in P.L. 2003, c. 210 (N.J.S.A. 55:19-78 et seq.) to carry out
the rehabilitation of vacant buildings in urban areas.
§ 207-9. Statutory definition; criteria; exceptions.
For the purposes of creating an abandoned property list, properties must
meet the criteria in the statutory definition as outlined below. This definition
applies to buildings of any type, without respect to their previous use, but

A. Threshold criteria. Property must not have been legally occupied for the
previous six months and must meet any one of the secondary criteria
below (See also Subsection D for exceptions.)

(1) Property is in need of rehabilitation in the reasonable judgment of
the public officer, and no rehabilitation has taken place during that

leaving the building unsuitable for occupancy, and no construction
has taken place for at least six months as of the date the building
was determined to be abandoned.
(3) At least one installment of property tax remains unpaid and
delinquent as of the date the building was determined to be
abandoned.
(4) The property has been determined to be a nuisance by the public
officer in accordance with the nuisance criteria below.
C. Nuisance criteria. For a property to be determined a nuisance, one of
the following must apply:

(1) The property is found to be unfit for human habitation, occupancy,
or use pursuant to N.J.S.A. 40:48-2.3.
(2) The condition and vacancy of the property materially increases the
risk of fire to the property and adjacent properties.

of abandoned property:
(1) A property on which an entity other than the municipality holds a
tax sales certificate is not deemed to be abandoned if the owner of
the certificate continues to pay all municipal tax and liens when
due; and initiates foreclosure proceedings within six months of the
property being determined eligible for foreclosure.
(2) A property used on a seasonal basis is deemed to be abandoned
only if it meets any two of the secondary criteria.
A. The public officer shall establish and maintain a list of abandoned
property, to be known as the "abandoned property list." The public
officer may add properties to the list at any time when he finds that a
property meets the definition of an abandoned property, and the public
officer may delete properties from the list at any time when he finds

abandoned property list, provided he/she follows the procedure set
forth in N.J.S.A. 55:19-105.

purchased or taken assignment from the municipality of a tax sale

property included on the list by regular mail and certified mail, return
receipt requested, within 10 days of the establishment of the
abandoned property list or any additions thereto.

cannot be ascertained in the exercise of reasonable diligence by the Tax
Collector, the notice shall not be mailed, but instead shall be posted on
the property by posting a copy of the notice in a conspicuous place on
the building affected by the notice.
D. The public officer, in consultation with the Tax Collector, also shall mail
a notice by regular mail to any mortgagee, servicing organization, or

provisions contained in the contract. The insurance will provide the

indemnification from, any claim, damage, loss or expense that is
attributable to bodily injury, sickness, disease or death, or to injury
to or destruction of tangible property, including the loss of use,
which arises out of the contractor's operations under the contract

operations, actions, derelictions or failures to act from which the
§ 210-2 ATLANTIC CITY CODE § 210-2
1:1232
claim arises are attributable to the contractor, any of its
consultants, officers, agents, subcontractors, employees, or anyone
directly or indirectly employed by any of them, including anyone
for whose acts of the aforementioned may be liable by operation
of statute, government regulation, or applicable case law or the
City, unless caused by the sole negligence of the City. Proof of
such insurance shall be provided to the City before the contract

of the contractor's insurance obligations set forth herein.

required in Subsections A, B, C and D above, the Director shall cause an
inspection of each rolling chair to be made by the City Inspectors. Upon

Bureau of Identification in the New Jersey State Police and/or the
Federal Bureau of Investigation, Identification Division, together with a
drug test and fingerprinting, the Director shall notify the applicant of
affirmative or negative results. The determination of the Director shall
be based upon a review of any prior convictions for crimes or offenses
which negatively impact the health, safety and welfare of the public. In
the event a current holder of a rolling chair operator license fails the
drug test and/or criminal record check, said license holder shall have
90 days to cure such defect, at which point an operator license would be
issued.
G. An owner or operator licensee shall notify the Mercantile License
Bureau, in writing, of any material change in the information contained
within the license application and accompanying documentation within
10 days of such change. Any failure to provide the aforesaid notification
shall be cause for the revocation of such license in addition to any other
sanction reasonably imposed by the Director.
H. The licenses issued pursuant to this article are nonassignable and
nontransferable.
I. There shall be a limit of 150 rolling chair owner licenses; however, no
more than 100 licenses shall be issued to any one person or any entity
or combination of entities in which there is common ownership with
another license holder. For purposes of this section, the restriction

chairs shall remain effective only as long as a particular owner
continues to license the maximum of two rolling chairs. Should an
affected owner fail to license any number of maximum chairs by May 30

Engineer.
(b) In lieu of the above-mentioned performance surety, public
utility companies or authorities may post an annual
performance surety for $50,000 or for an increased amount
determined by the City Engineer; the form of surety shall be
approved by the City Solicitor.

contemplated by an application exceed the amount of the bond
posted, additional bonds will be required.

submitted to the City Engineer and shall be made payable to "The

§ 222-6 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 222-7
1:1283

the certificate of satisfactory completion, and also agree that the City of
Atlantic City, in issuing the permit, shall not assume liability in connection
therewith. In the event of any suit or claim against the city due to the
negligence or default of the permittee or the contractor, the city shall give
written notice to the permittee of such suit or claim. Any final judgment
requiring the city to pay for such damage shall be conclusive upon the
permittee and the contractor, and the permittee and the contractor shall be
liable to repay the city for its costs of defense in connection with such suit.
§ 222-8. Insurance requirements.
A. The permittee and any contractor hired by the permittee shall provide
insurance coverage of such types and in such amounts as will
completely protect the permittee, contractor and the city, its elected
officials, officers, agents, servants, employees and assigns against any
and all risks of loss or liability arising out of any work under this permit.
The insurance must be furnished by insurance companies authorized by
the Commissioner of Insurance to do business in the State of New
Jersey and must be approved by or acceptable to the City Risk Manager.
The permittee shall furnish the city with certificates of insurance
naming the city as an additional insured, and providing further that any
liability insurance coverage shall be considered as primary and not as
excess insurance, describing the types and amounts of insurance,
identifying the coverage to this permit by reference and providing for
30 days' written notice to the city by registered mail prior to any
modification, cancellation, nonrenewal or other change in coverage.
The policies must be effective prior to the commencement of work and
must remain in force until the certificate of satisfactory completion is
issued by the City Engineer. If the permittee returns to the site to
perform maintenance work during the maintenance period, a current
certificate of insurance must be provided to the city at that time. A
completed operations policy must remain in effect for five years after
issuance of the certificate of satisfactory completion. In the event of
interruption of coverage for any reason, all work under the permit shall
cease and not resume until coverage has been restored.
B. The following are the minimum mandatory types and amounts of
insurance coverage to be carried in accordance with this article:
(1) Workers compensation — statutory — limits — employer's liability

(2) General liability in a comprehensive form with a minimum limit of
$1,000,000 C.S.O., including:
(a) Premises-operations.

themselves and/or their contractors which shall be valid until the
expiration of the coverage listed thereon.
D. The permittee shall provide proof that any contractors or
subcontractors have in force during the term of this permit insurance
equal to the coverages as herein set forth or shall make arrangements
to ensure that the activities of any contractors or subcontractors are
included under the permittee's policy. If the contractor does not have
adequate insurance, then the permittee must agree to indemnify the
city for all the contractor's actions. Neither approval by the city nor
failure to disapprove certificates of insurance furnished by the
permittee shall release the permittee of full responsibility for all
liability and casualty claims or losses. Insurance is required as a
measure of protection, and the permittee's liability is not limited
thereby. The certificate shall be subject to the review and approval of
the City Insurance/Risk Manager. If, at any time during the term of this
permit or any extension thereof, any required policies of insurance
should expire or be canceled, it will be the responsibility of the
permittee to furnish to the City a Certificate of Insurance or an
acceptable replacement of the expiring policy prior to the expiration or
cancellation date so that there shall be no lapse in any coverage.

policy, insuring the premises in question where the driveway is
being constructed; the policy shall be necessary if the work is to be
performed by the applicant/policyholder. The minimum limits of
liability coverage must be $300,000.

requirements set forth in Subsections A, B, C and D of this section.
A. The permittee shall take appropriate measures to assure that during
the performance of the excavation work both vehicular and pedestrian
traffic, as applicable, shall be maintained as nearly normal as
practicable. The permittee shall plan and carry out his work to provide
for the safe and convenient passage of such traffic and to cause as little
inconvenience as possible to the occupants of adjoining properties. The
permittee shall notify the owners of adjoining properties at least 48
hours prior to the time he proposes to begin any work which will
interfere with their normal passage and must provide the City Engineer
with proof of such notice. If an opening requires a detour, then five
working days' notice is required.
B. The permittee shall open no greater part of a street or pedestrianway
than shall be reasonably necessary as determined by the City Engineer.
C. The permittee shall provide, erect and maintain all necessary
barricades, suitable and sufficient lights, danger signals, signs and

Edition, and any amendments thereto.
D. In the event that it will become necessary to close off any street to
pedestrian or vehicular traffic, the permittee shall provide a detailed
detour plan to the City Engineer for approval. The City Engineer may
require that said plan be prepared by a New Jersey licensed
professional engineer. The permittee shall notify the City Engineer at
least five working days in advance of putting the detour in effect so that
the City Engineer shall have sufficient time to notify the police and the
media of the detour. The permittee shall be responsible for the repair
and maintenance of such detours, the regulation and direction of traffic
thereon and signing.

police officers shall be employed for traffic control where required
by the City Engineer.
A. All openings must be backfilled immediately and temporarily paved or
steel plated the same day as the opening is made. Final restoration
must be performed within the time periods described in § 222-5C.
B. If the nature of the work requires leaving an excavation unfinished
overnight or for an extended period of time, the permittee shall obtain
written authorization from the City Engineer at least five days in
advance of construction. Alternatively, in case of an emergency, the
permittee shall place safety barriers with appropriate lighting around
the unfinished excavation area. The barriers and lighting devices shall
conform to the specifications set forth in the United States Department
of Transportation Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices, Latest
Edition, and any amendments thereto, Part VI; except that the
permittee must place his name and a phone number where he can be
reached at all times on the barriers.
C. Any portions of work areas not closed to traffic shall be brought to the
existing grade with at least six inches of bituminous stabilized base, Mix
I-2, applied over a six-inch subbase of dense graded aggregate. All lifts
must be mechanically compacted and continuously maintained until
final restoration is performed.

or specific street improvements based upon a review of the applicant's
plans, details and/or specifications and after considering the impact of
the project on the streets and its users. Paper streets shall be restored
to existing conditions.
B. Trenches and other open excavations shall be backfilled with clean
granular soil, free of excessive fines, in lifts not to exceed six inches in
height. Compaction shall be done with vibratory tampers such as
jumping jacks, hoe packs, Dynapacks or other equipment acceptable to
the City Engineer. Puddling of backfill is permitted. Excess backfill shall
be removed from the site. If there is a deficiency of backfill material,
additional backfill material shall be supplied by the permittee.
Whenever the City Engineer deems the backfill material unsatisfactory,
the permittee shall provide acceptable material that is clean, granular
and free from excessive fines. Ninety-five percent relative compaction
(modified proctor) is required for all backfill operations. The City
Engineer may require the permittee to have a certified soil testing
laboratory test backfill for compaction at any given lift. These tests shall
be done at the expense of the permittee, and a copy of the test results
shall be furnished to the City Engineer. If the certified laboratory test
results do not achieve the 95% relative compaction required, the City
Engineer may require reexcavation and compaction. The provisions of
this subsection are subject to § 222-11A.
C. In all streets except those with a concrete base, the permittee shall
restore said road or street with a compacted subgrade of material
acceptable to the City Engineer, six inches of compacted dense graded
aggregate and a temporary pavement consisting of six inches of
§ 222-10 ATLANTIC CITY CODE § 222-11
1:1288
bituminous stabilized base, Mix I-2. The top of the bituminous stabilized
course shall be brought even with the existing finish grade of the street.
Cold patch will not be permitted as a temporary pavement course,
unless the asphalt plants are closed during the winter months. The
temporary pavement shall stay in place for a period of at least four
weeks unless further time is deemed necessary by the City Engineer.
In general, deeper excavations shall require longer periods of time
for soil consolidation. The permittee is responsible for maintaining the
temporary pavement in passable condition and shall apply additional
asphalt courses or skin patches or perform pothole repairs if deemed
necessary by the City Engineer. Immediately prior to applying the
surface course, the permittee shall mill out the temporary pavement
above the trench and to sufficient widths on both sides of the trench to
assure straight and uniform surface restoration limits. At a minimum,
the mill course shall consist of the width of the trench at the road
surface plus one foot on each side of the trench. The milling depth shall
be two inches. The permittee shall then apply a tack coat followed by
two inches of bituminous concrete surface course, Mix I-5. The total
width of the restored roadway surface shall comply with the policies
stated in Subsection D below. Streets with a concrete base shall be
restored using a combination of concrete and asphalt as approved
by the City Engineer. The time limitation prescribed in § 222-5C also
applies to this section. The provisions of this subsection are subject to
§ 222-11A.
D. Street surface restoration standards are further delineated as follows:
(1) One travel lane or deceleration lane. Surface restoration shall
extend for 1/2 of the road width for a two-lane road and a full lane
width for a multilane street.
(2) Multiple laterals or exceptionally wide trench openings. Surface
restoration shall extend across the full width of the paved street.
"Multiple laterals" is defined as disturbing greater than 25% of the
area of an individual block. "Exceptionally wide" is defined as
disturbing greater than 1/3 of the curb-to-curb width of a street.
(3) All final edges of trench restoration shall be straight, uniform cuts
with no keys or edge realignments. The City Engineer may require
a diamond restoration pattern for cross trenches and intersection
crossings depending upon the amount of traffic on the street and
the depth of the trench. The permittee is responsible for the full
restoration of the roadway surface, including restriping.
(4) The provisions of this subsection are subject to § 222-11A.
E. Pipes, conduits and hookups, six-inch diameter or less, used for making
opposite side of the street hookups shall be driven or bored under the
paved portion of the street without disturbing the surface. This
requirement shall not apply to gravity sanitary sewer laterals. The
provisions of this subsection are subject to § 222-11A.
§ 222-11 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 222-11

F. Minimum Boardwalk restoration shall consist of new decking for the
full width of any disturbed ribbons. New stringers and girders shall be
required to replace any superstructure members damaged or otherwise
rendered unusable during the course of construction. Removed
members may be reused, provided that their reinstallation complies
with the City's Standard Plans and Specifications and permission is
obtained from the City Engineer. The applicant will not be responsible
for replacing damaged superstructure members, provided that the
applicant notifies the City Engineer and requests preconstruction
inspection and provided that written acknowledgment of existing
damaged members is received from the City Engineer. When pedestrian
and/or vehicular ramps are removed they shall be reconstructed in their
entirety with new material. The provisions of this subsection are subject
to § 222-11A.
G. Upon completion of work, the applicant will request a final inspection
by the City Engineer's office. The City Engineer may require that
random core samples be taken on the project if in the opinion of the City
Engineer there appears to be a question regarding either quality of the
asphalt or the thickness thereof. These core samples will be the
responsibility of the contractor and shall be taken and tested by a
certified testing laboratory. All costs associated with this testing will be
borne by the permittee. If these samples reveal the use of improper
material or insufficient thickness, the permittee shall be required to
remove, replace, add or take other actions to satisfactorily complete the
restoration work as directed by the City Engineer. If the work is
completed in a manner satisfactory to the City Engineer, the City
Engineer will then issue a certificate of satisfactory completion to the
applicant. The performance surety will be returned by the City upon
receipt of a satisfactory maintenance guaranty. The provisions of this
subsection are subject to § 222-11A.
H. If the permittee fails to complete work or provide required safety and
signage measures in a timely manner satisfactory to the City Engineer,

Stormwater Control for Major Development
[Adopted 4-23-2008 by Ord. No. 32-2008]
§ 223-8. Scope and purpose.
A. Policy statement. Flood control, groundwater recharge, and pollutant
reduction through nonstructural or low-impact techniques shall be
explored before relying on structural BMPs. Structural BMPs should be
integrated with nonstructural stormwater management strategies and
proper maintenance plans. Nonstructural strategies include both
environmentally sensitive site design and source controls that prevent
pollutants from being placed on the site or from being exposed to
stormwater. Source control plans should be developed based upon
physical site conditions and the origin, nature, and the anticipated
quantity or amount of potential pollutants. Multiple stormwater
management BMPs may be necessary to achieve the established
performance standards for water quality, quantity, and groundwater
recharge.
B. Purpose. It is the purpose of this article to establish minimum
stormwater management requirements and controls for major
development, as defined in § 223-9 for the City of Atlantic City. Figure 1
depicts an Aerial Map of the City.381
C. Applicability.
(1) This article shall be applicable to all site plans and subdivisions for
the following major developments that require preliminary or final
site plan or subdivision review:
(a) Nonresidential major developments; and
(b) Aspects of residential major developments that are not preempted
by the Residential Site Improvement Standards at
N.J.A.C. 5:21.
(2) This article shall also be applicable to all major developments
undertaken by the City of Atlantic City.
D. Compatibility with other permit and ordinance requirements.
Development approvals issued for subdivisions and site plans pursuant
to this article are to be considered an integral part of development

(1) To the maximum extent practicable, the standards in Subsections F
and G shall be met by incorporating nonstructural stormwater
management strategies set forth at Subsection E into the design.
The applicant shall identify the nonstructural measures
incorporated into the design of the project. If the applicant
contends that it is not feasible for engineering, environmental, or
safety reasons to incorporate any nonstructural stormwater
management measures identified in Subsection E(2) below into the
design of a particular project, the applicant shall identify the
strategy considered and provide a basis for the contention.
(2) Nonstructural stormwater management strategies incorporated
into site design shall:

surface to collect stormwater from that surface into a
storm drain or surface water body under that grate:
[a] The New Jersey Department of Transportation
(NJDOT) bicycle-safe grate, which is described in
Chapter 2.4 of the NJDOT Bicycle Compatible
Roadways and Bikeways Planning and Design
Guidelines (April 1996); or
[b] A different grate, if each individual clear space in that
grate has an area of no more than seven square

1:1328
the curb opening has two or more clear spaces) shall have an
area of no more than seven square inches, or be no greater
than two inches across the smallest dimension.
(c) This standard does not apply:
[1] Where the review agency determines that this standard
would cause inadequate hydraulic performance that could
not practicably be overcome by using additional or larger
storm drain inlets that meet these standards;
[2] Where flows from the water quality design storm as
specified in Subsection G(1) are conveyed through any
device (e.g., end of pipe netting facility, manufactured
treatment device, or a catch basin hood) that is designed,
at a minimum, to prevent delivery of all solid and floatable
materials that could not pass through one of the following:
[a] A rectangular space 4 5/8 inches long and 1 1/2 inches
wide (this option does not apply for outfall netting
facilities); or
[b] A bar screen having a bar spacing of 0.5 inch.
[3] Where flows are conveyed through a trash rack that has
parallel bars with one-inch spacing between the bars, to
the elevation of the water quality design storm as specified
in Subsection G(1); or
[4] Where the New Jersey Department of Environmental
Protection determines, pursuant to the New Jersey
Register of Historic Places Rules at N.J.A.C. 7:4-7.2(c), that
action to meet this standard is an undertaking that
constitutes an encroachment or will damage or destroy the
New Jersey Register listed historic property.
(4) Any land area used as a nonstructural stormwater management
measure to meet the performance standards in Subsections F and
G shall be dedicated to a government agency, subjected to a
conservation restriction filed with the appropriate County Clerk's
office, or subject to an approved equivalent restriction that ensures
that measure or an equivalent stormwater management measure
approved by the reviewing agency is maintained in perpetuity.

§ 223-11 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 223-11
1:1329
(1) This subsection contains minimum design and performance
standards to control erosion, encourage and control infiltration and
groundwater recharge, and control stormwater runoff quantity
impacts of major development.
(a) The minimum design and performance standards for erosion
control are those established under the Soil Erosion and
Sediment Control Act, N.J.S.A. 4:24-39 et seq., and
implementing rules.
(b) The minimum design and performance standards for
groundwater recharge are as follows:
[1] The design engineer shall, using the assumptions and
factors for stormwater runoff and groundwater recharge
calculations at § 223-12, either:
[a] Demonstrate through hydrologic and hydraulic
analysis that the site and its stormwater management
measures maintain 100% of the average annual
preconstruction groundwater recharge volume for the
site; or
[b] Demonstrate through hydrologic and hydraulic
analysis that the increase of stormwater runoff volume
from preconstruction to postconstruction for the twoyear
storm is infiltrated.
[2] This groundwater recharge requirement does not apply to
projects within the urban redevelopment area, or to
projects subject to Subsection F(1)(b)[3] below.
[a] Figures 2A and 2B in the Appendix383 is a portion of a
State Plan Policy Map for the City of Atlantic City. It
delineates the majority of the City as a Metropolitan
Planning Area (PA1). Previously developed portions of
the Metropolitan Planning Area are considered an
urban redevelopment area.
[b] Also included in the Appendix is Figures 3A and 3B384
which is a Groundwater Recharge Area Map for the
City of Atlantic City. This map indicates groundwater
recharge potential for the various areas of the City. It

offices.
384. Editor's Note: Figures 3A and 3B, and the appendix in its entirety, are on file in the City
offices.
§ 223-11 ATLANTIC CITY CODE § 223-11
1:1330
[a] Stormwater from areas of high pollutant loading. High
pollutant loading areas are areas in industrial and
commercial developments where solvents and/or
petroleum products are loaded/unloaded, stored, or
applied, areas where pesticides are loaded/unloaded
or stored; areas where hazardous materials are
expected to be present in greater than reportable
quantities as defined by the United States
Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) at 40 CFR
302.4; areas where recharge would be inconsistent
with Department-approved remedial action work plan
or landfill closure plan and areas with high risks for
spills of toxic materials, such as gas stations and
vehicle maintenance facilities; and
[b] Industrial stormwater exposed to source material.
"Source material" means any material(s) or
machinery, located at an industrial facility, that is
directly or indirectly related to process,
manufacturing or other industrial activities, which
could be a source of pollutants in any industrial
stormwater discharge to groundwater. Source
materials include, but are not limited to, raw
materials; intermediate products; final products;
waste materials; by-products; industrial machinery
and fuels, and lubricants, solvents, and detergents
that are related to process, manufacturing, or other
industrial activities that are exposed to stormwater.
[4] The design engineer shall assess the hydraulic impact on
the groundwater table and design the site so as to avoid
adverse hydraulic impacts. Potential adverse hydraulic
impacts include, but are not limited to, exacerbating a
naturally or seasonally high water table so as to cause
surficial ponding, flooding of basements, or interference
with the proper operation of subsurface sewage disposal
systems and other subsurface structures in the vicinity or
downgradient of the groundwater recharge area.
(c) In order to control stormwater runoff quantity impacts, the
design engineer shall, using the assumptions and factors for
stormwater runoff calculations at § 223-12, complete one of the
following:
[1] Demonstrate through hydrologic and hydraulic analysis
that for stormwater leaving the site, postconstruction
runoff hydrographs for the two-, ten-, and one-hundredyear
storm events do not exceed, at any point in time, the
preconstruction runoff hydrographs for the same storm
events;
§ 223-11 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 223-11
1:1331
[2] Demonstrate through hydrologic and hydraulic analysis
that there is no increase, as compared to the
preconstruction condition, in the peak runoff rates of
stormwater leaving the site for the two-, ten-, and onehundred-
year storm events and that the increased volume
or change in timing of stormwater runoff will not increase
flood damage at or downstream of the site. This analysis
shall include the analysis of impacts of existing land uses
and projected land uses assuming full development under
existing zoning and land use ordinances in the drainage
area;
[3] Design stormwater management measures so that the
postconstruction peak runoff rates for the two-, ten-, and
one-hundred-year storm events are 50%, 75% and 80%,
respectively, of the preconstruction peak runoff rates. The
percentages apply only to the postconstruction
stormwater runoff that is attributable to the portion of the
site on which the proposed development or project is to be
constructed. The percentages shall not be applied to
postconstruction stormwater runoff into tidal flood hazard
areas if the increased volume of stormwater runoff will not
increase flood damages below the point of discharge; or
[4] In tidal flood hazard areas, stormwater runoff quantity
analysis in accordance with Subsection F(1)(c)[1], [2], and
[3] above shall only be applied if the increased volume of
stormwater runoff could increase flood damages below the
point of discharge.
G. Stormwater runoff quality standards.
(1) Stormwater management measures shall be designed to reduce the
postconstruction load of total suspended solids (TSS) in stormwater
runoff by 80% of the anticipated load from the developed site,
expressed as an annual average. Stormwater management
measures shall only be required for water quality control if an
additional 1/4 acre of impervious surface is being proposed on a
development site. The requirement to reduce TSS does not apply to
any stormwater runoff in a discharge regulated under a numeric
effluent limitation for TSS imposed under the New Jersey Pollution
Discharge Elimination System (NJPDES) rules, N.J.A.C. 7:14A, or in
a discharge specifically exempt under a NJPDES permit from this
requirement. The water quality design storm is 1.25 inches of
rainfall in two hours. Water quality calculations shall take into
account the distribution of rain from the water quality design
storm, as reflected in Table 1. The calculation of the volume of
runoff may take into account the implementation of nonstructural
and structural stormwater management measures.

(2) For purposes of TSS reduction calculations, Table 2 below presents
the presumed removal rates for certain BMPs designed in
accordance with the New Jersey Stormwater Best Management
Practices Manual. The BMP Manual may be obtained from the
address identified in § 223-14 or found on the Department's
website at www.njstormwater.org. The BMP Manual and other
sources of technical guidance are listed in § 223-7. TSS reduction
shall be calculated based on the removal rates for the BMPs in
Table 2 below. Alternative removal rates and methods of calculating
removal rates may be used if the design engineer provides
documentation demonstrating the capability of these alternative
rates and methods to the review agency. A copy of any approved
alternative rate or method of calculating the removal rate shall be
provided to the Department at the following address: Division of
Watershed Management, New Jersey Department of Environmental
Protection, PO Box 418, Trenton, New Jersey 08625-0418.
(3) If more than one BMP in series is necessary to achieve the required
eighty-percent TSS reduction for a site, the applicant shall utilize
the following formula to calculate TSS reduction:
§ 223-11 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 223-11
1:1333
R = A + B - (AXB)/100
Where
R = Total TSS percent load removal from application of both
BMPs
A = The TSS percent removal rate applicable to the first
BMP
B = The TSS percent removal rate applicable to the second
BMP

Best Management Practice TSS Percent Removal Rate
Bioretention systems 90
Constructed stormwater
wetland
90
Extended detention basin 40 to 60
Infiltration structure 80
Manufactured treatment device See § 223-13C
Sand filter 80
Vegetative filter strip 60 to 80
Wet pond 50 to 90
(4) If there is more than one on-site drainage area, the eighty-percent
TSS removal rate shall apply to each drainage area, unless the
runoff from the subareas converge on site in which case the
removal rate can be demonstrated through a calculation using a
weighted average.
(5) Stormwater management measures shall also be designed to
reduce, to the maximum extent feasible, the postconstruction
nutrient load of the anticipated load from the developed site in
stormwater runoff generated from the water quality design storm.
In achieving reduction of nutrients to the maximum extent feasible,
the design of the site shall include nonstructural strategies and
structural measures that optimize nutrient removal while still
achieving the performance standards in Subsections F and G.
(6) Additional information and examples are contained in the New
Jersey Stormwater Best Management Practices Manual, which may
be obtained from the address identified in § 223-14.
(7) In accordance with the definition of "FW1" at N.J.A.C. 7:9B-1.4,
stormwater management measures shall be designed to prevent
any increase in stormwater runoff to waters classified as FW1.
(8) Special water resource protection areas shall be established along

or intermittent streams that drain into or upstream of the Category
One waters as shown on the USGS Ouadrangle Maps or in the
County Soil Surveys, within the associated HUC14 drainage area.
Figure 4385 depicts a map of the City designating waters subject
to Special Water Resource Protection Area. These areas shall be
established for the protection of water quality, aesthetic value,
exceptional ecological significance, exceptional recreational
significance, exceptional water supply significance, and
exceptional fisheries significance of those established Category
One waters. These areas shall be designated and protected as
follows:
(a) The applicant shall preserve and maintain a special water
resource protection area in accordance with one of the
following:
[1] A three-hundred-foot special water resource protection
area shall be provided on each side of the waterway,
measured perpendicular to the waterway from the top of
the bank outwards or from the centerline of the waterway
where the bank is not defined, consisting of existing
vegetation or vegetation allowed to follow natural
succession is provided.
[2] Encroachment within the designated special water
resource protection area under Subsection G(8)(a)[1]
above shall only be allowed where previous development
or disturbance has occurred (for example, active
agricultural use, parking area or maintained lawn area).
The encroachment shall only be allowed where applicant
demonstrates that the functional value and overall
condition of the special water resource protection area will
be maintained to the maximum extent practicable. In no
case shall the remaining special water resource protection
area be reduced to less than 150 feet as measured
perpendicular to the top of bank of the waterway or
centerline of the waterway where the bank is undefined.
All encroachments proposed under this subsection shall be
subject to review and approval by the Department.
(b) All stormwater shall be discharged outside of and flow through
the special water resource protection area and shall comply

recharge.
development on a lot receiving preliminary or final subdivision
approval on or before February 2, 2004, provided that the
construction begins on or before February 2, 2009.
A. Stormwater runoff shall be calculated in accordance with the following:
(1) The design engineer shall calculate runoff using one of the
following methods:
(a) The USDA Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS)
methodology, including the NRCS Runoff Equation and
Dimensionless Unit Hydrograph, as described in the NRCS
National Engineering Handbook Section 4 — Hydrology and
Technical Release 55 — Urban Hydrology for Small
Watersheds; or
(b) The Rational Method for peak flow and the Modified Rational
Method for hydrograph computations.
(2) For the purpose of calculating runoff coefficients and groundwater
recharge, there is a presumption that the preconstruction condition
of a site or portion thereof is a wooded land use with good
hydrologic condition. The term "runoff coefficient" applies to both
the NRCS methodology at Subsection A(1)(a) and the Rational and
Modified Rational Methods at Subsection 5A(1)(b). A runoff
coefficient or a groundwater recharge land cover for an existing
condition may be used on all or a portion of the site if the design
engineer verifies that the hydrologic condition has existed on the
site or portion of the site for at least five years without interruption
prior to the time of application. If more than one land cover have
existed on the site during the five years immediately prior to the
time of application, the land cover with the lowest runoff potential
shall be used for the computations. In addition, there is the
presumption that the site is in good hydrologic condition (if the
land use type is pasture, lawn, or park), with good cover (if the land
use type is woods), or with good hydrologic condition and
conservation treatment (if the land use type is cultivation).
(3) In computing preconstruction stormwater runoff, the design
engineer shall account for all significant land features and
structures, such as ponds, wetlands, depressions, hedgerows, or
culverts, that may reduce preconstruction stormwater runoff rates
and volumes.
(4) In computing stormwater runoff from all design storms, the design
engineer shall consider the relative stormwater runoff rates and/or
volumes of pervious and impervious surfaces separately to
accurately compute the rates and volume of stormwater runoff
§ 223-11 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 223-12
1:1337
§ 223-13. Standards for structural stormwater management
measures.
from the site. To calculate runoff from unconnected impervious
cover, urban impervious area modifications as described in the
NRCS Technical Release 55 — Urban Hydrology for Small
Watersheds and other methods may be employed.
(5) If the invert of the outlet structure of a stormwater management
measure is below the flood hazard design flood elevation as defined
at N.J.A.C. 7:13, the design engineer shall take into account the
effects of tailwater in the design of structural stormwater
management measures.
B. Groundwater recharge may be calculated in accordance with the
following: The New Jersey Geological Survey Report GSR-32 A Method
for Evaluating Ground-Water Recharge Areas in New Jersey,
incorporated herein by reference as amended and supplemented.
Information regarding the methodology is available from the New
Jersey Stormwater Best Management Practices Manual; at
http://www.state.nj.us/dep/njgs/; or at New Jersey Geological Survey, 29
Arctic Parkway, P.O. Box 427, Trenton, New Jersey 08625-0427; (609)
984-6587.
A. Standards for structural stormwater management measures are as
follows:
(1) Structural stormwater management measures shall be designed to
take into account the existing site conditions, including, for
example, environmentally critical areas, wetlands; flood-prone
areas; slopes; depth to seasonal high water table; soil type,
permeability and texture; drainage area and drainage patterns; and
the presence of solution-prone carbonate rocks (limestone).
(2) Structural stormwater management measures shall be designed to
minimize maintenance, facilitate maintenance and repairs, and
ensure proper functioning. Trash racks shall be installed at the
intake to the outlet structure as appropriate, and shall have parallel
bars with one-inch spacing between the bars to the elevation of the
water quality design storm. For elevations higher than the water
quality design storm, the parallel bars at the outlet structure shall
be spaced no greater than 1/3 the width of the diameter of the
orifice or 1/3 the width of the weir, with a minimum spacing
between bars of one inch and a maximum spacing between bars of
six inches. In addition, the design of trash racks must comply with
the requirements of § 223-15D.
(3) Structural stormwater management measures shall be designed,
constructed, and installed to be strong, durable, and corrosion
resistant. Measures that are consistent with the relevant portions
§ 223-12 ATLANTIC CITY CODE § 223-13
1:1338
§ 223-14. Sources for technical guidance.
of the Residential Site Improvement Standards at N.J.A.C. 5:21-7.3,
7.4, and 7.5 shall be deemed to meet this requirement.
(4) At the intake to the outlet from the stormwater management basin,
the orifice size shall be a minimum of 2 1/2 inches in diameter.
(5) Stormwater management basins shall be designed to meet the
minimum safety standards for stormwater management basins at
§ 223-15.
B. Stormwater management measure guidelines are available in the New
Jersey Stormwater Best Management Practices Manual. Other
stormwater management measures may be utilized provided the design
engineer demonstrates that the proposed measure and its design will
accomplish the required water quantity, groundwater recharge and
water quality design and performance standards established by
§ 223-11 of this article.
C. Manufactured treatment devices may be used to meet the requirements
of § 223-11 of this article, provided the pollutant removal rates are
verified by the New Jersey Corporation for Advanced Technology and
certified by the Department.
A. Technical guidance for stormwater management measures can be

§ 223-19. Purpose.
This article requires the retrofitting of existing storm drain inlets which are
in direct contact with repaving, repairing, reconstruction, or resurfacing
or alterations of facilities on private property, to prevent the discharge of
solids and floatables (such as plastic bottles, cans, food wrappers and other
litter) to the municipal separate storm sewer system(s) operated by the City
of Atlantic City so as to protect public health, safety and welfare, and to
prescribe penalties for the failure to comply.
§ 223-20. Definitions.
For the purpose of this article, the following terms, phrases, words, and
their derivations shall have the meanings as defined below unless their use
in the text of this article clearly demonstrates a different meaning. When
not inconsistent with the context, words used in the present tense include
the future, words used in the plural number include the singular number,
and words used in the singular number include the plural number. The word
"shall" is always mandatory and not merely directory.
MUNICIPAL SEPARATE STORM SEWER SYSTEM (MS4) — A conveyance or
system of conveyances (including roads with drainage systems, municipal
streets, catch basins, curbs, gutters, ditches, man-made channels, or storm
drains) that is owned or operated by the City of Atlantic City or other public
body, and is designed and used for collecting and conveying stormwater.
STORM DRAIN INLET — An opening in a storm drain used to collect
stormwater runoff and includes, but is not limited to, a grate inlet, curbopening
inlet, slotted inlet, and combination inlet.
§ 223-21. Prohibited conduct.
No person in control of private property (except a residential lot with one
single-family house) shall authorize the repaving, repairing (excluding the
repair of individual potholes), resurfacing (including top coating or chip
sealing with asphalt emulsion or a thin base of hot bitumen), reconstructing
or altering any surface that is in direct contact with an existing storm drain
inlet on that property unless the storm drain inlet either:
A. Already meets the design standard below to control passage of solid
and floatable materials; or
B. Is retrofitted or replaced to meet the standard in § 223-22 below prior
to the completion of the project.
§ 223-19 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 223-22
1:1347
§ 223-22. Design standard.
Storm drain inlets identified in § 223-21 above shall comply with the
following standard to control passage of solid and floatable materials
through storm drain inlets. For purposes of this section, "solid and floatable
materials" means sediment, debris, trash, and other floating, suspended, or
settleable solids. For exemptions to this standard, see § 223-22C below.
A. Grates.
(1) Design engineers shall use either of the following grates whenever
they use a grate in pavement or another ground surface to collect
stormwater from that surface into a storm drain or surface water
body under that grate:
(a) The New Jersey Department of Transportation (NJDOT)
bicycle-safe grate, which is described in Chapter 2.4 of the
NJDOT Bicycle Compatible Roadways and Bikeways Planning
and Design Guidelines (April 1996); or
(b) A different grate, if each individual clear space in that grate
has an area of no more than seven square inches, or is no
greater than 0.5 inch across the smallest dimension.
(2) Examples of grates subject to this standard include grates in grate
inlets, the grate portion (non-curb-opening portion) of combination
inlets, grates on storm sewer manholes, ditch grates, trench grates,
and grates of spacer bars in slotted drains. Examples of ground
surfaces include surfaces of roads (including bridges), driveways,
parking areas, bikeways, plazas, sidewalks, lawns, fields, open
channels, and stormwater basin floors.
B. Whenever design engineers use a curb-opening inlet, the clear space in
that curb opening (or each individual clear space, if the curb opening
has two or more clear spaces) shall have an area of no more than seven
square inches, or be no greater than two inches across the smallest
dimension.
C. This standard does not apply:
(1) Where the municipal engineer agrees that this standard would
cause inadequate hydraulic performance that could not practicably
be overcome by using additional or larger storm drain inlets that
meet these standards;
(2) Where flows are conveyed through any device (e.g., end-of-pipe
netting facility, manufactured treatment device, or a catch basin
hood) that is designed, at a minimum, to prevent delivery of all
solid and floatable materials that could not pass through one of the
following:
(a) A rectangular space 4 5/8 inches long and 1 1/2 inches wide
(This option does not apply for outfall netting facilities.); or

is increased thereby. The exemption period shall be five years, and the

period of five years, notwithstanding that the value of the property to
which the improvements are made is increased thereby. During the

§ 231-21 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 231-22

enter into a written agreement with the applicant for the exemption of local
real property taxes. The agreement shall provide for the applicant to pay to
the municipality in lieu of full property tax payments an amount annually
to be computed by one, but in no case a combination, of the following
formulas:
A. Cost basis: the agreement may provide for the applicant to pay to the
municipality in lieu of full property tax payments an amount equal to 2%
of the cost of the project. For the purposes of the agreement, "the cost
of the project" means only the cost or fair market value of direct labor
and all materials used in the construction, expansion or rehabilitation of
all buildings, structures and facilities at the project site, including the
costs, if any, of land acquisition and land preparation, provision of
access roads, utilities, drainage facilities and parking facilities,
together with architectural, engineering, legal, surveying, testing and
contractors' fees associated with the project; which the applicant shall
cause to be certified and verified to the governing body by an
independent and qualified architect, following the completion of the
project.
B. Gross revenue basis: the agreement may provide for the applicant to
pay to the municipality in lieu of full property tax payments an amount
annually equal to 15% of the annual gross revenues from the project.
For the purposes of the agreement, "annual gross revenues" means the
total annual gross rental and other income payable to the owner of the
project from the project. If in any leasing, any real estate taxes or
assessments on property included in the project, any premiums for fire
or other insurance on or concerning property included in the project or
any operating or maintenance expenses ordinarily paid by the landlord
are to be paid by the tenant, then those payments shall be computed
and deemed to be part of the rent and shall be included in the annual
gross revenue. The tax agreement shall establish the method of
computing the revenues and may establish a method of arbitration by
which either the landlord or tenant may dispute the amount of
payments so included in the annual gross revenue.
C. Tax phase-in basis: the agreement may provide for the applicant to pay
to the municipality in lieu of full property tax payments an amount
equal to a percentage of taxes otherwise due, according to the following
schedule:
(1) In the first full tax year after completion, no payment in lieu of
taxes otherwise due.
(2) In the second tax year, an amount not less than 20% of taxes
otherwise due.
(3) In the third tax year, an amount not less than 40% of taxes
otherwise due.
(4) In the fourth tax year, an amount not less than 60% of taxes
otherwise due.

40A:21-9 through 40A:21-12 shall be in effect for no more than the five
full tax years next following the date of completion of the project.
B. All projects subject to tax agreement as provided herein shall be subject
to all applicable federal, state and local laws and regulations on
pollution control, worker safety, discrimination in employment, housing
provision, zoning, planning and building code requirements.
C. That percentage which the payment in lieu of taxes for a property bears
to the property tax which would have been paid had an exemption not
been granted for the property under the agreement shall be applied to
the valuation of the property to determine the reduced valuation of the
property to be included in the valuation of the municipality for
determining equalization for county tax apportionment and school aid
during the term of the tax agreements covering the properties, and at
the termination of an agreement for a property, the reduced valuation
procedure required under this section shall no longer apply. [Amended
9-22-2004 by Ord. No. 99-2004]
D. Within 30 days after the execution of a tax agreement, the City Clerk
shall forward a copy of the agreement to the Director of the Division of
Local Government Services in the Department of Community Affairs.
A. If during any tax year prior to the termination of the tax agreement the
property owner ceases to operate or disposes of the property or fails to
meet the conditions for qualifying, then the tax which would have
otherwise been payable for each tax year shall become due and payable
from the property owner as if no exemption had been granted. The
governing body of the municipality shall notify the property owner and
Tax Collector forthwith, and the Tax Collector shall within 15 days
thereof notify the owner of the property of the amount of taxes due.
However, with respect to the disposal of the property, where it is
determined that the new owner of the property will continue to use the
property pursuant to the conditions which qualified the property, no tax
shall be due, the exemption shall continue, and the agreement shall
remain in effect. [Amended 9-22-2004 by Ord. No. 99-2004]
B. At the termination of a tax agreement, a project shall be subject to all
applicable real property taxes as provided by state law and regulation
and local ordinance; but nothing herein shall prohibit a project, at the
termination of an agreement, from qualifying for and receiving the full
benefits of any other tax preferences provided by law.

pursuant to N.J.S.A. 40A:21-9 through 40A:21-12, the amount of tax to be
paid for the first full tax year following completion shall be based on the
assessed valuation of the property for the previous year plus any portion
of the assessed valuation of the improvement, conversion or construction
not allowed an exemption pursuant to this article. Subject to the provisions
of this article, the property shall continue to be treated in the appropriate

This article provides that an additional improvement, conversion or
construction completed on a property granted a previous exemption or
abatement pursuant to this article during the period in which such previous
exemption or abatement is in effect shall be qualified for an exemption, just
as if such property had not received a previous exemption or abatement.
In such case, the additional improvement, conversion or construction shall
be considered as separate for the purposes of calculating exemptions and
abatements pursuant to this article, except that the assessed value of
any previous improvement, conversion or construction shall be added to
the assessed valuation as it was prior to that improvement, conversion
alteration or construction for the purpose of determining the assessed
valuation of the property.
§ 231-27. Properties with delinquent taxes ineligible. [Amended

owing must be paid in full upon application.

to the Solicitor, one original to the Business Administrator and a
copy to the Tax Assessor, the Tax Collector, and the Director of
Planning and Development. The City Clerk's executed copy shall be
placed on permanent file within that office where it shall be
available for examination by the public during regular business
hours.
C. Oversight and billing. During the construction period, the Director of
the Department of Revenue and Finance, Tax Collector, and
Construction Official shall each be responsible to oversee some aspect
of the financial agreement as outlined below.
(1) Permits and inspection. Upon receipt of an executed financial
agreement, the Construction Official shall cause permits to be
issued upon application by the developer and shall cause
inspections of all work activity to be conducted in the manner
provided by the City ordinances. The Construction Official shall
notify the Tax Assessor and Director of the Department of Revenue
and Finance of any failure by the developer to properly apply for
permits, to begin construction or to complete construction within
the period set forth in the financial agreement. The Construction
§ 231-40 ATLANTIC CITY CODE § 231-40
1:1390
Official shall send the Tax Assessor and Director of the Department
of Revenue and Finance a copy of each permit as it is issued.
(2) Quarterly report to Tax Assessor. From the date of the execution of
a financial agreement until the issuance of the permanent
certificate of occupancy for the entire project, the Construction
Official shall report to the Tax Assessor and Director of the
Department of Revenue and Finance each quarter as to the status
of permit and construction activity on the project. Upon the total or
partial completion of construction, the Construction Official shall
issue a certificate of occupancy in the appropriate form, and shall
send a copy of each such certificate to the Tax Assessor and
Director of the Department of Revenue and Finance. The
Construction Official in the quarterly reports will incorporate the
term "substantially complete" on the certificates of occupancy
when the event occurs. In the event the certificate of occupancy is
issued for part of a building, the Construction Code Official shall
specifically identify that portion of the building affected.
(3) Assessments and taxes. Upon receipt of a certificate of occupancy
for the project or a part thereof, the Tax Assessor shall adjust the
assessment status to exempt for as much or all of the improvements
as are reflected in the certificate. Upon receipt of the certificate of
occupancy for the entire project or a part thereof, the Tax Assessor
shall exempt the assessment for all improvements covered by the
certificate during such time as the financial agreement remains in
effect. Land shall remain conventionally taxed throughout the
entire term of the financial agreement. At any time that the Tax
Assessor causes the assessment on the project to be moved, in
whole or in part, from taxable to exempt status, he or she shall
immediately and directly notify the Director of the Department of
Revenue and Finance and Tax Collector, in writing, to insure the
prompt commencement of the service charge billing.
(4) Billing, collection and audit. Upon receipt of a fully executed
financial agreement, the Director of the Department of Revenue
and Finance and Tax Collector shall note in his or her records the
execution of the financial agreement and those dates by which
construction is to commence and be completed. The Director of the
Department of Revenue and Finance shall thereafter continue to
levy conventional taxes and collect payment therefor on the
property until the occurrence of the following:
(a) In the event that a certificate of occupancy is issued for the
entire project or any part thereof, the Tax Collector shall
immediately cease to levy or collect taxes on the portion of the
assessed value covered by the certificate. The Director of the
Department of Finance shall instead bill the developer for the
estimated amount of payment in lieu of taxes due as indicated
in the application and financial agreement. Taxes on the value
of the land shall continue to be levied and collected.
§ 231-40 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 231-40
1:1391
§ 231-41. Administration of agreements after project completion.
After the completion of construction and issuance of the final certificate
of occupancy, the project shall continue to operate within the terms of the
financial agreement until its termination. The Director of the Department of
Revenue and Finance shall administer the financial agreement throughout
this period, according to the following procedures:
(b) Upon the issuance of the final certificate of occupancy for the
entire project or any part thereof, the developer shall submit
within 30 days to the Director of the Department of Revenue
and Finance two copies of total project costs certified by the
project architect and two copies of an audited statement of
total project cost certified by a certified public accountant.
(c) The Director of the Department of Revenue and Finance shall
review the certified audit of total project cost and make a
determination as to the acceptability of the audit. If the audit is
deemed unacceptable by the City, it shall be reaudited by the
City with all fees to be paid by the developer. The Director of
the Department of Revenue and Finance shall bill the
developer for the cost of the audit. Once the audit is accepted,
if its findings cause any change in the basis to be used in the
determination of the payment in lieu of taxes, the Director of
the Department of Revenue and Finance shall file a notice of
final certified project cost (notice) with the City Clerk and send
a copy to the Solicitor, the Tax Assessor, and developer as an
addendum to the financial agreement.
(d) Upon the filing of the notice, the Director of the Department of
Revenue and Finance shall bill the developer for the cost of the
audit and for any adjustments necessitated by the audit.
Failure to file the notice, however, shall not bar the collection
of the audited service charge.
D. Violation of financial agreement. In the event that the developer fails to
commence construction or to complete construction within the time
required by the financial agreement, or fails to make payments due to
the City as required by the financial agreement, or otherwise fails to
meet any other material condition of the financial agreement, the
Director of the Department of Revenue and Finance shall notify the
Solicitor. The Solicitor shall undertake those steps necessary to
terminate the financial agreement and shall advise the Tax Assessor, the
Tax Collector and the Director of Planning and Development of the
actions to be taken in regard to the levying and collection of taxes and
payments in lieu of taxes. The Solicitor shall prepare such notices or
resolutions as are necessary or appropriate to authorize the
termination of the financial agreement.
A. Billing and payment.
§ 231-40 ATLANTIC CITY CODE § 231-41
1:1392
(1) The Tax Collector shall bill the developer each quarter. If the
service charge is calculated as a percentage of project cost, the bill
shall reflect both the taxes due on the value of all land included
within the project and the service charge payments due on the
improvements required by the financial agreement. If the service
charge is calculated as a percentage of annual gross revenue, the
quarterly bills shall be estimated in an amount equal to the actual
amounts due in the previous year. In such case, the developer shall
make an additional payment within 90 days after the close of the
fiscal year, and such payment shall be the difference between the
estimated billing and the adjusted annual service charge, based
upon the actual financial performance of the project, including any
excess profits due and owing in accordance with N.J.S.A. 40A:20-1
et seq. The additional payment by the developer shall be submitted,
along with a certified audit of annual gross revenue calculated
under the Law and the financial agreement.
(2) Regardless of the date of a bill or whether the bill is sent or
received, a bill for a service charge shall be deemed to have been
issued on the first day of each calendar quarter following the
substantial completion of the project and to be due and payable
within 30 calendar days thereafter. All payments which are not paid
as of the date due shall be subject to the same charges for penalties
and interest then in effect for delinquent property taxes.
(3) In the event the estimate of the annual service charge exceeds the
actual service charge due based upon final total project cost or
actual annual gross revenue, the developer shall not be entitled to
any credit against any past service charges due and owing, but only
a credit, without interest, against subsequent service charges.
(4) The Tax Collector or the Director of Revenue and Finance shall
accept all payments and maintain books of account as to each
financial agreement. Except where otherwise required by law, the
Director of the Department of Revenue and Finance, in
coordination with the Tax Collector, if appropriate, shall apply
payments received to amounts due in the following order: amounts
due for penalties and interest on taxes; amounts due for payments
of taxes; amounts due for penalties and interest for service charge
payments; amounts due for service charge payments. The
developer shall make timely payments of taxes and annual service
charges directly to the Director of the Department of Revenue and
Finance and/or the Tax Collector, as instructed.
(5) In addition to the payment of the annual service charge, all
developers shall pay an annual administrative fee to the City. The
annual administrative fee shall be 2% of the annual service charge
and shall be due no later than December 31 of each year and paid
and collected in the same manner as the service charge.
B. Annual audits.
§ 231-41 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 231-41
1:1393
(1) As required by law or the financial agreement, the developer shall
submit an annual certified audit prepared by a certified public
accountant of the financial performance of the project. The audit
shall be submitted each year within 90 days after the end of the
fiscal year of the project to the Director of the Department of
Revenue and Finance with a copy to the City Clerk and Director of
Planning and Development. In addition to the submission of the
annual certified audit, the developer shall submit a statement by a
certified public accountant attesting to the percentage of excess
profits, if any, pursuant to the provisions of N.J.S.A. 40A:20-15 and
40A:20-16. The Director of the Department of Revenue and Finance
shall review the audit and make a determination as to any required
increase in the service charge payment and the payment of the
excess profit, if any. The developer shall utilize the City's figures in
calculating excess profits.
(2) The audit and the determination of the Director of the Department
of Revenue and Finance shall be submitted to the City's designated
auditors for their review. If the determination of the Director of the
Department of Revenue and Finance is acceptable, it shall be used
as the basis to bill for any increases due and owing. If the
determination or the audit is not acceptable, the Director of the
Department of Revenue and Finance shall notify the developer, and
the developer shall be responsible to remedy the deficiencies noted
and to resubmit a corrected audit for review. As part of this annual
audit process, the developer shall be responsible for the payment of
all costs incurred by the City to reaudit or review the audit. Such
costs will be in the actual amount incurred by the City. The cost
shall be billed by the Director of the Department of Revenue and
Finance as part of the annual service charge and shall be paid and
collected in the same manner as the service charge.
C. Noncompliance.
(1) During the term of the financial agreement, if the developer fails to
comply with the requirements for the submission of audits and/or
timely payments of amounts due, the Director of the Department of
Revenue and Finance, in coordination with the Tax Collector, if
appropriate, shall enforce the terms of the financial agreement.
The enforcement procedures which follow shall not constitute the
City's sole or exclusive remedies, but rather shall be used in
addition to such other remedies as may be permitted under any law
and by the terms of the financial agreement.
(a) In the case where any payment due to the City pursuant to the
financial agreement, whether arising from real property taxes
or service charge payments, audit or administrative fees or
water or sewer charges, is in arrears for a period of three
months or more, the Director of the Department of Revenue
and Finance shall notify the developer that unless the total
amount due, including penalties and interest and subsequent
§ 231-41 ATLANTIC CITY CODE § 231-41
1:1394
charges, is paid in full within a period of 30 days from the date
of the notification, the financial agreement shall be terminated.
If the developer fails to comply with such notice, the Director
of the Department of Revenue and Finance shall notify the
Solicitor and recommend that a resolution be prepared, if
necessary, terminating the financial agreement. The Director
of the Department of Revenue and Finance shall also notify the
Tax Collector and Tax Assessor.
(b) If a financial agreement is terminated in this manner, the
developer shall have 30 calendar days to seek reinstatement of
the financial agreement. Reinstatement shall be permitted only
if all amounts due and owing have been paid in full within 30
calendar days. In that case, the Director of the Department of
Revenue and Finance shall recommend that the Solicitor
prepare a resolution to restore the financial agreement for the
remainder of its original term. It shall be the responsibility of
the developer to pay a restoration fee to the City.
(2) It shall be the responsibility of the City Clerk to file and distribute
approved copies of all resolutions or ordinances adopted to rescind
or restore financial agreements which arise pursuant to this
subsection, doing so in the same manner as set forth in
§ 231-40B(2) for the original executed financial agreements.
(3) In the event of any nonpayment, in addition to the above remedies,
the developer, in signing the financial agreement, agrees that the
City shall have the same rights to place liens and foreclose against
the project as though the nonpayment of the service charges were
delinquent property taxes.
(4) If an audit required to be submitted pursuant to the financial
agreement is not submitted when due or is incomplete for three
months or more from the date due, the Director of the Department
of Revenue and Finance shall notify the developer that unless the
audit is submitted in proper form within 30 days from the date of
notification, the financial agreement shall be terminated. If the
developer fails to comply with the requirements of the notice, the
Director of the Department of Revenue and Finance shall request
the Solicitor to prepare a resolution terminating the financial
agreement, and after its adoption shall thereafter treat the
property as conventionally taxed.
(a) If the financial agreement is terminated in this manner, the
remaining procedure shall be the same as set forth in
Subsection C(1)(a) and (3) above. The City may, however, as its
option, choose not to exercise its rights of termination of the
financial agreement for failure to submit an audit. Instead, the
City may cause an audit to be conducted by qualified personnel
under the City's direction and use that audit as the basis for
billing as if it had been submitted by the developer. The cost of
§ 231-41 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 231-41
1:1395
§ 231-42. Termination of long-term tax exemptions.
§ 231-43. Second term tax exemption application.
the audit shall be paid by the developer and billed and
collected in the same manner as the service charges. Should
the City invoke this option, the City shall not in any way be
barred or limited from exercising any other right to terminate
the financial agreement at any subsequent time.
(5) If the developer fails to comply with any other material provision of
the financial agreement, the Director of the Department of
Revenue and Finance shall notify the Solicitor of the defect in the
performance of the developer. The Solicitor shall thereupon take
those steps necessary to enforce the terms of the financial
agreement.
D. Revaluation. In the event of a revaluation in the City of Atlantic City, the
City Tax Exemption Committee reserves the right to review all existing
financial agreements and modify the terms where applicable to provide
the most benefit to the City of Atlantic City.
A. All exemptions granted pursuant to the provisions of this chapter,
N.J.S.A. 55:14K-1 et seq., and N.J.S.A. 40A:20-1 et seq., shall terminate
at the time prescribed and in accordance with the terms set forth in the
financial agreement. Upon the termination of the exemption granted
pursuant to the provisions of this chapter, N.J.S.A. 55:14K-1 et seq., and
N.J.S.A. 40A:20-1 et seq., the project, all affected parcels, land and all
improvements made thereto shall be assessed and subject to taxation as
are other taxable properties in the City.
B. After the date of termination, all restrictions and limitations upon the
sponsor or the urban renewal entity shall terminate and be at an end
upon the entity's rendering of its final accounting to the City.
A. The applicant must formally apply not more than one year and not less
than six months prior to the end of the initial term of the tax exemption;
a second term tax exemption is possible only for affordable housing
projects with an existing exemption at the time of adoption of this
article to enable the continued maintenance of existing affordable
housing stock in the City of Atlantic City.
B. A second term tax exemption may be granted if necessary for
refinancing of an existing affordable housing project, where such an
exemption is required by the New Jersey Housing Mortgage Finance
Agency (HMFA) or its successor agency in order for the refinancing to
occur. Additionally, a second term tax exemption may be granted if
necessary for refinancing of an existing affordable housing project
funded with low-income housing tax credits, where such an exemption
is required by the lender.
§ 231-41 ATLANTIC CITY CODE § 231-43
1:1396
§ 231-44. Review of second term tax exemption application.
Upon receipt of the application, the Director of Planning and Development
shall distribute copies in the same manner as set forth in § 231-39A. The
Solicitor shall then review the application and make a determination
pursuant to § 231-39B. Subsequent to the Solicitor's review, the City Tax
Exemption Committee shall have 60 days to review the application in
accordance with § 231-39C of this chapter and upon arriving at a
recommendation, forward a report to the Mayor and governing body.
C. A second term tax exemption may only be granted with an annual
payment structure that is greater than the annual payment structure
provided in the first term tax exemption and if the terms in the
aggregate do not exceed the maximum allowed by statute. The term of
the exemption shall not exceed the length of the first mortgage created
by the second term tax exemption.
D. All applications for a second term tax exemption shall be subject to the
following criteria:
(1) The application must be filed in the same manner as set forth in
§ 231-38B of this chapter, with the applicable second term
application fee.
(2) The applicant must provide an in-depth analysis to the City of
Atlantic City supporting the benefit of granting second term tax
exemption.
(3) The applicant must prove granting the second term tax exemption
will improve the quality of life for the occupants of the project and
the quality of life for the City of Atlantic City.
(4) The applicant must not have any building violations during the
initial term of the tax exemption; if so, such violation(s) must have
been corrected within 30 days, a reasonable time frame, of the
occurrence; failure to do so will automatically terminate the
request for second term tax exemption; a reasonable time frame for
remediation of building violations shall be determined by the
applicable public officer.
(5) The applicant must not have any late payments during the initial
term of the tax exemption.
(6) The applicant must continue to meet the requirements of all
applicable state laws, rules and regulations.
(7) The application must be submitted before the end of the term of the
first tax exemption.

1:1397
Thereafter, the Mayor shall have a maximum of 60 days to review the report
pursuant to § 231-39E(4). Upon receipt of recommendation from the Mayor,
the City Council shall have 45 days to approve or reject the second term tax
exemption request or direct the application be returned to the developer
for correction or change. Rejection may be conditional or unconditional.
An application that is conditionally rejected may be resubmitted with the
applicable resubmission fee. An application that is unconditionally rejected
may only be submitted as a new application with payment of the applicable
fee. The applicant shall not be eligible for additional tax exemptions beyond
approval of a second term tax exemption.
§ 231-45. Form of financial agreement for second term tax
exemption.
The financial agreement shall be in the appropriate form as provided in
§ 231-40 of this chapter.
§ 231-46. Term of second term tax exemption.

eligible housing projects financed by the New Jersey Housing and Mortgage
Finance Agency (NJHMFA) or another lender.
§ 231-47. Filing.
This chapter shall be kept on file in the office of the City Clerk, Director of

nature of the franchise granted to the individuals licensed to drive
taxicabs. When this fact is taken into consideration with the fact that
the amount of casino gaming in the City of Atlantic City has resulted in
the need for improved taxicab service for the benefit of visitors to the
City, businesses operating within the City and residents of the City, it is
deemed desirable that the Director have a forum whereby he or his
representative can regularly meet with the holders of taxicab licenses
and/or their representatives to discuss and meet the changing demand
for taxicab service in the City of Atlantic City. It is anticipated that such
a forum will aid the Director in coordinating and managing the taxicab
industry in the City of Atlantic City, and thereby the taxicab industry
will better serve the needs of the City. [Amended 7-24-2002 by Ord.
No. 25-2002]
W. The maximum number of passengers for each trip in a taxicab shall be
six for full-size cars, two in front and four in back; five for mid-size cars,
two in front and three in back; and four for compact cars, one in front
and three in back. Any other vehicles, i.e., vehicles that have jump seats
or limousine-style seating, are required to have a specific letter on file
with the Department from their insurance carrier stating how many
passengers they can carry.
X. Child passenger restraint systems. [Added 9-11-1991 by Ord. No.

(1) Every person operating a taxicab who is transporting a child under

prior to the effective date of Subsection A(12) and Subsection X shall have 30 days from
the effective date to comply with those requirements before any penalty may be imposed
for violations thereof. The license of any taxicab medallion owner or driver who has not
complied with the requirements of Subsection A(12) and Subsection X after the passage of
said thirty-day grace period shall be subject to penalties provided in § 233-14.3 for such

that a transfer may be permitted if an appeal is pending from an
unsatisfied judgment and a bond is filed with the Director in an amount
sufficient to satisfy the judgment but not to exceed the fair market value
of the license or licenses being transferred. A transfer may also be
permitted without filing a bond, provided that all the tort judgment
creditors of unsatisfied judgments file written permission for such a
transfer with the Director or provided that the proceeds of sale are paid
into court or held in escrow on terms and conditions approved by the

decedent's estate owning a taxicab license.

provided with respect to the same judgment. The individual who
obtains the license by involuntary transfer must comply with the
procedures and requirements of this article before said individual may

institution, which loan shall use the owner's license as collateral, the
terms of the loan shall be approved by the Director. The approval of the

indebtedness which the license secures. When these documents
are filed with the Director, any subsequent application to transfer
the affected license shall, if otherwise approved, automatically be
conditioned upon satisfaction in full of the indebtedness which the
license secures, and written proof of such satisfaction shall be filed
with the Director within 10 days of approval of the transfer.

the manner prescribed by law, the lending institution shall
thereafter promptly expose the license for sale and thereafter

ultimately be transferred to an individual. Any individual who
ultimately acquires said license from a lending institution shall
comply with the procedures and requirements of this article;
however, the lending institution shall not be required to pay any

the manner prescribed by law. Any lending institution that acquires
a jitney license shall not be permitted to use said license in
connection with the operation of the subject jitney bus until the
license is transferred to an individual.
(4) Security interest in and to jitney licenses that may hereafter be
created pursuant to applicable state law shall be conspicuously
noted on the certificate of ownership for each and every jitney
license issued by the Director. No new certificate of ownership shall
be issued by the Director upon the transfer of any jitney license
unless there is presented to the Director, in the case of any security
interest noted on a certificate of ownership, proof satisfactory to
the Director that the security interest has been endorsed for
discharge or cancellation. [Added 11-23-1994 by Ord. No.
101-1994406]
(5) Neither the City nor the Director or the Division shall be deemed a
party to any transfer undertaken pursuant to any provision of this

insurance card. No jitney license shall be recommended or awarded to
an applicant by the Director if it appears that: [Amended 3-8-2006 by
Ord. No. 15-2006]
(1) The insurance policy required by law has not been furnished and
approved, or the same is insufficient in form or substance to
properly safeguard the public interest and safety, or that the policy
of insurance is not operative for at least one year;
(2) The vehicle which the license is applied for is inadequate or unsafe
for the purpose intended or is insufficiently equipped in any

violation of any state law relating to traffic or use of streets or for
failure to pay any judgment for personal damages arising from the
unlawful or negligent operation of a jitney for which the license was

place of such hearing. The notice provided hereby shall be served
personally or mailed to the address last filed by the person licensed in
the office of the Director. It will also be within the discretion of the
Director to levy a fine and/or suspension, should the Director deem
revocation too severe a penalty.
E. Where a licensee has been convicted of a crime in any City, county, state
or federal court, upon conviction, the Director may revoke the license of
the jitney owner upon notice and hearing.
F. For the purpose of this article, the Director is assigned the supervision
over the operation of all jitneys upon public streets in the City of
Atlantic City to assure the safe and timely operation of all jitneys.
G. The Director shall take official cognizance of any and all misconduct,
deceit, fraud, subterfuge or actions of any jitney licensee which are
against the best interest of the public or the jitney industry itself,
regardless of whether or not such actions are specifically covered in
this article. It shall also be the direct responsibility of all Department
Inspectors to bring such actions to the notice of the Director.
H. It shall further be the duty of the Director to take all reasonable and
prudent steps to assure that the terms and conditions of this article are
fulfilled, both with regard to the appointment and supervision of
qualified personnel, as well as the timely promulgation of all necessary

nearest to the parking meter; when a parking meter space is diagonal to
the curb or sidewalk, no person shall park or permit the parking of any
vehicle in such parking space in any other position than with the foremost
part of such vehicle nearest to the parking meter; when a parking meter
shall have been installed at the head of and immediately adjacent to any
parking space on a municipal off-street parking lot, no person shall park or
permit the parking of any vehicle in such parking space in any other position
than with the foremost part of such vehicle nearest to the parking meter;
provided, however, that in municipal off-street parking lots, signs shall be

§ A265-2. Findings.
The Advisory Committee, having engaged in certain review and
investigations concerning the performance of the franchisee and its
predecessors and assignors under the 1975 franchise agreement and the
City's current and projected cable-related needs; and the City, having held
public hearings pursuant to the State Act and the regulations promulgated
thereto; and the City, having received and considered all comments relating
to its consent to the renewal of the franchise, the City hereby finds:
§ A265-3. Consent to renewal.
The City hereby consents to a renewal of the franchise, subject to the terms
and conditions of this ordinance and upon the conditions that the franchisee
accept this ordinance and confirm, in writing, that it will comply with all
of the commitments contained herein and that compliance is commercially
practicable and within the economic capabilities of the franchisee.
§ A265-4. Nature of consent.
The consent of renewal is for a nonexclusive franchise. The City specifically
reserves the right to grant, at any time and consistent with applicable law,
such additional consents for additional cable television systems as it deems
appropriate.
§ A265-5. Renewal term.
The renewal term to which the City has herein granted its consent is for a
period of 15 years beginning as of the issuance of a renewal certificate of
approval by the Board, and shall thereafter be extended for, and end after,
an automatic renewal term of 10 years as provided by N.J.S.A. 48:5A-19 and
N.J.A.C. 14:18-13.6.
A. That the franchisee and its predecessors and assignors have
substantially complied with the obligations of the 1994 Renewal
Certificate of Approval issued by the Board in Docket No. CE91030409
and applicable law, and there is no reason to believe that in the future
the franchisee would fail to comply with its obligation under a renewal
of the franchise and under applicable law.
B. That, if the franchisee fully, faithfully and expeditiously complies with
the provisions set forth in § A265-22, it will provide reasonable
assurance of meeting the City's current and future cable-related needs
and will remedy any deficiencies which the City has determined to exist.
§ A265-1 ATLANTIC CITY CODE § A265-6
1:1684
§ A265-6. Applicability.
The consent granted herein to the renewal of the franchise applies to the
entirety of the City, as defined in § A265-1.
§ A265-7. Use of streets.
A. At the time the consent herein granted becomes effective and for and
throughout the renewal term, the City shall renew and continue its
consent for the franchisee to construct, erect, operate, modify and
maintain in, upon, along, across, above, over and under the highways,
streets, alleys, sidewalks, public ways and public places now laid out or
dedicated and all extensions thereof and additions hereto, in the City,
poles, wires, cables, underground conduits, manholes and other
television conductors and fixtures necessary for the maintenance and
operation in the City of a cable television system for the purpose of
distributing television and radio signals and other electronic and
electromagnetic services to the public, subject to the conditions and
restrictions contained in this subsection. The right so granted includes
the right to use and occupy said highways, streets, alleys, public ways
and public places and all manner of easements for the purposes herein
set forth.
B. All transmissions and distribution structures, lines and equipment
erected by the franchisee within the City shall be so located as to cause
minimum interference with the proper use of streets, alleys and other
public ways and places and to cause minimum interference with the
rights and reasonable convenience of property owners who adjoin any
of said streets, alleys or other public ways and places.
C. The franchisee shall not construct or install any poles or wire-holding
structures within the street, sidewalk or any public area or right-of-way
nor shall it commence any work requiring the opening of the ground in
any street, sidewalk, public area or right-of-way without the written
consent of the City Engineer, which shall not be unreasonably withheld.
D. The franchisee shall, at its sole cost and expense, remove and relocate
any of its poles or wire-holding structures when, in the opinion of the
City Engineer, whose opinion shall be reasonable, said poles or wireholding
structures pose a danger to public safety.
E. With respect to any cables, wires and other like facilities constructed
and installed by the franchisee above ground, the franchisee shall, at its
sole expense, reconstruct and reinstall such cable, wires or other
facilities underground pursuant to any project under which the cables,
wires or other like facilities of similar utilities are placed underground
within an area. The duty of the franchisee to place its existing cables,
wires and other facilities underground shall arise only if all like
facilities of utilities which exist above ground are placed underground.
§ A265-6 GENERAL PROVISIONS § A265-7
1:1685
F. In all areas of the City where the cables, wires and other like facilities of
a public utility or public utility district are placed underground, the
franchisee shall construct, install and maintain cables, wires and other
facilities underground. Amplifier boxes and pedestal-mounted terminal
boxes may be placed above ground if existing technology reasonably
requires, but shall be of such size and design and shall be located in a
manner that is not unsightly or unsafe.
G. In case of disturbance of any street, sidewalk, alley, public way or paved
area caused by the franchisee, the franchisee shall, at its own cost and
expense and in a manner approved by the City Engineer, replace and
restore such street, sidewalk, alley, public way or paved area to at least
as good a condition as before the work involving such disturbance was
done.
H. The franchisee shall have the authority, upon receiving the approval of
the City Engineer, on either an ongoing or case-by-case basis, at the
discretion of the City Engineer, to trim trees upon overhanging streets,
alleys, sidewalks and public ways and places of the City so as to prevent
the branches of such trees from coming in contact with the wires and
cables of the franchisee. The City Engineer may impose reasonable
restrictions concerning the method, timing and amount of such
trimming. Should the City Engineer or the Police Department
determine that any proposed tree trimming may or will unduly interfere
with traffic, the franchisee, after negotiation with the applicable City
department, shall pay the cost of providing a police or traffic control
officer to direct traffic during the tree trimming. Unless otherwise
determined by the City Engineer or the Police Department, the
franchisee may, within the limits of law, provide its own private traffic
control.
I. The franchisee shall, at the request of any person holding a building
permit, building moving permit or demolition permit issued by the City,
temporarily raise or lower or relocate its wires to permit the activity
authorized by the permit. The expense of such raising, lowering or
relocating shall be paid by the person requesting such action, unless
the request is made by the City and relates to a project to be paid for
with public funds of or by the City of Atlantic City. The franchisee's
obligations under this subsection, however, shall not be proportionally
greater than any other utility or pole occupier required to temporarily
remove or relocate any poles, wires, cables, underground conduits,
manholes or similar facilities. The franchisee shall be entitled to at least
10 days' notice to arrange for such changes and shall have the authority
to require payment in advance.
J. In the event that the City elects to alter, repair, realign, abandon,
improve, vacate, reroute or change the grade of any street or to
replace, repair, install, maintain or otherwise alter any aboveground or
underground cable, wire conduit, pipe, line, pole, withholding
structure, structure or other facility utilized for the provision of utility
or other services or transportation of drainage, sewage or other liquids,

wires, cables, underground conduits, manholes and any other facilities
which it has installed or which it maintains. The franchisee's obligations
under this subsection, however, shall not be proportionally greater than
any other public utility or pole occupier required to temporarily remove
or relocate any poles, wires, cable, underground conduits, manholes or
similar facilities.
K. The franchisee shall, at its sole cost and expense, remove and relocate
any poles or wire-holding structures owned and maintained by it when,

the operation or location of any future streets or public places or pose a
danger to public safety.
A. The franchisee shall at all times maintain a comprehensive general
liability insurance policy with a single limit amount of $1,000,000
covering liability for any and all claims, causes of actions and
judgments arising out of or related to its construction, maintenance and
operation of the cable television system or arising out of or relating to
its failure or alleged failure to comply with the provisions of any law
applicable to the franchisee in its business. The franchisee represents,
however, that it maintains a liability policy for an amount in excess of
the single limit policy referenced above. The City shall be named as an
additional insured on said single limit policy, and proof of coverage shall
be submitted to the City Risk Manager on at least a yearly basis.
B. The franchisee shall hold the City, its employees, officers, agents and
officials harmless and indemnify them for any and all damages,
penalties and expenses (including attorneys' fees) which any of them

harmless. The City's failure to timely notify the franchisee shall not
excuse the franchisee from its obligation to hold harmless and

To secure its faithful performance of its obligations under a renewal of the

affecting construction or operation of the cable television system or services
provided through the system shall, upon request, be filed with the City
Clerk; provided, however, that this section shall not affect the franchisee's
indemnify unless the delay has materially prejudiced the franchisee,
and then only to the extent of such material prejudice.

held harmless from participating in the defense of any litigation by their
counsel, but in no event shall franchisee be obligated to pay counsel
fees for any single claim in addition to those required by this § A265-9
once the defense has been tendered. Such participation shall not
relieve the franchisee from its duty of defense against liability or of
paying any judgment entered against such party. The parties

counsel in defending any such action.

portions of this section as are affected thereby shall be deemed to have
expired and the City and the franchisee shall enter into negotiations
concerning matters which are so affected to the extent permitted by
