of persons in custody, to search all persons in the presence of some other person, whenever

everything found upon the person of such prisoners, all according to law. All personal effects so
taken from prisoners aforementioned shall be restored to them upon their release. Suitable

who shall lose or destroy the same shall be required to pay the replacement costs, and in the event

the Police Chief. The City Council may from time to time provide the municipal police with
such uniforms, equipment, and transportation as may be essential in the performance of their
official duties. (Neb. RS 17-118 and 17-124) Penalty, see § 10.99

BOARDS AND COMMISSIONS
§ 32.001 PLANNING COMMISSION.
(A) The Planning Commission shall consist of nine regular members who shall represent,
insofar as is possible, the different professions or occupations in the municipality and shall be appointed
by the Mayor, by and with the approval of a majority vote of the members elected to the
City Council. Two of the regular members may be residents of the area over which the
municipality is authorized to exercise extraterritorial zoning and subdivision regulation. When
there is a sufficient number of residents in the area over which the municipality exercises
extraterritorial zoning and subdivision regulation, one regular member of the Commission shall
be a resident from that area. If it is determined by the City Council that a sufficient number of
residents reside in the area subject to extraterritorial zoning and subdivision regulation, and no
such resident is a regular member of the Commission, the first available vacancy on the
Commission shall be filled by the appointment of such an individual. For purposes of this section,
a sufficient number of residents shall mean 500 residents. The term of each regular member shall
be three years, except that three regular members of the first Commission shall serve for terms of
one year, three for terms of two years, and three for terms of three years. All regular members
shall hold office until their successors are appointed. Any member may, after a public hearing
before the City Council, be removed by the Mayor, with the consent of a majority vote of the
members elected to the City Council, for inefficiency, neglect of duty, or malfeasance in office,
or other good and sufficient cause. Vacancies occurring otherwise than through the expiration of
term shall be filled for the unexpired portion of the term by the Mayor.
(B) All regular members of the Commission shall serve without compensation and shall hold
no other municipal office except when appointed to serve on the Board of Adjustment as provided
in Neb. RS 19-908. All members of the Commission may be required, in the discretion of
the City Council, to give bond in a sum set by resolution of the Council, and conditioned upon
the faithful performance of their duties. The Commission shall elect its chairperson and a secretary
from its members and create and fill such other of its offices as it may determine. The term
of the chairperson and the secretary shall be one year, and they shall be eligible for reelection. No
member of the Commission shall serve in the capacity of both the chairperson and secretary of
the Commission. It shall be the duty of the secretary to keep the full and correct minutes and
records of all meetings and to file the same with the Municipal Clerk where they shall be
available for public inspection during office hours. The Commission shall be funded by the City
Council from time to time out of the general fund. The expenditures of the Commission,
exclusive of gifts, shall be within the amounts appropriated for that purpose by the City Council;
and no expenditures nor agreements for expenditures shall be valid in excess of those amounts. A
number of Commissioners equal to a majority of the number of regular members appointed to the
Com- mission shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of any business. The Commission
shall hold at least one regular meeting in each calendar quarter, except the City Council may
require the Commission to meet more frequently and the chairperson of the Commission may call
for a meeting when necessary to deal with business pending before the Commission. Special
meetings may also be held upon the call of any 3 members of the Commission. The
Commission shall adopt rules and regulations for the transaction of business and shall keep a
record of its resolutions, transactions, findings, and determinations, which shall be a public
record. The Commission shall make and adopt plans for the physical development of the
municipality, including any areas outside its boundaries which, in the Commission's judgment,
bear relation to the planning of the municipality, and shall carry out the other duties and exercise
the powers specified in Neb. RS 19-929. All actions by the Commission shall be subject to the
review and supervision of the Mayor and City Council. The Commission shall make its
recommendations to the City Council so that they are received by the City Council within 60
days after the Commission begins consideration of a matter relating to the comprehensive
development plan, capital improvements, building codes, subdivision development, the
annexation of territory, or zoning. The Commission shall be responsible for making those
reports and performing those other duties as the City Council may, from time to time, designate.
(Am. Ord. 2594, 6-21-94; 2631, 2-21-95)
§ 32.002 BOARD OF ADJUSTMENT.
(A) The Mayor shall appoint, with the consent of the City Council, a Board of Adjustment
which shall consist of 5 regular members plus one additional member designated as an alternate
who shall attend and serve only when one of the regular members is unable to attend for any reason.
Each member shall be appointed for a term of 3 years and shall be removable for cause by
the Mayor and City Council upon written charges and after public hearings. Vacancies shall be
filled for the unexpired term of any member whose term becomes vacant. One member only of
the Board of Adjustment shall be appointed from the membership of the Planning Commission,
and the loss of membership on the Planning Commission by that member shall also result in his
or her immediate loss of membership on the Board of Adjustment and the appointment of another
Planning Commissioner to the Board of Adjustment. If the Board does not include a member
who resides in the extraterritorial zoning jurisdiction of the City, the first vacancy occurring on
the Board of Adjustment after the effective date of this section shall be filled by the appointment
of a person who resides in the extraterritorial zoning jurisdiction of the City at such time as more
than 200 persons reside within that area. Thereafter, at all times, at least one member of the
Board of Adjustment shall reside outside the corporate boundaries of the City but within its
extraterritorial zoning jurisdiction. Neither the Mayor nor any member of the City Council shall
serve as a member of the Board of Adjustment. (Neb. RS 19-908)
(B) The members of the Board shall serve without compensation and may be required, in
the discretion of the City Council, to give a bond in a sum set by resolution of the City Council,
and conditioned upon the faithful performance of their duties. The Board shall organize at its
first meeting each year after the City Council meeting when appointments are regularly made
and elect from its membership a chairperson and secretary. No member of the Board of Adjustment
shall serve in the capacity of both chairperson and secretary of the Board.
(C) The Board shall adopt rules in accordance with the provisions of Neb. RS 19-901
through 19-914. Meetings of the Board shall be held at the call of the chairperson and at such
other times as the Board may determine. Special meetings may be also held upon the call of any
3 members of the Board. A majority of the Board shall constitute a quorum for the purpose of
doing business. The chairperson, or in his or her absence the acting chairperson, may administer
oaths and compel the attendance of witnesses. All meetings of the Board shall be open to the
public. It shall be the duty of the secretary to keep complete and accurate minutes of all Board
meetings, showing the vote of each member upon each question, or, if absent or failing to vote,
indicating that fact, and to keep records of the Board's examinations and other official actions, all
of which shall be immediately filed in the office of the Board and shall be public record. The
Board shall be responsible for making those reports and performing those other duties as the
Mayor and City Council may designate. (Neb. RS 19-908)
(D) Appeals to the Board may be taken by any person aggrieved or by any officer, department,
board, or bureau of the City affected by any decision of the administrative officer. This
appeal shall be taken within a reasonable time, as provided by the rules of the Board, by filing
with the officer from whom the appeal is taken and with the Board a notice of appeal specifying
the grounds thereof. The officer from whom the appeal is taken shall forthwith transmit to the
Board all the papers constituting the record upon which the action appealed from was taken. An
appeal stays all proceedings in furtherance of the action appealed from, unless the officer from
whom the appeal is taken certifies to the Board, after the notice of appeal shall have been filed
with him or her, that by reason of facts stated in the certificate a stay would, in his or her opinion,
cause imminent peril to life or property. In that case, proceedings shall not be stayed otherwise
than by a restraining order which may be granted by the Board or by a court of record on
application on notice to the officer from whom the appeal is taken and on due cause shown. The
Board shall fix a reasonable time for the hearing of the appeal, give public notice thereof, as well
as due notice to the parties in interest, and decide the same within a reasonable time. Upon the
hearing, any party may appear in person or by agent or by attorney. (Neb. RS 19-909)
(E) The board of adjustment shall, subject to such appropriate conditions and safeguards as
may be established by the City Council, have only the following powers: (1) To hear and decide
appeals when it is alleged there is error in any order, requirement, decision, or determination made
by an administrative official or agency based on or made in the enforcement of any zoning
regulation or any regulation relating to the location or soundness of structures, except that the
authority to hear and decide appeals shall not apply to decisions made under subsection (3) of
section Neb. Rev. Stat. 19-929; (2) to hear and decide, in accordance with the provisions of any
zoning regulation, requests for interpretation of any map; and (3) when by reason of exceptional
narrowness, shallowness, or shape of a specific piece of property at the time of the enactment of the
zoning regulations, or by reason of exceptional topographic conditions or other extraordinary and
exceptional situation or condition of such piece of property, the strict application of any enacted
regulation under Neb. Rev. Stat. 19-910 and sections 19-901, 19-903 to 19-904.01, and 19-908
would result in peculiar and exceptional practical difficulties to or exceptional and undue hardships
upon the owner of such property, to authorize, upon an appeal relating to the property, a variance
from such strict application so as to relieve such difficulties or hardship, if such relief may be
granted without substantial detriment to the public good and without substantially impairing the
intent and purpose of any ordinance or resolution.
(F) No such variance shall be authorized by the board unless it finds that: (1) The strict
application of the zoning regulation would produce undue hardship; (2) such hardship is not shared
generally by other properties in the same zoning district and the same vicinity; (3) the authorization
of such variance will not be of substantial detriment to adjacent property and the character of the
district will not be changed by the granting of the variance; and (4) the granting of such variance is
based upon reason of demonstrable and exceptional hardship as distinguished from variations for
purposes of convenience, profit, or caprice. No variance shall be authorized unless the board finds
that the condition or situation of the property concerned or the intended use of the property is not of
so general or recurring a nature as to make reasonably practicable the formulation of a general
regulation to be adopted as an amendment to the zoning regulations.
(G) In exercising the powers granted in this section, the board may, in conformity with Neb.
Rev. Stat. 19-901 to 19-915, reverse or affirm, wholly or partly, or may modify the order,
requirement, decision, or determination appealed from, and may make such order, requirement,
decision, or determination as ought to be made, and to that end shall have all the powers of the
officer from whom the appeal is taken. The concurring vote of four members of the board shall be
necessary to reverse any order, requirement, decision, or determination of any such administrative

or building codes and ordinances; (5) a site plan of the area; and (6) a statement as to the kind
and number of additional public facilities or utilities which will be required to support the new
land uses in the area after redevelopment. Any redevelopment plan may include a proposal for
the designation of an enhanced employment area.
(R) Redevelopment Plan Consideration by Planning Commission. Prior to recommending a
redevelopment plan to the City Council for approval, the Authority shall submit such plan to the
Planning Commission for review and recommendations as to its conformity with the Comprehensive
Plan for the development of the City as a whole. The Planning Commission shall submit
its written recommendations with respect to the proposed redevelopment plan to the Authority
within 30 days after receipt of the plan for review. Upon receipt of the recommendations of the
Planning Commission or, if no recommendations are received within such 30-day period, then
without such recommendations, the Authority may recommend the redevelopment plan to the
City Council for approval.
(S) Redevelopment Plan Consideration; Cost-Benefit Analysis.
(1) Prior to recommending a redevelopment plan to the City Council for approval, the
Authority shall consider whether the proposed land uses and building requirements in the redevelopment
project area are designed with the general purpose of accomplishing, in conformance
with the Comprehensive Plan, a coordinated, adjusted, and harmonious development of the City
and its environs which will, in accordance with present and future needs, promote health, safety,
morals, order, convenience, prosperity, and the general welfare, as well as efficiency and economy
in the process of development, including, among other things, adequate provision for traffic,
vehicular parking, the promotion of safety from fire, panic, and other dangers, adequate provision
for light and air, the promotion of the healthful and convenient distribution of population,
the provision of adequate transportation, water, sewerage, and other public utilities, schools,
parks, recreational and community facilities, and other public requirements, the promotion of
sound design and arrangement, the wise and efficient expenditure of public funds, and the prevention
of the recurrence of unsanitary or unsafe dwelling accommodations or conditions of
blight.
(2) The Authority shall conduct a cost-benefit analysis for each redevelopment project
whose redevelopment plan includes the use of funds authorized by Neb. Rev. Stat. §18-2147. In
conducting the cost-benefit analysis, the Authority shall use a cost-benefit model developed for
use by local projects. Any cost-benefit model used by the Authority shall consider and analyze
the following factors: (a) tax shifts resulting from the approval of the use of funds pursuant to
Neb. Rev. Stat. §18-2147; (b) public infrastructure and community public service needs impacts
and local tax impacts arising from the approval of the redevelopment project; (c) impacts on employers
and employees of firms locating or expanding within the boundaries of the area of the
redevelopment project; (d) impacts on other employers and employees within the City and the
immediate areas that are located outside of the boundaries of the area of the redevelopment
project; and (e) any other impacts determined by the Authority to be relevant to the consideration
of costs and benefits arising from the redevelopment project.
(T) Recommendation of Redevelopment Plan to City Council. The recommendation of a redevelopment
plan by the Authority to the City Council shall be accompanied by the recommendations,
if any, of the Planning Commission concerning the redevelopment plan; a statement of
the proposed method and estimated cost of the acquisition and preparation for redevelopment of
the redevelopment project area and the estimated proceeds or revenue from its disposal to redevelopers;
a statement of the proposed method of financing the redevelopment project; and a
statement of a feasible method proposed for the relocation of families to be displaced from the
redevelopment project area.
(U) City Council Rejection of Redevelopment Plan; Modifications to Redevelopment Plan.
A redevelopment plan which has not been approved by the City Council when recommended by
the Authority may again be recommended to the City Council with any modifications deemed
advisable. A redevelopment plan may be modified at any time by the Authority, provided that, if
modified after the lease or sale of real property in the redevelopment project area, the modification
must be consented to by the redeveloper or redevelopers of such real property or their successor
or successors in interest affected by the proposed modification. Where the proposed modification
will substantially change the redevelopment plan as previously approved by the City
Council, the modification must similarly be approved by the Council.
(V) Sale, Transfer, or Lease of Real Estate. The Authority may sell, lease for a term not exceeding
99 years, exchange, or otherwise transfer real property or any interest therein in a redevelopment
project area to any redeveloper for residential, recreational, commercial, industrial, or
other uses, including parking or other facilities functionally related or subordinate to such uses,
or for public use in accordance with the redevelopment plan, subject to such covenants, conditions,
and restrictions as it may deem to be in the public interest or to carry out the purposes of
the Community Development Law. Such real property shall be sold, leased, or transferred at its
fair value for uses in accordance with the redevelopment plan. In determining the fair value of
real property for uses in accordance with the redevelopment plan, the Authority shall take into
account and give consideration to the uses and purposes required by such plan; the restrictions
upon and the covenants, conditions and obligations assumed by the redeveloper of such property;
the objectives of the redevelopment plan for the prevention of the recurrence of substandard and
blighted areas; and such other matters as the Authority shall specify as being appropriate. In fixing
rentals and selling prices, the Authority shall give consideration to appraisals of the property
for such uses made by land experts employed by the Authority.
(W) Redevelopment Contracts.
(1) The Authority shall, by public notice by publication once each week for two consecutive
weeks in a legal newspaper having a general circulation in the City, prior to the consideration
of any redevelopment contract proposal relating to real estate owned or to be owned by
the Authority, invite proposals from, and make available all pertinent information to, private redevelopers
or any persons interested in undertaking the redevelopment of an area or any part thereof
which the City Council has declared to be in need of redevelopment. Such notice shall identify
the area and shall state that such further information as is available may be obtained at the
office of the Authority. The Authority shall consider all redevelopment proposals and the financial
and legal ability of the prospective redevelopers to carry out their proposals and may negotiate
with any redevelopers for proposals for the purchase or lease of any real property in the redevelopment
project area. The Authority may accept any such redevelopment contract proposal
as it deems to be in the public interest and in furtherance of the purposes of the Community Development
Law if the Authority has, not less than 30 days prior thereto, notified the City Council
in writing of its intention to accept such redevelopment contract proposal. Thereafter, the Authority
may execute such redevelopment contract in accordance with the provisions of Neb. Rev.
Stat. §18-2118 and deliver deeds, leases, and other instruments and take all steps necessary to
effectuate such redevelopment contract. In its discretion, the Authority may, without regard to
the foregoing provisions of this section, dispose of real property in a redevelopment project area
to private redevelopers for redevelopment under such reasonable competitive bidding procedures
as it shall prescribe, subject to the provisions of Neb. Rev. Stat. §18-2118.
(2) In the case of any real estate owned by a redeveloper, the Authority may enter into a
redevelopment contract providing for such undertakings as the Authority shall determine appropriate.
Any such redevelopment contract relating to real estate within an enhanced employment
area shall include a statement of the redeveloper's consent with respect to the designation of the
area as an enhanced employment area, shall be recorded with respect to the real estate owned by
the redeveloper, and shall be binding upon all future owners of such real estate.
(X) Conveyance of Project Property For Public Use. In carrying out a redevelopment
project, the Authority may: (1) Convey to the City such real property as, in accordance with the
redevelopment plan, is to be laid out into streets, alleys, and public ways; (2) grant servitudes,
easements, and rights-of-way for public utilities, sewers, streets, and other similar facilities in
accordance with the redevelopment plan; and (3) convey to the City, County, or other appropriate
public body, such real property as, in accordance with the redevelopment plan, is to be used
for parks, schools, public buildings, facilities, or other public purposes.
(Y) Temporary Operation of Real Property. The Authority may temporarily operate and
maintain real property in a redevelopment project area pending the disposition of the property for
redevelopment without regard to the provisions of Neb. Rev. Stat. §§18-2118 and 18-2119 for
such uses and purposes as may be deemed desirable even though not in conformity with the redevelopment
plan.
(Z) Eminent Domain.
(1) The Authority shall have the right to acquire by the exercise of the power of eminent
domain any real property which it may deem necessary for a redevelopment project or for its
purposes under the provisions of the Community Development Law after the adoption by it of a
resolution declaring that the acquisition of the real property described therein is necessary for
such purposes. The procedure to condemn property shall be exercised in the manner set forth in
Neb. Rev. Stat. §§76-704 to 76-724.
(2) When the Authority has found and determined by resolution that certain real property
described therein is necessary for a redevelopment project or for its purposes under the provisions
of the Community Development Law, the resolution shall be conclusive evidence that the
acquisition of such real property is necessary for the purposes described therein.
(AA) Acquisition of Undeveloped Vacant Land. Upon a determination by resolution of the
City Council that the acquisition and development of undeveloped vacant land not within a substandard
or blighted area is essential to the proper clearance or redevelopment of substandard or
blighted areas or a necessary part of the general community redevelopment program of the City,
that the acquisition and development of land outside the City but within a radius of three miles
thereof is necessary or convenient to the proper clearance or redevelopment of one or more substandard
or blighted areas within the City, or is a necessary adjunct to the general community redevelopment
program of the City, the acquisition, planning, and preparation for development or
disposal of such land shall constitute a redevelopment project which may be undertaken by the
Authority in the manner provided in the foregoing sections.
(BB) Issuance of Bonds. The Authority shall have power to issue bonds from time to time
in its discretion for any of its corporate purposes, including the payment of principal and interest
upon any advances for surveys and plans for redevelopment projects. The Authority shall also
have power to issue refunding bonds for the purpose of paying, retiring, or otherwise refinancing,
or in exchange for any or all of the principal or interest upon bonds previously issued by it.
The Authority may issue such types of bonds as it may determine, including, without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, bonds on which the principal and interest are payable: (1) exclusively
from the income, proceeds, and revenue of the redevelopment project financed with proceeds
of such bonds; (2) exclusively from the income, proceeds, and revenue of any of its redevelopment
projects, whether or not they are financed in whole or in part with the proceeds of such
bonds; (3) exclusively from its revenue and income, including such tax revenue or receipts as
may be herein authorized, including those which may be pledged under Neb. Rev. Stat. §18-
2150, and from such grants and loans as may be received; or (4) from all or part of the income,
proceeds and revenue enumerated in subdivisions (1), (2), and (3) of this section, provided that
any such bonds may be additionally secured by a pledge of any loan, grant, or contributions or
parts thereof from the federal government or other source or a mortgage of any redevelopment
project or projects of the Authority, and that the Authority shall not have the power to pledge the
credit or taxing power of the State or any political subdivision thereof, except such tax receipts
as may be authorized under this section or pledged under Neb. Rev. Stat. §18-2150 or to place
any lien or encumbrance on any property owned by the state, county, or city used by the Authority.
(CC) Bonds; Liability; Exempt from Taxation; Anticipation Notes; Renewal Notes; Terms.
(1) Neither the members of the Authority nor any person executing the bonds shall be
liable personally on the bonds by reason of the issuance thereof. The bonds and other obligations
of the Authority, and such bonds and obligations shall so state on their face, shall not be a debt of
the City and the City shall not be liable on such bonds, except to the extent authorized by Neb.
Rev. Stat. §18-2147 to 18-2150, nor in any event shall such bonds or obligations be payable out
of any funds or properties other than those of the Authority acquired for the purposes of Neb.
Rev. Stat. §§18-2101 to 2144, except to the extent authorized by Neb. Rev. Stat. §§18-2147 to
2150. Except to the extent otherwise authorized, the bonds shall not constitute indebtedness
within the meaning of any constitutional or statutory debt limitation or restriction. Bonds of the
Authority are declared to be issued for an essential public and governmental purpose and to be
public instrumentalities and, together with interest thereon and income therefrom, shall be exempt
from all taxes. All bonds shall be general obligations of the issuing Authority and shall be
payable out of any revenue, income, receipts, proceeds, or other money of the Authority, except
as may be otherwise provided in the instruments themselves.
(2) The Authority shall have power from time to time to issue bond anticipation notes,
referred to as notes herein, and from time to time to issue renewal notes, such notes in any case
to mature not later than 30 months from the date of incurring the indebtedness represented thereby
in an amount not exceeding in the aggregate at any time outstanding the amount of bonds then
or theretofore authorized. Payment of such notes shall be made from any money or revenue
which the Authority may have available for such purpose or from the proceeds of the sale of
bonds of the Authority or such notes may be exchanged for a like amount of such bonds. The
Authority may pledge such money or revenue of the Authority, subject to prior pledges thereof,
if any, for the payment of such notes and may in addition secure the notes in the same manner as
herein provided for bonds. All notes shall be issued and sold in the same manner as bonds. The
Authority shall have power to (a) make contracts for the future sale from time to time of notes on
terms and conditions stated in such contracts and (b) pay such consideration as it shall deem
proper for any commitments to purchase notes and bonds in the future. Such notes shall also be
collaterally secured by pledges and deposits with a bank or trust company, in trust for the payment
of such notes, of bonds in an aggregate amount at least equal to the amount of such notes
and, in any event, in an amount deemed by the issuing Authority sufficient to provide for the
payment of the notes in full at the maturity thereof. The Authority may provide in the collateral
agreement that the notes may be exchanged for bonds held as collateral security for the notes or
that the trustee may sell the bonds if the notes are not otherwise paid at maturity and apply the
proceeds of such sale to the payment of the notes. Such notes shall bear interest at a rate set by
the Authority and shall be sold at such price as shall cause an interest cost thereon not to exceed
such rate.
(3) It is the intention hereof that any pledge of revenue, income, receipts, proceeds, or
other money made by the Authority for the payment of bonds or notes shall be valid and binding
from the time such pledge is made; that the revenue, income, receipts, proceeds, and other money
so pledged and thereafter received by the Authority shall immediately be subject to the lien of
such pledge without the physical delivery thereof or further act, and that the lien of any such
pledge shall be valid and binding as against all parties having claims of any kind in tort, contract,
or otherwise against the Authority irrespective of whether such parties have notice thereof. Neither
the resolution nor any other instrument by which a pledge is created need be recorded.
(DD) Terms of Bonds. Bonds of the Authority shall be authorized by its resolution and may
be issued in one or more series and shall bear such date or dates, be payable upon demand or mature
at such time or times, bear interest at such rate or rates, be in such denomination or denominations,
be in such form either coupon or registered, carry such conversion or registration privileges,
have such rank or priority, be executed in such manner, be payable in such medium of
payment, at such place or places, and be subject to such terms of redemption, with or without
premium, as such resolution, its trust indenture or mortgage may provide.
(EE) Sale of Bonds. The bonds may be sold by the Authority in such manner and for such
price as the body may determine, at par or above par, at private sale or at public sale after notice
published prior to such sale in a legal newspaper having general circulation in the City or in such
other medium of publication as the Authority may deem appropriate, or may be exchanged by
the Authority for other bonds issued by it under Neb. Rev. Stat. §§18-2101 to 18-2144 and 18-
2147 to 18-2151. Bonds which are issued under this section may be sold by the Authority to the
federal government at private sale at par or above par and, in the event that less than all of the
authorized principal amount of such bonds is sold by the Authority to the federal government,
the balance or any portion of the balance may be sold by the Authority at private sale at par or
above par.
(FF) Validity of Signatures on Bonds. In case any of the members or officers of the Authority
whose signatures appear on any bonds or coupons shall cease to be such members or officers
before the delivery of such bonds, such signatures shall nevertheless be valid and sufficient for
all purposes the same as if such members or officers had remained in office until such delivery.
Any provision of any law to the contrary notwithstanding, any bonds issued pursuant to the provisions
of Neb. Rev. Stat. §18-2124 shall be fully negotiable.
(GG) Authority and Powers Regarding Bonds. In connection with the issuance of bonds or
the incurring of obligations under leases and in order to secure the payment of such bonds or obligations,
the Authority, in addition to its other powers, shall have power:
(1) To pledge all or any part of its gross or net rents, fees, or revenue to which its right
then exists or may thereafter come into existence;
(2) To mortgage all or any part of its real or personal property then owned or thereafter
acquired;
(3) To covenant against pledging all or any part of its rents, fees, and revenue or against
mortgaging all or any part of its real or personal property to which its right or title then exists or
may thereafter come into existence, or against permitting or suffering any lien on such revenue
or property; to covenant with respect to limitations on its right to sell, lease, or otherwise dispose
of any redevelopment project or any part thereof; and to covenant as to what other or additional
debts or obligations may be incurred by it;
(4) To covenant as to the bonds to be issued and as to the issuance of such bonds in escrow
or otherwise and as to the use and disposition of the proceeds thereof; to provide for the
replacement of lost, destroyed, or mutilated bonds; to covenant against extending the time for the
payment of its bonds or interest thereon; and to covenant for the redemption of the bonds and to
provide the terms and conditions thereof;
(5) To covenant, subject to the limitations contained in the Community Development
Law, as to the amount of revenue to be raised each year or other period of time by rents, fees,
and other revenue and as to the use and disposition to be made thereof; to establish or to authorize
the establishment of special funds for money held for operating costs, debt service, reserves,
or other purposes and to covenant as to the use and disposition of the money held in such funds;
(6) To prescribe the procedure, if any, by which the terms of any contract with bondholders
may be amended or abrogated, the amount of bonds the holders of which must consent
thereto and the manner in which such consent may be given;
(7) To covenant as to the use, maintenance, and replacement of any or all of its real or
personal property, the insurance to be carried thereon, and the use and disposition of insurance
money and to warrant its title to such property;
(8) To covenant as to the rights, liabilities, powers, and duties arising upon the breach
by it of any covenants, conditions, or obligations; and to covenant and prescribe as to events of
default and terms and conditions upon which any or all of its bonds or obligations shall become
or may be declared due before maturity and as to the terms and conditions upon which such declaration
and its consequences may be waived;
(9) To vest in any obligees of the Authority the right to enforce the payment of the
bonds or any covenants securing or relating to the bonds; to vest in any obligee or obligees holding
a specified amount in bonds the right, in the event of a default by the Authority, to take possession
of and use, operate, and manage any redevelopment project or any part thereof, title to
which is in the Authority, or any funds connected therewith, and to collect the rents and revenue
arising therefrom and to dispose of such money in accordance with the agreement of the Authority
with such obligees; to provide for the powers and duties of such obligees and to limit the liabilities
thereof; and to provide the terms and conditions upon which such obligees may enforce
any covenant or rights securing or relating to the bonds;
(10) To pledge all of the revenue from any occupation tax received or to be received
with respect to any enhanced employment area; and
(11) To exercise all or any part or combination of the powers herein granted; to make
such covenants, other than and in addition to the covenants herein expressly authorized, and to
do any and all such acts and things as may be necessary or convenient or desirable in order to
secure its bonds or, in the absolute discretion of the Authority, as will tend to make the bonds
more marketable notwithstanding that such covenants, acts, or things may not be enumerated
herein.
(HH) Default on Bonds. The Authority will have power by its resolution, trust indenture,
mortgage, lease, or other contract to confer upon any obligee holding or representing a specified
amount in bonds the right, in addition to all rights that may otherwise be conferred, upon the
happening of an event of default as defined in such resolution or instruments, by suit, action, or
proceeding in any court of competent jurisdiction: (1) to cause possession of any redevelopment
project or any part thereof, title to which is in the Authority, to be surrendered to any such obligee;
(2) to obtain the appointment of a receiver of any redevelopment project of said Authority or
any part thereof, title to which is in the Authority, and of the rents and profits therefrom. If such
receiver be appointed, he or she may enter and take possession of, carry out, operate, and maintain
such project or any part thereof; collect and receive all fees, rents, revenue, or other charges
thereafter arising therefrom and shall keep such money in a separate account or accounts, applying
the same in accordance with the obligations of said Authority as the court shall direct; and
(3) to require the Authority and the members, officers, agents, and employees thereof to account
as if it and they were the trustees of an express trust.
(II) Federal Government; Contract for Financial Assistance. In any contract for financial
assistance with the federal government, the Authority may obligate itself, which obligation shall
be specifically enforceable and shall not constitute a mortgage notwithstanding any other laws, to
convey to the federal government possession of or title to the redevelopment project and land
therein to which such contract relates which is owned by the Authority, upon the occurrence of a
substantial default, as defined in such contract, with respect to the covenants or conditions to
which the Authority is subject. Such contract may further provide that in case of such conveyance,
the federal government may complete, operate, manage, lease, convey, or otherwise
deal with the redevelopment project in accordance with the terms of such contract; provided, the
contract requires that, as soon as practicable after the federal government is satisfied that all defaults
with respect to the redevelopment project have been cured and that the redevelopment
project will thereafter be operated in accordance with the terms of the contract, the federal government
shall reconvey to the Authority the redevelopment project as then constituted.
(JJ) Property Exempt from Execution. All property including the Authority’s funds shall be
exempt from levy and sale by virtue of an execution, and no execution or other judicial process
shall issue against the same nor shall judgment against the Authority be a charge or lien upon its
property; provided, the provisions of this section shall not apply to or limit the right of obligees
to fore-close or otherwise enforce any mortgage of the Authority or the right of obligees to pursue
any remedies for the enforcement of any pledge or lien given by the Authority on its rents,
fees, grants, or revenue.
(KK) Authority Property Exempt from Taxation; Payment in Lieu of Taxes. The property of
the Authority is declared to be public property used for essential public and governmental purposes
and shall be exempt from all taxes. Whenever the Authority shall purchase or acquire real
property pursuant to Neb. Rev. Stat. §§18-2101 to 18-2144, it shall annually, so long as it shall
continue to own such property, pay out of its revenue to the State of Nebraska, county, city,
township, school district or other taxing subdivision in which such real property is located a sum,
in lieu of taxes, equal to the amount which such state, county, city, township, school district or
other taxing subdivision received from taxation from such real property during the year immediately
preceding the purchase or acquisition of such real property by the Authority. The County
Board of Equalization may, in any year subsequent to the purchase or acquisition of such property
by the Authority, determine the amount that said Authority shall pay out of its revenue to the
State of Nebraska and its several governmental subdivisions in lieu of taxes, which sum shall be
as justice and equity may require, notwithstanding the amount which the state and its governmental
subdivisions may have received from taxation during the year immediately preceding the
purchase or acquisition of such property; provided, with respect to any property in a redevelopment
project, the tax exemption provided herein shall terminate when the Authority sells, leases,
or otherwise disposes of such property to a redeveloper for redevelopment. The members of the
Authority shall not incur any personal liability by reason of the making of such payments.
(LL) City Council May Appropriate Funds to Authority. The Authority may, at such time as
it may deem necessary, file with the City Council an estimate of the amounts necessary to be
appropriated by the Council to defray the expenses of the Authority. The Council is hereby authorized
to appropriate from its general fund, in its discretion, and to place at the disposal of the Authority
an amount sufficient to assist in defraying such expenses. The City may grant funds to the
Authority for the purpose of aiding it in carrying out any of its powers and functions under the
provisions of Neb. Rev. Stat. §§18-2101 to 18-2144. To obtain funds for this purpose, the City
may levy taxes and may issue and sell its bonds. Any bonds to be issued by the City pursuant to
the provisions of this section shall be issued in the manner and within the limitations, except as
otherwise provided by Neb. Rev. Stat. §§18-2101 to 18-2144, prescribed by the laws of this state
for the issuance and authorization of bonds by the City for any public purpose.

Clerk pursuant to that approval of the City Council.
(B) The premium on any official bond required to be given may be paid out of the general
fund or other proper municipal fund, upon a resolution to that effect by the City Council at the
beginning of any municipal year. All surety and other bonds required by city ordinances or by
Nebraska law for city officials may be provided by the purchase of a blanket bond, undertaking
or equivalent insurance. The bond or insurance coverage shall be, at a minimum, an aggregate of
the amounts fixed by the law or by the City Council requiring such bond or undertaking and on
such terms and conditions as may be required. (Neb. Rev. Stat. §11-104 (2)) (Am. Ord. 2695, 10-

for his or her official records, and it shall be the duty of the Municipal Clerk to furnish a certified
copy of any bond so filed upon the payment of a fee, which shall be set by resolution of the City
Council. In the event that the sureties on the official bond of any officer of the municipality, in
the opinion of the City Council, become insufficient, the City Council may, by resolution, fix a
reasonable time within which the officer may give a new bond or additional sureties as directed.
In the event that the officer should fail, refuse, or neglect to give a new bond or additional sureties
to the satisfaction and approval of the City Council, then the office shall, by that failure, refusal,
or neglect, become vacant, and it shall be the duty of the City Council to appoint a competent
and qualified person to fill the office. Any official who is reelected to office shall be required

purpose of establishing a sinking fund for the construction, purchase, improvement, extension,

swimming pool and appurtenances thereto; municipal jail; municipal building to house equipment
or personnel of a fire department, together with firefighting equipment or apparatus; municipal
park; municipal cemetery; municipal medical clinic building, together with furnishings and
equipment; or municipal hospital. The City shall not be authorized to levy the tax or to establish
the sinking fund as provided in this section if, having bonded indebtedness, the City has been in
default in the payment of interest thereon or principal thereof for a period of ten years prior to the
date of the passage of the resolution providing for the submission of the proposition for
establishment of the sinking fund as required in Neb. Rev. Stat. 19-1303. (Neb. RS 19-1302)
(B) Before any sinking fund or funds shall be established or before any annual tax shall be

City Council shall declare its purpose by resolution to submit to the qualified electors of the
municipality at the next general municipal election the proposition to provide the improvement.
The resolution shall, among other things, set forth a clear description of the improvement
planned, the estimated cost according to the prevailing costs, the amount of the annual levy, over
a definite period of years (not exceeding 10 years) required to pay that cost, and the specific
name or designation for the sinking fund sought to be established to carry out the planned
improvement, together with a statement of the proposition for placement upon the ballot at that
election. Notice of the proposition, together with a copy of the official ballot containing the same,
shall be published in its entirety three successive weeks before the day of the election in a legal
newspaper of general circulation in the municipality. No such sinking fund shall be established
unless the same shall have been authorized by a majority or more of the legal votes of such city or
village cast for or against the proposition. If less than a majority of the legal votes favor the
establishment of the sinking fund, the planned improvement shall not be made, no annual tax
shall be levied therefor, and no sinking fund or sinking funds shall be established in connection
therewith, but such resolution of submission shall immediately be repealed. If the proposition
shall carry at such election in the manner prescribed in this section, the City Council and its
successors in office shall proceed to do all things authorized under such resolution of submission
but never inconsistent with Neb. Rev. Stat. 19-1301 to 19-1304. Provisions of the statutes of this

investments of said sinking fund or funds are made, as aforesaid, the nature and character of the
same shall be reported to the City Council, and said investment report shall be made a matter of
record by the City Clerk in the proceedings of the City Council. The sinking fund, or sinking
funds, accumulated under the provisions of Neb. Rev. Stat. 19-1301 to 19-1304, shall constitute a
special fund, or funds, for the purpose or purposes for which the same was authorized and shall

(2) For the purpose of this section, the following definition shall apply unless the context
clearly indicates or requires a different meaning.
SUBSIDIZATION. The costs of operation of a proprietary function are regularly
financed by appropriations from the municipality's general fund in excess of the amount paid by
the municipality to the proprietary function for actual service or services received. (Neb. RS 18-
2804)
(C) (1) If the municipality does not include its proprietary functions in its municipal budget
statement, a proposed proprietary statement shall be prepared in writing on forms provided by
the State Auditor and filed with the Municipal Clerk, at least 30 days prior to the start of the fiscal
year of each proprietary function, containing the following information:
(a) For the immediate 2 prior fiscal years, the revenue from all sources, the unencumbered
cash balance at the beginning and end of the year, the amount received by taxation,
and the amount of actual expenditure;
(b) For the current fiscal year, actual and estimated revenue from all sources, separately
stated as to each source, the actual unencumbered cash balance available at the beginning
of the year, the amount received from taxation, and the amount of actual and estimated expenditure,

(2) This statement shall contain the estimated cash reserve for each fiscal year and shall
note whether or not the reserve is encumbered. The cash reserve projections shall be based upon
the actual experience of prior years. (Neb. RS 18-2805)
(D) (1) After the proposed proprietary budget statement is filed with the Municipal Clerk,
the City Council shall conduct a public hearing on the statement. Notice of the time and place of
the hearing, a summary of the proposed proprietary budget statement, and notice that the full
proposed proprietary budget statement is available for public review with the Municipal Clerk
during normal business hours shall be published at least 5 days prior to the hearing in a newspaper

the City Council's jurisdiction.
(2) After the hearing, the proposed proprietary budget statement shall be adopted or
amended and adopted as amended, and a written report shall be kept of the hearing. If the

presented at the hearing, a copy of the adopted proprietary budget statement shall be filed with
the Municipal Clerk within 20 days after its adoption and published in a newspaper of general
circulation within the City Council's jurisdiction or by mailing to each resident within the City
Council's jurisdiction. (Neb. RS 18-2806)

function reconciliation statement within 90 days after the end of the fiscal year which reflects
any difference between the adopted proprietary budget statement for the previous fiscal
year and the actual expenditures and revenue for the fiscal year. After the adoption of a proprietary
function reconciliation statement, it shall be filed with the Municipal Clerk and published in
a newspaper of general circulation within the City Council's jurisdiction or by mailing to each
resident within the City Council's jurisdiction. If the difference between the adopted proprietary
budget for the previous fiscal year and the actual expenditures and revenues for the fiscal year is
greater than 10%, the proprietary function reconciliation statement shall only be adopted following
a public hearing. (Neb. RS 18-2807)
(F) Any income from a proprietary function which is transferred to the general fund of the
municipality shall be shown as a source of revenue in the municipal budget statement created
pursuant to the State Budget Act. (Neb. RS 18-2808)

LEVIES.
(A) The City Council has decided to certify to the County Clerk for collection one allpurpose

schedule of levies for specific purposes added together. Subject to the limits in Neb. RS 77-3442,
the all-purpose levy shall not exceed the annual levy specified in Neb. RS 19-1309 to be levied
upon the taxable valuation of all taxable property in the municipality. (Neb. RS 19-1309)
(B) (1) The amount of the all-purpose levy shall be certified as a single amount for general
fund purposes. (Neb. RS 19-1312)
(2) The City Council shall allocate the amount raised by the all-purpose levy to the several
departments of the municipality in its annual budget and appropriation ordinance, or in other
legal manner, as the City Council deems wisest and best. (Neb. RS 19-1310)
(B) The municipality shall be bound by its election to follow the all-purpose levy method
during the ensuing fiscal year but may abandon the method in succeeding fiscal years. (Neb. RS
19-1311)
(C) Otherwise authorized extraordinary levies to service and pay bonded indebtedness of
the municipality may be made by the municipality in addition to the all-purpose levy. (Neb. RS
19-1309)
(Am. Ord. 2752, 10-20-98)
§ 35.66 PROPERTY TAX LEVY; MAXIMUM; AUTHORITY TO EXCEED.

(C). The City may levy a maximum levy of $0.45 per $100 of taxable valuation of property

contracts approved prior to July 1, 1998, for bonded indebtedness approved according
to law and secured by a levy on property, and for payments by a public airport to retire interestfree
loans from the Department of Aeronautics in lieu of bonded indebtedness at a lower cost to
the public airport are not included in the levy limits established by this division (A). The limitations

indebtedness at a lower cost to the public airport. For off-street parking districts established under
the Offstreet Parking District Act, the tax shall be counted in the allocation by the City proportionately,
by dividing the total taxable valuation of the taxable property within the district by
the total taxable valuation of the taxable property within the City multiplied by the levy of the
district. The City Council shall review and approve or disapprove the levy request of the political
subdivisions subject to this division (B). The City Council may approve all or a portion of the

(5) Any excess levy authority approved under this division (C) shall terminate pursuant
to its terms, on a vote of the City Council to terminate the authority to levy more than the limits,
at the end of the fourth fiscal year following the first year in which the levy exceeded the limit,
or as provided in division (C) (8), whichever is earliest.
(6) The City Council may pass no more than one resolution calling for an election pursuant

County Board shall authorize a tax in excess of the limits in division (A), but the tax shall not
exceed the amount stated in the ballot question. If a majority of those voting on the ballot question

(1) To connect any instrument, device, or contrivance with any wire supplying or
intended to supply electricity or electric current or to connect any pipe or conduit supplying
water, without the knowledge and consent of the City, in such a manner that any portion thereof

through it, without the knowledge and consent of the City.
(B) Proof of the existence of any wire, pipe, or conduit connection or reconnection or of any
injury, alteration, interference, or obstruction of a meter is prima facie evidence of the guilt of
the person in possession of the premises where that connection, reconnection, injury, alteration,

(Neb. RS 28-515.02) Penalty, see § 10.99
§ 50.05 DIVERSION OF SERVICES; PENALTY.
(A) For purposes of this section, the definitions found in Neb. RS 25-21,275 shall apply.
(B) (1) The City may bring a civil action for damages against any person who commits,
authorizes, solicits, aids, abets, or attempts (a) bypassing, (b) tampering, or (c) unauthorized
metering when that act results in damages to a municipal utility. The City may bring a civil
action for damages pursuant to this section against any person receiving the benefit of utility
service through means of bypassing, tampering, or unauthorized metering.
(2) In any civil action brought pursuant to this section, the City shall be entitled, upon
proof of willful or intentional bypassing, tampering, or unauthorized metering, to recover as
damages:
(a) The amount of actual damage or loss if the amount of the damage or loss is
susceptible of reasonable calculation; or
(b) Liquidated damages of $750 if the amount of actual damage or loss is not
susceptible of reasonable calculation.
(3) In addition to damage or loss under division (B)(2)(a) or (B)(2)(b), the City may
recover all reasonable expenses and costs incurred on account of the bypassing, tampering, or
unauthorized metering, including, but not limited to, disconnection, reconnection, service calls,
equipment, costs of the suit, and reasonable attorneys' fees in cases within the scope of Neb. RS
25-1801. (Neb. RS 25-21,276)
(C) (1) There shall be a rebuttable presumption that a tenant or occupant at any premises
where bypassing, tampering, or unauthorized metering is proven to exist caused or had
knowledge of that bypassing, tampering, or unauthorized metering if the tenant or occupant:
(a) Had access to the part of the utility supply system on the premises where the
bypassing, tampering, or unauthorized metering is proven to exist; and
(b) Was responsible or partially responsible for payment, either directly or
indirectly, to the utility or to any other person for utility services to the premises.
(2) There shall be a rebuttable presumption that a customer at any premises where
bypassing, tampering, or unauthorized metering is proven to exist caused or had knowledge of
that bypassing, tampering, or unauthorized metering if the customer controlled access to the part
of the utility supply system on the premises where the bypassing, tampering, or unauthorized
metering was proven to exist. (Neb. RS 25-21,277)
(D) The remedies provided by this section shall be deemed to be supplemental and
additional to powers conferred by existing laws. The remedies provided in this section are in
addition to and not in limitation of any other civil or criminal statutory or common-law remedies.

§ 50.06 LIEN.
In addition to all other remedies, if a customer shall for any reason remain indebted to the
City for water and sewer services furnished, the amount due, together with any rents and
charges in arrears, shall be considered a delinquent utility rent which is hereby declared to be
a lien upon the real estate for which the same was furnished. The Municipal Clerk shall notify in
writing, or cause to be notified in writing, all owners of premises or their agents whenever their
tenants or lessees are 60 days or more delinquent in the payment of the utilities rent. It shall be
the duty of
the Municipal Clerk to report to the City Council a list of all unpaid accounts due for all utilities
services together with a description of the premises served. The report shall be examined and, if
approved by the City Council, shall be certified by the Municipal Clerk to the County Clerk as to
water and sewer services to be collected as a special tax in the manner provided by law. (Neb.

the work, and all expenses so incurred shall be charged to the consumer. All installations or
repairs of pipes require two inspections by the Plumbing Inspector. The first inspection shall
be made when connections or repairs are completed and before the pipes are covered. The second
inspection shall be made after the dirt work is completed and the service is restored. It is the
responsibility of the consumer or the plumbing permit holder to notify the Plumbing Inspector at
the time the work is ready for each inspection. All installation shall be done under the
supervision and strictly in accordance with the rules, regulations, and specifications prescribed
for that installation by the Board of Public Works; provided that those rules, regulations, and
specifications have been reviewed and approved by the City Council. (Neb. RS 17-537) Penalty,
see § 10.99
§ 51.20 INSTALLATION EXPENSE.
The expense of installation shall be paid by the consumer for new service. The City Council,

which shall be paid by the customers requiring new service installation at the time of the making
of the application. The City shall then make the tap. The City shall supply the meter and other
appurtenances, if any, which the City Council may deem appropriate to supply to the customer. It
shall be the duty of the customer to supply all other labor and materials from the city's main to
the place of dispersement. It shall be unlawful for any person other than an agent for the City to
tap the main. It shall be unlawful for any person other than a licensed plumber to do any work on
the municipal water system. Penalty, see § 10.99
§ 51.21 WATER MAIN EXTENSION; APPLICATION; ASSESSMENT.
Applicants for water service whose property is situated outside the corporate limits may be
allowed to connect with the city's main on such terms as the Board of Public Works shall on
application in each case prescribe. The city mains may be extended into unsupplied territory
within the corporate limits by means of water extension districts. No credit for construction cost
of water service paid for by the applicant shall hereafter be given any applicant or consumer for
any purpose. Hereafter no permit shall be granted to any person to make connections with any
water main of the City, other than a water main within a water district in which the property
proposed to be connected is situated, until the owners of that property shall have filed a written
petition for the privilege with the City Council, platting and describing the lot, part of lot,
subdivision of lot, or piece of land for which the connection and water privilege is desired and
designating the point in the water main at and with which the connection is desired, and the
Council by a 2/3 vote and with the approval of the Mayor shall have authorized the connection
and fixed the amount of money to be paid by the applicant to the Board of Public Works for this
privilege, which amount of money shall be determined in each case by the Council upon the
basis of the probable cost and special assessment to be apportioned to and assessed against the
real property described in the petition for the construction of a proper water main within a proper
water district created to include and accommodate that property, this water main to be on such
lines and levels and having that capacity and equipment as may be found necessary to conform to
the general plans and purposes of the water system of the City, and no connection with any of the
mains or pipes within the tract shall be permitted with any property outside thereof, without
further application and further action of the Council in the same manner as above described and
set out; provided, that any part of real properties extending beyond a depth of 150 feet from the
street line of the street in which the abutting water main is situated shall not be included in this
exemption but shall be subject to the operation of the foregoing assessment provisions for water
extension districts; and provided further, that water privileges extended under the foregoing
provisions shall be exercised and enjoyed on payment of the rates for water consumer and under
the same rules and regulations as are provided generally for the consumers of water furnished by
the City Council by its Water Department. Upon the payment of the amount of money as
determined by the City Council for deposit with the Municipal Clerk/Treasurer, the Clerk/
Treasurer shall issue a certificate therefor, describing the real property for the accommodation of
which the same was issued, which certificate shall thereafter be receivable at its face value by the
authorized collector of any special water district assessment which may be assessed against the
real property described therein, for the payment of the cost of constructing any water main in any
water district which may be created to include that real property; and in case the face value of the
certificate shall exceed the amount of the special tax when so determined and levied against the
property therein described, the City Council on a proper showing of the facts may allow and pay
a properly verified claim for the excess to the party entitled to receive the same. Penalty, see §
10.99
§ 51.22 REPAIRS AND MAINTENANCE.
All repairs to pipe and other appurtenances, except the water meter from the place of
dispersement to the water main shall be the responsibility of the customer. Repairs to the main
and to the meter shall be the responsibility of the City. All water meters shall be kept in repair by
the City at the expense of the City. When meters are worn out, they shall be replaced and reset
by the City at the expense of the City; provided, that if the customer permits or allows a water
meter to be damaged, injured, or destroyed through his or her own recklessness, carelessness, or
neglect so that the meter must be repaired or replaced, the Utilities Superintendent shall bill and
collect from the customer the cost of the meter repair or replacement in the same manner as
water rent is collected. Permitting a water meter to be damaged or destroyed by freezing shall
always be considered negligence on the part of the customer. All meters shall be tested at the
customer's request at the expense of the customer any reasonable number of times; provided, that
if the test shows the water meter to be running 2% or more fast, the expense of the test shall be
borne by the City. The City reserves the right to test any water service meter at any time, and if a
meter is found to be beyond repair the City shall always have the right to place a new meter on
the customer's water service fixtures at municipal expense. Should a consumer's meter fail to
register properly, the customer shall be charged for water during the time the meter is out of
repair on the basis of the monthly consumption during the same quarter of the preceding year;
provided, that if no such basis for comparison exists, the customer shall be charged an amount as
may be reasonably fixed by the Utilities Superintendent. Penalty, see § 10.99 (Am. Ord. 2970,
2/5/08)

that property into the municipal sanitary sewer system in order to determine the strength of that
sewage over that period. Usually samples shall be taken from the sewage discharge on at least
three composites during operations on the property.
(B) The Superintendent shall then determine the classification to be used for that property
and the corresponding surcharge as shown in the surcharge table under the sewer use fee
schedule. All such sampling and analyzing of the sewage discharge from a given property shall
be in accordance with the latest edition of Standard Methods for the Examination of Water and
Wastewater; provided, however, that the Superintendent may in his or her discretion accept those
sampling and analyzing results as may be submitted to him or her by the sewer user on the
property if the Superintendent reasonably determines that those results properly reflect the
overall nature of the discharge.
§ 52.54 INSPECTION; RIGHT OF ENTRY.
The Utilities Superintendent, or his or her authorized agents, shall have free access at any
reasonable time to all parts of each premises and building which is connected with the sewer

§ 52.55 LIEN.
In addition to all other remedies, if a customer shall for any reason remain indebted to the City
for sewer service furnished, the amount due, together with any rents and charges in arrears, shall
be considered a delinquent sewer rent which is hereby declared to be a lien upon the real estate
for which the same was furnished. The Municipal Clerk shall notify in writing, or cause to be
notified in writing, all owners of premises or their agents whenever their tenants or lessees are 60
days or more delinquent in the payment of sewer rent. It shall be the duty of the Utilities
Superintendent on the first day of June of each year to report to the City Council a list of all
unpaid accounts due for sewer service together with a description of the premises served. The
report shall be examined, and if approved by the City Council, shall be certified by the Municipal
Clerk to the County Clerk to be collected as a special tax in the manner provided by law. (Neb.

§ 53.20 PURPOSE.
In order to comply with §§ 201 and 210 of the Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act of
1978 and with the rules and regulations of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission
pertaining thereto, the following policies relating to interconnections of the electric system of the
City with cogeneration and small power production facilities, rates for sales of electric energy to
these facilities, and rates for purchases of electric energy from these facilities are hereby
established.
§ 53.21 DEFINITIONS.
For the purpose of this subchapter, the following definitions shall apply unless the context
clearly indicates or requires a different meaning.
AVOIDED COSTS. The incremental costs to an electric utility of electric energy or
capacity or both which, but for the purchase from qualifying facilities, the utility would generate
itself or purchase from another source.
COGENERATION FACILITY. A facility which produces electric energy and steam or
other forms of useful energy (such as heat) which are used for industrial, commercial, heating, or
cooling purposes.
INTERCONNECTION COSTS. The reasonable costs of connection, switching,
metering, transmission, distribution, safety provisions, and administrative costs incurred by the
electric utility directly related to the installation and maintenance of the physical facilities
necessary to permit interconnected operations with a qualifying facility, to the extent those, costs
are in excess of the corresponding costs which the electric utility would have incurred if it had
not engaged in interconnected operations, but instead generated an equivalent amount of electric
energy itself or, purchased an equivalent amount of electric energy or capacity from other
sources. (INTERCONNECTION COSTS do not include any costs involved in the calculation of
avoided costs.)
QUALIFYING COGENERATION FACILITY. A cogeneration facility that meets the
requirements of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission regarding ownership, fuel use, and
operating and efficiency standards.
QUALIFYING SMALL POWER PRODUCTION FACILITY. A small power
production facility that meets the requirements of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission
regarding ownership, fuel use, fuel efficiency, and reliability.
SMALL POWER PRODUCTION FACILITY. A facility which produces electric
energy solely by the use, as a primary energy source, of biomass, waste, renewable resources, or
any combination thereof totaling not greater than 80 megawatts at one site.
§ 53.22 INTERCONNECTIONS WITH QUALIFYING FACILITIES.
(A) Qualifying facilities desiring to interconnect with the electric system of the City shall
make application to the Board of Public Works for that interconnection. Applicants shall use
those forms as are prescribed by the City and shall furnish all information requested.
(B) The City shall establish reasonable standards to be met by qualifying facilities to ensure
system safety and reliability of interconnected operations. These standards may include but shall
not be limited to the following areas: power factor; voltage regulations; fault, overcurrent, and
over-under voltage protection; harmonics; synchronization; and isolation.
(C) Interconnection costs associated with the interconnection with a qualifying facility shall
be paid for by the qualifying facility. Qualifying facilities shall be required to execute contractual
agreements with the City before any interconnection is established.
Penalty, see § 10.99
§ 53.23 RATES FOR ELECTRIC ENERGY SALES TO QUALIFYING FACILITIES.
Rates for sales of electric energy to qualifying facilities shall be those current standard rates
adopted from time to time by resolution of the Mayor and City Council which apply to other
customers of the utility in the same classification(s) of electric service.
§ 53.24 RATES FOR ELECTRIC ENERGY PURCHASES FROM QUALIFYING
FACILITIES.
(A) Rates for purchases of electric energy from qualifying facilities shall be established by
resolution of the Mayor and City Council.
(B) The rates shall be just and reasonable to the electric consumer of the utility and in the
public interest, shall not discriminate against qualifying cogeneration and small power
production facilities, and shall be related to avoided costs; however, in no case is the utility
required to pay more than the avoided costs.
(C) Standard rates shall be established for purchases from qualifying facilities with a design
capacity of 100 kilowatts or less. Rates for purchases from qualifying facilities with a design
capacity over 100 kilowatts may be standard rates or may be by individual contracts, the terms of
which are fair and reasonable.

or she may prescribe for doing that work. It shall be unlawful for any person felling or removing
such trees or branches to disrupt or damage the lines without first giving proper notice and
receiving permission in writing to do so. Whenever it becomes necessary to protect the lines or
property of the electrical system, the Board of Public Works shall have the power to order cut
and removed any overhanging branches, or limbs of trees, so that the lines will be free and safe.
Penalty, see § 10.99
§ 53.39 INSPECTION; RIGHT OF ENTRY.

Any consumer has the right to request its Board of Public Works to test the meter or meters
upon the consumer's premises any reasonable number of times at the consumer's expense, and
the Board or its agents shall comply with the request, subject to those reasonable rules and
regulations as the Board may adopt. If the test shows the electric meter to be running 2% or more
off, then the expense of the test shall be borne by the City. The Board reserves the right to test
and replace any meter in use at any time. The Board shall keep all meters in proper repair and
shall replace without cost to the consumer any meter where the replacement is required as a
result of ordinary depreciation or obsolescence; provided, however, the consumer shall
reimburse the Board for any replacement necessitated by any negligence or willful act of the
consumer, his or her agents, employees, invitees, guests, or members of his or her household, or
by fire.

turned on again. Penalty, see § 10.99
§ 53.57 SERVICE DEPOSIT; DISPOSITION.
The service deposit required for electrical service shall be promptly paid upon demand by
all customers of the electrical system. From this deposit shall be deducted all delinquent
electrical charges. The service deposit shall be collected by the Utilities Superintendent and
immediately turned over to the Municipal Treasurer who shall keep these fees in a trust fund for
the customers of the electrical system. The fund shall be put out at interest separate and apart

benefited as a special assessment in the same manner as other special assessments for
improvements are levied and assessed; or
(2) recover in a civil action the costs and expenses of the work upon the lot or piece of
ground and the adjoining streets and alleys.

§ 92.40 AIR POLLUTION PROHIBITED.
It shall be unlawful for any person, firm, or corporation to permit the emission of smoke
from any source that is injurious or offensive to the residents of the municipality in the judgment
of the Board of Health. Air shall be considered to be polluted when the discharge into the open
air of dust, fumes, gases, mist, odors, smoke, or any combination thereof is of a character and in
a quantity which to any group of persons interferes with their health, repose, or safety, or causes
severe annoyance or discomfort or is offensive and objectionable to normal persons, and causes
injury to real and personal property of any kind. The standards for air pollution established or
adopted by the state shall be presumptive evidence as to when the air is deemed to be polluted
under this section. It is hereby unlawful for any person, firm, or corporation to permit or cause
the escape of the nuisances named above, and the escape of the dust, fumes, gases, mists, odors,
and smoke is hereby declared to be a nuisance and shall be summarily abated upon written notice

It shall be unlawful for any person, firm, or corporation to obstruct or impede without legal
authority any river or collection of water, or to corrupt and render unwholesome or impure any
watercourse, stream, or other water. The standards for water quality established or adopted by
the state shall be presumptive evidence as to when the water is deemed to be polluted under this
section. Such a corruption of the water in or about the municipality shall constitute a nuisance
and shall be summarily abated upon written notice to the violator by the Board of Health. The
abatement may be in addition to the penalty for water pollution. (Neb. RS 18-1720 and 28-1321)
Penalty, see § 10.99

or on the premises. In the event that the owner, lessee, or occupant of any dwelling or building
neglects, fails, or otherwise refuses to control and actively exterminate the insects, rodents,
and other pests in and about his or her premises, the Board of Health shall issue notice for him or
her to do so. If that owner, lessee, or occupant has not made a good faith effort to exterminate the
pests within 5 days, the premises shall be deemed to be a nuisance and a health hazard. (Neb. RS
18-1720 and 28-1321) Penalty, see § 10.99
§ 92.56 OCCUPANT RESPONSIBILITY.
It shall be the responsibility of the occupant in a single dwelling unit whether or not the
dwelling unit is located in a multiple unit structure to exterminate the rodents and insects infesting
the premises when it is found by the Board of Health that only the occupant's dwelling is so
infested. (Neb. RS 18-1720 and 28-1321) Penalty, see § 10.99
§ 92.57 OWNER RESPONSIBILITY.
The owner of a multiple dwelling unit shall have the duty to exterminate therein for rodents
and insects when infestation exists in two or more units, when infestation exists in shared or
public areas of a multiple unit structure when the infestation is due to failure by the owner to
maintain the dwelling in an insect and rodent proof condition. The owner of a single dwelling
unit shall have the duty to exterminate therein notwithstanding the occupancy of a renter or
lessee when the infestation of insects or rodents is due to the owner's failure to construct or
maintain the premises in a manner so as to make it reasonably resistant to the entrance and
habitability of pests. (Neb. RS 18-1720 and 28-1321) Penalty, see § 10.99

MUNICIPAL PROPERTY
§ 93.001 DEFINITIONS.
For the purpose of this subchapter, the following definition shall apply unless the context
clearly indicates or requires a different meaning.
SIDEWALK SPACE. The portion of a street between curb lines and adjacent
property line.
§ 93.002 MAINTENANCE AND CONTROL.
The City Council shall have the care, supervision, and control of all public highways,
bridges, streets, alleys, public squares, and commons within the municipality and shall cause the
same to be kept open and in repair and free from nuisances. (Neb. RS 17-567(1))
§ 93.003 OBSTRUCTIONS.
(A) (1) Trees and shrubs growing upon or near the lot line or upon public ground and interfering
with the use or construction of any public improvements shall be deemed an obstruction
under this chapter. The trees and shrubs and their roots may be removed by the City at the expense
of the owner of the property upon which the tree is located should the owner fail, or neglect,
after notice, to do so. It shall be unlawful for any person, persons, firm, or corporation to
obstruct or encumber by fences, gates, buildings, structures, or otherwise any of the streets, alleys,
or side-walks. The public ways and property shall be considered to be obstructed when the
owner or occupant of the adjacent property shall permit or suffer to remain on any premises
owned or controlled by him or her any hedge, shrubbery, bush, or similar growth within two feet
adjacent to the lot line whether there is a sidewalk abutting or adjoining the premises or not. It
shall be the duty of owners and occupants to keep trimmed and pruned all such similar growth at
all times. Whenever any such growth is allowed to grow within two feet of the lot line contrary
to the provisions of this chapter, the City Council may pass a resolution ordering the owner or
occupant to remove those obstructions within five days after having been served with a copy of
the resolution by the City stating that the City will do so and will charge the costs thereof to
the owner or occupant as a special assessment for improvements as herein provided, or shall
collect the same by civil suit brought in the name of the municipality against the owner or
occupant.
(2) Trees and shrubs growing upon the lot line partially on public ground and partially
upon the abutting property or wholly upon the abutting property but so close to the lot line as to
interfere with the making of any public improvement or so that the roots thereof interfere with
any utility wires or pipe shall be deemed an obstruction and these trees, shrubs, and roots may be
removed by the City pursuant to the procedure prescribed above.
(3) It shall be unlawful for any person to plant, or allow to grow, any tree or shrub within
any sidewalk space, street right of way, or other public property of the City without first receiving
a written permit for the same from the City pursuant to its regulations. Any tree or shrub
otherwise planted and growing hereafter or any other obstruction within such sidewalk space,
street right of way, or other public property of the City may be declared a nuisance by the City
and ordered to be removed. Pursuant to the nuisance provisions of this Code and state law, upon
failure of the owner to remove such a nuisance, the City may cause such removal at the owner’s
expense.
(B) It shall be unlawful for any person to place any structure, facility, utility, or other obstruction,
whether above ground or below, including but not limited to underground sprinklers,
ornamental mailboxes, signage, lighting, or other structures within any sidewalk space, street
right of way, or other public property of the City without first receiving a written permit for the
same from the City pursuant to its regulations. The City shall not repair, pay for, or otherwise
compensate or be responsible for any damage done to any structures located in any sidewalk
space, street right of way, or other public property of the City by the City while engaged in municipal
operations, which limitation of responsibility shall be noted on any permits received by
applicants for construction of the same. Failure to obtain a permit prior to placement of any such
structure in any sidewalk space, street right of way, or other public property of the City does not
alter the limitation of the City’s responsibility under this section.
(C) It shall be the duty of an owner or occupant engaged in construction of any building or
improvement upon or near the public ways and property to have all excavations or exposures of
any kind protected and guarded by suitable guards or barricades by day and by warning lights at
night. In the event of failure, neglect, or refusal to comply with the provisions of this subchapter,
it shall be the duty of the City to stop all work upon the buildings and improvements until suitable
guards are erected and kept in the manner aforementioned.
(D) Persons engaged in the erection, construction, reconstruction, wrecking, or repairing of
any building, or the construction or repair of a sidewalk along any street, may occupy the public
street space with such building material and equipment as long as is necessary if those persons
shall make application to and receive a permit in writing from the municipal official in charge of
municipal streets to do so, provided that no permit for the occupancy of the sidewalk space and
more than one-third of the roadway of the public space adjacent to the real estate on which the
building is to be constructed, erected, reconstructed, wrecked, or repaired shall be granted, and
provided further that a suitable passageway for pedestrians shall be maintained within the public
space included in the permit which shall be protected and lighted in the manner required by the
official issuing the permit.
(E) In the event the property owner is a nonresident of the county in which the property lies,
the municipality shall, before levying any special assessment against that property, send a copy
of any notice required by law to be published by means of certified mail, return receipt requested,
to the last known address of the nonresident property owner. The last known address
shall be that address listed on the current tax rolls at the time the required notice was first published.
(Am. Ord. 2990, 3-16-10) Penalty, see § 10.99
§ 93.004 WEEDS.
It is hereby the duty of the Police Chief or his or her duly authorized agent to view and inspect
the sidewalk space within the corporate limits for growing weeds during the growing season,
and if rank and noxious weeds are found growing thereon, he or she shall notify the owner
or occupant thereof to cut down those weeds as close to the ground as can be practicably done
and keep the weeds cut thereon in like manner during the growing season for weeds, provided
that any weeds growing in excess of 12 inches on any sidewalk space shall be considered a violation
of this section. In the event that the owner of the lot or parcel of land abutting that sidewalk
space within the municipality is a nonresident of the municipality or cannot be found therein, the
notice may be given to any person having the care, custody, or control of that lot or parcel of
land. In the event that there can be found no one within the municipality to whom notice can be
given, it shall be the duty of the Police Chief or his or her agent to post a copy of the notice on
the premises and then to cut or cause the weeds thereon to be cut as therein provided and report
the cost thereof in writing to the City Council. The cost shall then be audited and paid by the
municipality, and the amount thereof shall be assessed against the lot or parcel of land as a special
tax thereon and shall be collected as are other taxes of the municipality or may be recovered
by civil suit brought by the municipality against the owner of the parcel of land. In the event the
property owner is a nonresident of the county in which the property lies, the municipality shall,
before levying any special assessment against that property, send a copy of any notice required
by law to be published by means of certified mail, return receipt requested, to the last known address
of the nonresident property owner. The last known address shall be that address listed on
the current tax rolls at the time the required notice was first published. (Am. Ord. 2941, 6-20-06)
Penalty, see § 10.99
§ 93.005 SIGNS AND CANOPIES.
No person, firm, or corporation shall erect or maintain any sign, signboard, poster, or rigid
canopy over any street, sidewalk, alley, or on other public property without having first obtained
a permit therefor. Permits for signs, canopies, posters, and signboards shall be issued by the Municipal
Clerk, subject to the approval of the Utilities Superintendent. All signs and canopies extending
over any public sidewalk, street, alley, or other public place must be securely fastened
and constructed so that there will be no danger of the same being dislodged by ordinary winds, or
falling from other causes. No sign or canopy shall be erected or maintained which extends over
any public sidewalk, street, alley, or other public place in such a location as to obstruct the view
of any traffic light, sign, or signal. Upon the written order of the City Council, any person owning
or occupying the premises where such a sign, canopy, poster, or signboard is located shall
cause the same to be removed within the time limit specified on the notice, upon payment of a
fee set by the City Council by resolution. Penalty, see § 10.99
§ 93.006 OVERHANGING BRANCHES.
(A) The owner or occupant of any lot, piece, or parcel of ground abutting or adjacent to any
street or sidewalk over which there extend the branches of trees shall at all times keep the
branches or limbs thereof trimmed to the height of at least 8 feet above the surface of the walk
and at least 14 feet above the surface of the street. Whenever the limbs or branches of any tree or
trees extend over streets or sidewalks contrary to the provisions herein so as to interfere with the
lighting of the street from street lights or with the convenience of the public using the street or
sidewalk, the City Council at any regular or special meeting may pass a resolution ordering the
owner or occupant to cut or remove the obstructions within 5 days after having received a copy
thereof from the Utilities Superintendent stating that the municipality will remove the branches
and charge the costs thereof to the owner or occupant as a special assessment for improvements
as herein provided, if the resolution is not complied with.
(B) In the event the property owner is a nonresident of the county in which the property lies,
the municipality shall, before levying any special assessment against that property, send a copy
of any notice required by law to be published by means of certified mail, return receipt requested,
to the last known address of the nonresident property owner. The last known address
shall be that address listed on the current tax rolls at the time the required notice was first published.
Penalty, see § 10.99
§ 93.007 SALE AND CONVEYANCE OF REAL PROPERTY.
(A) Except as provided in division (G) of this section, the power of the city to convey any
real property owned by it, including land used for park purposes and public squares, except real
property used in the operation of public utilities, shall be exercised by resolution, directing the
sale at public auction or by sealed bid of the property and the manner and terms thereof, except
that the property shall not be sold at public auction or by sealed bid when:
(1) The property is being sold in compliance with the requirements of federal or state
grants or programs;
(2) The property is being conveyed to another public agency; or
(3) The property consists of streets and alleys.
(B) The City Council may establish a minimum price for real property at which bidding
shall begin or shall serve as a minimum for a sealed bid.
(C) After the passage of the resolution directing the sale, notice of all proposed sales of
property described in division (A) of this section and the terms thereof shall be published once
each week for 3 consecutive weeks in a legal newspaper published in or of general circulation in
the city.
(D) (1) If within 30 days after the third publication of the notice a remonstrance against the
sale is signed by registered voters of the city equal in number to 30% of the registered voters of
the city voting at the last regular municipal election held therein and is filed with the City Council,
the property shall not then, nor within one year thereafter, be sold. If the date for filing the
remonstrance falls upon a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday, the signatures shall be collected
within the 30-day period, but the filing shall be considered timely if filed or postmarked on or
before the next business day.
(2) Upon the receipt of the remonstrance, the City Council, with the aid and assistance
of the Election Commissioner or County Clerk, shall determine the validity and sufficiency of
signatures on the remonstrance. The City Council shall deliver the remonstrance to the Election
Commissioner or County Clerk by hand carrier, by use of law enforcement officials, or by certified
mail, return receipt requested.
(3) Upon receipt of the remonstrance, the Election Commissioner or County Clerk shall
issue to the City Council a written receipt that the remonstrance is in the custody of the Election
Commissioner or County Clerk. The Election Commissioner or County Clerk shall compare the
signature of each person signing the remonstrance with the voter registration records to determine
if each signer was a registered voter on or before the date on which the remonstrance was
filed with the City Council. The Election Commissioner or County Clerk shall also compare the
signer's printed name, street and number or voting precinct, and city or post office address with
the voter registration records to determine whether the signer was a registered voter. The signature
and address shall be presumed to be valid only if the Election Commissioner or County
Clerk determines that the printed name, street and number or voting precinct, and city or post
office address matches the registration records and that the registration was received on or before
the date on which the remonstrance was filed with the City Council. The determinations of the
Election Commissioner or County Clerk may be rebutted by any credible evidence which the
City Council finds sufficient. The express purpose of the comparison of names and addresses
with the voter registration records, in addition to helping to determine the validity of the remonstrance,
the sufficiency of the remonstrance, and the qualifications of the signer, shall be to prevent
fraud, deception, and misrepresentation in the remonstrance process.
(4) Upon completion of the comparison of names and addresses with the voter registration
records, the Election Commissioner or County Clerk shall prepare in writing a certification
under seal setting forth the name and address of each signer found not to be a registered voter
and the signature page number and line number where the name is found, and if the reason for
the invalidity of the signature or address is other than the nonregistration of the signer, the Election
Commissioner or County Clerk shall set forth the reason for the invalidity of the signature.
If the Election Commissioner or County Clerk determines that a signer has affixed his or her signature
more than once to the remonstrance and that only one person is registered by that name,
the Election Commissioner or County Clerk shall prepare in writing a certification under seal
setting forth the name of the duplicate signature and shall count only the earliest dated signature.
(5) The Election Commissioner or County Clerk shall certify to the City Council the
number of valid signatures necessary to constitute a valid remonstrance. The Election Commissioner
or County Clerk shall deliver the remonstrance and the certifications to the City Council
within 40 days after the receipt of the remonstrance from the City Council. The delivery shall be
by hand carrier, by use of law enforcement officials, or by certified mail, return receipt requested.
Not more than 20 signatures on one signature page shall be counted.
(6) The City Council shall, within 30 days after the receipt of the remonstrance and certifications
from the Election Commissioner or County Clerk, hold a public hearing to review the
remonstrance and certifications and receive testimony regarding them. The City Council shall,
following the hearing, vote on whether or not the remonstrance is valid and shall uphold the remonstrance
if sufficient valid signatures have been received.
(E) Real estate now owned or hereafter owned by the city may be conveyed without consideration
to the state for state armory sites or, if acquired for state armory sites, shall be conveyed
strictly in accordance with the conditions of Neb. RS 18-1001 through 18-1006.
(F) Following passage of the resolution directing a sale, publishing of the notice of the proposed
sale, and passing of the 30-day right-of-remonstrance period, the property shall then be
sold. The sale shall be confirmed by passage of an ordinance stating the name of the purchaser
and terms of the sale. (Neb. RS 17-503)
(G) Divisions (A) through (F) of this section shall not apply to the sale of real property if the
authorizing resolution directs the sale of real property, the total fair market value of which is less
than $5,000. Following passage of the resolution directing the sale of the property, notice of the
sale shall be posted in 3 prominent places within the city for a period of not less than 7 days prior
to the sale of the property. The notice shall give a general description of the property offered for
sale and state the terms and conditions of sale. Confirmation of the sale by passage of an ordinance
may be required.
(Neb. RS 17-503.01) (Am. Ords. 2605, 6-21-94; 2688, 6-17-97; 2749, 10-20-98; 2879, 2-3-04)
§ 93.008 SALE AND CONVEYANCE OF PERSONAL PROPERTY.
In order to sell personal property owned by the City, the City Council shall adopt a resolution
directing the sale and the manner and terms of the sale. Following passage of the resolution
directing the sale of the property, notice of the sale shall be posted in three prominent places
within the City for a period of not less than seven days prior to the sale of the property. If the fair
market value of the property is greater than $5,000.00, notice of the sale shall also be published
once in a legal newspaper in or of general circulation in such city at least seven days prior to the
sale of the property. The notice shall give a general description of the property offered for sale
and state the terms and conditions of sale. When such personal property is being (a) sold in compliance
with the requirements of federal or state grants or programs or (b) conveyed to another
public agency, the notice procedure set forth above may be dispensed with.
(Neb. RS 17-503.02) (Ord. 2879, 2-3-04) (Am. Ord. 2966, 10-16-07)
§ 93.009 ACQUISITION OF PROPERTY; CONSTRUCTION; ELECTIONS, WHEN

(B) Except as provided in division (C) of this section, before any such purchase can be
made or building erected, the question shall be submitted to the electors of the municipality at a
general municipal election or at an election duly called for that purpose, or as set forth in Neb.
RS 17-954 and be adopted by a majority of the electors voting on the question.
(Neb. RS 17-953)
(C) If the funds to be used to finance the purchase or construction of a building pursuant to
this section are available other than through a bond issue, then either:
(1) Notice of the proposed purchase or construction shall be published in a newspaper
of general circulation in the municipality, and no election shall be required to approve the purchase
or construction unless within 30 days after the publication of the notice, a remonstrance
against the purchase or construction is signed by registered voters of the municipality equal in
number to 15% of the registered voters of the municipality voting at the last regular municipal
election held therein and is filed with the City Council. If the date for filing the remonstrance
falls upon a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday, the signatures shall be considered timely if filed
or postmarked on or before the next business day. If a remonstrance with the necessary number
of qualified signatures is timely filed, the question shall be submitted to the voters of the municipality
at a general municipal election or a special election duly called for that purpose. If the purchase
or construction is not approved, the property involved shall not then, nor within one year
following the election, be purchased or constructed; or
(2) The City Council may proceed without providing the notice and right of remonstrance
required in division (C)(1) of this section if the property can be purchased below the fair
market value as determined by an appraisal, there is a willing seller, and the purchase price is
less than $25,000. The purchase shall be approved by the City Council after notice and public
hearing as provided in Neb. RS 18-1755.
(Neb. RS 17-953.01) (Am. Ord. 2689, 6-17-97)
§ 93.010 ACQUISITION OF REAL PROPERTY; APPRAISAL.
The municipality shall not purchase, lease-purchase, or acquire for consideration real property
having an estimated value of $100,000 or more unless an appraisal of the property has been
performed by a certified real estate appraiser. (Neb. RS 13-403)
§ 93.011 ACQUISITION OF REAL PROPERTY; PUBLIC MEETING.
When acquiring an interest in real property by purchase or eminent domain, the municipality
shall do so only after the City Council has authorized the acquisition by action taken in a public
meeting after notice and public hearing. The City shall provide to the public a right of access for
recreational use to the real property acquired for public recreational purposes. Such access shall
be at designated access points and shall be equal to the right of access for recreational use held by
adjacent landowners. The right of access granted to the public for recreational use shall meet or
exceed such right held by a private landowner adjacent to the real property.
(Neb. RS 18-1755)
§ 93.012 PUBLIC WORKS INVOLVING ARCHITECTURE OR ENGINEERING; REQUIREMENTS.
(A) Except as provided in division (B) of this section, the municipality shall not engage in
the construction of any public works involving architecture or engineering unless the plans, specifications,

engineer, or those under the direct supervision of an architect or professional engineer.
(B) Division (A) of this section shall not apply to the following activities:

All sidewalks within the business district shall be cleaned within 5 hours after the cessation
of a storm, unless the storm or fall of snow shall have taken place during the night, in which case

City Council.
(D) (1) Bond and Public Liability Insurance. Every applicant for such permit shall file with
the application required, a continuing bond in the sum of not less than $5.000.00, but in the event
that the City Council in the resolution authorizing the permit shall fix a different sum, then a
bond for such sum so fixed shall be substituted and filed with the application. All bonds and sureties

shall be conditioned that the person to whom such permit shall be issued and such person's heirs,
successors, or assigns shall strictly comply with all applicable laws and regulations and all conditions
of the permit and which shall save and keep the city free and harmless from any and all loss
or damages or claims for damages arising from or out of the use of the space or structure therein
mentioned, and for the maintenance of the street, alley, sidewalk, or other public way in such
condition that said street, alley, sidewalk, or other public way shall at all times after such structure
is completed or such space is covered, be safe for the public use; for the full and complete
protection of the city against any and all litigation growing out of the granting of such permit or
anything done under such permit and for the removal of any structure permitted in the public
space by such permit at the sole expense of the permittee and the permittee's heirs, successors, or
assigns; for the faithful performance and observance of all the terms and conditions of this chapter;
and where the permit is given to use space which under this chapter is taxed, such bond shall
also be conditioned for the prompt and full payment of the compensation required by this chapter,
or any other ordinance required to be paid during the period said permit shall be outstanding.
Following the issuance of such permit and as long as the use continues or as long as the structure
exists in such public space, the owners of such property from time to time shall also be responsible
to the city for the performance of all of the conditions of said bond above described.
(2) Whenever the City Council shall be of the opinion that the surety on such bond given for
such permit issued hereunder has become insufficient and shall so declare by resolution, a new
bond for such permit shall thereupon be filed with a new surety to be approved by the City
Attorney.
(3) In addition to the bond, the applicant shall be required to:
(a) At all times maintain public liability insurance in the form of a commercial or
comprehensive general liability policy, or an acceptable substitute policy form as permitted by

Attorney for conformance with the provisions of this section;
(b) At all times keep on file with the City Clerk a current certificate of insurance
signed by a qualified agent of an insurance company licensed to do business in the State of Nebraska
and approved by the City Attorney for conformance with the provisions of this section
evidencing the existence of valid and effective policies of insurance naming the city as an additional
insured for the coverage required by subsection (a) of this section, the limits of each policy,
the policy number, the name of the insurer, the effective date and expiration date of each policy,
the deductibles or self-insurance retainers of each policy and a copy of an endorsement
placed on each policy requiring thirty day's notice by mail to the City Clerk before the insurer
may cancel the policy for any reason, and upon request of the City Clerk or the City Attorney, a
copy of any endorsements placed on such policies or the declarations page of such policies. Any
termination or lapse of such insurance shall automatically revoke any permit issued pursuant to
this chapter.

any such street, alley, or public way in such manner as to interfere with any wastewater collector,
gas, water, or any other public works or utilities lawfully in such street, alley, or other public
way unless by consent of the City Council especially granted by resolution; and no such permit
shall be granted until the applicant therefor has deposited with the City Clerk and a sum of money
equal to the estimated cost prepared by the City Clerk to defray the cost and expense of removing,
replacing, and relaying such wastewater collector, gas, water pipes, or other public
works or utilities, and making the necessary connections therewith. Each and every applicant disturbing
any such wastewater collector, gas, water pipes, or other public works or utilities, shall,
within ten days after so disturbing it, restore the same to such condition as will meet with the approval
of the Department of Public Works and Utilities. When such wastewater collector, gas,
water pipes, or other public works or utilities are so restored by said applicant, the sum so deposited
with the City Clerk shall be refunded to such applicant less any sums which may be necessary
to defray any damages which might arise from such disruption. If such applicant shall fail to
restore such wastewater collector, gas, or water pipes, or other public works or utilities within ten

meeting with his/her approval, and the cost thereof shall be paid out of the sum thus deposited.
(F) (1) Revocation of Permit; Removal of Structure. A permit issued under this chapter may
be revoked by resolution of the City Council upon a finding by them of such fact and the giving
of five days' written notice to such person by the City Clerk, for the following reasons:

days after the date for payment is due;
(b) Failure or neglect of the permit holder to comply with the provisions of this
chapter or any of the provisions of the Municipal Code or provisions of the permit;
(c) Failure to use the space for which the permit was granted for a continuous period
of at least six months; or
(d) Upon a determination by the city that the space for which the permit was
granted is needed for public use.

the space for which the permit was granted. together with the removal of any structures at his/her
own cost and expense and return that space to the City of Fairbury, free and clear of all structures
or encroachments of any type, at no expense to the city. If said space is below ground, such
space shall be filled to the satisfaction of the Director of Public Works and Utilities at the
expense of the permit holder. If a removal, abandonment, or fill has been requested and the said
removal, abandonment, or fill is not completed within six months after revocation of such permit,
the City Council may cause such removal, abandonment, or fill to be so done, and the costs
of such work shall become a lien against the property of the permit holder.

been ordered by it. Upon the petition of any freeholder who is an abutting owner in fee simple of
property subject to assessment for sidewalk improvements, the Council may order permanent
sidewalks built in accordance with this subchapter upon the freeholder making, executing, and
delivering to the City an agreement to the effect that the petitioning freeholder will pay the engineering

to pay the costs with interest. The total cost of the improvement shall be levied, allocated, financed,
and specially assessed as provided by law. In the event the property owner is a nonresident
of the county in which the property lies, the municipality shall, before levying any special
assessment against that property, send a copy of any notice required by law to be published by
means of certified mail, return receipt requested, to the last known address of the nonresident
property owner. The last known address shall be that address listed on the current tax rolls at the
time the required notice was first published.
§ 93.035 CONSTRUCTION SPECIFICATIONS.
All sidewalks shall be constructed in conformity with those specifications as are adopted by
the Street Superintendent and approved by the City Council. The Street Superintendent may reject
the use of any materials that do not comply with those requirements and specifications or
any material that is lacking in quality, and it shall be unlawful to construct any sidewalks from
any material so rejected. In case any lot owner of a piece of land within the municipality, under
notice given or otherwise, shall construct a sidewalk in violation of this chapter, the Street Superintendent
may stop the work of the construction and order the same to be constructed in accordance
with this chapter and order the work already done to be changed, and on the failure of the
owner to change any such work, the Street Superintendent shall forthwith change the work, and
the expense of the same shall be assessed and taxed to that lot. Penalty, see § 10.99
§ 93.036 CERTIFICATION.
The Street Superintendent shall certify to the City Council a detailed schedule of all sidewalks
laid, widened, or rebuilt and the cost of same, from which the City Council may be aided
in determining the amount to be assessed as a special assessment against each lot or piece of
ground. The Street Superintendent shall certify such other facts as may be necessary to enable
the City Council to make the proper special assessment. He or she shall also certify to the City
Council the acceptance of any sidewalk improvements to the adjoining lots or parcels of land and
prepare all necessary data for assessment sheets. The cost of improvements provided for in this
chapter shall be assessed by the Mayor and Council meeting as a Board of Equalization, following
notice of such sitting at least 10 days prior thereto by publication in a newspaper having general
circulation in the municipality, and the assessments shall be equalized and levy made in the
manner provided by law.

§ 93.053 VACATING PUBLIC WAYS.
(A) For the purpose of this subchapter, the following definition shall apply unless the context
clearly indicates or requires a different meaning.
SPECIAL DAMAGES. Only those losses or damages or injuries which a property
owner suffers that are peculiar or special or unique to his or her property and which result from
the City Council vacating a street, avenue, alley, lane, or similar public way. SPECIAL DAMAGES
shall not mean those losses or damages or injuries that a property owner suffers that are in
common with the rest of the city or public at large, even though those losses or damages or injuries
suffered by the property owner are greater in degree than the rest of the city or public at
large. (Ord. 2380, 9-2-86)
(B) Whenever the City Council decides that it would be in the best interests of the city to
vacate a street, avenue, alley, lane, or similar public way, the City Council shall comply with the
following procedure.
(1) Notice shall be given to all abutting property owners either by first class mail to
their last known address or if there is no known address then by publishing the notice in a newspaper
that is of general circulation in the city. The content of the notice shall advise the abutting
property owners that the City Council will consider vacating the street, avenue, alley, lane, or
similar public way at its next regular meeting or, if a special meeting is scheduled for the discussion,
then the date, time, and place of that meeting.
(2) The City Council may have all the abutting property owners sign a form stating that
they consent to the action being taken by the City Council and waive their right of access. The
signing of this form shall have no effect on claims for special damages by the abutting property
owners but shall create the presumption that the City Council's action was proper. If the abutting
property owners do not sign the consent/waiver form, the City Council may still proceed with
vacating the street, avenue, alley, lane, or similar public way under the authority granted by Neb.
RS 17-558 and 17-559.

within the city for a period of time in excess of twenty-one (21) days. It shall be unlawful for any
person in charge or control of any private property within the city, whether as owner, tenant,
occupant, lessee or otherwise, to allow any motor vehicle which has been unregistered for more
than twenty-one (21) days to remain upon any private property. Any motor vehicle allowed to
remain on private property in violation of this subsection shall constitute a nuisance and shall be
abated.
(2) Any person violating any of the provisions of this section shall be guilty of a
misdemeanor and, upon conviction thereof, such person shall be fined in a sum not to exceed
five hundred dollars ($500.00), except that each person so convicted shall be fined in a sum not
less than one hundred dollars ($100.00) for the first offense, not less than one hundred fifty
dollars ($150.00) for the second offense, and not less than two hundred dollars ($200.00) for the
third offense and each offense thereafter. Each day that a violation of any of the provisions of
this section continues shall constitute a distinct offense and shall be punishable as such.
(D) Exception for enclosures and screening. Section C shall not be construed to prohibit any
person from storing junked or unregistered motor vehicles, or parts of a motor vehicle, upon
private property when completely enclosed within a building. Section C shall not be construed to
prohibit any person from storing up to two (2) junked or unregistered motor vehicles upon
private property when screened from view by a solid fence or wall.
(E) Exception in business. Nothing in this article shall be construed to apply to any motor
vehicle in connection with a lawful business enterprise, operating in an appropriate commercial
or industrial zoning district.
(F) Junked motor vehicles on city property. No person shall leave any junked motor vehicle
on public property within or without the corporate limits in excess of forty-eight (48) hours.
(G) Impoundment. The chief of police is hereby authorized to remove or have removed any
vehicle left on public property within the corporate limits which reasonably appears to be an
abandoned vehicle. Such vehicle shall be impounded until lawfully claimed or disposed of in
accordance with the provisions of this article.
(H) Abandoned motor vehicle; value of $250.00 or less; title vests in city. If an abandoned
vehicle at the time of abandonment has no license plates of the current year affixed or valid In
Transit decals issued pursuant to section 60-230 of the Nebraska Revised Statutes affixed and is
of a wholesale value, taking into consideration the condition of the vehicle, of two hundred fifty
dollars ($250.00) or less, title shall immediately vest in the city.
(I) Police Department; duties.
(1) Except vehicles governed by section H, the Police Department, having custody
of an abandoned vehicle, shall make an inquiry as follows, concerning the last registered owner
of each abandoned vehicle in its custody:
(a) An abandoned vehicle with license plates affixed, to the jurisdiction that issued
such number plates; or
(b) An abandoned vehicle with no license plates affixed, to the state department of
motor vehicles.
(2) The Police Department shall notify the last registered owner, if any, that the vehicle
in question has been determined to be an abandoned vehicle and that, if unclaimed, either (a) it
will be sold or will be offered at public auction after five (5) days from the date such notice was
mailed; or (b) title will vest in the city thirty (30) days after the date such notice was mailed. If
the agency described in subsection (1)(a) or (b) of this section also notifies the Police
Department that a lien or mortgage exists, such notice shall also be sent to the lienholder or
mortgagee. Any person claiming such vehicle shall be required to pay the cost of removal and
storage of such vehicle. Notice required by this subsection shall be either by personal service or
by United States registered mail, return receipt required.
(3) Title to such abandoned vehicle, if unclaimed, shall vest in the city (a) five (5) days
after the date the notice is mailed if the vehicle will be sold or will be offered at public auction
under subsection (2) of this section; (b) thirty (30) days after the date the notice is mailed if the
city will retain the vehicle; or (c) if the last registered owner cannot be ascertained, when notice
of such fact is received.
(4) If the Police Department has custody of a motor vehicle for investigatory purposes
and has no further need to keep it in custody, then the Police Department shall send a certified
letter to each of the last registered owners stating that the vehicle is in the custody of the Police
Department, that the vehicle is no longer needed for law enforcement purposes, and that after
thirty (30) days the city will dispose of the vehicle. This subsection shall not apply to motor
vehicles subject to forfeiture under Section 28-431 of the Nebraska Revised Statutes. No storage
fees shall be assessed against the registered owner of a motor vehicle held in custody for
investigatory purposes under this subsection unless the registered owner or the person in
possession of the vehicle when it is taken into custody is charged with a felony or misdemeanor
related to the offense for which the Police Department took the vehicle into custody. If a
registered owner or person in possession of the vehicle when it is taken into custody is charged
with a felony or misdemeanor but is not convicted, the registered owner shall be entitled to a
refund of the storage fees.
(J) Disposition. After title to the abandoned vehicle vests pursuant to state law in the city,
the city may retain for use, sell, or auction the abandoned vehicle. If the Police Department has
determined that the vehicle should be retained for use, the city shall at the time that the notice, if
any, is mailed, publish in a newspaper of general circulation in the city an announcement that the
city intends to retain the abandoned vehicle for its use and that title will vest in the city thirty
(30) days after the publication. Any proceeds from the sale of the abandoned vehicle, less any
expenses incurred by the city shall be held by the city without interest, for the benefit of the
owner of such vehicle, for a period of two (2) years. If not claimed within such two (2) year
period, such proceeds shall be paid into the general fund of the city.
(K) Costs of removal and storage. The last registered owner of an abandoned vehicle shall
be liable to the city for the costs of removal and storage of such vehicle.
(L) Liability for removal. Neither the owner, lessee, nor occupant of the premises for which
any abandoned vehicle shall be removed, nor the State of Nebraska, nor the city shall be liable
for any loss or damage to such vehicle which occurs during its removal or while in the
possession of the city or as a result of any subsequent disposition.

large, while incalculable, extremely exorbitant.

protect and improve the health, safety and welfare of the citizens of the City by creating certain

certain sexual predators are prohibited from establishing temporary or permanent residence.

conveyance with the knowledge that it will be used as a permanent residence or a temporary
residence by any person prohibited from establishing such permanent residence or temporary
residence pursuant to this ordinance if such place, structure, or part thereof or trailer or other
conveyance is located within 500 feet of any school, day care center, or park.
(B) A property owner's failure to comply with the provisions of this section shall constitute a
violation of this section and shall subject the property owner to a fine of $500.00. The City may

RESIDENTIAL RENTAL CERTIFICATE OF OCCUPANCY
AND INSPECTION PROGRAM
(Ord. No. 3020, 7-3-12, as amended)

and Inspection Program.
§ 150.11 DEFINITIONS. For purposes of this Section, the following definitions shall apply:
“Rental Unit” shall mean any residential dwelling within the City’s jurisdiction, regardless
of location therein, that is, whether by written agreement or otherwise, rented or leased or to be
rented or leased to tenants, or is otherwise occupied or to be occupied for consideration by a
person or persons other than the owner of record of such dwelling, for residential purposes on a
non-transient basis, when one or more tenants reside on the property or rents or leases or are to
rent or lease the property for thirty consecutive days or longer.
“Owner” shall mean any Person who is the owner of record in whole or in part, of one or
more Rental Units.
“Person” shall mean any individual or entity.
“Code Enforcement Authority” shall mean the City of Fairbury Board of Health or the code

“Certificate of Occupancy” shall mean a permit issued by the City, pursuant to this
Ordinance and any regulations promulgated by the Code Enforcement Authority, that permits
under this Section an Owner to rent or lease a Rental Unit.
§ 150.12 RULES OF CONSTRUCTION.
This Section shall be liberally construed and applied to promote its underlying purpose,
which is to encourage the maintenance and improvement of the quality of rental housing in the
City.
§ 150.13 COMPLIANCE.
No Person shall offer the use of a Rental Unit to any Person unless in accordance with the
provisions of this Section.
§ 150.14 SCOPE. This Section shall apply to all Rental Units, but shall not apply to the

individuals or a family while they are absent from the city for short periods of time, not to exceed

lease period;
(iv) persons who occupy the premises and rent to no more than two occupants;
provided that this exception does not apply to the renting of basements, attics, or garages which
are used as habitable spaces.
§ 150.15 CERTIFICATE OF OCCUPANCY; REQUIREMENT.
On and after April 1, 2015, no Person may use real estate for the purpose of erecting or
affording to any Person the use of a Rental Unit thereon without having first obtained a Certificate
of Occupancy from the office of the Code Enforcement Authority pursuant to this Section.
§ 150.16 CERTIFICATE OF OCCUPANCY; FORM.
The form of the Certificate of Occupancy shall be as determined by regulations promulgated
by the Code Enforcement Authority.
§ 150.17 CERTIFICATE OF OCCUPANCY; APPLICATION.
Any Owner wishing to rent or lease or afford to any Person the use of a Rental Unit must
apply for a Certificate of Occupancy for such Rental Unit with the office of the Code Enforcement
Authority. The application shall be in a form as determined by the Code Enforcement Authority,
and shall require the following information:

designate a resident agent.
(7) Certificate of Occupancy fees as established by the Code Enforcement Authority.
Such fees are compensation for necessary paperwork and work to inspect Rental Units.
The application shall be signed by the Owner. Whenever ownership of a Rental Unit changes, the
existing Certificate of Occupancy shall expire upon such change of ownership, and the new
Owner shall complete a new application and must be issued a new Certificate of Occupancy.
Notification of the Owner or Owner’s agent at the address shown on the application shall
constitute sufficient notice pursuant to any provision of this Section. It is a violation of this
Section for an Owner to rent or lease or afford to any Person the use of a Rental Unit for which a
Certificate of Occupancy has not been issued or for which a Certificate of Occupancy is not
currently valid in accordance with this Section.
§ 150.17.1 DURATION.

following expiration of a One Year Certificate shall be a Two Year Certificate valid for 24 months
following the date of issuance; (2) the Certificate of Occupancy issued to such Owner for such
Rental Unit following expiration of a Two Year Certificate shall be a Three Year Certificate valid
for 36 months following the date of issuance; and (3) each subsequent Certificate of Occupancy
issued to an Owner for a Rental Unit following expiration of a Three Year Certificate therefor
shall be a Three Year Certificate. Notwithstanding the foregoing, should a Rental Unit at any time
be the subject of a Special Inspection, or any re-inspection pursuant to Section 150.18, any
subsequent Certificate of Occupancy issued therefor by the Code Enforcement Authority may be
the next duration-advancing Certificate of Occupancy as provided in this subsection, any lowerduration
Certificate of Occupancy, or the same-duration Certificate of Occupancy in the discretion
of the Code Enforcement Authority.
§ 150.18 CERTIFICATE OF OCCUPANCY; General Inspection.
In addition to the other requirements of this Section and any regulations promulgated by the
Code Enforcement Authority not in conflict with this Section, it shall be a requirement to obtain a
Certificate of Occupancy to pass an inspection of the Rental Unit carried out by the office of the
Code Enforcement Authority (a “General Inspection”), or to provide proof to the Code
Enforcement Authority of an Alternate Inspection as provided herein. Such General Inspection
shall require the Rental Unit to meet the inspection check list promulgated by the Code
Enforcement Authority and any other applicable local and state property maintenance provisions
included as part of the inspection by the Code Enforcement Authority. Each General Inspection
shall apply to the Certificate of Occupancy issued for the Rental Unit inspected, and a new
General Inspection or approved Alternate Inspection shall be required for the issuance of a new
Certificate of Occupancy following the expiration for any reason of a prior Certificate of
Occupancy. Owners shall be notified in writing of any reason for failure of a General Inspection
and disapproval of a Certificate of Occupancy. For Rental Units that do not pass the General
Inspection, Owners may request one re-inspection for no additional fee following correction of the
issues identified by the Code Enforcement Authority or designated inspector. There shall be no
limit to the number of re-inspections authorized per Rental Unit, but there shall be an additional
fee as established by the Code Enforcement Authority per re-inspection after the initial reinspection.
§ 150.19 ALTERNATE INSPECTION.
In lieu of a General Inspection, it shall be a requirement to obtain a Certificate of Occupancy
to provide the Code Enforcement Authority proof of the Rental Unit passing an inspection, within
the past 6 months prior to applying for a Certificate of Occupancy, conducted by or at the
requirement of another governmental entity possessing authority to conduct or require property
inspections, that meets the minimum inspection requirements of the Code Enforcement Authority
and that is approved by the Code Enforcement Authority, as determined by regulations
promulgated by the Code Enforcement Authority consistent with this Section (“Alternate
Inspection”). Each approved Alternate Inspection shall apply to the Certificate of Occupancy
issued for the Rental Unit inspected, and a new approved Alternate Inspection or General
Inspection shall be required for the issuance of a new Certificate of Occupancy following the
expiration for any reason of a prior Certificate of Occupancy. Owners shall be notified in writing
of any reason for disapproval of an Alternate Inspection and disapproval of a Certificate of
Occupancy. For Rental Units that do not receive approval for an Alternate Inspection, Owners
may request a General Inspection as provided herein.
§ 150.20 SPECIAL INSPECTION.
A special inspection may be done at the discretion of the Code Enforcement Authority, upon
the written, signed request of any resident of the City, any governmental agency, or the Rental
Unit’s tenant, the tenant's legal representative, the Owner, or the Owner’s agent (a “Special
Inspection”). A Special Inspection shall be confined to the defects complained of, if any, by the
person requesting the inspection unless the Code Enforcement Authority determines that the
condition of the Rental Unit or premises has deteriorated since the last General Inspection to such
an extent that a complete inspection is required to effectuate the purposes of this Section, in which
case a complete new inspection of the entire Rental Unit and premises may be performed. If a
complete General Inspection is performed, a new Certificate of Occupancy shall be issued upon
passage of the General Inspection, with a duration as provided by the Code Enforcement
Authority pursuant to Section 150.17.1.
§ 150.21 INSPECTION; ENTRY TO PREMISES.
Unless waived by the Owner or tenant, the following procedure shall be used to obtain entry
to Rental Units for the purpose of any inspection. The Owner shall be contacted and a date shall
be established for inspection. The Owner shall then furnish to the Code Enforcement Authority or
designated inspector a current list of tenants in each affected Rental Unit. The Code Enforcement
Authority or designated inspector shall then send a letter and a postage-paid self-addressed
postcard by regular first class mail to each tenant so reported by the Owner. If there is evidence
that the tenant received the letter, but no other response is received from the tenant, consent to
enter will be presumed. An official record shall be maintained of all notices. The Owner shall be
responsible for granting access for inspection upon presentation of a copy of the official record of
notices and responses. If either the tenant or the Owner refuses entry for inspection after proper
notification, the Code Enforcement Authority or designated inspector shall not inspect without
first obtaining an inspection warrant from a court of competent jurisdiction.
§ 150.22 RETALIATORY EVICTION PROHIBITED.
It shall be a violation of this Section for any Owner or Owner’s agent to bring or threaten to
bring an action for possession of the Rental Unit for the purpose of retaliating against a tenant for
requesting a special inspection as provided for in this section.
§ 150.23 VIOLATION. In addition to any penalty that may be imposed pursuant to § 10.99 of
this Code for any violation of the Code, the Code Enforcement Authority may:
(A) Declare a Rental Unit to be unsafe pursuant to the Property Maintenance Code, or take other
action pursuant to that Code.
(B) Issue an emergency order where immediate action is required to protect the health and safety
of the public or of the occupants of the Rental Unit.
(C) Seek any of the additional remedies which provide for an appropriate action or proceeding at
law or in equity against the person responsible for the violation for the purpose of ordering the
person to:
(1) Restrain, correct or remove the violation or refrain from any further execution of work
causing a violation;
(2) Restrain or correct the erection, installation, or alteration of such structure;
(3) Require the removal of work in violation, or part thereof erected, construed, installed or
altered in violation of, or not in compliance with, the provisions of this Code, or in
violation of a plan or specification under which an approval, permit or certificate was
issued.
§ 150. 24 APPEALS.
Appeals of decisions of the Code Enforcement Authority pursuant to this Section may be
had to the City Council, in the same manner as appeals of nuisance declarations pursuant to this
Code.
§ 150.25 CIVIL ENFORCEMENT.
Any violation of this Section is hereby declared to be a nuisance under this Code, and as
such may be abated in a manner as nuisances are now or may hereafter be abated pursuant to this
Code, or may be enjoined and abated by a suit in equity, in the manner provided by law.

Section 4.15 Nonconforming, General Intent
It is the intent of this ordinance to permit lawful non-conformities to continue until they are removed, but not encourage their survival. Such uses are declared by this ordinance to be incompatible with permitted uses in the districts involved.

Section 4.16 Nonconforming Lots of Record
In any district, notwithstanding limitations imposed by other provision of this ordinance, a primary structure and customary accessory buildings may be erected on any single lot of record at the effective date of adoption or amendment of this ordinance.

ARTICLE 4: GENERAL PROVISIONS
FAIRBURY, NEBRASKA ¦ ZONING ORDINANCE ¦ 2013
45
4.17.02 Enlargement, Repair, Alterations: Any such structure described in Section 4.17.01 may be enlarged, maintained, repaired or remodeled, provided, however, that no such enlargement, maintenance, repair or remodeling shall either create any additional nonconformity or increase the degree of existing nonconformity of all or any part of such structure, except that as to structures located on a lot that does not comply with the applicable lot size requirements, the side yard requirements shall be in conformance with this section, and unless otherwise permitted by conditional use permit unless otherwise approved or as specified in the Residential District.
4.17.03 Damage or Destruction: In the event that any structure described in Section 4.17.01 is damaged or destroyed, by any means other than intentional destruction, to the extent of more than 50 percent of its structural value, such structure shall not be restored unless it shall thereafter conform to the regulations for the zoning district in which it is located; provided that structures located on a lot that does not comply with the applicable lot size requirements in Section 4.16, shall not have a side yard of less than five feet. When a structure is damaged to the extent of less than 50 percent of its structural value, no repairs or restoration shall be made unless a building permit is obtained and restoration is actually begun within one year after the date of such partial destruction and is diligently pursued to completion.
Complete reconstruction of a nonconforming structure may be allowed through a Conditional Use Permit if the structure is damaged or destroyed by natural means and not through intentional destruction or actions of the property owner or tenant. Reconstructed structures shall not be allowed to increase the level of nonconformity with regard to setbacks or lot coverage.
4.17.04 Moving: No structure shall be moved in whole or in part for any distance whatever, to any other location on the same or any other lot unless the entire structure shall thereafter conform to the regulations of the zoning district in which it is located after being moved.
Section 4.18 Nonconforming Uses
4.18.01 Nonconforming Uses of Land: Where at the effective date of adoption or amendment of this ordinance, lawful use of land exists that is made no longer permissible under the terms of this ordinance as enacted or amended, such use may be continued so long as it remains otherwise lawful, subject to the following provisions:
1. No such non-conforming use shall be enlarged or increased, nor extended to occupy a greater area of land than was occupied at the effective date of adoption or amendment or this ordinance, unless a Conditional Use Permit is granted;
2. No such nonconforming use shall be moved in whole or in part to any other portion of the lot or parcel occupied by such use at the effective date of adoption or amendment of this ordinance.
3. If any such nonconforming use of land ceases for any reason for a period of more than 12 consecutive months, any subsequent use of such land shall conform to the regulations specified by this ordinance for the district in which such land is located.
4.18.02 Nonconforming Uses of Structures: If a lawful use of a structure, or of structure and premises in combination, exists at the effective date of adoption or amendment of this ordinance, that would not be allowed in the district under the terms of this ordinance, the lawful use may be continued so long as it remains otherwise lawful subject to the following provisions:
1. No existing structure devoted to a use not permitted by this ordinance in the district in which it is located shall be enlarged, extended, constructed, reconstructed, moved or structurally altered except in changing the use of the structure to a use permitted in the district in which it is located, unless a Conditional Use Permit is granted;
2. Any nonconforming use may be extended throughout any parts of a building which were manifestly arranged or designed for such use at the time of adoption or amendment of this ordinance but no such use shall be extended to occupy any land outside such building;
3. If no structural alterations are made, any nonconforming use of a structure or structures and premises may be changed to another nonconforming use provided that the Board of Adjustment either by general rule or by making findings in the specific case, shall find that the proposed use is equally appropriate or more appropriate to the district than the existing nonconforming use. In permitting such change, the Board of Adjustment may
ARTICLE 4: GENERAL PROVISIONS
FAIRBURY, NEBRASKA ¦ ZONING ORDINANCE ¦ 2013
46
require appropriate conditions and safeguard in accord with the provisions of this ordinance;
4. Any structure, or structure and land in combination, in or on which a nonconforming use is superseded by a permitted use, shall thereafter conform to the regulations for the district in which such structure is located and the nonconforming use may not thereafter be resumed;
5. When a nonconforming use of a structure or structure and premises in combination is discontinued or abandoned for 12 consecutive months, the structure or structure and premises in combination shall not thereafter be used except in conformance with the regulations of the district in which it is located;
6. Where nonconforming use status is applied to a structure and premises in combination, removal or destruction of the structure shall eliminate the nonconforming status of the land.
Section 4.19 Repairs and Maintenance
4.19.01 On any building devoted in whole or in part to any nonconforming use, work may be done in any period of 12 consecutive months on ordinary repairs or on repair or replacement of non-bearing walls, fixtures, wiring or plumbing provided that the cubic content of the building as it existed at the time of passage of amendment of this ordinance shall not be increased.
4.19.02 Nothing in this ordinance shall be deemed to prevent the strengthening or restoring to a safe condition of any building or part thereof declared to be unsafe by any official charged with protecting the public safety, upon order of such official.
Section 4.20 Uses under Conditional Use Permit not Nonconforming Uses
Any use for which a special exception has been issued as provided in previous ordinances shall not be deemed a nonconforming use, but shall without further action be deemed a conforming use in such district.

3. No existing pool enclosure shall be removed, replaced or changed in a manner that reduces its effectiveness as a safety barrier.
4. The provisions of this section shall be applicable to all family pools, other than indoor pools, which have a minimum depth of 24 inches of water. No person in possession of land within the city limits, either as owner, purchaser, lessee, tenant or licensee, upon which is situated a family pool having a minimum depth of 24 inches shall fail to provide and maintain such fence or wall as herein provided.

ARTICLE 6: CONDITIONAL USE PERMITS
FAIRBURY, NEBRASKA ¦ ZONING ORDINANCE ¦ 2013
88
application will have no effect on the landmark or property in a landmark district as detailed in the particular designating ordinance and will be in harmony therewith. The Secretary of the Interior’s “Standards for Rehabilitation” and other such guidelines as may have been adopted shall be applied. For properties within landmark districts, an alteration must also be compatible with the historic character of the district. New construction shall be compatible with the landmark district in which it is located.
Applications shall be transmitted by the Preservation Committee, along with any recommendations by the Public Works Director and/or Zoning Administrator.
Within 60 days of receipt of the application by the Public Works Director and/or Zoning Administrator, the Preservation Committee shall hold a public hearing on the applications received. Notice of the time, place, and purpose of such hearing shall be published by the City of Fairbury in a newspaper of general circulation in the city and shall be served upon the applicant or agent thereof by personal service or by mail not less than 10 days prior to the date of hearing.

5.19.12 Certificate of Approval or Denial
Within 30 days of the hearing, the Preservation Committee shall approve or deny the application for the certificate for certain work on the landmark or in a historic district.
The Preservation Committee:
1. may issue a “certificate of appropriateness” if, after focusing upon aesthetic, historical, and architectural values, it finds that the proposed work would not unduly hinder the protection, enhancement, perpetuation, and use of the landmark, property within a landmark district or the landmark district;
2. may issue a “certificate of exception” on the ground of insufficient return or hardship if it finds that the landmark or property within the historic district cannot yield a reasonable return if the proposed work is not permitted, that the plight of the applicant is due to unique circumstances, and that the hardship is the result of the application of the ordinance and is not the result of any act or omission by the applicant; or
3. may refuse to issue a certificate, if it finds that the application does not meet any of the above criteria.
The Preservation Committee’s decision must be accompanied by written findings of fact. No change shall be made in the application for any building permit after issuance of a certificate by the Preservation Committee without resubmittal to the Preservation Committee and approval in the same manner as provided above.
5.19.13 Procedure Following Certificate Denial
If no certificate is issued, the applicant and the Preservation Committee shall enter into negotiations to develop a plan whereby modifications in the application would enable the Preservation Committee to issue a certificate under the criteria listed above and compatible with the guideline for preservation in the particular designation ordinance.
If the proposed work involves demolition of all or a significant portion of a landmark or property within a landmark district or involves construction upon open areas of a landmark or within a landmark district and no acceptable plan is negotiated and approved by the applicant within three months of the Preservation Committee’s decision not to issue a certificate, the City may proceed by eminent domain proceedings to acquire the landmark or the affected property within the landmark district. But if the city does not initiate proceedings within 90 days, the Preservation Committee shall issue a “certificate of allowance,” permitting the applicant to proceed with the work as proposed in the application.
ARTICLE 6: CONDITIONAL USE PERMITS
FAIRBURY, NEBRASKA ¦ ZONING ORDINANCE ¦ 2013
89
If the proposed work on a landmark or to a property within landmark district is other than the above and no acceptable plan is negotiated and approved by the applicant within three months of the Preservation Committee’s decision not to issue a certificate, the Preservation Committee shall issue a certificate of allowance permitting the applicant to proceed with the work as proposed in the application.
5.19.14 Hazardous Structures
The Preservation Committee shall issue a “certificate of allowance” on the grounds of hazardous conditions for razing a structure or other work if the Public Works Director has determined that the landmark or property within the landmark district poses an immediate hazard to human health and safety and that no alternative exists that would allow for saving the structure and protecting the public’s health and safety. However, if an owner shall, by deliberate acts or deliberate neglect allow a landmark or property within a landmark district to become hazardous to human health and safety with the intent of then obtaining such permit, no such permit shall be issued, and the City shall take steps to declare the structure a nuisance and/or unsafe building, and shall proceed under those provisions to ensure the owner shall take steps necessary to protect the public’s health and safety and to rehabilitate the structure, and failing to do so, the City shall do so, billing the costs to the owner.
5.19.15 Appeal
Any person aggrieved by any order, approval, disapproval, or other decision issued by the Preservation Committee or the Planning Commission, may appeal such order, approval, disapproval, or other decision to the City Council by filing a written appeal with the City Clerk within 30 days of such order.

Section 5.20 FP/FW Floodplain/Floodway District
5.20.01 Statutory Authorization, Findings of Fact and Purposes
1. Statutory Authorization
The Legislature of the State of Nebraska has delegated the responsibility to local governmental units to adopt zoning regulations designed to protect the public health, safety and general welfare. The Legislature, in Sections 31-1001 to 31-1022, R.R.S. 1943, has further assigned the responsibility to adopt, administer, and enforce floodplain management regulations to the county, city or village with zoning jurisdiction over the flood-prone area. Therefore, the City Council of the City of Fairbury, Nebraska, ordains as follows:
2. Findings of Fact
A. Flood Losses Resulting from Periodic Inundation
The flood hazard areas of the City of Fairbury, Nebraska, are subject to inundation which results in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare.
B. General Causes of the Flood Losses
These flood losses are caused by: (1) The cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains causing increases in flood heights and velocities, (2) The occupancy of flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods or hazardous to others, which are inadequately elevated or otherwise unprotected from flood damages.
C. Methods Used to Analyze Flood Hazards
This ordinance uses a reasonable method of analyzing flood hazards which consists of a series of interrelated steps.
1) Selection of a regulatory flood which is based upon engineering calculations which permit a consideration of such flood factors as its expected frequency of occurrence, the area inundated, and the depth of inundation. The base flood is selected for this ordinance. It is representative of large floods which are reasonably characteristic of what can be expected to occur on the particular streams subject to this ordinance. It is in the general order of a flood which could be expected to have a one percent (1%) chance of occurrence in any one year, as delineated on the Federal Insurance Administration's Flood Insurance Study, and illustrative materials dated August 17, 2015, and any future revisions thereto.
2) Calculation of water surface profiles based on a hydraulic engineering analysis of the capacity of the stream channel and overbank areas to convey the base flood.
3) Computation of the floodway required to convey this flood without increasing flood heights more than 1 foot at any point.
4) Delineation of floodway encroachment lines within which no obstruction is permitted which would cause any water surface increase along the floodway profile.
5) Delineation of floodway fringe, i.e., that area outside the floodway encroachment lines, but which still is subject to inundation by the base flood.
3. Statement Of Purpose
It is the purpose of this ordinance to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare and to minimize those losses described in Section 5.20.01 (2) (A) by applying the provisions of this ordinance to:
A. Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety, or property in times of flooding or cause undue increases in flood heights or velocities.
B. Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including public facilities which serve such uses, be provided with flood protection at the time of initial construction.
C. Protect individuals from buying lands which are unsuited for intended purposes because of flood hazard.
D. Assure that eligibility is maintained for property owners in the community to purchase flood insurance in the National Flood Insurance Program.
ARTICLE 6: CONDITIONAL USE PERMITS
FAIRBURY, NEBRASKA ¦ ZONING ORDINANCE ¦ 2013
93
5.20.02 General Provisions
1. Lands to Which Ordinance Applies
This ordinance shall apply to all lands within the jurisdiction of the City of Fairbury, Nebraska identified on the Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) and flood Insurance Study (FIS) dated August 17, 2015, and any revisions thereto, as numbered and unnumbered A Zones (including AE, AO and AH Zones) and within the Zoning Districts FW and FF established in Section 5.20.04 of this ordinance. In all areas covered by this ordinance no development shall be permitted except upon the issuance of a floodplain permit to develop, granted by the City Council or its duly designated representative under such safeguards and restrictions as the City Council or the designated representative may reasonably impose for the promotion and maintenance of the general welfare, health of the inhabitants of the community and where specifically noted in Sections 5.20.05, 5.20.06, and 5.20.07.
2. The Enforcement Officer
The Zoning Administrator of the community is hereby designated as the community's duly designated Enforcement Officer under this Ordinance.
3. Rules for Interpretation of District Boundaries
The boundaries of the floodway and flood fringe overlay districts shall be determined by scaling distances on the official zoning map or on the Flood Insurance Rate Map or Floodway Map. Where interpretation is needed to the exact location of the boundaries of the districts as shown on the official zoning map, as for example where there appears to be a conflict between a mapped boundary and actual field conditions, the Enforcement Officer shall make the necessary interpretation. In such cases where the interpretation is contested, the Board of Adjustment will resolve the dispute. The regulatory flood elevation for the point in question shall be the governing factor in locating the district boundary on the land. The person contesting the location of the district boundary shall be given a reasonable opportunity to present his case to the Board of Adjustment and to submit his own technical evidence, if he so desires.
4. Compliance
Within identified special flood hazard areas of this community, no development shall be located, extended, converted or structurally altered without full compliance with the terms of this ordinance and other applicable regulations.
5. Abrogation and Greater Restrictions
It is not intended by this ordinance to repeal, abrogate or impair any existent easements, covenants, or deed restrictions. However, where this ordinance imposes greater restrictions, the provision of this ordinance shall prevail. All other ordinances inconsistent with this ordinance are hereby repealed to the extent of the inconsistency only.
6. Interpretation
In their interpretation and application, the provisions of this ordinance shall be held to be minimum requirements and shall be liberally construed in favor of the governing body and shall not be deemed a limitation or repeal of any other powers granted by state statutes.
7. Warning and Disclaimer of Liability
The degree of flood protection required by this ordinance is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on engineering and scientific methods of study. Larger floods may occur on rare occasions or the flood height may be increased by man-made or natural causes, such as ice jams and bridge openings restricted by debris. This ordinance does not imply that areas outside floodway and flood fringe district boundaries or land uses permitted within such districts will be free from flooding or flood damage. This ordinance shall not create liability on the part of City of Fairbury, Nebraska or any officer or employee thereof for any flood damages that may result from reliance on this ordinance or any administrative decision lawfully made thereunder.
8. Severability
ARTICLE 6: CONDITIONAL USE PERMITS
FAIRBURY, NEBRASKA ¦ ZONING ORDINANCE ¦ 2013
94
If any section, clause, provision or portion of this ordinance is adjudged unconstitutional or invalid by a court of competent jurisdiction, the remainder of this ordinance shall not be affected thereby.
9. Appeal
Where a request for a permit to develop or a variance is denied by the Zoning Administrator the applicant may apply for such permit or variance directly to the Board of Adjustment.
5.20.03 Development Permit
1. Permit Required
No person, firm or corporation shall initiate any floodplain development or substantial improvement or cause the same to be done without first obtaining a separate permit for development as defined in Section 5.20.12.
2. Administration

5. Conditions for Variances
A. Generally, variances may be issued for new construction and substantial improvements to be erected on a lot of one-half acre or less in size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed below the base flood level, providing items (5.20.08 (5)(B) – 5.20.08 (5)(F) below) have been fully considered. As the lot size increases beyond the one-half acre, the technical justification required for issuing the variance increases.
B. Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic structures upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a historic structure and the variance is the minimum necessary to preserve the historic character and design of the structure.
C. Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any increase in flood levels along the floodway profile during the base flood discharge would result.
D. Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief.
E. Variances shall only be issued upon (i) a showing of good and sufficient cause, (ii) a determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship to the applicant, and (iii) a determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create nuisances, cause fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances.
F. The applicant shall be given a written notice over the signature of a community official that (1) the issuance of a variance to construct a structure below the base flood level will result in increased premium rates for flood insurance up to amounts as high as $25.00 for $100.00 of insurance coverage and (2) such construction below the base flood level increases risks to life and property. Such notification shall be maintained with the record of all variance actions as required by this ordinance.
5.20.09 Nonconforming Use
1. A structure or the use of a structure or premises which was lawful before the passage or amendment of the ordinance, but which is not in conformity with the provisions of this ordinance may be continued subject to the following conditions:

"Appeal" means a request for a review of the Zoning Administrator’s interpretation of any provision of this ordinance or a request for a variance.
"Area of Shallow Flooding" means a designated AO or AH zone on a community's Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) with a one percent or greater annual chance of flooding to an average depth of one to three feet where a clearly defined channel is unpredictable and where velocity flow may be evident. Such flooding is characterized by ponding or sheet flow.
"Base Flood" means the flood having one percent chance of being equaled or exceeded in any given year.
"Basement" means any area of the building having its floor subgrade (below ground level) on all sides.
"Development" means any man-made change to improved or unimproved real estate, including but not limited to buildings or other structures, mining, dredging, filling, grading, paving, excavation or drilling operations or storage of equipment or materials.

B. Height Limit: The height limit of the approach zones begins at the elevation of the operation zone and rises one foot vertically for every 50 feet horizontally (50:1) up to a maximum of 150 feet above the nearest existing or proposed runway end. At three miles from such operation zone, the height limit resumes sloping one foot vertically for every 50 feet horizontally and continues to the 10-mile limit.
2. Visual Runways:
A. Length and Width: The approach zones extend from the operation zone to the limits of the turning zone, measured along the extended runway centerline. The approach zones are 500 feet wide at the end nearest the runway and expand uniformly so that at a point on the extended runway centerline three miles from the operation zone, the approach zone is 3,700 feet wide.
B. Height: The height limit of the approach zones begins at the elevation of the operation zone and rises one foot vertically for every 40 feet horizontally (40:1) up to a maximum of 150 feet above the nearest existing or proposed runway end.
Operation Zones are longitudinally centered on each existing or proposed runway:
1. Length:
a. For existing and proposed paved runways, the operation zones begin and end 200 feet beyond the end of each runway.
b. For existing and proposed turf runways, the operation zones begin and end at the runway ends.
c. For existing and proposed instrument runways, the operation zone is 1,000 feet wide, with 500 hundred feet on either side of the runway centerline.
d. For all other existing and proposed runways, the operation zone is 500 feet wide, with 250 feet on either side of the runway centerline;
2. Height: The height limit of the operation zones is the same as the nearest point on an existing or proposed runway or the surface of the ground, whichever is higher.
Transition Zones extend outward at right angles to the runway centerline and upward at a rate of one foot vertically for every seven feet horizontally (7:1). The height limit of these zones begins at the height limit of the adjacent operation zones or approach zones. The transition zones end at a height of 150 feet above the nearest existing or proposed runway end.
Turning Zones extend three miles as a radius from the corners of the operation zone of each runway and connecting adjacent arcs with tangent lines, excluding any area within the approach zone, operation zone, or transition zone. The height limit of the turning zones is 150 feet above the nearest existing or proposed runway end.

ARTICLE 6: CONDITIONAL USE PERMITS
FAIRBURY, NEBRASKA ¦ ZONING ORDINANCE ¦ 2013
107
regulations. A permit shall be granted under this subsection if the applicant shows that the replacement, alteration, repair, reconstruction, growth, or replanting of the nonconforming structure, tree, or nonconforming use would not result in an increase in height or a greater hazard to air navigation than the condition that existed when the applicable regulation was adopted. For nonconforming structures other than electric facilities, no permit under this subsection shall be required for repairs necessitated by fire, explosion, act of God, or the common enemy or for repairs which do not involve expenditures exceeding more than sixty percent of the fair market value of the nonconforming structure, so long as the height of the nonconforming structure is not increased over its preexisting height.

An electric supplier owning or operating an electric facility made nonconforming by the adoption of airport zoning regulations under the Airport Zoning Act may, without a permit or other approval by the political subdivision adopting such regulations, repair, reconstruct, or replace such electric facility if the height of such electric facility is not increased over its preexisting height. Any construction, repair, reconstruction, or replacement of an electric facility, the height of which will exceed the preexisting height of such electric facility, shall require a permit from the political subdivision adopting such regulations. The permit shall be granted only upon a showing that the excess height of the electric facility will not establish or create an airport hazard or become a greater hazard to air navigation than the electric facility that previously existed.
5.21.08 MARKING OF NON-CONFORMING STRUCTURES
Whenever the Zoning Administrator determines that a specific structure or object in the Airport Hazard Area exceeds the height restrictions and existed prior to the promulgation of these regulations, the owner(s) and/or the lessor(s) of the premises on which the structure or object is located shall be notified in writing by the Zoning Administrator. The owner(s) and lessor(s) shall, within a reasonable time, permit the marking and lighting of the structure or object. The Zoning Administrator shall specify the required marking and lighting, consistent with these regulations entitled “Marking and Lighting of Structures”. The cost of marking or lighting shall not be assessed against the owner or lessor of said premises.
5.21.09 ADMINISTRATIVE AGENCY; ENFORCEMENT
The Zoning Administrator shall administer and enforce these regulations and shall be the administrative agency provided for in Neb. Rev. Stat. § 3-319 (Reissue 2007), and shall have all the powers and perform all the duties of the administrative agency as provided in the Airport Zoning Act.
5.21.10 VARIANCE FROM REGULATIONS

Any person desiring to erect any structure, increase the height of any structure, permit the growth of any tree, or otherwise use his or her property in a manner inconsistent with the airport zoning regulations adopted under this regulation may apply to the board of adjustment for a variance from the zoning regulations in question. Such variances shall be allowed only if the board of adjustment makes the same findings for the granting of variances generally as set forth in subsection section 19-907 through 19-912.01, except that if the applicant demonstrates that the proposed structure or alteration of a structure does not require any modification or revision to any approach or approach procedure as approved or written by the Federal Aviation Administration on either an existing or proposed runway and the applicant provides signed documentation from the Federal Aviation Administration that the proposed structure or alteration of the structure will not require any modification or revision of any airport minimums, such documentation may constitute evidence of undue hardship and the board of adjustment may grant the requested variance without such findings. Any variance
ARTICLE 6: CONDITIONAL USE PERMITS
FAIRBURY, NEBRASKA ¦ ZONING ORDINANCE ¦ 2013
108
may be allowed subject to any reasonable conditions that the board of adjustment may deem necessary to effectuate the purposes of this regulation.
2. In granting any permit under or variance from any airport zoning regulation adopted under this regulation, the administrative agency or board of adjustment may, if it deems such action is advisable to effectuate the purposes of the regulation and reasonable in the circumstances, so condition such permit or variance as to require the owner of the structure or tree in question to permit the political subdivision, at its own expense, to install, operate, and maintain thereon such markers and lights as may be necessary to indicate to flyers the presence of an airport hazard.
5.21.11 ZONING BOARD OF ADJUSTMENT

The height of a sign shall be computed as the distance from the base of the sign at normal grade to the top of the highest attached component of the sign. In cases in which the normal grade cannot reasonably be determined, sign height shall be computed on the assumption that the elevation of the normal grade at the base of the sign is equal to the elevation of the nearest point of the crown of a public street or the grade of the land at the principal entrance to the principal structure on the lot, parcel, or tract of land, whichever is lower. When a sign is placed on a berm, the height of the sign shall include the height of the berm above grade level at the base of the berm.

Section 9.03 Wireless Communication Towers
9.03.01 Intent:
Based upon the Communications Act of 1934, as amended by the Telecommunications Act of 1996 (the Act) grants the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) exclusive jurisdiction over certain aspects of telecommunication services. This section is intended to regulate towers, telecommunications facilities and antennas in the City in conformance with the Act without prohibiting or tending to prohibit any person from providing wireless telecommunication service.
The regulation of telecommunication facilities, towers and antennas in the City, is intended to protect residential areas and land uses from potential adverse impact from the installation of towers and antennas through:
1. The careful design, siting, and camouflaging,
2. The promotion and encouragement of shared use/collocation of towers and other antenna support structures rather than the construction of additional single use towers,
3. The avoidance of potential damage to property caused by towers, telecommunications facilities and antennas by ensuring such structures are soundly and carefully designed, constructed, modified, maintained, repaired and removed when no longer used or are determined to be structurally unsound and to ensure that towers and antennas are compatible with surrounding land uses.

2. Such hardship is not shared generally by other properties in the same zoning district and the same vicinity; and
3. The authorization of such variance will not be of substantial detriment to adjacent property and the character of the district will not be changed by the granting of the variance; and
4. The granting of such variance is based upon reasons of demonstrable and exceptional hardship as distinguished from variations for purposes of convenience, profit or caprice. No variance shall be authorized unless the Board finds that the condition or situation of the property concerned or the intended use of the property is not of so general or recurring a nature as to make reasonably practicable the formulation of a general regulation to be adopted as an amendment to this Ordinance.
In exercising the above mentioned powers, the Board may reverse or affirm, wholly or partly, or may modify the order, requirement, decision or determination appealed from, and may make such order, requirement, decision or determination as ought to be made, and to that end shall have all the powers of the officer from whom the appeal is taken. The concurring vote of four members of the Board shall be necessary to reverse any order, requirement, decision or determination of any such administrative official, or to decide in favor of the applicant on any matter upon which it is required to pass under this Ordinance or to effect any variation in this Ordinance.

ARTICLE 4: “GHOST” PLATTING AND BUILD-THROUGH ACREAGE REQUIREMENTS
Section 4.01 Scope of Regulations.
The regulations set forth in this Article are the regulations of the BTA Build-through Acreage policies. The
regulations set forth in this Article shall only apply to applications for development submitted after
________________, 2013.
Section 4.02 Purpose.
The purpose of this Article is to provide a mechanism for approval of short-term acreage development in
portions of the City of Fairbury’s zoning jurisdiction that are unlikely to receive urban services, and
consequent urban density development, within the next 10 to 20 years. These regulations are intended to
allow owners the opportunity to realize a reasonable return on their property and to accommodate a
continuing demand for acreage development without obstructing future urban development. The BTA
Overlay District allows owners to develop a portion of their property with low-density residential
development, while reserving the majority of the property for future long-term development with urban
services. It also provides for the eventual transition of the previously developed acreage residential use to
higher densities with the extension of urban services.
Section 4.03 Applicability
The BTA requirements apply to all land designated as LDR Low Density Residential in the Future Land Use
Plan and zoned TA or R-1 in the zoning regulations but within the extraterritorial zoning jurisdiction of
Fairbury.
Section 4.04 “Ghost” Platting Requirements
The following requirements shall be provided to the City as indicated in any area designated as a “buildthrough”
area as stated in Section 4.03.
1. A final plot plan for the “Ghost” platting component shall be accurately, clearly, and legibly drawn in a
sufficient size and scale to show the details of the plan clearly and shall contain the information
required for final plot plans in Article 3 and the following requirements:
a. Building envelopes shown on lots in the final plot plan shall meet required setbacks for the lots
shown under the future final plot plan providing for conversion of the “Ghost” platting component to
higher urban residential density.
b. The drainage and site grading plans shall include both the proposed acreage layout and the future
drainage at urban residential densities. The development shall be designed to drain and grade both
components in accordance with the future final plot plan for the acreage development and the
proposed urban density. Final and rough grading of the acreage development shall be accomplished
as set forth in these regulations.
2. A future final plot plan providing for conversion from acreages to higher urban residential density shall
be accurately, clearly, and legibly drawn in a sufficient size and scale to show the details of the plan
clearly and shall contain the information required for final plot plans in Article 3 of these regulations and
the following information:
a. Final lot lines that will be implemented with the extension of urban infrastructure and annexation by
the City.
b. The location and layout of any future streets not dedicated and improved as part of the final plot
plan for the acreage development, but needed in the future to convert the acreage development to
an urban density development.
c. Easement locations for future utilities and stormwater drainage.
d. Building envelopes which meet required setbacks under the conversion.
e. A Master Plan providing an urban framework for future development which establishes the major
systems that serve the overall development, documenting the future relationships between the
acreage development. This Master Plan shall be accurately, clearly and legibly drawn in a sufficient
size and scale to show the details of the plan clearly and shall contain the following information:
(1) The layout of arterial and collector streets on the site. These will typically include streets
approximately on half section lines, along with connections to adjacent parcels.
(2) Major infrastructure lines, including water distribution, sanitary sewers, and storm sewers, if
part of the stormwater management plan.
(3) A master stormwater management plan, indicating general grading concepts and directions,
stormwater retention and detention structures, and storm sewers.
(4) Easements and dedications for all major utility services.
(5) Proposed parks, open spaces, trails, and greenways.
FAIRBURY, NEBRASKA • SUBDIVISION ORDINANCE • 2013 18
(6) Resource conservation or preservation areas, including wetlands, wooded areas, streams and
waterways, and other features that will be maintained and incorporated into future
development concepts.
(7) The Master Plan shall provide a minimum gross residential density of no less than four units per
acre on the portion of the site that is to be developed for urban residential purposes.
(8) The Master Plan may propose a land use master plan, displaying the location and relationship
of various uses, but such a plan is not a requirement for approval.
f. For a “ghost” plat located within the jurisdiction of Fairbury, the Council shall require the execution
of a written agreement with the City relating to conversion of the acreage development to higher
urban density and the future annexation of the subdivision as a whole and the implementation of
the Master Plan for the future development of the urban density of the clustered/mixed use
development. The written agreement shall include, but not be limited to, the following provisions:
(1) The timing of annexation and the final platting of the urban density areas following the
extension of sanitary sewer and water utilities to the subdivision;
(2) A plan for funding infrastructure cost for conversion of the acreage development and
implementation of the master plan for the urban residential density, including an agreement to
agree to petition for the creation of special assessment districts for the installation of such
improvements if not installed by the permittee at permittee’s own cost and expense. If after a
public hearing, the Planning Commission finds that the proposed clustered/mixed use
development does not meet the above requirements for approval, the Planning Commission
may deny the application or approve the application upon condition that the applicant makes
specific changes in the proposed community unit plan which will remove the objection. In the
event the Planning Commission fails to act upon the application within sixty days from the date
the application is referred to the Planning Commission, the applicant may appeal to the City
Council requesting final action. If the City Council determines that the delay of the Planning
Commission is unjustified, it shall direct the Commission to act no later than the Commission’s
next regularly scheduled meeting.
Section 4.05 Special Requirements for “Ghost” Plats
The following special requirements shall be provided to the City and completed as indicated and required by
this Ordinance.
1. All platted streets required to be platted as part of the “Ghost” plat shall be protected as a part of the
initial installation of improvements and street during the acreage development phase.
2. All “Ghost” plats shall be required to have easements placed at a minimum of five feet either side of a
proposed future property line (urban residential density) and around the perimeter of the acreage
density lots.
3. A Subdivision Agreement that will require the owner(s) at the owner’s expense:
a. To complete the installation of the permanent markers prior to construction on or conveyance of
any lot in the plat.
b. To comply with the provisions of this Ordinance regarding land preparation and grading.
c. To notify all potential purchasers of all lots that said lots are subject to future subdivision and
additional future urban residential development when (1) the sanitary sewer and water mains have

rezoned to a district allowing for higher urban density.
d. To notify all potential purchasers of lots that an identified Outlot, identified on a final plat as
Reserved for Future Platting to Urban Density, is subject to future urban residential development
when (1) the sanitary sewer and water mains have been extended to serve the final plat; (2) the
Outlot has been annexed; and (3) the Outlot has been zoned to a district allowing for higher urban
density.
e. To install water mains to all lots at the owners own cost and expense within 12 months following
annexation of said lots into the City of Fairbury, unless a water district is created by the City Council
for the water mains and the water mains are finally ordered constructed within six months following
said annexation.
f. In the event any infrastructure improvements including but not limited to water mains, street
paving, sidewalks, street trees, stormwater and ornamental street lighting are ordered constructed
pursuant to a special assessment district Subdivider (1) agrees and consents that the costs thereof
shall be assessed and levied together with assessment and equalization costs, against the
benefited properties in the ____________________ Addition, waiving all objections to the sufficiency
of the petitions therefore, to the proceedings and (2) agrees to pay to the City of Fairbury said costs
as thus assessed and levied against said property.
FAIRBURY, NEBRASKA • SUBDIVISION ORDINANCE • 2013 19

ARTICLE 5: DESIGN STANDARDS
Section 5.01 General
No subdivision shall be approved unless it is in conformance with the requirements of these regulations and
the Comprehensive Development Plan.
In subdividing property, consideration shall be given to suitable sites for schools, parks, playgrounds, and
other common areas for public use so as to best conform to any recommendations of the Comprehensive
Development Plan. Any provisions for schools, parks, and playgrounds should be indicated on the
Preliminary Plat in order that it may be determined when and in what manner such areas will be provided or
acquired by an appropriate agency.
Land which the Planning Commission has found to be unsuitable for subdividing, due to flooding, poor
drainage, steep slopes, rock formation, or other features likely to be harmful to the safety, welfare or health
of the future residents, shall not be subdivided unless adequate methods for subdivision are formulated by
the developer and approved by the Planning Commission that would eliminate or substantially reduce such
hazards.
The Planning Commission may require all contiguous land under common ownership to be submitted with
the Preliminary Plan in order to evaluate overall development patterns and conformity with the
Comprehensive Development Plan and issue proper extension of future roads and services.
Section 5.02 Streets
The arrangement, character, extent, width, grade and location of all streets shall conform to the
Comprehensive Development Plan and shall be considered in their relation to existing and planned streets,
to topographical conditions, to public convenience and safety, and in their appropriate relation to the
proposed uses of land to be serviced by such streets. All streets shall meet applicable AASHTO standards
and shall conform to the minimum design standards set by the Nebraska Board of Public Roads
Classification and Standards. See Schedule A, Section 5.25 for Minimum Street Standards.
The street layout of the proposed subdivision shall provide for the continuation or appropriate projection of
streets and alleys already existing in areas adjacent to the area being subdivided. Where, at the
determination of the Planning Commission, it is desirable to provide street access to adjoining properties,
proposed streets shall be extended by dedication to the boundaries of the subdivision. Where the Planning
Commission deems it necessary, such dead-end streets shall be provided with a temporary turnaround
having a right-of-way radius of at least 50 feet and a paved radius (usually crushed rock) of 30 feet, or other
approved design.
Section 5.03 Dedication of Rights-of-Way for New Streets
The dedications of rights-of-way for new streets measured from lot line to lot line shall be shown on the plat
and shall meet the right-of-way requirements as stated in See Schedule A, Section 5.25 of this Ordinance.
The City shall approve access to lots located on arterials.
Where a subdivision fronts on an arterial street, the Planning Commission shall, where possible, require
frontage roads. Where lots back up to an arterial street and such lots have access by means other than the
arterial street, a frontage road may not be required.
Section 5.04 Dedication of Rights-of-Way for Existing Streets
Subdivisions platted along existing streets shall dedicate additional Right-of-Way or easements if necessary
to meet the minimum street width requirements set forth in this Ordinance. The entire minimum Right-of-
Way width shall be dedicated where the subdivision is on both sides of an existing street. When the
subdivision is located on only one side of an existing street, one half of the required Right-of-Way width,
measured from the centerline of the existing roadway, shall be dedicated along with any proposed
easements.
Section 5.05 Frontage Roads
Where a front or side yard abuts railroad, limited access freeway, or principal highway or arterial street
rights-of-way, a marginal access street or frontage road may be required parallel and adjacent to the
boundary of such rights-of-way when necessary for adequate protection of properties from the arterial street
and to protect and preserve the safety and traffic handling capabilities of the arterial street. The distance
from said rights-of-way shall be determined, with due consideration to minimum distance required for
approach connections to future grade-separated intersections. In the case of lots where the rear yard is
FAIRBURY, NEBRASKA • SUBDIVISION ORDINANCE • 2013 21
adjacent to an arterial street and such lots have access other than of off the arterial street frontage, a
frontage road may not be required.
Section 5.06 Intersections
Streets shall intersect as nearly as possible at an angle of 90 degrees, and no intersection shall be
constructed at an angle of less than 60 degrees. Street curb intersections shall be rounded by radii of at
least 20 feet. Larger intersection radii may be required in industrial or commercial area or when directed by
the City Engineer. When the smallest angle of street intersection is less than 75 degrees, the Planning
Commission may require curb radii of greater length.
Access onto any street intersecting an arterial street shall be located no closer to the right-of-way of such
arterial street than 75 feet, or more at the discretion of the City Engineer.
Consideration shall be given to street and right-of-way widths such that minimum sidewalk requirements are
maintained.
Section 5.07 Curves in Streets; Horizontal and Vertical
A tangent of at least 100 feet in length shall be introduced between reversed curves on arterial and collector
streets.
Where there is a deflection angle of more than 10 degrees in the horizontal alignment of a street, a curve
shall be installed with a radius adequate to ensure safe sight distances. Maximum requirements shall
conform to the standards in Schedule A of this Ordinance.
Minimum sight distances shall meet applicable AASHTO standards and shall conform to the minimum
design standards set by the Nebraska Board of Public Roads Classifications and Standards.
Section 5.08 Street Grades and Elevations
All streets shall be designed so as to provide for the discharge of surface water from the pavement and from
the right-of-way by grading and drainage. The minimum street grade shall not be less than four tenths of one
percent (0.4%). Minimum grades for gutters and ditches shall be four tenths and five tenths of one percent
(0.4% and 0.5%), respectively. The City may allow lesser slopes if approved by the City Engineer. Fill may be
used in areas subject to flooding in order to elevate streets and building pads provided such fill will not
increase flood elevations more than one foot. Street grades shall conform to the maximum requirements
provided in Schedule A of this Ordinance.
Section 5.09 Access Control
In the interest of public safety and for the preservation of the traffic-carrying capacity of the street system,
the Planning Commission and City Council shall have the right to restrict and regulate points of access to all
property from the public street system. Such restrictions shall be indicated on the Final Plat.
Section 5.10 Street Jogs
Street jogs with centerline offsets of less than 150 feet at intersections shall be prohibited.
Section 5.11 Cul-de-sac Streets
Cul-de-sacs shall not be longer than 500 feet and shall provide a turnaround having a radius at the outside
of the pavement of at least 50 feet and a radius at the right-of-way of at least 110 feet. Alternative designs
for temporary turnarounds may be approved by the City. Streets dead-ending or terminating in a temporary
turnaround shall not have a length greater than 500 feet or a radius at the right-of-way less than 60 feet.
Cul-de-sac and temporary turnarounds shall be measured from the center of the cul-de-sac or temporary
turnaround to the nearest right-of-way line of the intersecting street.
Section 5.12 Street Names
Proposed streets, which are in alignment with other existing streets, shall bear the name of such other
existing streets. The name of a proposed street which is not in alignment with an existing street shall not be
named so similarly to the name of any existing street as to cause confusion. To avoid duplication and
confusion, the proposed names of all streets shall be approved by the City Council prior to such names being
assigned or used.
Section 5.13 Private Streets and Reserve Strips
New private streets may be created as part of a planned development district provided such streets are
specifically authorized by the Planning Commission and City Council as an exception to the terms of the
FAIRBURY, NEBRASKA • SUBDIVISION ORDINANCE • 2013 22
Ordinance. There shall be no reserve strips in a subdivision except where their control is definitely vested in
the municipality under conditions of approval by the Planning Commission as authorized in these
regulations.

Alleys may be required in commercial, industrial, and residential areas. Dead-end alleys shall be avoided,
however, where a dead-end alley cannot be avoided, a dead-end alley shall be provided with adequate
turnaround capacity at the dead-end. Alleys should be avoided in residential areas except where an existing
alley of an adjoining subdivision would dead-end at the boundary of the proposed subdivision.
Section 5.15 Water Lines and Hydrants
All water mains within a subdivision shall be a minimum of six inches in diameter and/or shall be looped,
unless a dead-end is approved by the City Engineer. Hydrants shall be placed on the corners of each block or
with a maximum spacing not exceed 400 feet.
Section 5.16 Water Mains and Sewer Mains
Except for good cause, all water mains and sewer mains shall be located within the street right-of-way, but
not under the pavement located thereon. Further, all manholes shall not be placed in the proposed
driveways of residential subdivisions.
Section 5.17 Sidewalks
All sidewalks within a subdivision shall have a minimum pavement width of four feet or match existing and
shall be located in the street right-of-way adjacent to the residential lot line unless otherwise approved.
Section 5.18 Blocks
In determining the lengths, widths and shapes of blocks, consideration shall be given to the provision of
adequate access and circulation, the suitability of building sites to the needs of the use contemplated, and
the zoning requirements regarding minimum lot sizes, widths and frontages of the anticipated zoning
district. Except in unusual circumstances approved by the City, block lengths shall not exceed 600 feet.
Pedestrian easements 10 feet wide shall be provided through or near the center of blocks more than 600
feet long in order to provide for adequate pedestrian circulation.
Section 5.19 Lots
The size, width, depth, shape and orientation of lots shall conform to the regulations of the applicable zoning
district for the type of development and use contemplated. All lots shall be developed so that surface
drainage is diverted to lot lines and not across adjacent properties. Corner lots for residential uses shall be
designed with adequate width to permit appropriate building setback distances and orientation to both
streets. The subdividing of land shall be such as to provide each lot with satisfactory vehicular access from a
public street or an approved private street. Side lot lines shall be designed as close as possible to be
perpendicular to street right-of-way lines or radial to cul-de-sac center points.
Section 5.20 Through Lots
Through lots shall be avoided, except where essential to provide separation of residential development from
arterial streets or to overcome specific disadvantages of topography. Where such lots are used in relation to
an arterial street, a landscape screen easement of at least 10 feet in width shall be provided along the
property line of such lots abutting such arterial street. Within this easement, the subdivider shall install
trees, shrubbery or fences or a combination thereof to screen the residential development form the arterial
street and dampen the noise generated by traffic on the arterial street.
Section 5.21 Easements
Easements across lots or centered on rear or side lot lines shall be provided for utilities where necessary and

development runoff shall not exceed pre-development runoff by more than five percent, based upon a 10-
FAIRBURY, NEBRASKA • SUBDIVISION ORDINANCE • 2013 23
year storm event or as determined by the City engineer. Pre-development shall be the condition prior to
improvements being completed. In determining the size or type of the storm sewer system to be used, the
design shall be sufficient to handle all computed runoff from the proposed development. For large drainage
areas, natural drainage ways shall be maintained, and the City may require cross drainage structures such
as culverts, bridges, etc.
Section 5.23 Flood Hazards
Land subject to flooding and land deemed to be topographically unsuitable for residential or other
development shall not be platted for such purposes. Such land may be set aside on the plat for such uses
compatible with the hazards associated with flooding or erosion. All development shall conform to the flood
hazard zoning provisions of the Zoning Ordinance.
Section 5.24 Conformance with Other Regulations
No Final Plat of land within the City or its jurisdictional area shall be approved unless it conforms with
existing zoning regulations. Whenever there is a conflict between the standards set forth in these
regulations and those contained in other regulations the highest standard shall govern.

ARTICLE 6: REQUIRED IMPROVEMENTS
Section 6.01 General
The subdivider shall design and construct improvements using standards not less than the standards
outlined in this Ordinance. The Planning Commission and City Council upon recommendation of the City
Engineer shall approve all such plans.
The work shall be done under the supervision and inspection of the City and shall be completed within the
time limitations established herein. The minimum requirements for materials shall be in accordance with
specifications approved by the City. Standards applicable to health and sanitation as required by the
Nebraska Department of Environmental Quality and the Nebraska Department of Health and Human
Services shall be the minimum standards required thereof.
All inspection costs and costs for required tests shall be paid by the subdivider.
Section 6.02 Monuments and Markers
6.02.01 Monuments and markers placement shall be located at all quarter section points or other
reference points tied to the federal land survey on the boundaries of or within the area being
platted.
6.02.02 Monument Construction. Monument construction shall meet or exceed the "Minimum Standards
for Surveys," as the same may be amended from time to time, as adopted by the Professional
Surveyors Association of Nebraska in February 1989. These standards are as follows:
The surveyor shall establish or confirm the prior establishment of permanent monuments at each
corner on the boundary lines of the parcel being surveyed. Monuments shall be solid and
substantially free from movement. In such cases where the placement of a permanent
monument at the true corner is impractical because of instability or is likely to be destroyed, the
surveyor shall set a corner accessory monument and show its relationship by dimension to the
true corner.
The monuments set shall be constructed of material capable of being detected by commonly
used magnetic locators. These monuments shall consist of an iron pipe or steel rod with a
minimal diameter of five-eighths (5/8) inch and minimal length of 24 inches. When extenuating
circumstances dictate, the surveyor may use monuments (i.e., nail and washer) that have a
probability of permanence. Where a corner or a line falls on or within a wall, column line or other
physical feature and the placement of a monument is not feasible, the wall, column line or
physical feature shall become the monument by reference thereto.
In addition, monuments shall be set at all block corners, lot corners, deflection points and points
of curvature, except in cases where it is deemed clearly unreasonable or infeasible by the City
Council.
Section 6.03 Street Grading, Construction and Surface Type
6.03.01 All streets shall be graded to a minimum distance 15 feet from the back of the curb or edge of
pavement and to within six inches of the street grade established in the approved Final Plat
construction plans and specifications.
Design standards for the excavation and preparation of the road bed shall be approved by the City
Engineer. Where unusual soil conditions, extra-ordinary traffic volumes, or other abnormal
characteristics exist, the City Engineer may approve alternate design standards to address such
condition, if possible.
6.03.02 Concrete curbs and gutters shall be required for all streets within the boundaries of the
subdivision unless an exception is granted by the Planning Commission and City Council in
accordance with the terms of this Ordinance.

3,625,” and shall conform to Division 600 of the Nebraska State Standard Specifications.
Minimum compressive strength shall be 3,625 psi in 28 days. To verify compressive strength of
the concrete, a set of three all concrete test cylinders shall be made according to ASTM C-31 and
C-39. One set of concrete cylinders shall be required for each day’s concrete placement or for
FAIRBURY, NEBRASKA • SUBDIVISION ORDINANCE • 2013 25
each 100 cubic yards of concrete placed if, more than 100 cubic yards are placed in one day. The
concrete cylinders shall be tested by an approved testing laboratory and results of the testing
furnished to the City Engineer. Testing shall be conducted at seven days and 28 days from the
date of cylinder casting.
6.03.04 All materials used shall conform to Nebraska State Standard Specifications for Highway
Construction, Division 1000, and Material Details. Curing shall be accomplished with a
continuous coating of white pigmented curing compound conforming to the requirements of
Section 1012 of the Nebraska State Standard Specifications.
Section 6.04 Street Signs, Lighting and Electrical Power
6.04.01 At least one street sign shall be installed at each street intersection within or on the perimeter of

the area between the street and sidewalk at a point approximately six inches from said sidewalk or
its intended location.
6.04.02 The developer shall provide and install street lights at each entrance (street or sidewalk) into a
subdivision and at each street intersection within the subdivision and at such intermediate points as
necessary, as specified by Fairbury Light and Water and/or the City Engineer.
6.04.03 New subdivision lighting and electrical power shall be installed underground. The location of
easements for such wiring shall be indicated on the Preliminary and Final Plats. All underground
wiring shall conform to installation specifications required by the Nebraska State Electrical Code.
Section 6.05 Landscape Screens
Landscape screens as required by the City shall be installed at the subdivider's expense as a buffer for the
protection of residential properties along arterial and collector streets, state and federal highways, county
roads, railroad rights-of-way, and land uses which are substantially different from that proposed in the
subdivision.
Section 6.06 Drainage
6.06.01 A drainage management system shall be designed and constructed by the subdivider to provide for
the proper drainage of surface water within the subdivision.
1. Preliminary Plat Report shall include:
a). Preliminary estimates of the quantity of storm water entering the subdivision both naturally
and once there has been full development of lots within the subdivision.
b). An analysis of existing conditions of the watershed that may affect the proposed
subdivision, such as soil type, drainage channels, and obstructions to water flow.
c). A preliminary grading plan illustrating the proposed drainage management system.
2. Final Plat Drainage Report shall contain:
a). Calculations of the quantity of storm water entering the subdivision naturally and estimates
of the quantity of storm water entering the subdivision once there has been full
development of the lots within the subdivision based on the proposed zoning.
b). Quantities of flow at each pick-up point.
c). Estimates and type of temporary erosion control measures necessary to control erosion
during construction.
d). A description of an adequate drainage management system within the subdivision and its
design capacities based on a 10-year storm.
e). An evaluation of the ability of the proposed water courses, drainage tiles, storm sewers,
culverts and other improvements pertaining to drainage or flood control within the
subdivision to handle the run-off which would be generated by the development of the land
within and above the subdivision and the impacts of such drainage on downstream
drainage systems.
6.06.02 Drainage Requirements. The drainage management system designed by the subdivider shall
include culverts and storm sewers whenever necessary or required by the City Engineer. Where
storm sewers are not required, all open ditches shall be graded and all pipes, culverts, intersection
drains, drop inlets, bridges, headwalls, gutters and similar or related installations necessary to
provide adequate surface water drainage shall be constructed and installed in accordance with
plans approved by the City Engineer.
FAIRBURY, NEBRASKA • SUBDIVISION ORDINANCE • 2013 26

1. All streets shall be provided with an adequate storm drainage system of curbs, gutters and
storm sewers or open ditches.
2. Curb drainage inlets shall be provided at appropriate intervals along streets having curbs and
gutters. Where inlets connect to storm sewers, a drain inlet structure and a protective grating
shall be installed.
3. Where storm water flows across the intersections of streets having curbs and gutters, concrete
cross gutters shall be installed at such intersections.
4. All off-street drainage swales and ditches shall be protected by drainage easements noted on
the Preliminary and Final Plats. Where water courses would cross lots diagonally, the subdivider
shall straighten such course and shall substantially follow lot lines.
6.06.04 Storm Drain Responsibility. The City of Fairbury will review all storm drain design criteria. In
addition, the City of Fairbury may participate in the costs associated with providing adequate storm
drainage.
Section 6.07 Sanitary Sewers.
A sanitary sewer system shall be designed, financed and constructed by the subdivider for all lots in the
proposed subdivision. The following requirements shall apply:
6.07.01Within the corporate limits, a sanitary sewer collection system including all pipes and manholes
shall be provided and said collection system shall be connected to the public sewage system in
accordance with plans acceptable to the Planning Commission and City Council.
6.07.02 Within the jurisdictional areas of the City but outside the corporate limits, if a proposed subdivision
is so located with regard to adequate public sewer, either existing or to be existing within one year
from the date of application for final plat approval, or that said sewer is located within 500 feet of
the proposed subdivision or can be reached if the cost of installing lateral and connecting sewers
from all lots shown upon said plat, exclusive of connections from individual structures; is equal to or
less than 150 percent of the cost of installing a private sewage collection and disposal system for
all lots, then adequate lateral and connecting sewers to said public sewer system shall be
constructed.
6.07.03 If the subdivision is not located relative to a public sewer system, a private collection and treatment
system acceptable to the City Council and appropriate to the Nebraska Department of Health and
Human Services and the Nebraska Department of Environmental Quality (or successor agencies)
may be used. However, the City may require the developer to provide a plan for future expansion of
utilities including permanent easements. If on-site disposal is proposed, the subdivider shall
document acceptable percolation rates on each lot and such lots shall be adequately sized to allow
for the installation and safe operation of such systems in conjunction with any proposed water
supply or well location.
6.07.04 Standards. When applicable, improvement plans for a permanent sewage system shall be provided
showing pipe sizes, gradients, type of pipe, invert and finished grade elevations, location and type of

fire hydrants, valves and other appurtenances shall be provided and said distribution system shall
be connected to the public water system in accordance with plans acceptable to the Planning
Commission and City Council.
Within the jurisdictional area of the City but outside the corporate limits, if a proposed subdivision is
so located with regard to an adequate public water supply line, either existing or proposed within
one year from the date of application for Final Plat approval or that said water line is located within
500 feet of the proposed subdivision or can be reached if the cost of connecting to said water line
and installing an adequate distribution system to all lots shown upon said plat, exclusive of
connections from individual structures, is equal to or less than 150 percent of the cost of installing
an individual water system for all lots, then adequate connecting lines to said public water system
shall be constructed.
If the subdivision is not so located relative to a public water line, the City may authorize a
community well system. In addition, the City may require a plan for future extension of such utilities,
including permanent easements, for utilities throughout the proposed subdivision.
6.08.02 Standards. When applicable, improvement plans for a permanent water system shall be provided
showing pipe sizes, type of pipe, locations of fire hydrants and valves and, if applicable supply
facilities, booster pumps, elevated or ground level storage tanks and other appurtenances.
Design Standards of said system shall be subject to the approval of the City in accordance with the
following standards:
1. The minimum main or pipe size shall be determined by the type of uses to be served and the
provision of adequate fire flow capacities. Generally, water lines shall be a minimum of 6-inches
in diameter.
2. All hydrants will be located on the corner of each block or at a maximum of 400-foot intervals,
unless otherwise authorized by the City. The layout and flow design must meet the minimum
requirements as set forth by the City.
3. Gate valves on cross-connecting water lines shall be so located that no single break in the
distribution system shall require more than 400 feet to be out of service in any zoning district.
Valves or cross-connecting mains shall be so located that a break in the secondary distribution
system will not necessitate shutting down major distribution lines
Design standards of the water distribution system shall be in compliance with the requirements of
the Nebraska Department of Health and Human Services (or successor agencies).
Section 6.09 Cost of Over-size Improvements.
Minimum street pavement widths for streets shall conform to the standards established in Section 5.25 of
this Ordinance. Minimum utility sizes shall be determined by the standards of the City with regard to
providing service to the subdivision in question.
Where pavement widths or larger pipe or main sizes are deemed necessary by the Planning Commission
and City Council, the City may choose to bear the extra cost of providing such greater width or larger pipe or
main sizes. The subdivider shall be required to pay for that part of the construction costs for the Arterial
streets, trunk sewers, or water mains which are serving the proposed subdivision as determined by the
Planning Commission and City Council. The City shall pay the remainder of the costs.
Section 6.10 Extension to Boundaries.
The subdivider may be required to extend all necessary improvements to the boundaries of the proposed
subdivision at his/her expense to allow for services to future anticipated developments on the adjoining
lands, as determined by the Planning Commission and City Council.
Section 6.11 Off-site Extensions.
If streets or utilities are not available at the boundary of the proposed subdivision or within the distances or
costs established in this Article and the Planning Commission determines that extensions across
