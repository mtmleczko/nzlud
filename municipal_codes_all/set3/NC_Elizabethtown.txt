§ 10.99 GENERAL PENALTY.
(A) Whenever in this code or any ordinance of
the town any act is prohibited or is made or declared
to be unlawful, an offense or a misdemeanor, or
whenever in this code or any ordinance the doing of
any act is required or the failure to do such act is
declared to be unlawful, where no specific penalty is
provided therefor, the violation of any such provision
of this code or other ordinance shall be punished as
described therein or by a fine not exceeding $50 or by
imprisonment for a term not exceeding 30 days.
(Am. Ord. 94-6, passed 11-7-94)
(B) A violation of this code or any ordinance

penalty to be recovered by the town in a civil action

penalty within ten days after he has been cited for
violation of this code or any ordinance. The penalty
shall be issued in the form of a civil citation by any
sworn police officer of the Town of Elizabethtown or
the Fire Chief.
(C) Any provision of this code or any ordinance
may be enforced by an appropriate equitable remedy
issuing from a court of competent jurisdiction. In
such case, the general court of justice shall have
jurisdiction to issue such orders as may be
appropriate, and it shall not be a defense to the
application of the town for equitable relief that there
is an adequate remedy at law.
2018 S-11
General Provisions 7
(D) Any provision of this code or any ordinance
that makes unlawful a condition existing upon or use
made of real property may be enforced by injunction
and order of abatement, and the general court of
justice shall have jurisdiction to issue such orders.
when a violation of such a provision of this code or
an ordinance occurs, the town may apply to the
appropriate division of the general court of justice for
a mandatory or prohibitory injunction and order of
abatement commanding the defendant to correct the
unlawful condition upon, or cease the unlawful use of
the property. The action shall be governed in all
respects by the laws and rules governing civil
proceedings, including the Rules of Civil Procedure
in general and Rule 65 in particular.
(E) In addition to an injunction, the court may
enter an order of abatement as a part of the
judgement in the cause. An order of abatement may
direct that buildings or other structures on the
property be closed, demolished or removed; that
fixtures, furniture, or other movable property be
removed from buildings on the property; that grass
and weeds be cut; that improvements or repairs be
made; or that any other action be taken that is
necessary to bring the property into compliance with
the code or other ordinance. If the defendant fails or
refuses to comply with an injunction or with an order
of abatement within the time allowed by the court, he
may be cited for contempt, and the town may execute
the order of abatement. The town shall have a lien on
the property for the cost of executing the order of
abatement in the nature of a mechanic's and
materialmen's lien. The defendant may secure
cancellation of an order of abatement by paying all
costs of the proceedings and posting a bond for
compliance with the order. The bond shall be given
with sureties approved by the Clerk of Superior Court
in an amount approved by the judge before whom the
matter is heard, and shall be conditioned on the
defendant's full compliance with the terms of the
order of abatement within a time fixed by the judge.
Cancellation of an order of abatement shall not
suspend or cancel an injunction issued in conjunction
therewith.
(F) The terms of this code or any ordinance
may be enforced by any one, all or a combination of
the remedies authorized and prescribed by this
section. The procedure herein prescribed for
abatement of a nuisance shall not be deemed to be
exclusive.

(A) The nature and definition of the Town

responsibilities of said office, are as defined by the
North Carolina General Statutes and any other duties
may be delegated by the Town Council, either by
general resolution or by specific directives related to
one or more specific matters. The office of Town
Manager may be terminated by appropriate resolution
of the Council at any time, but provisions of any
current Town Manager's contract regarding salary and
other forms of compensation, if any, beneficial to the
employee shall nevertheless be honored if the office
should ever be terminated at any time other than upon
an anniversary of a Manager's contract.
(B) The contract of any Town Manager may be
summarily and unilaterally terminated by the town or
the Manager without cause or fault upon written
notice, provided that the terminating party shall give
the other party written notice by certified mail, return
receipt requested, or by personal delivery with receipt
obtained or other adequate written evidence of
delivery (such as witnesses), and provided that said
notice shall be given (or mailed) not less than 60 days
prior to the end of the current year of the agreement.
If the town terminates the Town Manager without
cause, the town shall render the Town Manager his
remaining salary until the agreement's annual
anniversary date, but in no case shall such severance
compensation be less than 60 days plus the Town
Manager's accumulated vacation.
(C) (1) A Town Manager's contract may be
terminated at any time for cause relating either to the
inadequate performance of the Town Manager's
duties and responsibilities under § 31.08 and/or under
law, or for personal conduct which reflects adversely
upon the town. The Town Manager shall, in the event
that it is alleged that he has committed any act, or
failed to perform any act or thing required of him,
which is suggested is grounds for dismissal for cause
under this agreement, and if the Town Council so
determines by appropriate resolution, be notified in
writing of the charge and charges, and provided with
a copy of the resolution of the Council making such
allegation. The Town Manager shall thereafter be
afforded an opportunity to appear before the Council
at a time and place within a reasonable time following
delivery of such notice (not less than 10 nor more
than 30 days after the delivery of such notice to the
Town Manager, unless agreed upon by both parties
hereto), at which
time the Council shall conduct a hearing into the
charges. At the hearing the Council shall examine the
2018 S-11
Town Officials 9
Town Manager with respect to determining the truth
or probable truth of the allegations against him. The
Town Manager may be represented in and at the
hearing by legal counsel of his own choice, and shall
have the right to present witnesses and other evidence
and arguments as he shall deem appropriate.
Following the hearing, the Council shall meet
(though not necessarily at the same time and place) as
it deems appropriate to consider its actions, which
may be as follows:
(a) To take no further action;
(b) To issue a written warning to the
Town Manager in such form as the Council shall
deem appropriate to be delivered to the Town
Manager in the same manner and form as a notice of
the hearing;
(c) To dismiss the Town Manager at
a day and date which shall be specified in the notice;
or
(d) Such other reasonable action
(such as salary reduction, suspension for a stated
time, imposition of a period of probation, and the
like) as the Council shall deem fair, necessary,
reasonable and appropriate under the circumstances.
(2) Any of the above actions shall be in
writing, and shall be delivered to the Town Manager
in the same manner as a notice of hearing under this
section may be delivered. All proceedings under this
section in which dismissal for cause is considered or
at issue shall be private and in executive session,
unless the Town Manager and the town shall agree
that the same, or any portion thereof, shall be open to
the public, except that such meetings shall be subject
to any legal requirements of the “North Carolina
Open Meetings Law,” especially with reference to
the entry of decisions in the public minutes of the
Town Council as required by said law or any other
rule of the law of this state.
(D) Any notices contemplated or specified by
this section to be given by one party to the other,
except as otherwise specified, shall be given in
writing and directed in postage pre-paid envelope or
other appropriate form addressed to the names and
addresses shown on the Town Manager's contract, by
certified mail, return receipt requested, and deposited
in the United States mail within the continental
United States. In the alternative, said written notices
may be given in person and considered valid and
binding under this section if an appropriate receipt is
obtained (which the parties hereto agree to execute
upon delivery without prejudice to the right to contest
the contents thereof), or if the witness of a third party
provided in writing attesting to said personal delivery.
The addresses which shall be binding upon the parties
hereto unless and until subsequent written notice of
change of address is provided by the moving party to
the other party shall be as set forth in the Town
Manager's contract.

('82 Code, Ch. 18, Art. I, § 18) Penalty, see § 10.99
§ 51.33 CROSS CONNECTION CONTROL.
(A) Introduction.
(1) The purpose of this cross connection
control section is to define the authority of town as
the water purveyor in the elimination of all cross
connections within its public potable water supply.
(2) This section shall apply to all users
connected to the town’s public potable water supply
regardless of whether the user is located within the
town limits or outside of the town limits.
(3) This section will comply with the
Federal Safe Drinking Water Act (PL 93-523), the
North Carolina State Administrative Code (15A
NCAC 18C), and the North Carolina State Building
Code (Volume II) as they pertain to cross connections
with the public water supply.
(B) Objectives. The specific objectives of this
section are as follows:
(1) To protect the public potable water
supply of the town against actual or potential
contamination by isolating within the consumer’s
water system contaminants or pollutants which could,
under adverse conditions, backflow through
uncontrolled cross connections into the public water
system.
2018 S-11
Water and Sewers 10A
(2) To eliminate or control existing cross
connections, actual or potential, between the
consumer’s potable water system and nonpotable or
industrial piping system.
(3) To provide a continuing inspection
program of cross connection control which will
systematically and effectively control all actual or
potential cross connections which may be installed in
the future.
(C) Responsibilities.
(1) Health agency. The North Carolina
Department of Environmental Quality (NCDEQ) has
the responsibility for promulgating and enforcing
laws, rules, regulations, and policies to be followed in
carrying out an effective cross connection control
program. The NCDEQ also has the primary
responsibility of ensuring that the water purveyor
operates the public potable water system free of
actual or potential sanitary hazards, including
unprotected cross connections. The NCDEQ has the
further responsibility of ensuring that the water
purveyor provides an approved water supply at the
service connection to the consumer’s water system
and, further, that he or she requires the installation,
testing, and maintenance of an approved backflow
prevention assembly on the service connection when
required.
(2) Water purveyor. Except as otherwise
provided in this section, the water purveyor’s town
responsibility to ensure a safe water supply begins at
the source and includes all of the public water
distribution system, including the service connection,
and ends at the point of delivery to the consumer’s
water system. In addition, the water purveyor shall
exercise reasonable vigilance to ensure that the
consumer has taken the proper steps to protect the
public potable water system. To ensure that the
proper precautions are taken, the town is required to
determine the degree of hazard or potential hazard to
the public potable water system; to determine the
degree of protection required; and to ensure proper
containment protection through an ongoing
inspection program. When it is determined that a
backflow
prevention assembly is required for the protection of
the public system, the town shall require the
consumer, at the consumer’s expense, to install an
approved backflow prevention assembly at each
service connection, to test immediately upon
installation and thereafter at a frequency as
determined by the town, to properly repair and
maintain such assembly or assemblies and to keep
adequate records of each test and subsequent
maintenance and repair, including materials and/or
replacement parts.
(3) Plumbing inspection. The plumbing
inspection departments of the town and the county
have the responsibility to not only review building
plans and inspect plumbing as it is installed; but, they
have the explicit responsibility of preventing cross
connections from being designed and built into the
plumbing system within its jurisdiction. Where the
review of building plans suggests or detects the
potential for cross connections being made an integral
part of the plumbing system, the Plumbing Inspector
has the responsibility, under the state Building Code,
for requiring that such cross connections be either
eliminated or provided with backflow prevention
equipment approved by the state Building Code. The
Plumbing Inspector’s responsibility begins at the
point of delivery, downstream of the first installed
backflow prevention assembly, and continues
throughout the entire length of the consumer’s water
system. The Plan Inspector should inquire about the
intended use of water at any point where it is
suspected that a cross connection might be made or
where one is actually called for by the plans. When
such is discovered it shall be mandatory that a
suitable, approved backflow prevention assembly
approved by the state Building Code be required by
the plans and be properly installed. The primary
protection assembly for containment purposes only
shall have approval from the town, the state Building
Code, and the NCDEQ.
(4) Consumer. The consumer has the
primary responsibility of preventing pollutants and
contaminants from entering his or her potable water
system or the public potable water system. The
consumer’s responsibility starts at the point of
delivery from the public potable water system and
includes all
2018 S-11
10B Elizabethtown - Public Works
of his or her water system. The consumer, at his or
her own expense, shall install, operate, test, and
maintain approved backflow prevention assemblies as
directed by the Town of Elizabethtown. The
consumer shall maintain accurate records of tests and
repairs made to backflow prevention assemblies and
shall maintain such records for a minimum period of
three years. The records shall be on forms approved
by the town and shall include the list of materials or
replacement parts used. Following any repair,
overhaul, repiping or relocation of an assembly, the
consumer shall have it tested to ensure that it is in
good operating condition and will prevent backflow.
Tests, maintenance and repairs of backflow
prevention assemblies shall be made by a certified
backflow prevention assembly tester.
(5) Certified backflow prevention
assembly testers. When employed by the consumer to
test, repair, overhaul, or maintain backflow
prevention assemblies, a backflow prevention
assembly tester will have the following
responsibilities: The tester will be responsible for
making competent inspections and for repairing or
overhauling backflow prevention assemblies and
making reports of such repair to the consumer and
responsible authorities on forms approved by the
town. The tester shall include the list of materials or
replacement parts used. The tester shall be equipped
with and be competent to use all the necessary tools,
gauges, manometers and other equipment necessary
to properly test, repair, and maintain backflow
prevention assemblies. It will be the tester’s
responsibility to ensure that original manufactured
parts are used in the repair of or replacement of parts
in a backflow prevention assembly. It will be the
tester’s further responsibility not to change the
design, material or operational characteristics of an
assembly during repair or maintenance without prior
approval of the town. A certified tester shall perform
the work and be responsible for the competency and
accuracy of all tests and reports. A certified tester
shall provide a copy of all test and repair reports to
the consumer and to the town cross connection
control department within ten business days of any
completed test or repair
work. A certified tester shall maintain such records
for a minimum period of three years. All certified
backflow prevention assembly testers must obtain and
employ backflow prevention assembly test equipment
which has been evaluated and/or approved by the
town. All test equipment shall be registered with the
town’s cross connection control department. All test
equipment shall be checked for accuracy annually, at
a minimum, calibrated, if necessary, and certified to
the town as to such calibration, employing an
accuracy/calibration method acceptable to the town.
All certified backflow prevention assembly testers
must become re-certified every two years through an
approved backflow prevention certification program.
(D) Definitions. For the purposes of this section,
the following definitions shall apply unless the
context clearly indicates or requires a different
meaning.
AIR-GAP SEPARATION. A physical
separation between the free flowing discharge end of
a potable water supply pipeline and an open or
nonpressure receiving vessel. An approved AIR-GAP
SEPARATION shall be at least double the diameter
of the supply pipe measured vertically above the
overflow rim of the receiving vessel, in no case less
than one inch (2.54 cm).

which has been investigated by the NCDEQ and
which has been approved for human consumption.
PUBLIC POTABLE WATER SYSTEM. Any
publicly or privately owned water system operated as
a public utility, under a current NCDEQ permit, to
supply water for public consumption or use. This
system will include all sources, facilities, and
appurtenances between the source and the point of
delivery such as valves, pumps, pipes, conduits,
tanks, receptacles, fixtures, equipment, and
appurtenances used to produce, convey, treat, or store
a potable water for public consumption or use.
REDUCED PRESSURE PRINCIPLE
BACKFLOW PREVENTION ASSEMBLY. An
assembly containing within its structure a minimum
of two independently acting, approved check valves,
together with a hydraulically operating, mechanically
independent, pressure differential relief valve located
between the check valves and at the same time below
2018 S-11
10F Elizabethtown - Public Works
the first check valve. The first check valve reduces
the supply pressure a predetermined amount so that
during normal flow and at cessation of normal flow,
the pressure between the checks is less than the
supply pressure. In case of leakage of either check
valve, the
pressure differential relief valve, by discharge to
atmosphere, shall operate to maintain the pressure
between the checks less than the supply pressure. The
unit shall include tightly closing shutoff valves
located at each end of the assembly and each
assembly shall be fitted with properly located test
cocks. The assembly is designed to protect against a
health hazard (i.e., contaminant).
REDUCED PRESSURE PRINCIPLE
DETECTOR ASSEMBLY. A specially designed
assembly composed of a line-size approved reduced
pressure principle backflow prevention assembly with
a specific bypass water meter and a meter-sized
approved reduced pressure principle backflow
prevention assembly. The meter shall register, in U.S.
gallons/cubit feet, accurately for only very low rates
of flow and shall show a registration for all rates of
flow. This assembly shall be used to protect against a
health hazard (i.e., contaminant).
SERVICE CONNECTIONS. The terminal end
of a service connection from the public potable water
system, i.e., where the town loses jurisdiction and
sanitary control over the water at its point of delivery
to the consumer’s water system.
VACUUM BREAKER—ATMOSPHERIC
TYPE. Also known as the NONPRESSURE TYPE
VACUUM BREAKER. A device containing a floatcheck,
a check seat, and an air inlet port. The flow of
water into the body causes the float to close the air
inlet port. When the flow of water stops, the float
falls and forms a check valve against back-siphonage
and at the same time opens the air inlet port to allow
air to enter and satisfy the vacuum. A shutoff valve
immediately upstream may be an integral part of the
device. An ATMOSPHERIC VACUUM BREAKER
is designed to protect against a nonhealth hazard,
isolation protection only, under a backsiphonage
condition only.
VACUUM BREAKER—PRESSURE TYPE.
An assembly containing an independently operating
internally loaded check valve and an independently
operating loaded air inlet valve located on the
discharge side of the check valve. The assembly is to
be equipped with properly located test cocks and
tightly closing shutoff valves attached at each end of
the assembly. This assembly is designed to protect
against a health hazard (i.e., contaminant) under a
backsiphonage condition only.
WATER PURVEYOR. The owner or operator of
a public potable water system, providing an approved
water supply to the public.
WATER SUPPLY—APPROVED. Any public
potable water supply which has been investigated and
approved by the NCDEQ. The system must be
operating under a valid health permit. In determining
what constitutes an APPROVED WATER SUPPLY,
the NCDEQ has reserved the final judgment as to its
safety and potability.
WATER SUPPLY—AUXILIARY. Any water
supply on or available to the premises other than the
purveyor’s approved public potable water supply.
These auxiliary waters may include water from
another purveyor’s public potable water supply or
any natural source such as a well, spring, river,
stream, etc., “used water,” or industrial fluids. These
waters may be polluted, contaminated, or
objectionable and constitute an unacceptable water
source over which the water purveyor does not have
sanitary control.
WATER SUPPLY—UNAPPROVED. A water
supply which has not been approved for human
consumption by the NCDEQ.
WATER—USED. Any water supplied by a
water purveyor from a public water system to a
consumer’s water system after it has passed through
the point of delivery and is no longer under the
control of the water purveyor.

or at any time during the event of an emergency, to
perform any duty imposed by this section. Those
duties may include sampling and testing of water, or
inspections and observations of all piping systems
connected to the public water supply. Where a user
has security measures in force which would require
proper identification and clearance before entry into
their premises, the user shall make necessary
arrangements with the security guards so that upon
presentation of suitable identification, town personnel
will be permitted to enter, without delay, for the
purposes of performing their specific responsibilities.
Refusal to allow entry for these purposes may result
in discontinuance of water service.
(2) On request, the consumer shall furnish
to the Commission any pertinent information
regarding the water supply system on such property
where cross connections and backflow are deemed

hazard.
(1) When cross connections are found to
exist, the owner, his or her agent, occupant, or tenant
will be notified in writing to disconnect the cross
connection within the time limit established by the
town. Degree of protection required and maximum
time allowed for compliance will be based upon the
potential degree of hazard to the public water supply
system. The maximum time limits are as follows:
(a) Cross connections with private
wells or other auxiliary water supplies—immediate
disconnection.
(b) All facilities which pose a health
hazard to the potable water system must have a
containment assembly in the form of a reduced
pressure principle backflow prevention assembly
within 60 days.

considered nonhealth hazard facilities. All nonhealth
hazard facilities must install, as a minimum
containment assembly, a double check valve
assembly within 90 days.
(d) If, in the judgment of the town, an
imminent health hazard exists, water service to the
building or premises where a cross connection exists
may be terminated unless an air gap is immediately
provided, or the cross connection is immediately
eliminated.
(e) Based upon recommendation
from the town, the consumer is responsible for
installing
sufficient internal isolation backflow prevention
assemblies and/or methods (i.e., air gap, pressure
vacuum breakers, reduced pressure principle
backflow prevention assembly, double check valve
assembly).
(f) Water mains served by the town
but not maintained by the town should be considered
cross connections, with degree of hazard to be
determined by the town. Degree of protection shall be
based upon the degree of hazard, as determined by
the town.
(g) In the event that a town cross
connection control inspector does not have sufficient
access to every portion of a private water system
(e.g., classified research and development facilities;
federal government property) to allow a complete
evaluation of the degree of hazard associated with
such private water systems, an approved reduced
pressure principle assembly shall be required as a
minimum of protection.
(2) No person shall fill special use tanks or
tankers containing pesticides, fertilizers, other toxic
chemicals or their residues from the public water

WATER AND SEWER RULES
AND REGULATIONS
§ 51.45 PURPOSE.
The purpose of these rules and regulations is
to provide a set of standard procedures for the normal
operation of the town water treatment and distribution
system and wastewater collection and treatment
system.
('82 Code, Ch. 18, Art. II, § 30) (Ord. passed 12-27-
77)
§ 51.46 AUTHORITY.
The town has the authority to finance,
construct and operate water and wastewater systems
through G.S. Chapter 160A, Article 16.
('82 Code, Ch. 18, Art. II, § 31) (Ord. passed 12-27-
77)
§ 51.47 RESPONSIBILITY AND LIABILITY OF
TOWN.
(A) The town shall have authority to own
and operate systems:
(1) The town shall own and
operate a water supply and distribution system for the
purpose of supplying water within the jurisdiction of
said town. Where possible and economically feasible,
a water distribution system will have lines located
adjacent and parallel to the property to be served, and
for which a tap-on fee, then in effect, will be charged.
(2) The town shall own and
operate a wastewater collection and treatment system
to treat the wastewater resulting from those sanitary
sewers located within the jurisdiction of said town.
Where possible and economically feasible, a
wastewater collector will be provided for the
transportation of wastewater to the treatment facility.
The wastewater
collector will be located adjacent and parallel to the
property to be served, and for which a tap-on fee,
then in effect, will be charged.
(B) The town may install its meter on the
service lateral at the property line or, at the town's
option, on the customer's property in a location mutually
agreed upon.
(C) When two or more meters are to be
installed on the same premises for different
customers, they shall be closely grouped and each
clearly designated to which customer it applies.
(D) In certain cases which may involve
customers outside the jurisdiction of the town, the
volume of water and/or wastewater flow may be
based upon metered water consumption as shown in
the records of meter readings maintained by a
municipal water department. Should any part, or all,
2018 S-11
Water and Sewers 11
of the customer's water supply come from other than
municipal sources, the customer discharging
wastewater to the town system shall be required to
install and maintain, at his expense, water meters of a
type approved by the town for the purpose of
determining the proper volume of flow to be charged.
(E) The town does not assume the
responsibility of inspecting the customer's piping on
apparatus and will not be responsible therefor.
However, the town does maintain the right to inspect
any and all tributary sewers for the purpose of
compliance with water and sewer use ordinance.
(F) The town reserves the right to refuse
service unless the customer's water lines and sewers
are installed in such manner as to eliminate leaks and
minimize infiltration. No connections to sources of
inflow, such as storm drains, roof drain, and the like
will be allowed.
(G) The town shall not be liable for damage of
any kind whatsoever resulting from any defect in the
piping or appurtenances on the customer's premises.
Neither shall the town be responsible for negligence
of third persons or forces beyond the control of the
town resulting in the interruption of service.
(H) Except as otherwise noted or provided, it
shall remain the responsibility of the customer to
operate and maintain those pumping facilities
necessary to discharge their wastewater to the town
system.
(I) Under normal conditions, the customer will
be notified of any anticipated interruption of service.
('82 Code, Ch. 18, Art. II, § 32) (Ord. passed 12-27-
77)
§ 51.48 RESPONSIBILITY OF CUSTOMER.
(A) Piping on the customer's premises must be
so arranged that the connections are conveniently
located with respect to the town's distribution or
collection system.
(B) If the customer's piping on the
customer's premises is so arranged that the town is
called upon to provide additional meters, each place
of metering
shall be considered as a separate and individual
account.
(C) Where a meter is placed on the
premises of a customer, a suitable place shall be
provided by the customer for placing such meter and
shall be unobstructed and accessible at all times to
the meter reader.
(D) While a meter may be out of service
for maintenance or other reasons, flows shall be

§ 51.73 FACTORS REQUIRING
IMPLEMENTATION OF THE WATER
SHORTAGE RESPONSE PLAN.
(A) Several parameters or conditions may
require the Town of Elizabethtown to begin the
WSRP. These include but may not be limited to
significant reductions in well water levels, a
significant increase in pump run times for the
predetermined total flow at the well(s), contaminants
in the water system, act of terrorism, vandalism, main
breaks and natural disasters.
(B) If the factors listed above reduce well water
levels or pump run times or by any event or
combination of events prevent the water system from
delivering water, WSRP phases will be enacted in the
following order:
(1) Phase I will be enacted if a 20%
reduction in seasonal/normal well water levels is
noted or if pump run times increase 20% in order to
maintain previous rate output or any other event
which causes a 20% reduction is the water system’s
capacity.
(2) Phase II will be enacted if a 40%
reduction in seasonal/normal well water levels is
noted
or if pump run times increase 40% in order to
maintain previous rate output or any other event
which causes a 40% reduction in the system’s
capacity.
(3) Phase III will be enacted if a 60%
reduction in normal well water levels is noted or if
pump run times increase 60% in order to maintain
previous rate output or any other event which causes
a 60% reduction in the system’s capacity.
(Ord. 02-7, passed 9-9-02; Am. Ord. 09-03, passed
12-7-09)
§ 51.74 PHASED WSRP AND WATER USE
REDUCTION GOALS.
When the WSRP is implemented, the below
phased approach will be followed:
(A) Phase I - Voluntary Conservation.
(1) This phase will be enacted when it is
determined that one or more of the parameters
outlined in § 51.73 is met. If this occurs, the
consumers will be notified promptly by any or all of
the following: mailers, door hangers, public postings
at the Town Hall, Post Offices, etc. The public will be
asked to begin voluntary conservation measures and
Class III non-essential uses will be halted.
(2) If the determining parameter(s) return
to seasonal norms, the measures will be lifted.
However, failure of the determining parameter(s) to
return to a state of seasonal normalcy may require the
initiation of Phase II.
(B) Phase II - Mandatory.
(1) This phase will begin when the Town
Manager issues a water shortage advisory. The
consumers will be notified by one of the methods
noted in Phase I. All users will be required to adhere
to the voluntary conservation measurers as noted in
Attachment I to Ord. 09-03.
(2) Class III uses will be banned.
2018 S-11
Water and Sewers 16A
(3) Class II uses will be allowed although
outdoor vegetative watering will be limited according
to the resident’s street address. Even numbered
addresses will be allowed to water on even days of
the month. Odd numbered addresses will be allowed
to water on odd days of the month.
(4) During Phase II, industrial facilities
will be required to develop and demonstrate to the
Town Manager a water shortage response program.
This program should show, at least, a 25% reduction
in water usage.
(C) Phase III - Emergency.
(1) This phase will commence with the
issuance of a water shortage emergency declaration
from the Town Manager. Users will be notified by
any or all of the methods noted in Phase I. All users
will be required to use voluntary conservation
measures outlined in Attachment I to Ord. 09-03.
Class III uses will be banned and Class II uses will be
allowed with the exception of vegetative watering.
Industrial users will be required to implement their
water reduction program, immediately.
(2) In addition, residential users will be
allotted 1000 gallons per month per person per
connection. If the user uses 1,001 to 1,250 gallons per
month per person per connection, a surcharge of 25%
will be added to the monthly bill. If the user uses
1,251 to 1,500 gallons per month per person per
connection, a surcharge of 75% will be added to the
monthly water bill. If the user uses 1,501 or more
gallons per month per person per connection, a
surcharge of 150% will be added to the monthly bill.
(3) Commercial, industrial and
institutional facilities will be required to reduce their
monthly water consumption by 25% of the previous
12 -month water consumption average to maintain the
current water rate for that month. The average water
use can be evaluated on an individual basis for
facilities with seasonal demand fluctuations. A 20%
to 24% water use reduction from the previous 12-
month water use
average will require the town to impose a 25%
surcharge on the monthly water bill. A 0% to 9%
water use reduction from the previous 12-month
water use average will require the town to impose a
50% surcharge on the monthly water bill. An increase
of 1% to 25% above the previous 12-month water use
average will result in surcharge of 100% added to the
next monthly bill. Any amount used above 25% of
the previous 12-month average water use will require
the town to add a surcharge of 150% to the monthly
bill.
(Ord. 02-7, passed 9-9-02; Am. Ord. 09-03, passed
12-7-09)
§ 51.75 ENFORCEMENT.
Enforcement of mandatory conservation and
associated fines will be the responsibility of the Town
Manager under the direction of the Towns Mayor.
(A) Phase I - Voluntary Conservation.
Continued water consumption by Class III, nonessential
users will result in a written notice of
violation for the first offense, a $25 fine, and a $25
fine for each subsequent offense.
(B) Phase II - Mandatory Reductions.
Failure to adhere to the Phase II (Mandatory) required
conditions will result in a written notice of violation
for the first offense and a $50 fine. Thereafter, each
violation increases by a factor of $50. Any violation
past a fourth offense shall result in a disruption of
water service to the offending party until Phase II has
been rescinded.
(C) Phase III - Emergency Reductions.
Failure to comply with the mandates during Phase III
will require the offending party to pay $100 fine for
the first offense, $350 fine for the second offense and
disruption of service for the third offense.
(Ord. 02-7, passed 9-9-02; Am. Ord. 09-03, passed
12-7-09)
§ 51.76 PUBLIC COMMENT.
Customers will have multiple opportunities to
comment on the provisions of the water shortage
response plan. A draft plan will be published on the
2018 S-11
16B Elizabethtown - Public Works
town’s website. A public hearing will be scheduled to
gather citizen comments, with notice given to the
public that copies of the plan are available for pick up
at any municipal building. Any changes to the WSRP
after adoption by Council will be published at least
30 days prior to an adoption vote by Town Council.
(Ord. 02-7, passed 9-9-02; Am. Ord. 09-03, passed
12-7-09)
§ 51.77 VARIANCE PROTOCOLS.
Applications for water use variance requests
are available from the Town of Elizabethtown
website and at the Town Hall. All applications must
be submitted to Town Hall for review by the Manager
or his or her designee. A decision to approve or deny
individual variance requests will be determined
within two weeks of submittal after careful
consideration of the following criteria: impact on
water demand, expected duration, alternative source
options, social and economic importance, purpose
(i.e., necessary use of drinking water) and the
prevention of structural damage.
(Ord. 02-7, passed 9-9-02; Am. Ord. 09-03, passed
12-7-09)
§ 51.78 EFFECTIVENESS.
The effectiveness of the Elizabethtown water
shortage response plan will be determined by
comparing the stated water conservation goals with
observed water use reduction data. Other factors to be
considered include frequency of plan activation, any
problem periods without activation, total number of
violation citations, desired reductions attained and
evaluation of demand reductions compared to the
previous year’s seasonal data.
(Ord. 02-7, passed 9-9-02; Am. Ord. 09-03, passed
12-7-09)
§ 51.79 REVISION.
The (WSRP) water shortage response plan will
be reviewed and revised as needed to adapt to new
circumstances affecting water supply and demand,
following implementation of emergency restrictions,
and at a minimum of every five years, as required by
the provisions of G.S.§ 143-355(l). Further, a water
shortage response planning work group will review
procedures following each emergency or rationing
stage to recommend any necessary improvements to
the plan to Town Council. The town is responsible for
initiating all subsequent revisions.
(Ord. 02-7, passed 9-9-02; Am. Ord. 09-03, passed
12-7-09)
§ 51.80 WATER SHORTAGE RESPONSE
PLAN CANCELLATION.
As the determining parameter(s) decrease in
severity and return to acceptable levels, the town will
lift the WSRP. The cancellation process will be in the
reverse order of the WSRP implementation.
(Ord. 02-7, passed 9-9-02; Am. Ord. 09-03, passed
12-7-09)
§ 51.81 IRRIGATION METER
REQUIREMENT.
(A) Irrigation meter requirement. All new inground
irrigation systems installed after application
of this subchapter that will be supplied water from the

GENERAL PROVISIONS
§ 52.001 PURPOSE AND POLICY.
(A) This chapter sets forth uniform
requirements for direct and indirect contributors to
the wastewater collection and treatment system for
the Town of Elizabethtown, herein after referred to as
the town and enables the town to comply with all
applicable state and federal laws, including the Clean
Water Act (33 U.S.C. 1251 et seq.) and the General
Pretreatment Regulations (40 CFR 403).
(B) The objectives of this chapter are:
(1) To prevent the introduction of
pollutants into the municipal wastewater system
which will interfere with the operation of the system
or contaminate the resulting sludge;
(2) To prevent the introduction of
pollutants into the municipal wastewater system
which will pass through the system, inadequately
treated, into any waters of the state or otherwise be
incompatible with the system;
(3) To promote recycling and reuse of
industrial wastewater and sludges from the municipal
system;
(4) To protect both municipal personnel
who may be affected by sewage, sludge, and effluent
in the course of their employment as well as
protecting the general public;
(5) To provide for equitable distribution of
the cost of operation, maintenance and improvement
of the municipal wastewater system; and
(6) To ensure that the municipality
complies with its NPDES or nondischarge permit
conditions, sludge use and disposal requirements and
any other federal and state laws to which the
municipal wastewater system is subject.
(C) This chapter provides for the regulation of
direct and indirect contributors to the municipal
wastewater system, through the issuance of permits to
certain non-domestic users and through enforcement
of general requirements for the other users, authorizes
monitoring and enforcement activities, requires user
reporting and provides for the setting of fees for the
equitable distribution of costs resulting from the
program established herein. This chapter shall apply
to all users of the municipal wastewater system, as
authorized by G.S. §§ 160A-312 and/or 153A.275.
Except as otherwise provided herein, the POTW
Director shall administer, implement, and enforce the
provisions of this chapter. Any powers granted to or
imposed upon the POTW Director may be delegated
by the POTW Director to other town personnel. By
discharging wastewater into the municipal
wastewater system, industrial users located outside
the town limits agree to comply with the terms and
conditions established in this chapter, as well as any
permits, enforcement actions, or orders issued
hereunder.

§ 52.068 NOTIFICATION OF THE
DISCHARGE OF HAZARDOUS WASTE.
(A) Any user who commences the discharge of
hazardous waste shall notify the POTW, the EPA
Regional Waste Management Division Director, and
state hazardous waste authorities, in writing, of any
discharge into the POTW of a substance which, if
otherwise disposed of, would be a hazardous waste
under 40 CFR Part 261. Such notification must
include the name of the hazardous waste as set forth
in 40 CFR Part 261, the hazardous waste number, and
the type of discharge (continuous, batch, or other). If
the user discharges more than 100 kilograms of such
waste per calendar month to the POTW, the
notification also shall contain the following
information to the extent such information is known
and readily available to the user: an identification of
hazardous constituents contained in the wastes, an
estimation of the mass and concentration of such
constituents in the wastestream discharge during the
calendar month, and an estimation of the mass of
constituents in the wastestream expected to be
discharged during the following 12 months. All
notification must take place no later than 180 days
after the discharge commences. Any notification
under this division need be submitted only once for
each hazardous waste discharge. However,
notification of changed conditions must be submitted
under § 52.064 of this chapter. The notification
requirement in this section does not apply to
pollutants already reported by users subject to
categorical pretreatment standards
2018 S-11
Wastewater Collection and Treatment 39
under the self-monitoring requirements of §§ 52.060,
52.062 and 52.063 of this chapter.
(B) Dischargers are exempt from the
requirements of division (A), above, during a
calendar month in which they discharge no more than
15 kilograms of hazardous wastes, unless the wastes
are acute hazardous wastes as specified in 40 CFR
261.30(d) and 261.33(e). Discharge of more than 15
kilograms of nonacute hazardous wastes in a calendar
month, or of any quantity of acute hazardous wastes
as specified in 40 CFR 261.30(d) and 261.33(e),
requires a one-time notification. Subsequent months
during which the user discharges more than such
quantities of any hazardous waste do not require
additional notification.
(C) In the case of any new regulation under
section 3001 of RCRA identifying additional
characteristics of hazardous waste or listing any
additional substance as a hazardous waste, the user
must notify the POTW Director/Superintendent, the
EPA Regional Waste Management Waste Division
Director, and state hazardous waste authorities of the
discharge of such substance within 90 days of the
effective date of such regulations.
(D) In the case of any notification made under
this section, the user shall certify that it has a
program in place to reduce the volume and toxicity of
hazardous wastes generated to the degree it has
determined to be economically practical.
(E) This provision does not create a right to
discharge any substance not otherwise permitted to
be discharged by this chapter, a permit issued
thereunder, or any applicable federal or state law.
(Ord. 94-3, passed 1-10-94)
§ 52.069 ANALYTICAL REQUIREMENTS.
All pollutant analyses, including sampling
techniques, to be submitted as part of a wastewater
discharge permit application or report shall be
performed in accordance with the techniques
prescribed in 40 CFR Part 136, unless otherwise
specified in an applicable categorical pretreatment
standard. If 40 CFR Part 136 does not contain
sampling or analytical techniques for the pollutant in
question, sampling and analyses must be performed in
accordance with procedures approved by the EPA.

COLLECTION.
(A) All wastewater samples must be
representative of the user’s discharge. Wastewater
monitoring and flow measurement facilities shall be
properly operated, kept clean, and maintained in good
working order at all times. The failure of a user to
keep its monitoring facility in good working order
shall not be grounds for the user to claim that sample
results are unrepresentative of its discharge.
(B) Grab samples must be used for pH, cyanide,
total phenols, oil and grease, sulfide, volatile organic
compounds, and any other pollutants as required by
40 CFR 136. The POTW shall determine the number
of grabs necessary to be representative of the user’s
discharge. See 40 CFR 403.12(g)(5) for additional
grab sample number requirements for BMR and 90
Day Compliance Reports. Additionally, the POTW
Director/Superintendent may allow collection of
multiple grabs during a 24-hour period which are
composited prior to analysis as allowed under 40 CFR
136.
(C) Composite samples. All wastewater
composite samples shall be collected with a minimum
of hourly aliquots or grabs for each hour that there is
a discharge. All wastewater composite samples shall
be collected using flow proportional composite
collection techniques, unless time-proportional
composite sampling or grab sampling is authorized by
the POTW Director/Superintendent. When
authorizing time-proportional composites or grabs,
the samples must be representative and the decision to
allow the alternative sampling must be documented.

Persons or occupants of premises where wastewater is
created or discharged shall allow the town, approval
authority and EPA or their representative ready
access at all reasonable times to all parts of the
premises for the purposes of inspection, sampling,
records examination and copying or in the
performance of any of their duties. The town's
approval authority and EPA shall have the right to set
up on the user's property such devices as are
necessary to conduct sampling, inspection,
compliance monitoring and/or metering operations.
Where a user has security measures in force which
would require proper identification and clearance
before entry into their premises, the user shall make
necessary arrangements with their security guards so
that upon presentation of suitable identification,
personnel from the town, approval authority and EPA
will be permitted to enter, without delay, for the
purposes of performing their specific responsibilities.
Denial of the POTW Director/ Superintendent's,
approval authority's, or
2018 S-11
Wastewater Collection and Treatment 41

A user shall have an affirmative defense to an
enforcement action brought against it for
noncompliance with the general prohibitions in §
52.015(A) of this chapter or the specific prohibitions
in § 52.015(B) (2), (3), (5) through (7) and (9)
through (23) of this chapter if it can prove that it did
not know, or have reason to know, that its discharge,
alone or in conjunction with discharges from other
sources, would cause pass through or interference and
that either:
(A) A local limit exists for each pollutant
discharged and the user was in compliance with each
limit directly prior to, and during, the pass through or
interference; or
(B) No local limit exists, but the
discharge did not change substantially in nature or
constituents from the user's prior discharge when the
town was regularly in compliance with its NPDES
permit, and in the case of interference, was in
compliance with applicable sludge use or disposal
requirements.
(Ord. 94-3, passed 1-10-94)
§ 52.102 BYPASS.
(A) A user may allow any bypass to occur
which does not cause pretreatment standards or
requirements to be violated, but only if it also is for
essential maintenance to assure efficient operation.
These bypasses are not subject to the provision of
divisions (B) and (C) of this section.
(B) (1) If a user knows in advance of
the need for a bypass, it shall submit prior notice to
the POTW Director/Superintendent at least ten days
before the date of the bypass, if possible.
2018 S-11
Wastewater Collection and Treatment 43
(2) A user shall submit oral notice to the
POTW Director/Superintendent of an unanticipated
bypass that exceeds applicable pretreatment standards
within 24 hours from the time it becomes aware of
the bypass. A written submission shall also be
provided within five days of this time the user
becomes aware of the bypass. A written submission
shall contain a description of the bypass and its cause;
the duration of the bypass, including exact dates and
times, and, if the bypass has not been corrected, the
anticipated time it is expected to continue; and steps
taken or planned to reduce, eliminate, and prevent
recurrence of the bypass. The POTW
Director/Superintendent may waive the written report
on a case-by-case basis if the oral report has been
received within 24 hours.
(C) (1) Bypass is prohibited, and the POTW
Director/Superintendent may take an enforcement
action against a user for a bypass, unless:
(a) Bypass was unavoidable to
prevent loss of life, personal injury, or severe
property damage:
(b) There were no feasible
alternatives to the bypass, such as the use of auxiliary
treatment facilities, retention of untreated wastes, or
maintenance during normal periods of equipment
downtime. This condition is not satisfied if adequate
back-up equipment should have been installed in the
exercise of reasonable engineering judgement to
prevent a bypass which occurred during normal
periods of equipment downtime or preventive
maintenance; and
(c) The user submitted notices as
required under division (B) of this section.
(2) The POTW Director/Superintendent
may approve an anticipated bypass, after considering
its adverse effects if the POTW
Director/Superintendent determines that it will meet
the three conditions listed in subdivision (C)(1) of
this section.
(Ord. 94-3, passed 1-10-94)
ENFORCEMENT
§ 52.110 ADMINISTRATIVE REMEDIES.
(A) Notification of violation. Whenever, the
POTW Director/Superintendent finds that any
industrial user has violated or is violating this
chapter, wastewater permit, or any prohibition,
limitation or requirements contained therein or any
other pretreatment requirement the POTW
Director/Superintendent may serve upon such a
person a written notice stating the nature of the
violation. Within 30 days from the date of this notice,
as explanation for the violation and a plan for the
satisfactory correction thereof shall be submitted to
the town by the user. Submission of this plan does not
relieve the discharger of liability for any violations
occurring before or after receipt of the notice of
violation.
(B) Consent orders. The POTW Director/
Superintendent is hereby empowered to enter into
consent orders, assurances of voluntary compliance,
or other similar documents establishing an agreement
with the person responsible for the noncompliance.
Such orders will include specific action to be taken
by the discharger to correct the noncompliance within
a time period also specified by the order. Consent
orders shall have the same force and effect as an
administrative order issued pursuant to division (D)
below.
(C) Show cause hearing.
(1) The POTW Director/Superintendent
may order any industrial user who causes or is
responsible for an unauthorized discharge, has
violated this chapter or is in noncompliance with a
wastewater discharge permit to show cause why a
proposed enforcement action should not be taken. In
the event the POTW Director/Superintendent
determines that a show cause order should be issued,
a notice shall be served on the user specifying the
time and place for the hearing, the proposed
enforcement action, the reasons for such action, and a
request that the user show cause why this proposed
enforcement
2018 S-11
44 Elizabethtown - Public Works
action should not be taken. The notice of the hearing
shall be served personally or by registered or certified
mail (return receipt requested) at least ten days before
the hearing. Service may be made on any agent or
officer of a corporation.
(2) The POTW Director/Superintendent
shall review the evidence presented at the hearing and
determine whether the proposed enforcement action
is appropriate.
(3) A show cause hearing under this
section is not a prerequisite to the assessment of a
civil penalty under § 52.111 nor is any action or
inaction taken by the POTW Director/Superintendent
under this section subject to an administrative appeal
under § 52.051(H).
(D) Administrative orders. When the POTW
Director/Superintendent finds that an industrial user
has violated or continues to violate this chapter,
permits or orders issued hereunder, or any other
pretreatment requirement the POTW
Director/Superintendent may issue an order to cease
and desist all such violations and direct those persons
in noncompliance to do any of the following:
(1) Immediately comply with all
requirements;
(2) Comply in accordance with a
compliance time schedule set forth in the order;
(3) Take appropriate remedial or
preventive action in the event of a continuing or
threatened violation;
(4) Disconnect unless adequate treatment
facilities, devices or other related appurtenances are
installed and properly operated within a specified
time period.
(E) Emergency suspensions.
(1) The POTW Director/Superintendent
may suspend the wastewater treatment service and/or
wastewater permit when such suspension is necessary
in order to stop an actual or threatened discharge
which presents or may present an imminent or
substantial endangerment to the health or welfare of
persons or the environment, interferes with the
POTW or causes the POTW to violate any condition
of its NPDES or non-discharge permit.
(2) Any user notified of a suspension of
the wastewater treatment service and/or the
wastewater permit shall immediately stop or
eliminate the contribution. A hearing will be held
within 15 days of the notice of suspension to
determine whether the suspension may be lifted or the
user's waste discharge permit terminated. In the
event of a failure to comply voluntarily with the
suspension order, the POTW Director/Superintendent
shall take such steps as deemed necessary including
immediate severance of the sewer connection, to
prevent or minimize damage to the POTW system or
endangerment to any individuals. The POTW
Director/Superintendent shall reinstate the wastewater
permit and the wastewater treatment service upon
proof of the elimination of noncompliant discharge.
The industrial user shall submit a detailed written
statement describing the causes of the harmful
contribution and the measures taken to prevent any
future occurrence to the POTW
Director/Superintendent prior to the date of the
above-described hearing.
(F) Termination of permit or permission to
discharge. The POTW Director/Superintendent may
revoke a wastewater discharge permit or permission
to discharge for good cause, including, but not limited
to, the following reasons:
(1) Failure to accurately report the
wastewater constituents and characteristics of his
discharge;
(2) Failure to report significant changes in
operations, or wastewater constituents and
characteristics;
(3) Refusal of reasonable access to the
user's premises for the purpose of inspection or
monitoring; or
2018 S-11
Wastewater Collection and Treatment 44A
(4) Violation of conditions of the permit or
permission to discharge, conditions of this chapter, or
any applicable state and federal regulations.
(G) Notification. Noncompliant industrial users
will be notified of the proposed termination of their
wastewater permit and will be offered an opportunity
to show cause under this § 52.110 why the proposed
action should not be taken.

FATS, OILS AND GREASES CONTROL
§ 52.125 SCOPE AND PURPOSE.
To aid in the prevention of sanitary sewer
blockages and obstructions from contributions and
accumulations of fats, oils, and greases into the
town's sewer collection system from industrial or
commercial establishments, particularly food
preparation and serving facilities.
(Ord. 02-9, passed 12-2-02)
§ 52.126 DEFINITIONS.
For the purposes of this subchapter, the
following definitions shall apply unless the context
clearly indicates or requires a different meaning.
CONDITIONAL USE PERMIT. A permit
granted by the Director to allow the use of alternate
measures other than a traditional grease interceptor
for the purpose of preventing the introduction of fats,
oils and greases into the town sewer collection
system. Such are allowed only when the user
demonstrates a bona fide logistical hardship to
installing an outside grease interceptor.
COOKING ESTABLISHMENTS. Those
establishments primarily engaged in activities of
preparing, serving, or otherwise making available for
consumption foodstuffs and that use one or more of
the following preparation activities: cooking by
frying (all methods), baking (all methods), grilling,
sautéing, rotisserie cooking, broiling, blanching,
roasting, toasting, or poaching. Also included are
infrared heating, searing, barbecuing, and any other
food preparation activity that produces a hot, nondrinkable
food product in or on a receptacle that
requires washing.
FATS, OILS, AND GREASES. Organic polar
compounds derived from animal and/or plant sources
that contain multiple carbon chain triglyceride
molecules. These substances are detectable and
measurable using analytical test procedures
established in 40 CFR 136, as may be amended from
time to time. All are sometimes referred to herein as
GREASE or GREASES.
GREASE TRAP OR INTERCEPTOR. A
device for separating and retaining waterborne
greases and grease complexes prior to the wastewater
exiting the trap and entering the sanitary sewer
collection and treatment system. These devices also
serve to collect solids, generated by and from food
preparation activities, prior to the water exiting the
trap and entering the sanitary sewer collection and
treatment system. Grease traps and interceptors are
sometimes referred to herein as GREASE
INTERCEPTORS.
INSIDE INTERCEPTOR. A device installed
inside an establishment to separate and retain
waterborne greases and grease complexes prior to
entering the sanitary sewer collection system. Such
are allowed by conditional use permit only.

MINIMUM DESIGN CAPABILITY. The
design features of a grease interceptor and its ability
or volume required to effectively intercept and retain
greases from grease-laden wastewater discharged to
the sanitary sewer.
NON-COOKING ESTABLISHMENTS. Those
establishments primarily engaged in the preparation
of precooked foodstuffs that do not include any form
of cooking. These include cold dairy and frozen
foodstuff preparation and serving establishments.
SEATING CAPACITY PROCEDURE
FORMULA. (No. of seats) X storage factor (SF) X
1/2 (no. of hours open) = trap volume (gal).

USER. Any person, including those located
outside the jurisdictional limits of the town, who
contributes, causes or permits the contribution or
discharge of wastewater into the POTW, including
persons who contribute such wastewater from mobile
sources, such as those who discharge hauled
wastewater.
(Ord. 02-9, passed 12-2-02)
§ 52.127 GREASE INTERCEPTOR
MAINTENANCE, RECORD KEEPING AND
GREASE REMOVAL.
(A) Grease interceptors shall be installed by
users as required by the Director or his designee.
Grease interceptors shall be installed at the user's
expense, when such user operates a restaurant,
school, child care facility with 20 or more children,
deli, meat market, grocery store, bakery,
entertainment club, caterer, church and fraternal
organization, or when deemed necessary by the
Director for the proper handling of liquid wastes
containing grease or any other substance deemed
harmful to the sewer system.
(B) The Director may permit, at his sole
discretion, alternative means of grease removal other
than the traditional outside grease trap. Such granting
shall be by way of the issuance of a conditional use
permit. A conditional use permit may be granted
only when the requesting establishment has a bona
fide hardship with installing a traditional interceptor.
BONA FIDE HARDSHIP may include, but is not
limited to insufficient property requirements and
logistically impractical compliance issues.
(C) All grease interceptors shall be of a type,
design, and capacity approved by the Director or his
designee and shall be readily and easily accessible for
user cleaning and town inspection. The sizing of
grease traps will be based on the number of seats
(Seating Capacity Procedure) or the number of meals
served in a single day (Meals Served Procedure) or
other methods approved by the Director. All such
grease interceptors shall be serviced and emptied of
accumulated waste content as required in order to
maintain minimum design capability or effective
volume of the grease interceptor, but not less often
2003 S-10
46 Elizabethtown - Public Works
than once every other month or more often, as
determined by the Director. Inside interceptors shall
be cleaned a minimum of once every 14 days. Users
who are required to, based on solids, pass water
through a grease interceptor shall:
(1) Provide for a minimum hydraulic
retention time of 24 minutes at actual peak flow or 12
minutes at the calculated theoretical peak flow rate as
predicted by the Uniform Plumbing Code fixture
criteria, between the influent and effluent baffles with
20% of the total volume of the grease interceptor
being allowed for sludge to settle and accumulate,
identified hereafter as a SLUDGE POCKET;
(2) Remove any accumulated grease cap
and sludge pocket as required, but at intervals of not
longer than every other month at the user’s expense.
Grease interceptors shall be kept free of inorganic
solid materials such as grit, rocks, gravel, sand, eating
utensils, cigarettes, shells, towels, rags, and the like,
which could settle into this pocket and thereby reduce
the effective volume of the grease interceptor;
(3) Abide by the following conditions: If
any skimmed or pumped wastes or other materials
removed from the grease interceptor are treated in
any fashion onsite and reintroduced back into the
grease interceptor as an activity of and after said
onsite treatment, the user shall be responsible for the
attainment of established grease numerical limits,
consistent with and contained in division (A) of this
section, on all discharges of wastewater from said
grease interceptor into the town sanitary sewer
collection and treatment system;
(4) Operate the grease interceptor in a
manner so as to maintain said device such that
attainment to the grease limit is consistently achieved.
CONSISTENT shall mean any wastewater sample
taken from said grease interceptor shall be subject to
terms of numerical limit attainment described in
division (A) of this section. If legitimate space
constraints (as determined by the Director) exist that
prohibit the sewer user from installing a grease
interceptor, a conditional use permit application
requesting variance to said ordinance may be
submitted;
(5) Understand and agree that: The use of
biological additives as a grease degradation agent is
conditionally permissible, upon approval by the
Director. Any establishment using this method of
grease abatement shall maintain the trap or
interceptor in such a manner that attainment of the
grease wastewater discharge limit, as measured from
the trap's outlet, is consistently achieved;
(6) Understand and agree that: The use of
automatic grease removal systems is conditionally
permissible, upon prior written approval by the
Director, Bladen County Plumbing Inspector of the
town and the Bladen County Department of Health.
Any establishment using this equipment shall operate
the system in such a manner that attainment of the
grease wastewater discharge limit, as measured from
the unit's outlet, is consistently achieved;
(7) Understand and agree that: The
Director reserves the right to make determinations of
grease interceptor adequacy and need, based on
review of all relevant information regarding grease
interceptor performance, facility site and building
plan review and to require repairs to, or modification
or replacement of such traps.
(D) All grease traps must be pumped once every
other month and records of such supplied to the
Director after each pumping. The Director has the
discretion to require more or less frequent pumping
on a case-by-case basis to protect the operation of the
town's sewer collection system. The town may
provide a grease trap pumping program to allow for
the convenient maintenance, record keeping and
service payment.
(E) The Public Services Department shall
maintain records for those participating in the town
grease trap pumping program. All other users shall
2003 S-10
Wastewater Collection and Treatment 47
provide a written record of trap maintenance to the
Director within 15 days of each mandatory pumping.
Records for users that have been granted conditional
use permits shall submit cleaning records bi-annually.
(F) No non-grease-laden sources are allowed to
be connected to sewer lines intended for grease
interceptor service.
(G) Should an obstruction of a town sewer
main(s) occur that causes a sewer overflow to the
extent that an impact on the environment is realized
and that said overflow or failure of the sanitary sewer
collection system to convey sewage can be attributed
in part or in whole to an accumulation of grease in the
town's sewer main(s), the town will take appropriate
enforcement actions, as stipulated in the town's Sewer
Use Ordinance, against the generator or contributor of
such grease.
(H) Access manholes shall be provided over
each chamber and sanitary tee. The access manholes
shall extend at least to finished grade and be designed
and maintained to prevent water inflow or infiltration.
The manholes shall also have readily removable
covers to facilitate inspection, grease removal, and
wastewater sampling activities.
(Ord. 02-9, passed 12-2-02)
§ 52.999 PENALTY.
(A) Any user who is found to have failed to
comply with any provision of this chapter, or the
orders, rules regulations and permits issued
hereunder, may be fined up to $10,000 per day per
violation.
(B) In determining the amount of the civil
penalty, the POTW Director/Superintendent shall
consider the following:
(1) The degree and extent of the harm to
the natural resources, to the public health, or to public
or private property resulting from the violation;
(2) The duration and gravity of the
violation;
(3) The effect on ground or surface water
quantity or quality or on air quality;
(4) The cost of rectifying the damage;
(5) The amount of money saved by
noncompliance;
(6) Whether the violation was committed
willfully or intentionally;
(7) The prior record of the violator in
complying or failing to comply with the pretreatment
program;
(8) The costs of enforcement to the town.
(C) Appeals of civil penalties assessed in
accordance with this section shall be as provided in §
52.051(H).

golf cart may be operated at a speed greater than
reasonable and prudent for the existing conditions.

days prior to the date upon which the sound
producing equipment is to be used or operated.
Where good cause is shown, or in the judgment of the

instrument, device or apparatus will constitute a
threat to the safety of pedestrians or vehicle
operators;
(3) At any location where the Chief of
Police, upon investigation, shall determine that the
conditions of overcrowding or of street repair or
other physical conditions are such that the use of a
sound producing instrument, device or apparatus will
deprive the public of the reasonable right to safe and
peaceful enjoyment of any public street, park, or
other public place, or will constitute a threat to the
safety of pedestrians or vehicle operators;

exceeding two hours without a 30 minute break,

the action of the Chief of Police, file a written note of
acceptance with the Chief of Police on a form
supplied by the city.
(E) Processing time; notice, right of appeal.

the applicant of the action taken as soon as possible
by telephone or other means. Any person aggrieved
by action taken on a permit application may file a
written notice of appeal, first with the City Manager
and then with the Town Council. The notice of
appeal must be filed within seven days from date
notice of the action, regardless of the means used to
convey such notice, is received by the applicant. The
Town Manager shall act on the appeal as
expeditiously as possible. The Town Council shall

§ 110.24 COMPUTATION OF TAX BASED ON
GROSS RECEIPTS.
(A) Whenever this chapter levies a privilege
license tax computed on the basis of gross receipts,
GROSS RECEIPTS means the amount reported as
gross receipts on a business’ state income tax return
or on the federal income tax return filed with the state
income tax return if the state return does not
separately state gross receipts for the most recently
completed tax year. It shall be the duty of a person
applying for the license to render to the Revenue
Collector or his or her designee a sworn statement of
such gross receipts during the preceding year.
(B) If a business has not been in operation long
enough for the information required in division (A) of
this section to be available, the Revenue Collector
shall estimate gross receipts for the business on the
basis of gross receipts of comparable businesses or
any other information the Revenue Collector
considers useful. On or before July 31 immediately
after the license year, each licensee who paid the tax
for the past license year based on estimated gross
receipts shall submit to the Revenue Collector a
sworn final report showing the amount of gross
receipts for the license year.
(C) If the amount shown is more than the
estimated gross receipts, the licensee shall pay the
amount of the additional tax that would have been
due had the estimate been accurate. If the payment
shown is less than the estimated gross receipts, the
town shall refund to the licensee the difference
between the actual tax paid and the amount of tax that
would have been due had the estimate been accurate.
(D) If a business conducts multiple business
activities, with some falling under Schedule B or C
(both with flat taxes) and others falling under
Schedule D (gross receipts), the business may either:
(1) Purchase several licenses based on the
various methods outlined; or
(2) Purchase one privilege license based
on the total gross receipts of all business activities.
(E) It will be the decision of the business to
choose the second option, the first option being the
default. The licensee, however, may be subject to
additional license taxes that the state authorizes the
town to levy, depending on the licensee’s business,
and for which a separate license must be purchased.
(F) All affidavits or other proof of gross
receipts furnished to the Revenue Collector or his or
her designee pursuant to division (B) of this section
shall remain privileged and confidential and shall not
be disclosed.

Art. 19, Parts 3, 5, and 8; and G.S. Ch. 160A, Art. 8,
delegated to local governmental the responsibility
units to adopt regulations designed to promote the
public health, safety, and general welfare of its
citizenry.
(Ord. CO-2006-07, passed 8-7-06)
§ 151.02 FINDINGS OF FACT.
(A) The floodprone areas within the jurisdiction
of the Town of Elizabethtown are subject to periodic
inundation which results in loss of life, property,
health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce
and governmental services, extraordinary public
expenditures of flood protection and relief, and
impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely
affect the public health, safety, and general welfare.
11
2018 S-11
12 Elizabethtown - Building and Land Use Regulations
(B) These flood losses are caused by the
cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains
causing increases in flood heights and velocities and
by the occupancy in floodprone areas of uses
vulnerable to floods or other hazards.
(Ord. CO-2006-07, passed 8-7-06)
§ 151.03 STATEMENT OF PURPOSE.
It is the purpose of this chapter to promote
public health, safety, and general welfare and to
minimize public and private losses due to flood
conditions within floodprone areas by provisions
designed to:
(A) Restrict or prohibit uses that are dangerous
to health, safety, and property due to water or erosion
hazards or that result in damaging increases in
erosion, flood heights or velocities;
(B) Require that uses vulnerable to floods,
including facilities that serve such uses, be protected
against flood damage at the time of initial
construction;
(C) Control the alteration of natural floodplains,
stream channels, and natural protective barriers,
which are involved in the accommodation of
floodwaters;
(D) Control filling, grading, dredging, and all
other development that may increase erosion or flood
damage; and
(E) Prevent or regulate the construction of flood
barriers that will unnaturally divert floodwaters or
which may increase flood hazards to other lands.
(Ord. CO-2006-07, passed 8-7-06)
§ 151.04 OBJECTIVES.
The objectives of this chapter are:
(A) To protect human life and health;
(B) To minimize expenditure of public money
for costly flood control projects;
(C) To minimize the need for rescue and relief
efforts associated with flooding and generally
undertaken at the expense of the general public;
(D) To minimize, prolonged business losses and
interruptions;
(E) To minimize damage to public facilities and
utilities (i.e., water and gas mains, electric, telephone,
cable and sewer lines, streets, and bridges) that are
located in floodprone areas;
(F) To help maintain a stable tax base by
providing for the sound use and development of
floodprone areas; and
(G) To ensure that potential buyers are aware
that property is in a special flood hazard area.
(Ord. CO-2006-07, passed 8-7-06)

(C) Certification requirements.
(1) Elevation certificates.
(a) An elevation certificate (FEMA
Form 81-31) is required prior to the actual start of any
new construction. It shall be the duty of the permit
holder to submit to the Floodplain Administrator a
certification of the elevation of the reference level, in
relation to mean sea level. The Floodplain
Administrator shall review the certificate data
submitted. Deficiencies detected by such review shall
be corrected by the permit holder prior to the
beginning of construction. Failure to submit the
certification or failure to make required corrections
shall be cause to deny a floodplain development
permit.
(b) A final as-built elevation
certificate (FEMA from 81-31) is required after
construction is completed and prior to certificate of
compliance/occupancy issuance. It shall be the duty
of the permit holder to submit to the Floodplain
Administrator a certification of final as-built
construction of the elevation of the reference level
and all attendant utilities. The Floodplain
Administrator shall review the certificate data
submitted. Deficiencies detected by such review shall
be corrected by the permit holder immediately and
prior to certificate of compliance/occupancy issuance.
In some instances, another certification may be
required to certify corrected as-built construction.
Failure to submit the certification or failure to make
required corrections shall be cause to withhold the
issuance of certification of compliance/occupancy.
(2) Flood proofing certification. If nonresidential
flood proofing is used to meet the
regulatory flood protection elevation requirements, a
flood proofing certificate (FEMA Form 81-65), with
supporting data and an operational plan, is required
prior to the actual start of any new construction. It
shall be the duty of the permit holder to submit to the
Floodplain Administrator a certification of the flood
proofed design elevation of the reference level and all
2018 S-11
Flood Damage Prevention 21
attendant utilities, in relation to mean sea level. Flood
proofing certification shall be prepared by or under
the direct supervision of a professional engineer or
architect and certified by same. The Floodplain
Administrator shall review the certificate data and
plan. Deficiencies detected by such review shall be
corrected by the applicant prior to permit approval.
Failure to submit the certification or failure to make
required corrections shall be cause to deny a
floodplain development permit. Failure to construct
in accordance with the certified design shall be cause
to withhold the issuance of a certificate of
compliance/occupancy.
(3) If a manufactured home is placed
within Zone A, AO, AE, or A1-30 and the elevation
of the chassis is more than 36 inches in height above

above factors shall be submitted with the application
for a variance.
(F) Upon consideration of the factors listed
above and the purposes of this chapter, the Appeal
Board may attach such conditions to the granting of
variances as it deems necessary to further the
purposes of this chapter.
(G) Any applicant to whom a variance is
granted shall be given written notice specifying the
difference between the base flood elevation (BFE)
and the elevation to which the structure is to be built
and that such construction below the base flood
elevation increases risks to life and property, and that
the issuance of a variance to construct a structure
below the base flood elevation will result in increased
premium rates for flood insurance up to $25 per $100
of insurance coverage. Such notification shall be
maintained with a record of all variance actions,
including justification for their issuance.

separate building and only the addition must comply
with the standards for new construction.
(F) Recreational vehicles. Recreational vehicles
shall either:
(1) Be on site for fewer than 180
consecutive days and be fully licensed and ready for
highway use (a recreational vehicle is ready for
highway use if it is on its wheels or jacking system, is
attached to the site only by quick disconnect type
utilities, and has no permanently attached additions);
or
(2) Meet all the requirements for new
construction.
(G) Temporary non-residential structures. Prior
to the issuance of a floodplain development permit

GENERAL PROVISIONS
§ 152.01 FOREWORD: BACKGROUND
INFORMATION.
(A) Most urban expansion takes place in the
form of land subdivision created by private
developers for residential, business and industrial
users.
23
2018 S-11
24 Elizabethtown - Building and Land Use Regulations
Subdivision of land will be explained in the text of
this chapter. Generally, the great bulk of subdivision
activity is for residential use and takes place in the
growing corridors of existing communities.
(B) The streets, blocks, and lots are among the
most permanent features of an urban community.
Rarely can past development errors be corrected. The
town does not spend large sums of money correcting
past errors, while allowing similar errors to be made
in new subdivisions that are located within the city’s
jurisdiction.
(C) Land subdivision regulation is one of the
most important tools for carrying out plans for the
development of the town area. Land development
plans calling for the location of future streets, parks
and schools can be incorporated into plans for new
subdivisions. It is customary to require the
dedication, without cost to the community, of public
street right-of-way and open space land. The
reservation of sites for public buildings or for later
public acquisition is also a frequent practice.
(D) The use of subdivision regulations also
protects the community in other ways. Streets that
are properly designed and adequately paved will
require a minimum amount of maintenance.
Requirements for installing essential utilities, paving
streets and providing other improvements will
discourage the premature and excessive subdivision
of land, which would inevitably, result in scattered
development and increase the cost of governmental
operation. Properly subdivided land stabilizes
property values and thus strengthens the local tax
base.
(E) The subdivision chapter will bring the
developer, the local decision-maker and the
homeowners to a common ground of understanding
in an urban environment. Special note: The
developer should consult any locally adopted area
thoroughfare plan, and hazard mitigation plan.
Reference to these plans by the developer will assist
in proper street design and subdivision location.
(Ord. 00-01, passed 4-3-00)
§ 152.02 TITLE.
This chapter shall be known and may be called
as the “Subdivision Regulations of the Town of
Elizabethtown, North Carolina,” and may be referred
to as the subdivision regulations.
(Ord. 00-01, passed 4-3-00)
§ 152.03 PURPOSE.
(A) The purpose of this chapter is to establish
procedures and standards for the development and
subdivision of land within the territorial jurisdiction
of the town. It is further designed to provide for:
(1) The orderly growth and development
of the town;
(2) The coordination of transportation
networks and utilities within proposed subdivisions
with existing or planned streets and highways within
proposed subdivisions with existing or planned street
and highways and with other public facilities;
(3) The dedication or reservation of
recreation areas serving residents of the immediate
neighborhood within the subdivision and of right-ofway
or easements for street and utility purposes; and
(4) The distribution of population and
traffic in such a manner that will mitigate hazards,
avoid congestion and overcrowding, and will create
conditions that substantially promote the public
health, safety and the general welfare.
(B) This chapter is designed to further facilitate
adequate provision of water, sewerage, parks, schools
and playgrounds, and also to facilitate the further
resubdivision of larger tracts into smaller parcels of
land.

§ 152.31 REVIEW OF MAJOR SUBDIVISIONS.
The sequence of actions prescribed in this
section shall be followed sequentially and may be
combined only at the discretion of the Planning
Board. The actions include the following steps:
(A) Pre-application discussion – Subdivider and
Subdivision Administrator.
(B) Existing features plan (site analysis)
submission.
(C) On-site walkabout by Subdivision
Administrator and applicant.
(D) Pre-submission conference.
(E) Sketch plan submission, review and
approval.
(F) Preliminary plat submission, review, and
approval.
(G) Final plat submission, review, and approval.
(Ord. 00-01, passed 4-3-00)
§ 152.32 ELEMENTS OF THE PRELIMINARY
PLAN PROCESS.
(A) Pre-application discussion. A preapplication
discussion is strongly encouraged
between the applicant, the site designer(s), and the
Subdivision Administrator. The purpose of this
informal meeting is to introduce the applicant and the
site designer(s) to the town’s zoning and subdivision
regulations and procedures and to discuss the
applicant’s objectives in relation to the town’s official
policies and ordinance requirements.
(B) Existing features plan (site analysis). Plans
analyzing each site’s special features are required for
all proposed subdivisions, as they form the basis of
the design process for house locations, lot lines, street
alignments, and conservation areas. The subdivider
or his/her representative shall bring a copy of the
existing features plan to the on-site walkabout.
Detailed requirements for the existing features plan
shall include, at the minimum:
(1) Contour lines based at least upon
topographical maps published by the U.S. Geological
Survey;
(2) The location of severely constraining
elements such as steep slopes (over 25%), wetlands,
watercourses, intermittent streams and 100-year
floodplains, and all rights-of-way and easements;
2018 S-11
Subdivision Regulations 33
(3) The location of significant features
such as woodlands, treelines, open fields or meadows,
scenic views into or out from the property, watershed
divides and drainage ways, fences or stone walls,
rock outcrops, and existing structures, roads, tracks
and trails.
(C) On-site walkabout. After the existing
features plan has been prepared, the Subdivision
Administrator shall schedule a mutually convenient
date to walk the property with the applicant and
his/her site designer. The purpose of this visit is to
familiarize the Subdivision Administrator with the
property’s special features, and to provide him an
informal opportunity to offer guidance to the
applicant regarding the potential house locations,
street alignments, and the tentative location of
conservation areas.
(D) Pre-submission conference. Prior to the
submission of the sketch plan or preliminary plat, the
applicant shall meet with the Subdivision
Administrator to discuss how the severely
constraining elements and the significant features,
which were identified in the Existing Features Plan,
could be applied to the design and layout of the
proposed subdivision. At the discretion of the
Subdivision Administrator this conference may be
combined with the on-site walkabout.
(E) Sketch plan.
(1) After the pre-submission conference, a
sketch plan shall be submitted for all proposed
subdivisions. A sketch plan is drawn to illustrate the
initial thoughts about a conceptual layout for house
sites, street alignments, and conservation areas –
taking into account the special conditions identified
in the existing features plan. This is the stage where
drawings are tentatively illustrated, before heavy
engineering costs are incurred in the design of any
proposed subdivision layout. Prior to the preliminary
plat submission, the applicant shall submit to the
Subdivision Administrator two copies of the sketch
plan of the proposed subdivision containing the
following information:
(a) A sketch vicinity map showing
the location of the subdivision in relation to
neighboring tracts, subdivisions, roads, and
waterways;
(b) The boundaries of the tract and
the portion of the tract to be subdivided;
(c) The total acreage to be
subdivided;
(d) The location of all potential
conservation areas, using the existing features plan.
These areas consist of wetlands, floodplains, slopes
over 25%, soils susceptible to slumping, and
noteworthy natural, scenic, and cultural resources.
(e) The existing and proposed uses of
the land within the subdivision and the existing uses
of land adjoining it;
(f) The proposed street layout with
approximate pavement and right-of-way widths;
(g) Proposed lot layout and size of
lots;
(h) The name, address, and telephone
number of the owner;
(i) The name, if any, of the proposed
subdivision;
(j) Streets and lots of adjacent
developed or platted properties;
(k) The zoning classification of the
tract and of adjacent properties;
(l) A statement from the County
Health Department that a copy of the sketch plan has
been submitted to them, if a septic tank system or
other onsite water or wastewater system is to be used
in the subdivision.
(2) The Subdivision Administrator shall
review the sketch plan for general compliance with
the requirements and goals of this chapter and the
Zoning
2018 S-11
34 Elizabethtown - Building and Land Use Regulations
Ordinance. The Subdivision Administrator shall
advise the applicant, or his authorized agent, of the
regulations pertaining to the proposed subdivision
and the procedures to be followed in the preparation
and submission of the preliminary and final plats.
(3) One copy of the sketch plan shall be
retained by the Subdivision Administrator and one
copy shall be returned to the applicant or his
authorized agent.

preliminary plat, such approval shall be noted on the
three copies of the plat. One print and one original
reproducible drawing of the plat shall be returned to
the subdivider, or his agent, and one copy of the print
shall be retained by the Subdivision Administrator.
(9) Approval of the preliminary plat is
authorization for the subdivider to proceed with the
construction of the necessary improvements in
preparation for the final plat.
(D) Pre-sale or pre-lease of unrecorded lots
permitted upon approval of preliminary plat.

SUBDIVISIONS.
(A) Preparation of final plat and installation of
improvements. Upon approval of the preliminary plat
by the Planning Board, the subdivider may proceed
with the preparation of the final plat, and the
installation of or arrangement for required
improvements in accordance with the approved
preliminary plat and the requirements of this chapter.
Prior to approval of a final plat, the subdivider shall
have installed the improvements specified in this
ordinance or guaranteed their installation as provided
herein. No final plat will be accepted or reviewed by
the Planning Board unless accompanied by written
notice by the Subdivision Administrator
acknowledging compliance with the improvement
and guarantee standards of this ordinance. The final
plat shall constitute only the portion of the
preliminary plat, which the subdivider proposes to
record and develop at that time. Such portion shall
conform to all requirements of this chapter.
(B) Improvements guarantees.
(1) Agreement and security required. In
lieu of requiring the completion, installation, and
dedication of all improvements prior to final plat
approval, the Town Council may enter into an
agreement with the subdivider whereby the
subdivider shall agree to complete all required
improvements. The subdivider shall be allowed to
choose which security or combination of securities
that he or she wishes to provided from the choices
provided below. The town shall not have the
authority to dictate which form of security will be
accepted as an improvement guarantee, and shall be
required to offer a range of options of types of
improvements guarantees from which the subdivider
may choose. Once the agreements are signed by both
parties and the security required herein is provided,
the final plat may be approved, if all other
requirements of this chapter are met. To secure this
agreement, the subdivider shall provide either one or
a combination of the following guarantees not
exceeding 1.2 times the entire cost. Portions of the
security deposit may be released as work progresses.
(a) Surety performance bond(s). The
subdivider shall obtain a performance bond(s) from a
surety bonding company authorized to do business in
the state. The bond(s) shall be payable to the town
and shall be in an amount equal to 1.2 times the entire
cost of installing all required improvements, as
estimated by the town. The duration of the bond(s)
shall be until such time as the improvements are
accepted by the town.
(b) Cash or equivalent security.
1. The subdivider shall deposit
cash, a certified check payable to the town, an
irrevocable letter of credit, or other instrument readily
convertible into cash at face value, either with the
town or in escrow with a financial institution
designated as an official depository of the town. The
use of any instrument other than cash shall be subject
to the approval of the Town Council. The amount of
deposit shall be equal to 1.2 times the cost of
installing all required improvements, as estimated by
the town.
2. If cash or other instrument is
deposited in escrow with a financial institution as
provided above, then the subdivider shall file with the
town a copy of an agreement between the financial
institution and himself guaranteeing the following:
2018 S-11
Subdivision Regulations 36A
A. That the escrow account
shall be held in trust until released by the town and
may not be used or pledged by the subdivider in any
other matter for the term of the escrow; and
B. That in the case of a
failure on the part of the subdivider to complete said
improvements the financial institution shall, upon
notification by the Town Council, and submission by
the Council to the financial institution of an
engineer’s estimate of the amount needed to complete
the improvements, immediately either pay to the town
the funds estimated to complete the improvements, up
to the full balance of the escrow account, or deliver to
the town any other instruments fully endorsed or
otherwise made payable in full to the town.
(2) Default. Upon default, meaning
failure on the part of the subdivider to complete the
required improvements in a timely manner as spelled
out in the performance bond or escrow agreement,
then the surety, or the financial institution holding the
escrow account shall, if requested by the Town
Council, pay all or any portion of the bond or escrow
fund to the town up to the amount needed to complete
the improvements based on an engineering estimate.
Upon payment the town, at its discretion, may expend
such portion of said funds, as it deems necessary to
complete all or any portion of the required
improvements. The town shall return to the
subdivider any funds not spent in completing the
improvements.
(3) Release of guarantee security. The
Town Council may release a portion of any security
posted as the improvements are completed and
approved by the Town Manager. When the Town
Manager approves said improvements, and then the
Council shall immediately release any security
posted.
(C) Submission procedure.
(1) “The subdivider shall submit the final
plat, so marked, to the Subdivision Administrator
who will forward it to the Planning Board for
review”.
(2) The final plat shall be prepared by a
Registered Land Surveyor currently licensed and
registered in the state by the North Carolina State

Surveying in North Carolina, where applicable, and
the requirements of the Bladen County Register of
Deeds.
(4) The final plat shall meet the
specifications in § 152.34 and must be of a size
suitable for recording with the County Register of
Deeds. It must be at the same scale and meet the
same sheet size requirements as the preliminary plat.
Plats may be placed on more than one sheet with
appropriate match lines.
(5) The following signed certificates shall
appear on all three copies of the final plat:
(a) Certificate of ownership and
dedication.
I hereby certify that I am the owner of the property
shown and described hereon, which is located in the

(D) Review procedure.
(1) The Subdivision Review Committee or
the Planning Board shall review the final plat at or
before its next regularly scheduled meeting and shall
approve or disapprove the plat with reasons within 45
days of its first consideration of the plat. During its
review of the final plat the Review Committee or the
Planning Board may appoint an engineer or surveyor
to confirm the accuracy of the plat (if agreed to by the
Town Council). If substantial errors are found, the
costs shall be charged to the subdivider and the plat
shall not be recommended for approval until such
errors have been corrected.
(2) If the final plat is disapproved, the
reasons for such disapproval shall be stated in
writing, specifying the provisions of this chapter with
which the final plat does not comply. A copy of this
statement, along with the original and three prints of
the plat, will be submitted to the subdivider who may
make the recommended changes and submit a revise
plat for approval or may directly appeal to the Town
Council. Resubmission of a revised plat does not
require an additional filing fee. Resubmission must
be made within 60 days and submitted at least one
week prior to the board or committee meeting.
(3) If the final plat is approved
conditionally, the conditions and reasons thereof shall
be stated, in writing, and, if necessary, the Review
Committee or Planning Board may require the
subdivider to submit a revised plat.
(4) Whenever a street or right-of-way
dedication is involved the Town Council must
approve the final plat. If approved by the Review
Committee or Planning Board such a plat shall be
considered by the Town Council at its regularly
scheduled meeting.
(5) Upon approval of the final plat by the
Town Council, Review Committee, or Planning
Board in the absence of a street or right-of-way
dedication, copies shall be distributed as follows.
One original tracing and one print of the plat shall be
filed with the Town Clerk. Two prints shall be
returned to the subdivider, one print shall be retained
by the

DESIGN STANDARDS AND REQUIREMENTS:
DEDICATIONS AND RESERVATIONS
§ 152.49 GENERAL POLICY
REQUIREMENTS.
(A) (1) Land subject to flooding as denoted in
the town’s flood plain maps and land deemed by the
Planning Board to be uninhabitable for other reasons
including, but not limited to, slopes in excess of 25%,
slumping soils, wetlands, habitats for endangered
species, and historic/archeological sites, shall not be
platted for residential occupancy, nor for such other
uses as may increase danger to health, life or
property, or aggravated the flood hazard. Such land
within a plan shall be set aside for such uses as will
not be endangered by periodic or occasional
inundation, or will not produce unsatisfactory living
conditions.
(2) Past records of flood levels shall be
used to determine sufficient area from the centerline
2018 S-11
Subdivision Regulations 39
of streams to provide adequate protection from the
most severe flood of record.
(B) Where land is subdivided into larger parcels
than ordinary building lots, such parcels shall be
arranged so as to allow for the opening of future
streets and logical further subdivision.
(C) Where a proposed residential subdivision
contains or is adjacent to a major highway, it shall be
planned so as to avoid having lots fronting on the
highway in such a manner as to derive their access
from said highway, preferably by providing a
marginal access street for these lots or by backing the
lots to the highway.
(D) Where a proposed subdivision contains or
is adjacent to a railroad right-of-way, it shall be
planned so as to avoid having residential lots front on
a street, which parallels and is adjacent to the railroad
right-of-way.
(E) Subdivision showing reserve strips
controlling access to public ways will not be
approved except when the control and disposition of
land comprising such strips is placed within the
town’s jurisdiction under conditions meeting the
approval of the Subdivision Administrator.
(F) All subdivided land shall be part of a usable
and numbered lot or it shall be reserved as permanent
open space. All major subdivisions shall be required
to reserve a minimum of 5% or more of the gross
land area as permanent open space, subject to the
review of the Planning Board.
(G) If the entire area shown on an approved
preliminary plat is not to be recorded at the same time
as one unit, but instead, sections or units of the entire
subdivision are to be recorded at subsequent time
intervals, then the unit boundaries shall be so
designated as to permit each unit recorded to function
independently of the unit to follow it in the proposed
recording schedule of the subdivider. Temporary
turnarounds shall be constructed by the developer, as
required by the town, at the ends of streets, which are
presently dead-end, but are planned as through streets
when the adjacent unit ultimately recorded.
(H) Areas that have been used for disposal of
solid waste shall not be subdivided unless tests by the
County Health Department, a structural engineer, and
soils expert determine that the land is suitable for the
purpose proposed.
(I) The names of the subdivision and street
shall not duplicate nor closely approximate the names
of
any existing subdivision or streets within the town or
its extraterritorial jurisdiction. The Town Council has
final say regarding names.
(Ord. 00-01, passed 4-3-00)
§ 152.50 UTILITIES.
(A) Utilities described in this section shall
include, but not be limited to water and sewer lines,
electrical distribution systems, and telephone and
cablevision facilities. The utility companies shall be
provided with copies of the preliminary plat by the
subdivider and shall be expected to work with the
subdivider in designing the utilities plan for the
subdivision. Underground installation of utility lines
is required unless the Subdivision Administrator
determines that circumstances exist that make this
requirement impractical.
(B) Requirements for participation in
residential development incentive program. The
developer must meet the following criteria in order to
qualify for incentives listed in §§ 152.50(C)(3),
(C)(4) and 152.52(G):
(1) Development must be contiguous to or
within the town limits and have a signed or valid
annexation petition if applicable. Annexation petition
must be approved before incentive application is
considered.
(2) The developer must have townapproved
engineering plans and as-built
specifications.
(3) The development must be classified as
a major subdivision defined as greater than five acres
of land and seven or more lots. Seven or more lots
must be developable for residential use.
2018 S-11
40 Elizabethtown - Building and Land Use Regulations
(4) Funds are available in the town’s
current fiscal year budget.
(5) Incentive application must be approved
prior to or in conjunction with the final plat.
(6) All developable lots must front a

water and sewer development, expansion and
improvement.
(2) The town will pay for the extension of
water/sewer lines up to a diameter of eight inches for
a maximum distance of 300 feet.
(3) The town will reimburse developers all
water and sewer tap fees within major subdivisions of
seven or more lots for a period of seven years.
Rebates will be given after the house is occupied and
water and sewer service has been established with the
town.
(4) As an incentive to encourage the
subdivider to select the neo-traditional option for
street right-of-way and paving widths, the town will
assume up to 10%, or a maximum of $50,000
(whichever is less), of the installation costs for the
required water and sewer lines in subdivisions
approved for development within the town limits.
This is in addition to § 152.50(C)(2) and (3).
(D) Connection to public water and sewer lines.
(1) Each lot in all subdivisions, within the
corporate limits of the town shall be provided with an
extension of the municipal water and sanitary sewer
systems.
(2) No subdivision shall be connected to
the public water and sewer system(s) and no neotraditional
reimbursements will be made until all
requirements of this chapter have been met and all
required improvements have been installed in
accordance with the final plat for the entire
subdivision, or for the current and all previous
phases, if the subdivision is a phased development.
(E) Where public water and sewer is not
available. All lots in subdivisions not connected to
the town water and sewer systems shall have a
suitable source of water supply and sanitary sewage
disposal which complies with the regulations of the

2006-01, passed 3-6-06) Penalty, see § 152.99
§ 152.51 STREETS; GENERAL STANDARDS.
(A) Street layout.
(1) In any new subdivision the street
layout shall conform to the arrangement, width and
location indicated by an official plan or map for the
town. In areas for which such plans have not been
completed, the streets shall be designed and located
in proper relation to existing and proposed streets, to
the topography, to such natural features as streams
and tree growth, to pubic convenience and safety, and
to the proposed use of land to be served by such
streets.
(2) Residential collector and local streets
and roads shall be laid out in such a way that their use
by through traffic will be discouraged. Streets shall
be designed or walkways dedicated to assure
convenient access to parks, playgrounds, schools, or
other places of public assembly.
(3) The proposed street layout shall be
made according to good land planning practice for the
type development proposed and shall be coordinated
with the street system of the surrounding areas. The
arrangements of streets in new subdivision shall make
provision for the continuation of the principal
existing
streets in adjoining subdivisions or, when adjoining
property is not subdivided, their proper projection
insofar as they may be necessary for vehicular
circulation in the future. The street and alley
2018 S-11
Subdivision Regulations 41
arrangement must be so designated as to cause no
hardship to owners of adjoining property when they
plat their own land and seek to provide for convenient
access to it. When a new subdivision adjoins
subdivided land, the new streets shall be carried to the
boundaries of the tract proposed to be subdivided,
except where it is determined by the Planning Board
that certain streets may not be required to be so
extended.
(4) Proposed streets should be adjusted to
the contour of the land so as to produce usable lots
and streets shall be kept to a minimum.
(B) Intersections.
(1) Intersection of local streets with major
streets shall be kept to a minimum.
(2) An approved permit is required for
connection to any existing state system road. This
permit is required prior to any construction on the
street or road. The application is available at the
office of the nearest district engineer of the NC
Division of Highways.
(3) All connections of private streets to
public streets must be approved by the NCDOT or
Town Council prior to preliminary plat approval.
(C) Cul-de-sacs.
(1) As a feature of subdivision design, culde-
sacs should be discouraged and kept to a
minimum. Cul-de-sacs should not be used to avoid
connection with an existing street or to avoid the
extension of an important street, unless an exception
is granted by the Planning Board.
(2) Permanent dead-end streets
shall not exceed 400 feet in length unless necessitated
by topography or property accessibility and in no case
shall be permitted to be over 900 feet. Measurement
shall be from the point where the centerline of the
dead–end street intersects with the centerline of a
through street to the center of the turnaround of the
cul-de-sacs.
(D) Half-streets.
(1) The dedication of half-streets
of less than 50 feet at the perimeter of a new
subdivision shall be prohibited. If circumstances
render this impracticable, adequate provision for the
concurrent dedication of the remaining half of the
street must be furnished by the subdivider. Where
there exists a half-street in an adjoining subdivision,
the remaining half shall be provided by the proposed
development.
(2) However, in circumstances
where more than 50 feet of right-of-way is required, a
partial width right-of-way, not less than 50 feet in
width, may be dedicated when adjoining undeveloped
property is owned or controlled by the subdivider;
provided that the width of the partial dedication is
such as to permit the installation of such facilities as
may be necessary to serve abutting lots. When the
adjoining property is subdivided, the remainder of the
full required right-of-way shall be dedicated.
(E) Alleys.
(1) Alleys may be required in all
blocks along the rear line of business property, in
multiple-family residential or industrial blocks, if, in
the opinion of the Planning Board, alleys are needed
to service these areas.
(2) All dead-end alleys shall be
provided with a turnaround in accordance with town
standards.
(3) Sharp changes in alignment
and grade shall be avoided. All alleys shall be
designed in accordance with North Carolina
Department of Transportation standards.
(4) No alley shall have access
from a major street or highway, but shall have its
access points confined to minor, lightly traveled
streets.
(F) Street names and signs.
(1) Proposed streets, which are
obviously in alignment with other existing and named
streets, shall bear the assigned name of the existing
streets.
2018 S-11
42 Elizabethtown - Building and Land Use Regulations
(2) In assigning new names, duplication of
existing names shall be avoided and in no case shall
the proposed name be phonetically similar to existing
names in the town and the ETJ irrespective of the use
of a suffix such as a street, road, drive, place, court,
and the like. Street names shall be subject to the
approval of the Town Council.
(3) The subdivider shall be required to
provide and erect metal street name signs to town or
county standards, as appropriate, at all intersections
and at any other point within the subdivision deemed
necessary by the town. Subdividers shall assume the
total cost of all new signs in addition to any
installation costs involved.
(G) Street dedication.
(1) All public streets inside the corporate
limits of the town shall be dedicated to the town and
all public streets in the extraterritorial area shall be
constructed to the standards necessary for acceptance
into the state highway system or the standards in this
chapter, whichever is stricter in regard to each
particular item, and shall be added to the state system,
if eligible. If such a public street is not eligible for
acceptance into the state system, due to an inadequate
number of lots or residences, it shall, nevertheless, be
dedicated to the public.
(2) All public streets shall be built to the
standards of this chapter and all other applicable
standards of the town and/or the North Carolina
Department of Transportation.
(H) Street lights. All subdivisions within the
corporate limits of the town shall have streetlights
installed, according to town policy.
(I) Street trees.
(1) Developers are encouraged to plant
deciduous shade trees along both sides of all streets in
new subdivisions. Such trees should be planted
within the right-of-way areas and be spaced no more
than 40 feet apart.
(2) Developers who choose to exercise the
“bonus option” for street right-of-way and paving
widths, described in § 152.52(A) (1), shall be
required to plant deciduous shade trees along both
sides of all streets in new subdivisions. Such trees
shall be planted within the right-of-way areas and be
spaced no more than 40 feet apart.
(J) Disclosure statement. All streets shown on
the final plat shall be designated in accordance with
G.S. § 136-102.6 and designation as public shall be
conclusively presumed an offer of dedication to the
public. Where streets are dedicated to the public but
not accepted into a municipal or the state system
before lots are sold, a statement explaining the status
of the street shall be included with the final plat.
(K) Access to adjacent properties. Where, in
the opinion of the Planning Board, it is necessary to
provide for street access to an adjoining property,
proposed streets shall be extended by dedication to
the boundary of such property and a temporary
turnaround provided. In areas subdivided and
recorded prior to the adoption of this ordinance (such
as, lots of record) which do not have direct access to a
public road or highway, a private drive or roadway
may provide access for further division meeting the
definition of a minor subdivision in and only if a
permanent easement for such drive or roadway, with
a minimum right-of-way width of 20 feet, is recorded
with the Register of Deeds and depicted as such on
the final plat.
(L) Nonresidential streets. The subdivider of a
nonresidential subdivision shall provide streets in
accordance with the North Carolina Roads, Minimum
Construction Standards and the standards of this
ordinance, whichever are stricter in regard to each
particular item.
(M) Private streets.
(1) Private streets shall be allowed within
the jurisdiction of this chapter only if they meet the
following criteria:
2018 S-11
Subdivision Regulations 43
(a) All private streets shall be
designated as such on the preliminary and final plats.
(b) A right-of-way maintenance
agreement, satisfactory to the Town Manager, must
be recorded by a property owners’ association in the
office of the Register of Deeds to ensure proper
maintenance. The agreement shall specify lot owners’
responsibilities for maintenance of private streets and
drainage systems, and shall provide for assessments
to finance all maintenance activities. In addition, all
property transfer instruments must contain reference
to that agreement, as well as a statement indicating
that the private street does not meet public standards
for maintenance and will not be considered for
maintenance unless improved by the property
owners’ association to those standards. This
agreement shall also specify that unless the street is
privately maintained in condition for safe passage of
public service and emergency vehicles, the town may
provide such maintenance, with charges therefor
becoming a lien on the properties served, dividing
among them proportionate to their assessed tax
valuation.
(2) A legally responsible organization
such as a property owners’ association shall be
established to maintain a private street(s). Documents
to assure private responsibility of future maintenance
and repair by property owners’ association shall be
provided to the town prior to final plat approval.

ground cover and tree growth and general leveling of
the topography.
(4) All changes in street grades shall be
connected by a vertical curve of a minimum length
equivalent in feet to 15 times the algebraic difference
in the rates of grade for major and collector streets,
and one-half this minimum for all other streets.
(C) Horizontal curves.
(1) When a continuous street centerline
deflects at any point by more than 10°, a circular curve
shall be introduced having a radius of a curvature on
said centerline of not less than the following:

Curvature
Major streets and highways 500 feet
Collector streets 300 feet
Minor streets 150 feet
(2) Proper superelevation shall be
provided for curves on major streets and highways.
(3) Tangents. A tangent of not less than
100 feet in length shall be provided between curves.
(D) Grading. All public streets shall be cleared
and graded to a sufficient width so as to provide
adequate shoulders and pedestrian ways. Finished
grades, cross-section, and profile shall be in
accordance with town standards.
(E) Paving (public street). Road base and

(4) Proper sight line shall be maintained at
all intersections of streets. Measured along the
centerline, there shall be a clear sight triangle of 150
feet for major streets and 75 feet on all streets from
the point of intersection, unless the Zoning Ordinance
2018 S-11
Subdivision Regulations 45
specifies differently. This shall be indicated on all
plans. No building or obstruction shall be permitted
in this area.
(G) Sidewalks. When a subdivider selects the
neo-traditional option for street rights-of-way and
pavement widths, described in § 152.52(A)(1), he
shall be required to construct sidewalks on both sides
of the streets. Should the developer choose the neotraditional
option, then the town shall participate in
one-half the sidewalk construction cost. Where the
subdivider chooses the traditional option for street
rights-of-way and pavement widths, described in §
152.52 (A)(1), he may still be required, by the
Planning Board, to construct sidewalks on one or
both sides of the streets in areas likely to be subject to
heavy pedestrian traffic, such as near schools and
shopping areas. Sidewalks shall be constructed to a
minimum width of four feet and shall consist of a
minimum thickness of four inches of concrete – six
inches at driveway crossings. All sidewalks shall be
placed in the right-of-way, unless the development is
platted as a planned unit or group development.
Wherever possible, sidewalks should be separated
from the edge of the street pavement by a minimum
distance of four feet.
(H) Wheelchair ramps. In accordance with
G.S. § 136-44.14, all street curbs in North Carolina
being constructed or reconstructed for maintenance
procedures, traffic operations, repairs, correction of
utilities, or altered for any reason after September 1,
1973, shall provide wheelchair ramps for the
physically handicapped at all intersections where
both curb and gutter and sidewalks are provided and
at other major points of pedestrian flow.

§ 152.53 BLOCKS.
Blocks shall be laid out with special attention
given to the type of use contemplated, zoning
requirements, needs for vehicular and pedestrian
circulation, control and safety of street traffic,
limitations and opportunities of topography, and
convenient access to water areas.
(A) Intersecting streets shall be laid out as such
intervals that block lengths are not more than 800 feet
nor less than 400 feet, except where, in the opinion of
the Planning Board, existing conditions justify a
modification of this requirement.
(B) Blocks shall have sufficient width to
provide for two tiers of lots of appropriate depth,
except where otherwise required, to separate
residential development from through traffic or
nonresidential uses.
(C) Pedestrian ways or crosswalks, not less than
ten feet in width, shall be provided near the center
and entirely across any block 800 feet or more in
length, or at the end of a cul-de-sac, where deemed

bulk requirements set forth in the town Zoning
Ordinance. Whenever there is a discrepancy between
the minimum standards or dimensions noted herein
and those contained in the zoning ordinance, building
codes or other official regulations, the highest or most
restrictive standards shall apply.
(2) Conformance to zoning requirements
means, among other things, that the smallest lot in the
subdivision must meet all dimensional requirements
of the Zoning Ordinance. It is not sufficient merely
for the average lot to meet zoning requirement.
(B) General standards for lots shall be as
follows:

or both, as will be adequate for the purpose. Parallel
streets or frontage roads may be required in
connection therewith.
(C) Public maintenance. Lakes, ponds, creeks,
flood plains and similar areas will be accepted for
maintenance by the town only if sufficient land is
dedicated as a public recreation area or park or if such
area constitutes a necessary part of the drainage
control system. Such areas must be approved by the
Planning Board before approval of the final plat.

§ 152.57 STORM WATER DRAINAGE.
The subdivider shall provide a surface water
drainage system constructed to town standards and to
North Carolina Department of Transportation
standards as reflected in the “Handbook for the
Design of Highway Surface Drainage Structures”, or
the current equivalent, subject to review by the town
engineer. The following shall apply:
(A) No surface water shall be channeled or
directed into a sanitary sewer.
(B) Where feasible, in the opinion of the
Subdivision Administrator, the subdivider shall
connect to an existing storm drainage system by
providing all grading and all structures necessary to
carry the water to the storm drainage system.
Drainage and construction of drainage structures
shall conform to town specifications and standards.
(C) Where an existing storm drainage system
cannot feasibly be extended to the subdivision, a
surface drainage system, approved and accepted by
the town, shall be designed and constructed to protect
the development from water damage.

IMPROVEMENTS
§ 152.65 IMPROVEMENT COSTS.
Prior to approval of the final plat, the following
improvements shall be installed, bonded for or
otherwise guaranteed according to § 152.31. The
subdivider or developer shall assume the entire cost
of all improvements, whether they be sewer line,
water line extensions or street paving, listed in this
section, unless he shall qualify for and select the
“bonus option” for street right-of-way paving widths
§§ 152.52 (A)(1) and 152.50 (B). Any professional
service required in this chapter as a condition of
approval of a subdivision plat, such as soil
percolation tests, shall be also paid for by the
subdivider.
(Ord. 00-01, passed 4-3-00) Penalty, see § 152.99
§ 152.66 GENERAL IMPROVEMENT
REQUIREMENTS.
No construction or installation of improvements
shall commence in a proposed major subdivision until
the preliminary plat has been approved, or until the
2018 S-11
48 Elizabethtown - Building and Land Use Regulations
final plat has been approved in a minor subdivision,
and all plans and specifications have been approved
by the appropriate authorities. All proposed
subdivision located within the territorial jurisdiction
of the town shall comply with the following
improvement requirements:
(A) Permanent monuments and markers.
Permanent monuments shall be placed at all block
corners or at the tangent points of curves connecting
intersecting street lines, at the points of curvature and
tangency in curved street lines, at all corners in the
exterior boundary of the subdivision and at such
other points as may be necessary to make the
retracing of the lines as shown upon the final plat
thereof reasonably convenient. The location of all
such monuments shall be clearly designated on said
final plat. All lot corners shall be marked by
permanent markers. Unless otherwise specified by
this chapter, the “Manual of Practice for Land
Surveying”, as adopted by the North Carolina State
Board of Registration for Professional Engineers and
Land Surveyors shall apply when conducting surveys
for subdivisions, in placing monuments and markers,
and the like.
(B) Required improvements. In addition to
survey monuments and markers, other improvements
must be completed prior to final plat approval, or
their completion provided for as described in division
(D) below. These required improvements include the
construction of streets, storm drainage facilities, and
public water and sewer lines; the planting of street
trees; and the installation of street name signs.
(C) Construction guarantee. In lieu of
completed improvements no final plat shall be
approved or accepted for recording by the Register of
Deeds until the required improvements have been
constructed in a satisfactory manner and approved by
the Subdivision Administrator or, in lieu of such prior
construction, the Town Council may accept a bond
with surety and condition satisfactory to the town,
cash, a certified letter of credit from a local bank, in
an amount equal to 120% of the estimated cost of the
installation of the required improvements, whereby
improvements may be made and utilities installed
without cost to the town or county in the event of
default by the subdivider, owner, or contractor. (see §
152.33(B)). The owner of a subdivision shall require
the contractor constructing streets, curbs, gutters,
drainage facilities, water and sewer lines to give bond
guaranteeing the work against defects for a period of
one year from the date of completion of such
construction.

ADMINISTRATION AND LEGAL PROVISIONS
§ 152.75 SUBDIVISION ADMINISTRATOR.
The holder of the office of Zoning Administrator
is hereby appointed to serve as Subdivision
Administrator.
(Ord. 00-01, passed 4-3-00)
§ 152.76 VARIANCE.
(A) The Zoning Board of Adjustment, after
reviewing the recommendation of the Planning Board
and after holding a public hearing, may authorize a
variance from these regulations when, in its opinion,
undue hardship may result from strict compliance and
only to the extent that is absolutely necessary and not
to an extent which would violate the intent of this
chapter. In granting any variance, the Zoning Board
of Adjustment shall make the findings required
below, taking into account the nature of the proposed
subdivision, the existing use of land in the vicinity,
the number of persons to reside or work in the
proposed subdivision, and the possible effect of the
proposed subdivision upon traffic conditions in the
vicinity.
(B) No variance shall be granted unless the
Zoning Board of Adjustment finds all four of the
following conditions to exist:
(1) Where because of severe topographic
or other condition peculiar to the site, strict adherence
to the provisions of this chapter would cause an
2018 S-11
Subdivision Regulations 48A
unnecessary hardship and would deprive the
applicant of the reasonable use of his land.
(2) That the variance is necessary for the
preservation and enjoyment of a substantial property
right of the petitioner.
(3) That the circumstances giving rise to
the need for the variance are peculiar to the parcel
and are not generally characteristic of other parcels in
the jurisdiction of this chapter.
(4) That the granting of the variance will
not be detrimental to the public health, safety and
welfare or injurious to other property in the territory
in which said property is situated.
(Ord. 00-01, passed 4-3-00)
§ 152.77 SEPARABILITY.
Should any section or provisions of this chapter
be decided by a court of competent jurisdiction to be
unconstitutional or invalid, such decision shall not
affect the validity of the ordinance as a whole or any
part thereof other than the part so declared to be
unconstitutional or invalid.
(Ord. 00-01, passed 4-3-00)
§ 152.78 VESTED RIGHTS.
A landowner submitting a preliminary or final
plat for approval may declare he is seeking to acquire
a vested right pursuant to G.S. § 160A-385.1 and the
Zoning Ordinance by completing the appropriate
form and following the procedure described in the
Zoning Ordinance.
(Ord. 00-01, passed 4-3-00)
§ 152.79 DEVELOPMENT MORATORIA.
The town may adopt temporary moratoria on
any development approval required by law. The
duration of any moratorium shall be reasonable in
light of the specific conditions that warrant
imposition of the
moratorium and may not exceed the period of time
necessary to correct, modify, or resolve such
conditions.
(A) Notice of public hearing. Except in cases of
imminent and substantial threat to public health or
safety, before adopting an ordinance imposing a
development moratorium with a duration of 60 days
or any shorter period, the Town Council shall hold a
public hearing and shall publish a notice of the
hearing in a newspaper having general circulation in
the area not less than seven days before the date set
for the hearing. A development moratorium with a
duration of 61 days or longer, and any extension of a
moratorium so that the total duration is 61 days or
longer, is subject to the published newspaper notice
and hearing requirements required for an amendment
to the zoning ordinance.
(B) Application of moratorium on
existing/pending permits and approvals. Absent an
imminent threat to public health or safety, a
development moratorium adopted pursuant to this
section shall not apply to development set forth in a
site-specific or phased development plan approved
pursuant to a granted vested right, or to development
for which substantial expenditures have already been
made in good faith reliance on a prior valid
administrative or quasi-judicial permit or approval, or
to preliminary or final subdivision plats that have
been accepted for review by the town prior to the call
for the public hearing to adopt the moratorium. Any
preliminary subdivision plat accepted for review by
the town prior to the call for public hearing, if
subsequently approved, shall be allowed to proceed to
final plat approval without being subject to the
moratorium.
(C) Contents of ordinance adopting
moratorium. Any ordinance establishing a
development moratorium must expressly include at
the time of adoption each of the following:
(1) A clear statement of the problems or
conditions necessitating the moratorium and what
courses of action, alternative to a moratorium, were
considered by the town and why those alternative
courses of action were not deemed adequate.
2018 S-11
48B Elizabethtown - Building and Land Use Regulations
(2) A clear statement of the development
approvals subject to the moratorium and how a
moratorium on those approvals will address the
problems or conditions leading to imposition of the
moratorium.
(3) An express date for termination of the
moratorium and a statement setting forth why that
duration is reasonably necessary to address the
problems or conditions leading to imposition of the
moratorium.
(4) A clear statement of the actions, and
the schedule for those actions, proposed to be taken
by the town during the duration of the moratorium to
address the problems or conditions leading to
imposition of the moratorium.
(D) Extension of moratorium. No moratorium
may be subsequently renewed or extended for any
additional period unless the town shall have taken all
reasonable and feasible steps proposed to be taken by
the town in its ordinance establishing the moratorium
to address the problems or conditions leading to the
imposition of the moratorium and unless new facts
and conditions warrant an extension. Any ordinance
renewing or extending a development moratorium
must expressly include, at the time of adoption, the
findings set forth in division (C), including what new
facts or conditions warrant the extension.
(E) Judicial review. Any person aggrieved by
the imposition of a moratorium on development
approvals required by law may apply to the
appropriate division of the General Court of Justice
for an order enjoining the enforcement of the
moratorium, and the court shall have jurisdiction to
issue that order. Actions brought pursuant to this
division (E) shall be set down for immediate hearing,
and subsequent proceedings in those actions shall be
accorded priority by the trial and appellate courts. In
any such action, the town shall have the burden of
showing compliance with the procedural
requirements of this section.
(Ord. CO-2006-01, passed 3-6-06)
§ 152.99 VIOLATIONS AND PENALTIES.
(A) Violations. After adoption of this chapter,
any person who, being the owner or agent of the
owner of any land located within the territorial
jurisdiction of this chapter, thereafter subdivides his
land in violation of this chapter or transfers or sells
land by reference to, exhibition of, or any other use of
a plat showing a subdivision of the land before the
plat has been properly approved under the terms of
this chapter and recorded in the office of the County
Register of Deeds (excepting the pre-sale and prelease
of unrecorded lots referencing an approved
preliminary plat and subject to the requirements of §
152.33(D)), shall be guilty of a violation and guilty of
a Class 1 misdemeanor. The description by metes and
bounds in the instrument of transfer or other
document used in the process of selling or
transferring land shall not exempt the transaction
from this penalty.
(B) Criminal penalties. The violation of any
provision of this chapter shall subject the offender to
criminal prosecution and, upon conviction, to fine
and/or imprisonment set to the maximum allowed by
G.S. § 14-4.
(C) Civil penalties.
(1) Any violation of any provision of this
chapter shall subject the violator to a civil penalty in
the sum of $500 per violation.
(2) A citation for said civil penalty shall
be issued by the Police Department.
(3) Each citation for a civil penalty must
be paid within 72 hours of issuance.
(4) The town, through its attorney or other
official designated by the Town Council, may enjoin
illegal subdivision transfer, or sale of land by action
for injunction or ensure compliance through an order
of abatement. If the violator fails or refuses to
comply with an injunction or order of abatement
within the time allowed by the court, he may be cited
2018 S-11
Subdivision Regulations 48C
for contempt and the town may execute the order of
abatement. The town shall have a lien on the
property for the cost of executing an order of
abatement.
(D) Denial of building permits. The town may
cause building permits to be denied for lots that have
been illegally subdivided.
(E) Continuing violation. Each day’s
continuing violation of this chapter after notification
of such violation shall be a separate and distinct
offense and subject to additional fine or civil penalty.
(F) Equitable remedies. Notwithstanding
division (C) above, this ordinance may be enforced
by appropriate equitable remedies issuing from a
court of competent jurisdiction.
(G) Combination of remedies. Nothing in this
section shall be construed to limit the use of remedies
available to the town. The town may seek to enforce
this ordinance by using any one, all, or a combination
of remedies.

§ 154.12 POWERS AND DUTIES OF HOUSING
ADMINISTRATOR.
The Housing Administrator is hereby designated
as the officer to enforce the provisions of this chapter
and to exercise the duties and powers herein
prescribed. The Building Inspector, at the request of
the Housing Administrator, is authorized to exercise
such powers as may be necessary or convenient to
carry out and effectuate the purpose and provisions of
the ordinance. The Housing Administrator or his
authorized representative shall have the following
powers and duties:
(A) To investigate the dwelling conditions, and
to inspect dwellings and dwelling units located in the
town, in order to determine which dwellings and
dwellings units are unfit for human habitation, and
for the purpose of carrying out the objectives of this
chapter with respect to the repair, closing or
demolition of such dwellings and dwellings units;
(B) To take such action, together with other
appropriate departments and agencies, public and
private, as may be necessary to effect rehabilitation

(C) To keep a record of the results of
inspections made under this chapter and an inventory
of those dwellings that do not meet the minimum

examine witnesses and receive evidence;
(E) To enter upon premises for the purpose of

chapter, and to delegate any of his functions and

AND OCCUPANTS.

occupant of every dwelling, dwelling unit, rooming

(C) Note: When permission to inspect a
dwelling or its premises is denied, the Building
Inspector must obtain a warrant to inspect. G.S. §
15-27.2 provides for the issuance of warrants for the
conduct of inspections authorized by law. The N.C.
Court of Appeals, in In Re Dwelling, 24 N.C. App.
17 (1974), has held that the consent of the tenantoccupant
who was in actual possession and control of
the premises was sufficient to authorize an inspection
without a warrant, notwithstanding the fact that the
owner had objected to the warrantless search. When
faced with a situation where permission to inspect is
denied, building inspectors are advised to seek the
advice of the Town Attorney.
(Ord. 96-4, passed 9-9-96)

owner of a deteriorated or dilapidated dwelling or
dwelling unit to comply with an order of the Housing
Administrator within the time specified therein, if
injunctive relief has not been sought or has not been
granted as provided in the preceding division (1), the
68 Elizabethtown - Building and Land Use Regulations
Housing Administrator shall submit to the Town
Council an ordinance ordering the Housing
Administrator to cause such dwelling or dwelling unit
to be repaired, altered, improved, vacated, closed,
removed or demolished, as provided in the original
order of the Housing Administrator, and pending
removal or demolition, to place a placard on such
dwelling as provided by G.S. § 160A-443 and §
154.16.
(D) Appeals from Orders of Housing
Administrator. An appeal from any decision or order
of the Housing Administrator may be taken by any
person aggrieved thereby. Any appeal from the
Housing Administrator shall be taken within 10 days
from the rendering of the decision or service of the
order, and shall be taken by filing with the Housing
Administrator and with the Zoning Board of
Adjustment a notice of appeal which shall specify the
grounds upon which the appeal is based. Upon the
filing of any notice of appeal, the Housing
Administrator shall forthwith transmit to the Board
all the papers constituting the record upon which the
decision appealed from was made. When an appeal
is from a decision of the Housing Administrator
refusing to allow the person aggrieved thereby to do
any act, his decision shall remain in force until
modified or reversed. When an appeal is from a
decision of the Housing Administrator requiring the
person aggrieved to do any act, the appeal shall have
the effect of suspending the requirement until the
hearing by the Board, unless the Housing
Administrator certifies to the Board, after the notice
of appeal is filed with him, that by reason of the facts
stated in the certificate (a copy of which shall be
furnished the appellant) a suspension of his
requirement would cause imminent peril to life or
property, in which case the requirement shall not be
suspended except for due cause shown upon not less
than one day's written notice to the Housing
Administrator, by the Board, or by a court of record
upon petition made pursuant to G.S. § 160A-446(f)
and division (E) of this section.
(1) The Board shall fix a reasonable time
for the hearing of all appeals, shall give due notice to
all the parties, and shall render its decision within a
reasonable time. Any party may appear in person or
by agent or attorney. The Board may reverse or
affirm, wholly or partly, or may modify the decision
or order appealed form, and may make such decision
and order as in its opinion ought to be made in the
matter, and to that end it shall have all the powers of
the Housing Administrator, but the concurring vote
of four members of the Board shall be necessary to
reverse or modify any decision or order of the
Housing Administrator. The Board shall have power
also in passing upon appeals, in any case where there
are practical difficulties or unnecessary hardships in
the way of carrying out the strict letter of the
ordinance, to adapt the application of the ordinance to
the necessities of the case to the end that the spirit of
the ordinance shall be observed, public safety and
welfare secured, and substantial justice done.
(2) Every decision of the Board shall be
subject to review by proceedings in the nature of
certiorari instituted within 15 days of the decision of
the Board.
(E) Petition to Superior Court by Owner. Any
person aggrieved by an order issued by the Housing
Administrator or a decision rendered by the Board
shall have the right, within 30 days after issuance of
the order or rendering of the decision, to petition the
Superior Court for a temporary injunction restraining
the Housing Administrator pending a final disposition
of the cause, as provided by G.S. § 160A-446(f).

ARTICLE 2. GENERAL REGULATIONS
SECTION 2.1 NORTH CAROLINA STATE BUILDING CODE.
The Town of Elizabethtown Building Code with appendices and the North Carolina State Building
Code are incorporated herein by reference, and serve as the basis for Building Inspector authority
to regulate building construction and repair. This Ordinance is not intended to conflict with or
supersede the North Carolina State Building Code regulations.
SECTION 2.2 INTERPRETATION.
In the event that any question arises concerning the application of regulations, performance
standards, definitions, development criteria, or any other provision of the Zoning Ordinance, the
Zoning Administrator shall be responsible for interpretation and shall look to the Ordinance for
guidance. Responsibility for interpretation by the Zoning Administrator shall be limited to
standards, regulations and requirements of the Zoning Ordinance, but shall not be construed to
include interpretation of any technical codes adopted by reference in the Zoning Ordinance, and
shall not be construed as overriding the responsibilities given to any commission, board, building
inspector, or town officials named in other sections or articles of the Zoning Ordinance.
Interpretations of the Zoning Ordinance may be appealed to the Board of Adjustment.
SECTION 2.3 IDENTIFICATION OF OFFICIAL ZONING MAP.
2.3.1. The Zoning Map shall be identified by the signature of the Mayor attested by the Town Clerk
and bearing the seal of the town under the following words: “This is to certify that this is the
Official Zoning Map of the Zoning Ordinance, Elizabethtown, North Carolina,” together with the
date of the adoption of this Ordinance and most recent revision date.
2.3.2. If, in accordance with the provisions of this Ordinance, changes are made in district
boundaries or other items portrayed on the Zoning Map, such changes shall be entered on the
official zoning map promptly after the amendment has been approved by the Town Council, with
an entry on the official zoning map denoting the date of amendment, description of amendment,
and signed by the Town Clerk. No amendment to this Ordinance which involves matter portrayed
on the official zoning map shall become effective until after such change and entry has been made
on said map.
2.3.3. No changes of any nature shall be made in the official zoning map or matter shown thereon
except in conformity with the procedures set forth in this Ordinance and state law. Any
unauthorized change of whatever kind by any person shall be considered a violation of this
Ordinance and punishable as provided under Section 1.6.
September 4, 2018 Page 2-2 Article 2
ARTICLE 2. GENERAL REGULATIONS
2.3.4. Regardless of the existence of purported copies of the official zoning map which may from
time to time be made or published, the official zoning map, which shall be located in the office of
the Town Clerk, shall be the final authority as to the zoning status of land and water areas,
buildings, and other structures in the town.
2.3.5. In the event the official zoning map becomes damaged, destroyed, lost, or difficult to
interpret, the Town Council may by resolution adopt a new official zoning map which shall
supersede the prior zoning map. The new official zoning map may correct drafting errors or other
errors or omissions in the prior official zoning map, but no correction shall have the effect of
amending the original official zoning map, or any subsequent amendment thereof. The new official
zoning map shall be identified by the signature of the Mayor attested by the Town Clerk, and
bearing the seal of the town under the following words: “This is to certify that this Official Zoning
Map supersedes and replaces the Official Zoning Map adopted (date of adoption of map being
replaced), as part of the Zoning Ordinance, Elizabethtown, North Carolina.”
2.3.6. Unless the prior official zoning map has been lost, or has been totally destroyed, the prior
map or any significant parts thereof remaining, shall be preserved together with all available
records pertaining to its adoption or amendment. In the case of GIS data, each version of the
zoning map produced shall be archived.
SECTION 2.4 ZONING MAP INTERPRETATION.
Where uncertainty exists with respect to the boundaries of any district shown on the Zoning Map,
the following rules shall apply:
2.4.1. Use of Property Lines.
Where district boundaries are indicated as approximately following street lines, alley lines, and lot
lines, such lines shall be construed to be such boundaries. Where streets, highways, railroads,
water courses, and similar areas with width are indicated as the district boundary, the actual
district boundary line shall be the centerline of such area.
2.4.2. Use of the Scale.
In unsubdivided property or where a zone boundary divides a lot, the location of such boundary,
unless the same is indicated by dimensions shall be determined by use of the scale appearing on
the map.
September 4, 2018 Page 2-3 Article 2
ARTICLE 2. GENERAL REGULATIONS

Where any street or alley is hereafter officially vacated or abandoned, the zoning regulations
applicable to each parcel of abutting property shall apply to the centerline of such abandoned
street or alley.
2.4.4. Split Zoned Parcels.
If a district boundary divides a parcel, the requirement for the district in which the greater portion
of the parcel lies shall be extended to the remainder of the parcel, provided that such extension
shall not include any part of such parcel which lies more than one hundred and fifty (150) feet
beyond the existing district boundary, and further provided that the remaining parcel shall not be
less than the minimum required lot area for the district in which it is located. Following adoption
of this Ordinance, split zoning of parcels will not be permitted.
2.4.5. Flood Hazard Boundaries.
Interpretations of the location of floodway and floodplain boundary lines shall be made by the
Zoning Administrator.
2.4.6. Board of Adjustment.
In case any further uncertainty exists, the Board of Adjustment shall interpret the intent of the map
as to location of such boundaries.

the council for the Town of Elizabethtown, as reflected in the Town of Elizabethtown land use plan

buildings under his control except in accordance with all of the applicable provisions of this
Ordinance.

SECTION 2.7 EFFECT OF PRIVATE DEED RESTRICTIONS.
It is not intended by this ordinance to interfere with or annul any easements, covenants or other
agreements between parties except in cases where such agreements require a use or location
prohibited by this ordinance. Where this ordinance imposes a greater restriction on a building,
use, or lot, the provisions of this ordinance shall govern.
SECTION 2.8 FEES.
2.8.1. Reasonable fees sufficient to cover the costs of administration, inspection, publication of
notice, and similar matters may be charged to applicants for zoning permits, sign permits, special
use permits, zoning amendments, variances, appeals, and other administrative relief, and site plan
review. The amount of the fees charged shall be set forth in the town’s budget or as established
by resolution of the council files in the Office of the Town Clerk.
2.8.2. Fees established in accordance with subsection 2.8.1, above, shall be paid upon submission
of a signed application or notice of appeal.
SECTION 2.9 COMPUTATION OF TIME.
2.9.1. Unless otherwise specifically provided, the time within which an act is to be done shall be
computed by excluding the first and including the last day. If the last day is a Saturday, Sunday, or
legal holiday, that day shall be excluded. When the period of time prescribed is less than seven (7)
days, intermediate Saturdays, Sundays, and holidays shall be excluded.
2.9.2. Unless otherwise specifically provided, whenever a person has the right or is required to do

by mail (Certified Mail/Return Receipt Requested), three days shall be added to the prescribed
period.

ARTICLE 3. ADMINISTRATIVE/LEGISLATIVE/QUASI-JUDICIAL AUTHORITY
SECTION 3.1 ZONING ADMINISTRATOR.
3.1.1. The Zoning Administrator, to be designated by the Town Manager, is hereby authorized and
it shall be his/her duty to enforce the provisions of this Ordinance. This official shall have the right
to enter upon any premises regulated by this Ordinance at any reasonable time necessary to carry
out his/her duties. If the suspected violation involves areas which cannot be viewed from public
areas, an administrative search warrant must be obtained from a magistrate or judge authorizing
a reasonable inspection. It is the intention of this Ordinance that all questions arising in connection
with enforcement and interpretation shall be presented first to the Zoning Administrator. Appeal
from his/her decision may be made to the Board of Adjustment. The Zoning Administrator may
be assisted by other town staff in performing the duties herein.
3.1.2. In administering the provisions of this Ordinance, the Zoning Administrator shall:
3.1.2.1. Make and maintain records of all applications for permits, special uses, and
requests listed herein, and records of all permits issued or denied, with notations of all
special conditions or modifications involved.
3.1.2.2. File and safely keep copies of all plans submitted, and the same shall form a part
of the records of his/her office and shall be available for inspection at reasonable times by
any interested party.
3.1.2.3. Conduct pre-application and sketch plan meetings with applicants for development
approval as necessary or appropriate in accordance with Section 5.4.
3.1.2.4. Transmit to the Planning and Zoning Commission, Town Council, and/or the Board
of Adjustment all applications and plans for which their review and approval is required
along with a report of his/her recommendations as may be required.
3.1.2.5. Review and approve zoning permit applications, minor site plans, and engineering
drawings.

3.1.2.8. Conduct inspections of premises and, upon finding that any of the provisions of
this Ordinance are being violated, notify in writing the person responsible for such
violations, indicating the nature of the violation and ordering the action necessary to
correct it. The Zoning Administrator shall order discontinuance of illegal use of land,
buildings or structures; inform the building inspections department designated by the
Elizabethtown Town Council of illegal buildings or of additions, alterations, or structural
changes thereto which are not compliant with the Zoning Ordinance; order discontinuance
of any illegal work being done; or shall take any other action authorized by this Ordinance

3.1.2.9. Maintain the public records of the Planning and Zoning Commission and Board of
Adjustment.
3.1.2.10. Perform site inspections.
SECTION 3.2 CONFLICTS OF INTEREST.
Members of the Town Council, Planning and Zoning Commission, and Board of Adjustment must
act in the public interest and not to advance their own financial interests. A member of an elected
board, planning board or board of adjustment may not vote on a Zoning Ordinance action where
there is a potential financial conflict of interest. A board or council member with a financial
interest in the outcome of the decision may not participate in making rezonings and other
legislative zoning decisions. With quasi-judicial zoning decisions, board members may not
participate in a matter involving someone with whom they have a close family, associational, or
business relationship, nor may they participate if they have a bias (defined as fixed opinion that
is not susceptible to change upon hearing the facts at the hearing). When a member is disqualified
for a conflict of interest, that member must not participate in the hearing in any way, neither
asking questions, nor debating, nor voting on the case. If an objection is raised to a member’s
participation or the member states a conflict of interest, the remaining members shall by majority
vote to decide if the member is excused from participation.

The Planning and Zoning Commission shall act in an advisory capacity to the Town Council in the
matter of guiding and accomplishing a coordinated and harmonious development of the area
within the town jurisdiction.
3.3.3. Creation and Organization.
3.3.3.1. Membership and Vacancies. The Planning and Zoning Commission shall consist
of nine (9) members. Seven (7) members shall reside within the corporate limits of the
Town and be appointed by the Town Council. Two (2) members shall reside within the
Town’s extraterritorial jurisdiction and be appointed by the County Board of
Commissioners. If, despite good faith efforts, sufficient numbers of residents of the
extraterritorial jurisdiction cannot be found to fill the seats reserved for residents of such
area, then the County Board of Commissioners may appoint other residents of the County
(including residents of the Town) to fill these seats. If the County Board of Commissioners
fails to make these appointments within ninety (90) days after receiving a resolution from
the Town Council requesting that they be made, the Town Council may make them.
Members shall be appointed for terms of two (2) years or until their successors shall have
qualified. Vacancies which occur other than the expiration of term shall be filled by the
Town Council or County Board of Commissioners for the remaining period of the term
vacated. Faithful attendance at the meetings of the Board is considered a prerequisite for
the maintenance of membership on the Board. The maximum number of full consecutive
terms that a Planning and Zoning Commission member may serve is three (3), except that
the Town Council may extend the number of terms for a Board Member where it is
determined that continuity of Board leadership, special expertise, and/or exceptional
dedication and experience of a particular Board Member demonstrates the need for such
term extension.
Planning and Zoning Commission members may be removed by the Council at any time for
cause or failure to attend three consecutive meetings or for failure to attend 30% or more
meetings within any 12-month period. Upon request of the Board Member proposed for
removal, the Town Council shall hold a hearing on removal before it becomes effective.

shall not be less than one-half of a newspaper page in size. The advertisement shall only
be effective for property owners who reside in the area of general circulation of the

County property tax listing for the affected property, shall be notified according to the

hearing, reasonably identify the lot that is the subject of the application or appeal, and give
a brief description of the action requested or proposed.
SECTION 4.4 EXPIRATION OF PERMITS.
4.4.1. Zoning and special use permits for which vested rights as specified in Section 4.7 have not
been secured shall expire automatically if, within one (1) year after the issuance of such permits:
4.4.1.1. The use authorized by such permits has not commenced, in circumstances where
no substantial construction, erection, alteration, excavation, demolition, or similar work
is necessary before commencement of such use; or
4.4.1.2. Less than ten (10) percent of the total cost of all construction, erection, alteration,
excavation, demolition, or similar work on any development authorized by such permits
has been completed on the site. With respect to phased development, this requirement
shall apply only to the first phase. If construction of a subsequent stage has not begun
within 365 calendar days (i.e., Phase 2 following completion of Phase 1), the permits for
all subsequent phases shall expire. For example, if a development has five phases, the
permits for Phases 2 through 5 would expire.

ARTICLE 4. LEGISLATIVE/QUASI-JUDICIAL PROCEDURES
4.4.2. If after some physical alteration to land or structures begins and such work is discontinued
for a period (i) of one (1) year if the date of discontinuance occurs more than one year after the
issuance of the permit, or (ii) equal to two years less the time between the issuance of the permit
and the time work is discontinued if the date of discontinuance occurs less than one year after the
issuance of the permit, then the zoning or special use permit authorizing such work shall
immediately expire. However, expiration of the permit shall not affect the provisions of
Section 4.5.
4.4.3. The permit-issuing authority may extend for a period up to six (6) months the date when
a zoning or special use permit would otherwise expire pursuant to subsections 4.4.1 or 4.4.2 if it
concludes that (i) the permit has not yet expired, (ii) the permit recipient has proceeded with due
diligence and in good faith, and (iii) conditions have not changed so substantially as to warrant a
new application. Successive extensions may be granted through a quasi-judicial proceeding for
periods up to six (6) months (for a total period not to exceed three (3) years) upon the same
findings. All such extensions may be granted without resort to the formal processes and fees
required for a new permit. Any permit issued through a quasi-judicial procedure will require a
quasi-judicial proceeding for issuance of a time extension.
4.4.4. For purposes of this section, the special use permit within the jurisdiction of the Town
Council is issued when such board votes to approve the application and issue the permit. A zoning
permit within the jurisdiction of the Zoning Administrator is issued when the earlier of the
following takes place:
4.4.4.1. A copy of the fully executed permit or extension is delivered to the permit
recipient and delivery is accomplished when the permit is hand delivered or mailed to the
permit applicant; or
4.4.4.2. The Zoning Administrator notifies the permit applicant that the application has
been approved and that all that remains before a fully executed permit can be delivered
is for the applicant to take certain specified actions, such as having the permit executed by
the property owner so it can be recorded if required (see Section 4.5.2).
4.4.5. Notwithstanding any of the provisions of Article 9 (Nonconforming Situations), this section
shall be applicable to permits issued prior to the date this section becomes effective.
4.4.6. Special use permits for which vested rights have been secured in accordance with Section
4.7 shall expire at the end of the two-year vesting period.

ARTICLE 4. LEGISLATIVE/QUASI-JUDICIAL PROCEDURES
SECTION 4.5 EFFECT OF PERMIT ON SUCCESSORS AND ASSIGNS.
4.5.1. Zoning, special use permits, sign permits, stormwater or other permits, and floodplain
development permits authorize the permittee to make use of land and structures in a particular
way. Such permits are transferable. However, so long as the conforming uses, land, or structures
or any portion thereof covered under a permit continues to be used for the purposes for which
the permit was granted, then:
4.5.1.1. No person (including successors or assigns of the person who obtained the permit)
may make use of the land or structures covered under such permit for the purposes
authorized in the permit except in accordance with all the terms and requirements of that
permit; and
4.5.1.2. The terms and requirements of the permit apply to and restrict the use of land or
structures covered under the permit, not only with respect to all persons having any
interest in the property at the time the permit was obtained, but also with respect to
persons who subsequently obtain any interest in all or part of the covered property and
wish to use it for or in connection with purposes other than those for which the permit was
originally issued, so long as the persons who subsequently obtain an interest in the
property had actual or record notice (as provided in subsection 4.5.2) of the existence of
the permit at the time they acquired their interest.
4.5.2. Whenever a special use or zoning permit is issued to authorize development (other than
single-family or two-family residences) on a tract of land in excess of one (1) acre, nothing
authorized by the permit may be done until the record owner of the property signs a written
acknowledgment that the permit has been issued so that the permit may be recorded in the
Bladen County Registry and indexed under the record owner' s name as grantor.

statement of the present and proposed zoning regulation or district boundary to be
applied, the name(s) and address(es) of the applicant(s), the owner of the parcel of land
involved in the change if different from the applicant, and all adjacent property owners as
shown on the Bladen County tax listing.
4.6.2.4. One (1) hard copy and one (1) electronic copy of such application shall be filed
with the Zoning Administrator not later than thirty (30) calendar days prior to the Planning

The Planning and Zoning Commission shall advise and comment on whether the proposed text
amendment or map amendment is consistent with the adopted comprehensive plan and any other
applicable officially adopted plans. The Planning and Zoning Commission shall provide a written
recommendation to the Town Council that addresses plan consistency and other matters as
deemed appropriate by the Planning and Zoning Commission, but a comment by the Planning and
Zoning Commission that a proposed amendment is inconsistent with the comprehensive plan shall
not preclude consideration or approval of the proposed amendment by the Town Council. In its
deliberations, the Planning and Zoning Commission shall provide the public an opportunity to
comment on consistency with the Comprehensive Plan.
4.6.4. Action by the Town Council.
Action to consider a rezoning petition, including the scheduling of a public hearing, will be at the
discretion of the Town Council.
4.6.4.1. Before an item is placed on the consent agenda to schedule a public hearing, the
Planning and Zoning Commission's recommendation on each proposed zoning amendment
must be received by the Town Council. If no recommendation is received from the
Planning and Zoning Commission within 30 days from the date when submitted to the
Planning and Zoning Commission, the petitioner may take the proposal to the Town
September 4, 2018 Page 4-7 Article 4
ARTICLE 4. LEGISLATIVE/QUASI-JUDICIAL PROCEDURES
Council without a recommendation from the Planning and Zoning Commission. However,
the Planning and Zoning Commission may request the Town Council to delay final action
on the amendment until such time as the Planning and Zoning Commission can present its
recommendations.
4.6.4.2. After receiving a recommendation from the Planning and Zoning Commission on
a proposed amendment, the Town Council may proceed to vote on the proposed
ordinance, refer it to a committee for further study, or take any other action consistent
with its usual rules of procedure.
4.6.4.3. The Town Council is not required to take final action on a proposed amendment
within any specific period of time, but it should proceed as expeditiously as practicable on
petitions for amendments since inordinate delays can result in the petitioner incurring
unnecessary costs.
4.6.4.4. No member of the Town Council shall vote on any zoning map amendment or text
amendment where the outcome of the matter being considered is reasonably likely to
have a direct, substantial and readily identifiable financial impact on the member or
his/her close family, business, and/or associational relationships. Refer to Section 3.5.5.
4.6.4.5. Prior to adopting or rejecting any zoning text and/or map amendment (including

taken is reasonable and in the public interest.
4.6.4.5.3. A statement approving the zoning amendment and containing at least
all of the following:
4.6.4.5.3.1. A declaration that the approval is also deemed an amendment
to the comprehensive plan. The Town Council shall not require any
additional request or application for amendment to the comprehensive
plan.
September 4, 2018 Page 4-8 Article 4
ARTICLE 4. LEGISLATIVE/QUASI-JUDICIAL PROCEDURES
4.6.4.5.3.2. An explanation of the change in conditions the Town Council
took into account in amending the Ordinance to meet the development
needs of the community.
4.6.4.5.3.3. Why the action was reasonable and in the public interest.
4.6.4.6. In deciding whether to adopt a proposed amendment to this Ordinance, the
central issue before the Town Council is whether the proposed amendment advances the
public health, safety, or welfare. All other issues are irrelevant and all information related
to other issues at the public hearing may be declared irrelevant by the Mayor and
excluded. When considering proposed map amendments:
4.6.4.6.1. The Town Council shall not consider any representations made by the
petitioner that, if the change is granted, the rezoned property will be used for only
one of the possible range of uses permitted in the requested classification. Rather,
the Town Council shall consider whether the entire range of permitted uses in the
requested classification is more appropriate than the range of uses in the existing
classification.
4.6.4.6.2. The Town Council shall not regard as controlling any advantages or
disadvantages to the individual requesting the change, but shall consider the
impact of the proposed change on the public at large.
4.6.5. Citizen Comments.
Zoning ordinances may from time to time be amended, supplemented, changed, modified, or
repealed. If any resident or property owner in the town submits a written statement regarding
a proposed amendment, modification, or repeal to a zoning ordinance to the Clerk to the Board
at least two business days prior to the proposed vote on such change, the Clerk to the Board shall
deliver such written statement to the Board of Commissioners. If the proposed change is the
subject of a quasi-judicial proceeding under NCGS 160A-388, the Clerk shall provide only the
names and addresses of the individuals providing written comment, and the provision of such
names and addresses to all members of the Board shall not disqualify any member of the Board
from voting.
4.6.6. Withdrawal of Application.
An applicant may withdraw his or her application at any time by written notice to the Zoning
Administrator and may resubmit at a subsequent date in compliance with the submittal schedule
contained herein.

permits are issued, the provisions of GS 160A-418 and GS 160A-422 shall apply, except that a
building permit shall not expire or be revoked because of the lack of progress during the two-year
vesting period. The two (2) years may be extended up to five (5) years where warranted in light
of all relevant circumstances, including, but not limited to, the size and phasing of development,
the level of investment, the need for the development, economic cycles, and market conditions.
These determinations shall be in the sound discretion of the town.

Failure to comply with the approved terms and conditions shall result in a forfeiture of vested
rights.

by the town which would change, alter, impair, prevent, diminish, or otherwise delay the
development or use of the property as set forth in this approved site-specific development plan,
except:
4.7.5.1. With the written consent of the affected landowner;
4.7.5.2. Upon findings, by ordinance after notice and a public hearing, that natural or manmade
hazards in the immediate vicinity of the property, if uncorrected, would pose a
serious threat to the public health, safety, and welfare if the project were to proceed as
contemplated in the site-specific development plan;
4.7.5.3. To the extent that the affected landowner receives compensation for all costs,
expenses, and other losses incurred by the landowner, including, but not limited to, all fees
paid in consideration of financing, and all architectural, planning, marketing, legal, and

hearing.
4.7.6. The establishment of a vested right shall not preclude the application of overlay zoning
which imposes additional requirements but does not affect the allowable type or intensity of use,
or ordinances or regulations which are general in nature and are applicable to all property subject
to land use regulation by the town, including, but not limited to, building, fire, plumbing, electrical,
and mechanical codes.
4.7.7. Notwithstanding any provisions of this section, the establishment of a vested right shall not
preclude, change, or impair the authority of the town to enforce provisions of this Ordinance
governing nonconforming situations or uses.
4.7.8. A vested right obtained under this section is not a personal right, but shall attach to and run
with the applicable property. After approval of a site-specific development plan, all successors to
the original landowner shall be entitled to exercise such vested rights.
4.7.9. The town shall not require a landowner to waive his vested rights as a condition of
developmental approval.

requirements of this Ordinance.
4.9.3.10. In the event that a rezoning is sought in conjunction with a special use permit,
such deliberation would be legislative in nature and not part of the quasi-judicial process.
4.9.4. Effect of Approval.
If an application for a special use permit is approved by the Town Council, the owner of the
property shall have the ability to develop the use in accordance with the stipulations contained
in the special use permit, or develop any other use listed as a permitted use for the general zoning
district in which it is located.

4.10.1. Appeals.
4.10.1.1. Any person who has standing under GS 160A-393(d) or the town may appeal a
decision of an administrative officer charged with the enforcement of this Ordinance to the
Board of Adjustment. An appeal is taken by filing a notice of appeal with the Town Clerk.
The notice of appeal shall state the grounds for the appeal. A notice of appeal shall be
considered filed with the Town Clerk when delivered to the Town Hall, and the date and
time of filing shall be entered on the notice by the town staff.
4.10.1.2. The official who made the decision shall give written notice to the owner of the
property that is the subject of the decision and to the party who sought the decision, if
different from the owner. The written notice shall be delivered by personal delivery,
electronic mail, or by first-class mail.
4.10.1.3. The owner or other party shall have thirty (30) days from receipt of the written
notice within which to file an appeal. Any other person with standing to appeal shall have
thirty (30) days from receipt from any source of actual or constructive notice of the
decision within which to file an appeal.

ARTICLE 4. LEGISLATIVE/QUASI-JUDICIAL PROCEDURES
4.10.1.4. The official who made the decision shall transmit to the Board of Adjustment all
documents and exhibits constituting the record upon which the action appealed from is
taken. The official shall also provide a copy of the record to the appellant and to the owner
of the property that is the subject of the appeal if the appellant is not the owner.
4.10.1.5. An appeal of a notice of violation or other enforcement order stays enforcement
of the action appealed from unless the official who made the decision certifies to the Board
of Adjustment after notice of appeal has been filed that because of the facts stated in an
affidavit, a stay would cause immediate peril to life or property or because the violation
is transitory in nature, a stay would seriously interfere with enforcement of the Ordinance.
In that case, enforcement proceedings shall not be stayed except by a restraining order
which may be granted by a court. If enforcement proceedings are not stayed, the
appellant may file with the official a request for an expedited hearing of the appeal, and
the Board of Adjustment shall meet to hear the appeal within fifteen (15) days after such
a request is filed. Notwithstanding the foregoing, appeals of decisions granting permit or
otherwise affirming that a proposed use of property is consistent with the Ordinance shall
not stay the further review of an application for permits or permissions to use such
property; in these situations, the appellant may request and the Board of Adjustment may
grant a stay of a final decision of permit applications or building permits affected by the
issue being appealed.
4.10.1.6. Subject to the provisions of subsection 4.10.1.4, the Board of Adjustment shall
hear and decide the appeal within a reasonable time.
4.10.1.7. The official who made the decision shall be present at the hearing as a witness.
The appellant shall not be limited at the hearing to matters stated in the notice of appeal.
If any party or the town would be unduly prejudiced by the presentation of matters not
presented in the notice of appeal, the Board of Adjustment shall continue the hearing. The
Board of Adjustment may reverse or affirm (wholly or partly) or may modify the decision
appealed from and shall make any order, requirement, decision, or determination that
ought to be made. The Board of Adjustment shall have all the powers of the official who

ARTICLE 4. LEGISLATIVE/QUASI-JUDICIAL PROCEDURES
4.10.2. Variances.
4.10.2.1. An application for a variance shall be submitted to the Board of Adjustment by
filing a copy of the application with the Zoning Administrator 30 days prior to the meeting
at which it will be considered. Applications shall be handled in the same manner as
applications for permits.
4.10.2.2. When unnecessary hardships would result from carrying out the strict letter of
the Zoning Ordinance, the Board of Adjustment shall vary any of the provisions of the
Ordinance upon a showing of all of the following:
4.10.2.2.1. Unnecessary hardship would result from the strict application of the
Ordinance. It shall not be necessary to demonstrate that, in the absence of the
variance, no reasonable use can be made of the property.
4.10.2.2.2. The hardship results from conditions that are peculiar to the property,
such as location, size, or topography. Hardships resulting from personal
circumstances, as well as hardships resulting from conditions that are common to
the neighborhood or the general public, may not be the basis for granting a
variance.
4.10.2.2.3. The hardship did not result from actions taken by the applicant or the
property owner. The act of purchasing property with knowledge that
circumstances exist that may justify the granting of a variance shall not be regarded
as a self-created hardship.
4.10.2.2.4. The requested variance is consistent with the spirit, purpose, and intent
of the Ordinance, such that public safety is secured and substantial justice is
achieved.
4.10.2.3. No change in permitted uses may be authorized by variance. Appropriate
conditions may be imposed on any variance, provided that the conditions are reasonably
related to the variance. Any other ordinance that regulates land use or development may
provide for variances consistent with the provisions of this subsection.
4.10.2.4. The nature of the variance and any conditions attached to it shall be entered on
the face of the zoning permit, or the zoning permit may simply note the issuance of the
variance and refer to the written record of the variance for further information. All such
September 4, 2018 Page 4-18 Article 4
ARTICLE 4. LEGISLATIVE/QUASI-JUDICIAL PROCEDURES
conditions are enforceable in the same manner as any other applicable requirement of this
Ordinance.
4.10.2.5. Reasonable Accommodations. The Town Council is authorized to grant
reasonable accommodations under the Federal Fair Housing Act for the circumstances set
forth in this section.
4.10.2.5.1. Persons Authorized to File Applications. An application for a
reasonable accommodation may be filed only by the owner of the land affected by
the reasonable accommodation; an agent, lessee, or contract purchaser specifically
authorized by the owner to file such application; or any unit of government that is
not the owner of the lot but proposes to acquire the lot by purchase, gift, or
condemnation.
4.10.2.5.2. Pre-Application Conference. Before filing an application for a
reasonable accommodation, the applicant may request a pre-application
conference with the Zoning Administrator under Section 5.4.
4.10.2.5.3. Application Filing and Contents. An application for a reasonable
accommodation shall be filed with the Zoning Administrator and contain: (1) the
applicant’s contact information (name, mailing address, phone number, fax number
and email address); (2) the contact information for the owner(s) of the property (if
different from the applicant); (3) the address of the property at which the
reasonable accommodation is requested; (4) a description of the reasonable
accommodation requested; (5) a statement explaining how and why the request
meets the “Approval Criteria” for a reasonable accommodation (see Section
4.10.2.5.5 below); and (6) notarized signature of the applicant and property
owner(s) (if different from the applicant). No filing fee shall be required for the
application.
4.10.2.5.4. Action by the Board of Adjustment. The Board of Adjustment shall
hold a quasi-judicial hearing on the proposed reasonable accommodation and shall
decide the request upon a majority vote of the members. The quasi-judicial
hearing shall be conducted in accordance with the hearing procedures of Sections
4.2 and 4.3 and the quasi-judicial procedures of Section 4.11. Action by the Board
of Adjustment shall be in accordance with Section 4.11.4. An appeal from a final
decision of the Board of Adjustment shall be governed by the Appeals provisions
September 4, 2018 Page 4-19 Article 4
ARTICLE 4. LEGISLATIVE/QUASI-JUDICIAL PROCEDURES
in Sections 4.10.1, Rehearings in Section 4.12, or Appeals of Quasi-Judicial Decisions
in Section 4.13.
4.10.2.5.5. Approval Criteria. The Board of Adjustment shall grant a reasonable
accommodation to any provision of the Zoning if the Board finds by the greater
weight of the evidence that the proposed reasonable accommodation is both
reasonable and necessary, in accordance with the following:
4.10.2.5.5.1. Reasonable. An accommodation will be determined to be
reasonable if it would not undermine the legitimate purposes and effects
of existing zoning regulations, and if it will not impose significant financial
and administrative burdens upon the town and/or constitute a substantial
or fundamental alteration of the town’s zoning provisions.
4.10.2.5.5.2. Necessary. An accommodation will be determined to be
necessary if it would provide direct or meaningful therapeutic amelioration
of the effects of the particular disability, handicap, or institutionalized
persons and would afford handicapped or disable persons’ equal
opportunity to enjoy and use housing in residential districts in the town.
4.10.3. Burden of Proof in Appeals and Variances.
4.10.3.1. When an appeal is taken to the Board of Adjustment in accordance with Section
4.10.1, the Zoning Administrator shall have the initial burden of presenting to the Board
of Adjustment sufficient evidence and argument to justify the order or decision appealed
from. The burden of presenting evidence and argument to the contrary then shifts to the
appellant, who shall also have the burden of persuasion.
4.10.3.2. The burden of presenting evidence sufficient to allow the Board of Adjustment
to reach the conclusions set forth in Section 4.10.2.2, as well as the burden of persuasion
on those issues, remains with the applicant seeking the variance.
4.10.4. Board of Adjustment Action/Voting
The concurring vote of four-fifths of the Board of Adjustment shall be necessary to grant a
variance. A majority of the members shall be required to decide any other quasi-judicial matter
or to determine an appeal. For the purposes of this subsection, vacant positions on the Board and
members who are disqualified from voting on a quasi-judicial matter shall not be considered
members of the board for calculation of the requisite majority.

ARTICLE 4. LEGISLATIVE/QUASI-JUDICIAL PROCEDURES
SECTION 4.11 PROCEDURES FOR QUASI-JUDICIAL HEARINGS.
4.11.1. Evidence/Presentation of Evidence.
4.11.1.1. The provisions of this section apply to all hearings for which a notice is required
by Section 4.3.
4.11.1.2. All persons who intend to present evidence to the decision-making board shall
be sworn in by the Chair. The Chair of the Board or any member acting as Chair and the
Clerk to the Board are authorized to administer oaths to witnesses in any matter coming
before the Board. Any person who, while under oath during a proceeding before the
decision-making board, willfully swears falsely is guilty of a Class 1 misdemeanor.
4.11.1.3. All findings and conclusions necessary to the issuance or denial of the requested
permit or appeal (necessary findings) shall be based upon competent, substantial evidence.
The term “competent evidence,” as used in this subsection, shall not preclude reliance by
the decision-making board on evidence that would not be admissible under the rules of
evidence as applied in the trial division of the General Court of Justice if (1) the evidence
was admitted without objection or (2) the evidence appears to be sufficiently trustworthy
and was admitted under such circumstances that it was reasonable for the decision-making
board to rely upon it. The term “competent evidence,” as used in this subsection, shall not
be deemed to include the opinion testimony of lay witnesses as to any of the following:
4.11.1.3.1. The use of property in a particular way would affect the value of other
property.
4.11.1.3.2. The increase in vehicular traffic resulting from a proposed development
would pose a danger to the public safety.
4.11.1.3.3. Matters about which only expert testimony would generally be
admissible under the rules of evidence.
4.11.1.4. The entirety of a quasi-judicial hearing and deliberation shall be conducted in
open session.
4.11.1.5. Parties to a quasi-judicial hearing have a right to cross-examine witnesses.
September 4, 2018 Page 4-21 Article 4
ARTICLE 4. LEGISLATIVE/QUASI-JUDICIAL PROCEDURES
4.11.1.6. Factual findings must not be based on hearsay evidence which would be
inadmissible in a court of law.
4.11.1.7. If a member of the decision-making board has prior or specialized knowledge
about a case, that knowledge should be disclosed to the rest of the decision-making board
and parties at the beginning of the hearing.
4.11.1.8. The decision-making board through the Chair, or in the Chair’s absence, anyone
acting as the Chair may subpoena witnesses and compel the production of evidence. To
request issuance of a subpoena, persons with standing under GS 160A-393(d) may make
a written request to the Chair explaining why it is necessary for certain witnesses or
evidence to be compelled. The Chair shall issue requested subpoenas he or she
determines to be relevant, reasonable in nature and scope, and not oppressive. The Chair
shall rule on any motion to quash or modify a subpoena. Decisions regarding subpoenas
made by the Chair may be appealed to the full decision-making board. If a person fails or
refuses to obey a subpoena issued pursuant to this subsection, the decision-making board
or the party seeking the subpoena may apply to the General Court of Justice for an order
requiring that its subpoena be obeyed, and the court shall have jurisdiction to issue these
orders after notice to all property parties.
4.11.2. Modification of Application at Hearing.
4.11.2.1. In response to questions or comments made in sworn testimony at the hearing,
the applicant may agree to modify his application, including the plans and specifications
submitted.
4.11.2.2. Unless such modifications are so substantial or extensive that the decisionmaking
board cannot reasonably be expected to perceive the nature and impact of the
proposed changes without revised plans before it, the decision-making board may approve
the application with the stipulation that the permit will not be issued until plans reflecting
the agreed upon changes are submitted to the Zoning Administrator.
4.11.3. Record.
4.11.3.1. A record shall be made of all hearings required by Section 4.2 and such
recordings shall be kept as provided by state law. Minutes shall also be kept of all such
proceedings. A transcript may be made, but is not required.

as all other types of physical evidence shall be made a part of the record of the proceedings
and shall be kept by the town in accordance with NCGS 160A-393(I).
4.11.4. Quasi-Judicial Decision.
The Board shall determine contested facts and make its decision within a reasonable time. Every
quasi-judicial decision shall be based upon competent, substantial evidence in the record. Each
quasi-judicial decision shall be reduced to writing and reflect the Board’s determination of
contested facts and their application to the applicable standards. The written decision shall be
signed by the Chair or other duly authorized member of the Board. A quasi-judicial decision is
effective upon filing the written decision within the Clerk to the Board or such other office or
official as this Ordinance species. The decision of the Board shall be delivered by personal delivery,
electronic mail, or by first-class mail to the applicant, property owner, and to any person who has
submitted a written request for a copy, prior to the date the decision becomes effective. The
person required to provide notice shall certify that proper notice has been made.
SECTION 4.12 REHEARINGS.
When an application involving a quasi-judicial procedure/petition is denied by the Town Council
or Board of Adjustment, reapplication involving the same property, or portions of the same
property, may not be submitted unless the petitioner can demonstrate a substantial change in the
proposed use, conditions governing the use of the property, or conditions surrounding the
property itself.
SECTION 4.13 APPEALS OF QUASI-JUDICIAL DECISIONS.
4.13.1. Every quasi-judicial decision shall be subject to review by the Superior Court of Bladen
County by proceedings in the nature of certiorari pursuant to GS 160A-393.

later of thirty (30) days after the decision is effective or after a written copy thereof is given in
accordance with Section 4.11.4. When first class mail is used to deliver notice, three (3) days shall
be added to the time to file the petition.
4.13.3. A copy of the writ of certiorari shall be served upon the Town of Elizabethtown.

ARTICLE 5. DEVELOPMENT REVIEW PROCESS
SECTION 5.1 APPLICABILITY.
The purpose of this Article is to establish an orderly process to develop land within the Town of
Elizabethtown. It is also the intent of this Article to provide a clear and comprehensible
development process that is fair and equitable to all interests, including the petitioners, affected
neighbors, town staff, related agencies, the Planning and Zoning Commission and the Town
Council. Approved plans shall be the guiding documents for final approval and permitting.
The development review process applies to all development actions within the planning jurisdiction
except for existing individual lots for single-family detached residential and two-family residential
(duplex) development. The provisions of this Article shall be applicable for all Minor and Major Site
Plans, except as provided in Section 5.2.
SECTION 5.2 APPLICATION NOT REQUIRED; WAIVER.
The Zoning Administrator may waive the required development review process when he
determines that the submission of a development plan in accordance with this Article would serve
no useful purpose. The Zoning Administrator may grant such a waiver only in the following cases:
5.2.1. Accessory structures.
5.2.2. Any enlargement of a principal building by less than 20% of its existing size provided such
enlargement is less than 7,000 square feet and will not result in required parking or landscaping
improvements.
5.2.3. A change in principal use where such change would not result in a change in zoning, lot
coverage, parking, vehicular access, signage, or other site characteristics.
SECTION 5.3 ZONING VERIFICATION.
Zoning compliance must be verified by the Zoning Administrator. If the zoning is in compliance,
the applicant may proceed with submittal of site plan or drawings. If the proposed development
is not zoning compliant, the applicant must request a rezoning (see Section 4.6) or a variance(s)
(see Section 4.10.2) before proceeding with site plan or drawing submittal.

5.4.1. The recommended pre-application meeting is a non-binding and informal review of a
development proposal intended to provide information to the applicant on the procedures and
policies of the Town of Elizabethtown, and does not confer upon the applicant any development
rights. The sketch plan is only a courtesy intended to inform the applicant of the approval criteria
prior to submittal of the development plan; furthermore, sketch plan review does not constitute
approval of the development plan and may not be substituted for any required approvals.
5.4.2. The applicant may schedule a pre-application meeting with the Zoning Administrator to
review a Sketch Plan of the proposed development. The Sketch Plan shall meet the requirements
of Section 5.4.4. The Zoning Administrator will advise the applicant of all applicable town
regulations and policies, may suggest development alternatives, and will discuss application
procedures and fees (see Section 2.8). The Zoning Administrator may submit the Sketch Plan to
other departments or agencies, as appropriate, for input and recommendations. Within fifteen
(15) days of receipt of the sketch plan, the Zoning Administrator shall forward all appropriate
comments to the applicant. This timeframe may be extended if comments are requested from
other agencies.
5.4.3. The applicant is encouraged to incorporate the recommendations of the Zoning
Administrator or authorized staff reviewer into the development plan before submittal.
5.4.4. To ensure an appropriate level of review, applicants are encouraged to submit as much
information as possible. At a minimum, three hard copies and one (1) digital copy of the sketch
plan, drawn to scale, should be submitted, including the following:
5.4.4.1. A scale, preferably the same scale as required for development plan submittal.

5.5.8. Inspections and Certificates of Occupancy.
No new building, or part thereof, shall be occupied, and no addition or enlargement of any existing
building shall be occupied, and no existing building after being altered or moved shall be occupied,
and no change of use shall be made in any existing building or part thereof, until the Building

a certificate of zoning compliance, and shall be issued within five (5) business days after the
erection or structural alteration of such building or part shall have been completed in conformance

ARTICLE 6. ZONING DISTRICTS
SECTION 6.1 ESTABLISHMENT OF ZONING DISTRICTS.
In accordance with the requirements of NCGS Section 160A-382 that zoning regulation be by
districts, the Town of Elizabethtown, as shown on the Zoning Map, is hereby divided into districts
which shall be governed by all of the uniform use and dimensional requirements of this Ordinance.
In the creation of the respective districts, careful consideration is given to the peculiar suitability
of each and every district for the particular regulations applied thereto, and the necessary, proper,
and comprehensive groupings and arrangements of various uses and densities of population in
accordance with a well-considered comprehensive plan for the physical development of the area.
The purposes of establishing the zoning districts are:
• To implement adopted plans;
• To promote public health, safety, and general welfare;
• To provide for orderly growth and development;
• To provide for the efficient use of resources;
• To facilitate the adequate provision of services.
SECTION 6.2 INTERPRETATION.
Zoning districts have uses specified as permitted by right, special uses, and uses permitted with
supplemental regulations. Detailed use tables are provided in Section 6.6 showing the uses
allowed in each district. The following describes the processes of each of the categories that the
uses are subject to:
• Permitted by Right: Administrative review and approval subject to district
provisions and other applicable requirements only.
• Permitted with Supplemental Regulations: Administrative review and approval
subject to district provisions, other applicable requirements, and supplemental
regulations outlined in Article 7.
• Special Uses: Town Council review and approval of Special Use Permit subject to
district provisions, other applicable requirements, and conditions of approval as
specified in Section 4.9. Some Special Uses may also be subject to supplemental
regulations outlined in Article 7.
• Uses Not Permitted: Uses not marked with a P, PS, S, or SS are not permitted.
September 4, 2018 Page 6-2 Article 6
ARTICLE 6. ZONING DISTRICTS
If a use is not specifically listed in any of the districts listed in this Ordinance, then the UDO
Administrator shall have the authority to interpret in which district the use, if any, should be
permitted. If the UDO Administrator rejects a proposal for a use that is not clearly disallowed in
a particular district, then the UDO Administrator shall:
• Ensure that the citizen is provided with a copy of the interpretation in writing.
• Inform the citizen of the right to appeal the decision to the Board of Adjustment.
• Assist with the development of a proposed zoning text change for consideration by
the Planning Board and Town Council allowing policy-makers to determine whether
the proposed use should be an allowable use in the district or not. Financial
responsibility for a proposed zoning text change shall be on the applicant.
SECTION 6.3 PRIMARY ZONING DISTRICTS.
For the purposes of this Ordinance, the Town of Elizabethtown, North Carolina is hereby divided
into the following primary zoning districts:
6.3.1. R-A Residential-Agricultural District.
The R-A district is defined as one to provide land for future development while permitting
continued agricultural use until such time that development is appropriate. Single-family and
manufactured home parks are permitted. It is assumed that approved wells and septic tanks will
be utilized until such time as municipal water and sewer is available.
6.3.2. R-40 Low-Density Residential District.
The R-40 district is defined as low-density residential areas of single-family detached dwellings on
large lots where a full range of public water and sewer services is not anticipated. The uses in this
district are designed to stabilize and protect the low-density, rural residential characteristics of the
area and to prohibit activities of a commercial nature except certain home occupations and health
care facilities controlled by specific limitations.
6.3.3. R-20 Low-Density Residential District.
The R-20 district is defined as low-density residential areas of single-family dwellings plus open
areas where similar residential development will likely occur. The uses in this district are
designated to stabilize and protect the essential characteristics of the area and to prohibit all
activities of a commercial nature except certain home occupations and health care facilities
controlled by specific limitations.
September 4, 2018 Page 6-3 Article 6
ARTICLE 6. ZONING DISTRICTS
6.3.4. R-15 Low-Density Residential District.
The R-15 district is defined as low-density residential areas of mostly single-family dwellings plus
open areas where similar residential development will likely occur. The uses permitted in this
district are designed to stabilize and protect the essential characteristics of the area and to prohibit
all activities of a commercial nature except certain home occupations and health care facilities
controlled by specific limitations.
6.3.5. R-12M Medium-Density and Manufactured Home Park District.
The R-12M district is defined as medium-density residential areas of mostly single-family dwellings,
open areas where similar residential development will likely occur and manufactured home parks.
The uses permitted in this district are designed to stabilize and protect the essential characteristics
of the area and to prohibit all activities of a commercial nature except certain home occupations
and health care facilities controlled by specific limitations.
6.3.6. R-12 Medium-Density Residential District.
The R-12 district is defined as medium-density residential areas of mostly single-family dwellings
and certain open areas where similar residential development will likely occur. The uses permitted
in this district are designed to stabilize and protect all activities of a residential nature except
certain home occupations and health care facilities controlled by specific limitations.
6.3.7. R-10 High-Density Residential District.
The R-10 district is defined as medium- to high-density residential areas where single-family and
multi-family dwellings are co-mingled and certain open areas where similar residential
development will likely occur. The uses permitted in this district are designed to stabilize and
protect the essential characteristics of the area and prohibit all activities of a commercial nature
except certain home occupations and health care facilities controlled by specific limitations.
6.3.8. O-I Office and Institutional District.
The O-I district is defined as certain land areas with structures that provide office space for
professional services and for certain institutional functions; and residential accommodations,
usually medium- or high-density. The district is normally small, and may include older homes
undergoing conversion. The district is usually situated between business and residential districts,
and the regulations are designed to permit development of the enumerated functions and still
protect and be compatible with nearby residential districts.
September 4, 2018 Page 6-4 Article 6
ARTICLE 6. ZONING DISTRICTS
6.3.9. C-1 General Commercial District.
The C-1 district is defined as certain commercial areas which provide a wide selection of
convenience and comparison shopping outlets, furniture showrooms, and for personal services,
in an orderly arrangement of retail facilities, parking and other amenities. This district is
customarily located at the intersection of one or more highways or along thoroughfares. This
district may also provide retailing and personal services for the benefit of residents in nearby areas
and non-residents. Included also are certain functions such as warehousing that are compatible
with the primary uses.
6.3.10. C-2 Central Commercial District.
The C-2 district is defined as certain land and structures that provide personal services, retailing
and business services of all kinds for local and regional commerce. The area is located in the
central business district of the Town where major streets and highways converge. The regulations
are designed to permit a concentrated development of permitted facilities and to protect the
district from over-intensive development and congestion.
6.3.11. CBD Central Business District.
The CBD district is defined as certain land and structures that provide personal services, retailing
and business services of all kinds for local and regional commerce. The area is located in the center
of the Town where major streets and highways converge. The regulations are designed to permit
a concentrated development of permitted facilities and to protect the district from over-intensive
development and congestion. The CBD recognizes the limited space for compact development and
provides for on-street parking.
6.3.12. L-I Light Industrial District.
The L-I district is for industries and warehouses which are not considered detrimental to
surrounding land uses or those industries that are not considered to cause unnecessary loads or
strain on existing public utility facilities. Further, these industries are to comply with applicable
state and federal agencies’ standards for emissions, effluents, noise, or odor.
6.3.13. H-I Heavy Industrial District.
The H-I district is established for the purpose of limiting the location of industries which by nature
of their activities are not compatible with residential, institutional, and commercial uses. In
addition to the permitted uses in the H-I Heavy Industrial District, any building or land may be used
for any other industrial purpose, except that no building or occupancy permit shall be issued for
any of those uses not meeting state and/or federal agencies’ standards for objectionable
emissions, effluents, noise, or odor.
September 4, 2018 Page 6-5 Article 6
ARTICLE 6. ZONING DISTRICTS
6.3.14. B-C Bypass Commercial District.
The intent of the B-C district is to protect natural resources, to encourage appropriate bypass
commercial areas, traffic safety, orderly site development, landscape improvements, and to
enhance the overall appearance of the NC Highway 87 Bypass. The district is designed to serve
motorists traveling the NC Highway 87 Bypass, while providing a wide range of commercial uses
for the community as a whole. All uses within this district shall have an orderly management of
parking and building development with safe access to all adjacent properties and roadways. The
B-C district is the only commercial zoning district allowed within 1,500 feet from each side of the
right-of-way along the NC Highway 87 Bypass within the zoning jurisdiction of the Town of
Elizabethtown.
SECTION 6.4 SPECIAL ZONING DISTRICTS.
The Special Zoning District (SZD) allows a large site to be developed with a mixture of land uses
according to an approved overall site plan. For example, a large tract may be developed with a mix
of single-family and multi-family housing, with part of the site also devoted to commercial and
office uses. The SZD district allows for greater flexibility in dimensional standards (such as lot sizes
and setbacks) upon approval of an overall master plan for the entire development. The district
does not require a rigid separation of different land uses. Uses are limited to the uses identified
in Section 6.6 Table of Uses and Activities. All of the site specific standards and conditions,
including a site plan, are incorporated into the zoning district regulations for the SZD. Approval of
the site plan will establish all zoning requirements for the subject property. A SZD district shall not
be less than three (3) acres in area.
This negotiated approach to a legislative decision allows maximum flexibility to tailor regulations
to a particular site and project. But is also has great potential for abuse - both in terms of impacts
on individual landowners seeking approval and their neighbors and on the public interests zoning
is supposed to promote. Thus, special restrictions have been placed on special zoning. Special
Zoning Districts may only occur at the owner's request and cannot be imposed without the owner's
agreement. The individual conditions and site-specific standards that can be imposed are limited
to those that are needed to bring a project into compliance with town ordinances and adopted
plans and to those addressing the impacts reasonably expected to be generated by use of the site.
The town must assure that all of the factors defining reasonable spot zoning are fully considered
and that the public hearing record reflects that consideration.
Special zoning provides important opportunities to carefully tailor regulations to address the
interest of the landowner, the neighbors, and the public. The town may use special zoning when
it concludes that a particular project should be approved but that the standards in the comparable
September 4, 2018 Page 6-6 Article 6
ARTICLE 6. ZONING DISTRICTS
conventional zoning district(s) are insufficient to protect neighbors or public interests (perhaps
because the conventional zoning allows other uses not suitable for the site or dimensional
standards inadequate to preserve the neighborhood). Special zoning often allows a developer to
proceed with a project in a way that addresses site-specific concerns of neighbors and the Town
of Elizabethtown.
SECTION 6.5 OVERLAY ZONING DISTRICTS.
6.5.1. Airport Hazard Overlay District (AHO).
The purpose of this district is to ensure that the Curtis L. Brown Jr. Field is protected from
incompatible uses and that uses surrounding the facility are compatible with expansion of airport
operations. Refer to Section 7.49 for requirements.
6.5.2. Broad Street Preservation Overlay District (BSP-O).
The Broad Street Preservation Overlay District is intended to: (1) Encourage development and
redevelopment which preserves the visual quality and functional operation of Broad Street; (2)
Enhance the visual image of the community; and (3) Preserve property values. Refer to Section
7.50 for requirements.

these additional waste streams can place a burden on existing waste management and
landfill resources at a local municipal and county level. A developer of a Solar Plant in
North Carolina shall be required to develop a Waste Stream Management Plan (WSMP) for
the construction waste and debris at the site of the said Solar Energy System.

surfaces to where they intersect the horizontal and conical surfaces. Transitional
zones for those portions of the precision approach zones which project through and
beyond the limits of the conical surface, extend a distance of 5,000 feet measured
horizontally from the edge of the approach zones and at 90 degree angles to the
extended runway centerline.
7.49.1.1.4. Horizontal Zone. The horizontal zone is hereby established by swinging
arcs of 10,000 feet radii from the center of each end of the primary surface of each
runway, and connecting the adjacent arcs by drawing lines tangent to those arcs.
The horizontal zone does not include the approach and transitional zones.
7.49.1.1.5. Conical Zone. The conical zone is hereby established as the area that
commences at the periphery of the horizontal zone and extends outward there
from a horizontal distance of 4,000 feet at a slope of 20:1. The conical zone does
not include the precision instrument approach zones and the transitional zones.

no structure or tree shall be erected, altered, allowed to grow, or be maintained in any
zone created by this Ordinance to the height in excess of the applicable height limit herein
established for such zone. Such applicable height limitations are hereby established for
each of the zones in question as follows:
7.49.1.2.1. Approach Zone (Non-Precision Instrument). Slopes upward thirty-four
(34) feet horizontally for each foot vertically beginning at the end of and at the
same elevation as the primary surface and extending to a horizontal distance of
10,000 feet along the extended runway centerline.
7.49.1.2.2. Approach Zone (Precision Instrument Runway Approach). Slopes fifty
(50) feet outward for each foot upward beginning at the end of and at the same
elevation as the primary surface and extending to a horizontal distance of 10,000
feet along the extended runway centerline; thence slopes upward forty (40) feet
horizontally for each foot vertically to an additional horizontal distance of 40,000
feet along the extended runway centerline.
7.49.1.2.3. Transitional Zones. Slopes seven (7) feet outward for each foot upward
beginning at the sides of and at the same elevation as the primary surface and the
approach surface, and extending to a height of 150 feet above the airport elevation.
In addition to the foregoing, there are established height limits sloping seven (7)

construction, alteration, or intended use of any structure, the construction or
alteration of which was begun prior to the effective date of this Ordinance, and is
diligently prosecuted.
7.49.1.4.2. Marking and Lighting. Notwithstanding the preceding provision of this
Section, the owner of any existing non-conforming structure or tree is hereby
required to permit the installation, operation, and maintenance thereon of such
markers and lights as shall be deemed necessary by the Curtis L. Brown, Jr. Field
Commission, for the Curtis L. Brown, Jr. Field, to indicate to the operators of aircraft
in the vicinity of the airport, the presence of such airport hazards. Such markers
and lights shall be installed, operated, and maintained at the expense of the Curtis
L. Brown, Jr. Field Commission if the requirement is in the vicinity of the Curtis L.
Brown, Jr. Field.
7.49.1.5. Permits.
7.49.1.5.1. Future Uses. No material change shall be made in the use of land and
no structure or tree shall be erected, altered, planted, or otherwise established in

Section and this Ordinance are violated. Evidence that FAA Form 7460-1 (as may
be revised from time to time) had been submitted and the findings approved by the
FAA.
7.49.1.5.1.1. However, a permit for a tree or structure of less than 75 feet
of vertical height above the ground shall not be required in the horizontal

horizontal distance of 4,200 feet from each end of the runway except when
such a tree or structure, because of terrain, land contour, or topographic
features, would extend above the height limit prescribed for the respective
zone.
7.49.1.5.1.2. Each application for a permit shall indicate the purpose for
which the permit is desired with sufficient particulars to determine whether
the resulting use, structure, or tree would conform to the regulations herein
prescribed. If such determination is in the affirmative, the permit shall be
granted.
September 4, 2018 Page 7-62 Article 7
ARTICLE 7. SUPPLEMENTAL REGULATIONS
7.49.1.5.1.3. Prior to a Planning and Zoning Commission hearing, Planning
Director shall notify the Airport/Economic Development Commission of any
zoning application for structures that may violate the Airport Hazard
Ordinance. Failure to comply with this section shall not void the application,
so long as all other applicable requirements have been met.
7.49.1.5.1.4. Any structure forty (40) feet or less in height, located in the
Elizabethtown Industrial Park, shall be exempt from the height limitations
requirements, provided that the FAA/State reviews all proposed structures
(in accordance with existing grant agreements).
7.49.1.5.2. Existing Uses. No permit shall be granted that would allow the
establishment or creation of an airport hazard or permit a non-conforming use,
structure, or tree to become a greater hazard to air navigation than it was on the
effective date of this Ordinance or any amendments thereto or than it is when the
application for a permit is made. Except as indicated, all applications for such a
permit shall be granted.
7.49.1.5.3. Nonconforming Uses Abandoned or Destroyed. Whenever the Zoning
Administrator determines that a non-conforming tree or structure has been
abandoned or more that 60 percent torn down, physically deteriorated, or decayed,
no permit shall be granted that would allow such structure or tree to exceed the
applicable height limit or otherwise deviate from the zoning regulations.
7.49.1.5.4. Variances. Any person desiring to erect or increase the height of any
structure, or permit the growth of any tree, or use his property not in accordance
with the regulations prescribed in this Ordinance, may apply to the Board of
Adjustment for a variance from such regulations in accordance with Section 4.10.2.
7.49.1.5.5. Hazard Marking and Lighting. Any permit or variance granted may, if
such action is deemed advisable to effectuate the purpose of this Ordinance and be
reasonable in the circumstances, be so conditioned as to require the owner of the
structure or tree in question to permit the Elizabethtown Airport Commission to
install, operate, and maintain thereon such markers and lights as may be necessary
to indicate to pilots the presence of an airport hazard at the expense of the owner
of the structure or tree, or if circumstances require, at the expense of the Airport
Commission.

ARTICLE 7. SUPPLEMENTAL REGULATIONS
7.49.2. Airport Noise Regulations.
7.49.2.1. Purpose. It is the intent and purpose of this section to promote the public health,
safety, and general welfare by regulating and restricting the development of structures for
human occupancy within an area surrounding the Curtis L. Brown, Jr. Field.
7.49.2.2. Generally Permitted Uses. The following general guidelines should be used to
identify suitable uses within each LUG zone.
7.49.2.2.1. Zone “A.” Generally acceptable for all activities and land uses and no
special noise considerations are required.
7.49.2.2.2. Zone “B.” Few, if any, activities will be affected by aircraft sounds,
although building designs for especially sound sensitive activities such as schools,
churches, auditoriums, hospitals and theaters should consider sound control in
areas closest to the Airport. Detailed studies are recommended for outdoor
amphitheaters and similar places of public assembly for those areas closest to the
airport.
7.49.2.2.3. Zone “C.” Activities where uninterrupted communication is essential
should consider sound exposure in design. Generally residential development is not
considered a suitable use, although multi-family developments where sound control
features have been incorporated in building design might be considered. Open-air
activities and outdoor living and auditoriums, schools, churches, hospitals, theaters,
and similar activities should be avoided.
7.49.2.2.4. Zone “D.” Land should be reserved for activities that can tolerate a high
level of sound exposure. Generally, land in this zone is owned by the Airport and
is left vacant or for use in industrial and commercial uses where relatively high
levels of sound exposure may be acceptable.
7.49.2.3. Construction Standards. An applicant for the construction of a new building shall
provide the Zoning Administrator with the necessary calculations to assure that noise levels
with in the proposed building will not exceed the following standards:
7.49.2.3.1. Sleeping Quarters. (Windows are assumed to be open unless other
provisions are made for adequate ventilation).

24-hour period.
7.49.2.3.2.2. Acceptable. Ldn 45 for not more than 30 minutes per 24-hour
period.
7.49.2.3.3. Insulation Between Dwelling Units. Floor and dividing walls between
attached dwelling units shall have a Sound Transmission Class (STC) of greater that
45.
7.49.2.4. Permits. No material change shall be made in the use of land and no structure
shall be erected, altered or otherwise established in Zone I unless a zoning permit therefore
shall have been applied for and granted by the Zoning Administrator upon determination
that no provision of this Section and this Ordinance are violated and that FAA Form 7460.1
(as may be revised from time to time) has been submitted and approved by the FAA.
7.49.2.5. Variances. Any person desiring to erect or alter a structure or to use this property
not in accordance with the regulations prescribed in this Ordinance, may apply to the Board
of Adjustment for a variance from such regulations in accordance with Section 4.10.2.

SECTION 8.14 NOTES TO THE ZONING DISTRICT DEVELOPMENT STANDARDS.
8.14.1. Minimum Lot Size.
The minimum lot size of any lot not served by water and sewer shall conform to requirements of
the Bladen County Health Department, notwithstanding the requirements of this Article.
8.14.2. Special Use Requirements Take Precedence.
Development standards established as part of issuance of a Special Use Permit shall take
precedence.
8.14.3. Fences, Walls, and Planted Buffer Strips.
Notwithstanding other provisions of this Ordinance, fences, walls, and planted buffer strips may
be permitted in any required yard, or along the edge of any yard. The finished side of the fence,
wall, or planted buffer strip shall face the property line.
8.14.4. Front Yard Setbacks for Dwellings.
The front yard setback requirements of this Ordinance for dwellings shall not apply to any lot
where the average setback of existing buildings located wholly or partially within 100 feet on
either side of the proposed dwelling and on the same side of the same block and use district and
fronting on the same street as such lot is less than the minimum required front yard depth. In
such case, the setback on such lots may be less than the required setback but not less than the
average of the existing setbacks on the aforementioned lots, or a distance of ten (10) feet from
the street right-of-way line, whichever is greater.
8.14.5. Corner Visibility.
In all districts except the CBD Central Business District, no obstruction of any kind or nature to the
visibility of vehicles on streets at intersections shall be erected, maintained, or allowed to exist.
This area of visibility shall be considered to be not more than three (3) feet higher than the curb
level and not less than ten (10) feet from the property corner.
8.14.6. Corner Lots in Residential and Office-Institutional Districts.
On corner lots in any residential or office-institutional district, the side yard, on that side of the lot
abutting the side street, shall not be less than one-half (½) of the front yard requirement on that
side of the street. Accessory buildings on that side of the lot abutting the side street shall not
project beyond the full front yard requirements on that side street.
September 4, 2018 Page 8-15 Article 8
ARTICLE 8. ZONING DISTRICT DESIGN STANDARDS
8.14.7. Corner Lots in Commercial and Manufacturing Districts.
On corner lots in any commercial or manufacturing district except the CBD district, the side yard
on that side of the lot abutting the side street, shall not be less than one-half (½) of the front yard
requirement on that side of the street.
8.14.8. Curb Cuts in Commercial, Manufacturing, and Office-Institutional Districts.
On town-maintained streets, no portion of any entrance driveway leading from a public street shall
be closer than 15 feet to the corner of any intersection measured from the right-of-way line. The
width of any entrance driveway leading from the public street shall not exceed 36 feet at its
intersection with curb or street line. No two (2) driveways leading from a public street shall be
within 20 feet of each other measured along the right-of-way line. On NCDOT-maintained streets,
all curb cuts must comply with NCDOT driveway permit requirements.
8.14.9. Side Yard Provided But Not Required.
Where any side yard is provided, though not required, the same shall be not less than three and
one-half (3-1/2) feet.
8.14.10. Maximum Lot Coverage.
In all zoning districts except the CBD district, the maximum lot coverage for the main building shall
be 60% of the total lot area. In the CBD district, there shall be no maximum lot coverage
requirement.
8.14.11. Structures Permitted Above the Height Limit.
8.14.11.1. Skylight and roof structures for the housing of elevators, stairways, tanks,
ventilating fans, air-conditioning or similar equipment required for operation and
maintenance of buildings may be erected above the height limit in any district.
8.14.11.2. Towers, steeples, flagpoles, chimneys, water tanks, or similar structures may
be erected above the height limits in office and institutional, business and industrial
districts that adjoin other office and institutional, business and industrial districts.
However, any part of such structure which extends above the height limit shall be
separated from any adjoining interior lot line of a lot in a residential district by a distance
equal to at least one-half (½) the height of the structure as measured from the ground.
8.14.11.3. Within residential districts, structures listed in subsection 8.14.11.2 above, may
be erected above the height limits provided any part of such structure which extends
above the height limit shall be separated from any adjoining interior lot line by a distance
September 4, 2018 Page 8-16 Article 8
ARTICLE 8. ZONING DISTRICT DESIGN STANDARDS
equal to at least one-half (½) the height of the structure as measured from the ground.
Otherwise, the structure shall be subject to the usual requirements for the district in which
it is located.
8.14.11.4. Radio and television masts and stations may be erected in any district provided
such facilities are located at least 200 feet from adjacent property lines on lots within or
adjoining residential districts.
8.14.12. Accessory Buildings.
Accessory buildings shall be permitted in any zoning district provided that they abide by the
following conditions:
8.14.12.1. Residential districts (R-A, R-40, R-20, R-15, R-12, R-12M, R-10): Uses within
Residential Districts are limited to one (1) detached garage and two (2) accessory buildings,
each of which shall be located behind the front line of the principal building. Accessory
buildings 750 sq ft or less in size may be located no closer than six (6) feet to any adjoining
lot line. Any accessory building greater than 750 sq ft in size shall meet the setbacks for
a principal building within that zoning district and must be granted a Special Use Permit.
8.14.12.2. Commercial, Industrial, and Institutional Districts (C-1, C-2, L-I, H-I, O-I): Uses
within Commercial, Industrial, and Institutional Districts are limited to two (2) accessory
buildings, unless otherwise granted by Special Use Permit. Accessory buildings 750 sq ft
or less in size may be located no closer than six (6) feet to any adjoining lot line. Any
accessory building greater than 750 sq ft in size shall meet the setbacks for a principal
building within that zoning district. Accessory buildings located in a front yard shall adhere
to the main building front yard setback requirements for the district in which it is located.

ARTICLE 9. NONCONFORMING SITUATIONS
SECTION 9.1 CONTINUATION OF NONCONFORMING SITUATIONS AND COMPLETION OF NONCONFORMING
PROJECTS.
9.1.1. Nonconforming situations that were otherwise unlawful on the effective date of this
Ordinance may be continued, subject to the restrictions and qualifications set forth in Sections 9.2
through 9.5 of this Article.
9.1.2. Nonconforming projects may be completed only in accordance with the provisions of
Section 9.6 of this Article.
SECTION 9.2 NONCONFORMING LOTS.
9.2.1. When a nonconforming lot can be used in conformity with all of the regulations (other than
the area or width requirements) applicable to the district in which the lot is located, such a use may
be made as of right. Otherwise, the nonconforming lot may be used only in accordance with
authorization by the Board of Adjustment, upon request of the property owner. The Board of
Adjustment shall authorize such use if it finds that:
9.2.1.1. The proposed use is one permitted by the regulations applicable to the district in
which the property is located; and
9.2.1.2. The property can be developed as proposed without any significant negative
impact on the surrounding property or the public health, safety, or welfare. In issuing the
permit authorized by this paragraph, the Board of Adjustment may allow deviations from
applicable dimensional requirements (such as setback lines and yard size minimums) if it
finds that no reasonable use of the property can be made without such deviations.
9.2.2. Whenever this Ordinance creates a nonconforming lot and the owner of the nonconforming
lot also owns land adjacent to it, and a portion of this other land can be combined with the
nonconforming lot to create a conforming lot (without thereby creating other nonconformities),
the owner of the nonconforming lot, or his successor in interest, may not take advantage of the
provisions of subsection 9.2.1 of this section.
SECTION 9.3 EXTENSION OR ENLARGEMENT OF NONCONFORMING SITUATIONS.
9.3.1. Except as specifically provided in this section, it shall be unlawful for any person to engage
in any activity that causes an increase in the extent of nonconformity of a nonconforming situation.
September 4, 2018 Page 9-2 Article 9
ARTICLE 9. NONCONFORMING SITUATIONS
9.3.2. Subject to subsection 9.3.4 of this section, a nonconforming use may be extended
throughout any portion of a completed building that, when the use was made nonconforming by
this Ordinance, was manifestly designed or arranged to accommodate such use. However, subject
to Section 9.6 of this article (authorizing the completion of nonconforming projects in certain
circumstances), a nonconforming use may not be extended to additional buildings or to land
outside the original building.
9.3.3. Subject to Section 9.6 of this article (authorizing completion of nonconforming projects in
certain circumstances), a nonconforming use of open land may not be extended to cover more land
than was occupied by that use when it became nonconforming, except that a use that involves the
removal of natural materials from the lot (e.g., a quarry) may be expanded to the boundaries of
the lot where the use was established at the time it became nonconforming, if 10% or more of the
earth products had already been removed at the effective date of this Ordinance.
9.3.4. The volume, intensity, or frequency of use of property where a nonconforming situation
exists may be increased and the equipment or processes used at a location where a nonconforming
situation exists may be changed if these or similar changes amount only to changes in the degree
of activity rather than changes in kind and no violations of other paragraphs of this subsection
occur.
9.3.5. Physical alteration of structures or the placement of new structures on open land are
unlawful if they result in:
9.3.5.1. An increase in the total amount of space devoted to a nonconforming use;
9.3.5.2. Greater nonconformity with respect to dimensional restrictions such as yard
requirements, height limitations, or density requirements; or
9.3.5.3. The enclosure of the previously unenclosed areas, even though those areas were
previously used in connection with the nonconforming activity. An area is unenclosed
unless at least 75% of the perimeter of the area is marked by a permanently constructed
wall or fence.
9.3.6. Minor repairs to and routine maintenance of property where nonconforming situations exist
are permitted and encouraged. Major renovation – i.e., work estimated to cost more than 10%
of the appraised value of the structure to be renovated (and not required by the partial or total
destruction of a structure (see Section 9.3.8)) may be done pursuant to authorization by the Board
of Adjustment, upon request of the owner. The Board of Adjustment shall grant such authorization
September 4, 2018 Page 9-3 Article 9
ARTICLE 9. NONCONFORMING SITUATIONS
if it finds that the work will not result in a violation of any other sections of this Article (particularly
Section 9.3.5) or make the property more incompatible with the surrounding neighborhood.
9.3.7. Notwithstanding Section 9.3.5, any structured used for single-family residential purposes
and maintained as a nonconforming use may be replaced with a similar structure of the same size
or larger size, so long as the replacement does not create new nonconformities or increase the
extent of existing nonconformities with respect to yard size and setback requirements. In
particular, a manufactured home may be replaced with a larger manufactured home, and a “singlewide”
manufactured home may be replaced with a “double-wide.” This subsection is subject to
the limitations stated in Section 9.5 on abandonment and discontinuance of nonconforming
situations.
9.3.8. A structure that is nonconforming in any respect or a structure that is used in a
nonconforming manner may be reconstructed or replaced if partially or totally destroyed, subject
to the following restrictions:
9.3.8.1. The total amount of space devoted to a nonconforming use may not be increased,
except that a larger, single-family residential structure may be constructed in place of a
smaller one and a larger manufactured home intended for residential use may replace a
smaller one.
9.3.8.2. The reconstructed building may not be more nonconforming with respect to
dimensional restrictions such as yard requirements, height limitations, or density
requirements, and such dimensional nonconformities must be eliminated if that can
reasonably be accomplished without unduly burdening the reconstruction process or
limiting the right to continue the nonconforming use of such building.
9.3.8.3. The reconstructed building may not enclose areas that were previously
unenclosed, even though those areas were used in connection with the nonconforming
activity. An area is unenclosed unless at least 75% or more of the perimeter area is marked
by a permanently constructed wall or fence.
9.3.8.4. Except for single-family residential structures (including manufactured homes), if
the estimated cost of the reconstruction work exceeds 10% of the appraised value of the
structure, the work may be done only after authorization by the Board of Adjustment, upon
request of the owner. The Board of Adjustment shall grant such authorization if it finds
that the work will be done in accordance with this subsection and that the reconstructed
building will not make the property more incompatible with the surrounding property that
it was before the destruction occurred.
September 4, 2018 Page 9-4 Article 9
ARTICLE 9. NONCONFORMING SITUATIONS
SECTION 9.4 CHANGE IN KIND OF NONCONFORMING USE.
9.4.1. A nonconforming use may be changed to a conforming use. Thereafter, the property may
not revert to a nonconforming use.
9.4.2. A nonconforming use may be changed to another nonconforming use only if authorized by
the Board of Adjustment. The Board of Adjustment shall grant such authorization if it finds that
the proposed use will be more compatible with the surrounding neighborhood than the use in
operation at the time the permit is applied for. If a nonconforming use is changed to any use other
than a conforming use
SECTION 9.5 ABANDONMENT AND DISCONTINUANCE OF NONCONFORMING SITUATIONS.
9.5.1. When a nonconforming use is discontinued for a consecutive period of 180 days, or
discontinued for any period of time without a present intention to reinstate the nonconforming
use, the property involved may thereafter be used only for conforming purposes, except as
provided in subsection 9.5.2 of this section.
9.5.2. The Board of Adjustment may authorize a nonconforming use that has been discontinued
for more than 180 consecutive days to be reinstated if it finds that the nonconforming use has
been discontinued for less than two (2) years, and the discontinuance resulted from factors that,
for all practical purposes, were beyond the control of the person maintaining the nonconforming
use.
9.5.3. For purposes of determining whether a right to continue a nonconforming situation is lost
pursuant to this subsection, all of the buildings, activities, and operations maintained on a lot are
generally to be considered as a whole. For example, the failure to rent one apartment in a
nonconforming apartment building or one space in a nonconforming manufactured home park for
180 days shall not result in a loss of the right to rent that apartment or space thereafter so long as
the apartment building or manufactured home park as a whole is continuously maintained. But
if a nonconforming use is maintained in conjunction with a conforming use, discontinuance of a
nonconforming use for the required period shall terminate the right to maintain it thereafter. And
so, if a manufactured home is used as a nonconforming use on a residential lot where a conforming
residential structure also is located, removal of that manufactured home for 180 days terminates
the right to replace it.
September 4, 2018 Page 9-5 Article 9
ARTICLE 9. NONCONFORMING SITUATIONS
9.5.4. When a structure or operation made nonconforming by this Ordinance is vacated or
discontinued at the effective date of this Ordinance, the 180-day period for purposes of this
subsection begins at the effective date of the Ordinance.
SECTION 9.6 COMPLETION OF NONCONFORMING PROJECTS.
9.6.1. All nonconforming projects on which construction was begun at least 180 days before the
effective date of this Ordinance as well as all nonconforming projects that are at least twenty five
percent (25%) completed in terms of the total expected cost of the project on the effective date
of this Ordinance may be completed in accordance with the terms of their permits, so long as these
permits were validly issued and remain unrevoked and unexpired. If a development is designed
to be completed in stages, this subsection shall apply only to the particular phase under
construction.
9.6.2. Except as provided in subsection 9.6.1, and except to the extent that a developer has a
vested right as set forth in Section 4.7, all work on any nonconforming project shall cease on the
effective date of this Ordinance, and all permits previously issued for work on nonconforming
projects shall be revoked unless the developer requests an appeal to the Board of Adjustment to
overturn the Zoning Administrator’s decision. An appeal shall stay any revocation. The Zoning
Administrator shall issue such a permit if he/she finds that the applicant has in good faith made
substantial expenditures or incurred substantial binding obligations or otherwise changes his
position in some substantial way in reasonable reliance on the Ordinance as it existed before the
effective date of this Ordinance and thereby would be unreasonably prejudiced if not allowed to
complete his project as proposed. In considering whether these findings may be made, the Zoning
Administrator shall be guided by the following, as well as other relevant considerations:
9.6.2.1. All expenditures made to obtain or pursuant to a building, zoning, sign, or special
or conditional use permit that was validly issued and that remains unrevoked shall be
considered as evidence of reasonable reliance on the land use law that existed before this
Ordinance became effective.
9.6.2.2. Except as provided in subdivision 9.7.2.1, no expenditures made more than 180
days before the effective date of this Ordinance may be considered as evidence of
reasonable reliance on the land use law that existed before this Ordinance became
effective. An expenditure is made at the time a party incurs a binding obligation to make
that expenditure.
September 4, 2018 Page 9-6 Article 9
ARTICLE 9. NONCONFORMING SITUATIONS
9.6.2.3. To the extent that expenditures are recoverable with a reasonable effort, a party
shall not be considered prejudiced by having made those expenditures. For example, a
party shall not be considered prejudiced by having made some expenditures to acquire a
potential development site if the property obtained is approximately as valuable under the
new classification as it was under the old.
9.6.2.4. To the extent that a nonconforming project can be made conforming and that
expenditures made or obligations incurred can be effectively utilized in the completion of
a conforming project, a party shall not be considered prejudiced by having made such
expenditures.
9.6.2.5. A person shall be considered to have acted in good faith if the person (i) had actual
knowledge of a proposed change in the Ordinance affecting the proposed development site
which could not be attributed to him, or (ii) should have known of the proposed change in
the Ordinance.
9.6.2.6. Even though a person had actual knowledge of a proposed change in the land use
law affecting a development site, the Zoning Administrator may still find that he acted in
good faith if he did not proceed with his plans in a deliberate attempt to circumvent the
requirements of the proposed Ordinance. The Zoning Administrator may find that the
developer did not proceed in an attempt to avoid requirements of the proposed Ordinance
if he/she determines that (i) at the time the expenditures were made it was not clear that
the proposed Ordinance would prohibit the intended development, and (ii) the developer
had legitimate business reasons for making expenditures.
9.6.2.7. In deciding whether a permit should be issued under this section, the Zoning
Administrator shall not be limited to either denying a permit altogether or issuing a permit
to complete the project (or phases, sections, or stages thereof) as originally proposed or
approved. Upon proper submission of plans by the applicant, the Zoning Administrator
may also issue a permit authorizing a development that is less nonconforming than the
project as originally proposed or approved but that still does not comply with all the
provisions of the Ordinance making the project nonconforming. The Zoning Administrator
shall not allow the nonconforming project to be constructed or completed in a fashion that
is larger or more extensive than is necessary to allow the developer to recoup and obtain
a reasonable rate of return on the expenditures he has made in connection with that
nonconforming project.
September 4, 2018 Page 9-7 Article 9
ARTICLE 9. NONCONFORMING SITUATIONS
9.6.3. When it appears from the developer's plans or otherwise that a project was intended to be
or reasonably could be completed in phases, stages, segments, or other discrete units, the
developer shall be allowed to complete only those phases or segments with respect to which the
developer can make the showing required under subsection 9.6.2 and obtain permits. In addition
to the matters and subject to the guidelines set forth in subdivisions 9.6.2.1 through 9.6.2.7, the
Zoning Administrator shall, in determining whether a developer would be unreasonably prejudiced
if not allowed to complete phases or segments of a nonconforming project, consider the following
in addition to other relevant factors:
9.6.3.1. Whether any plans prepared or approved regarding incompleted phases constitute
conceptual plans only or construction drawings based upon detailed surveying,
architectural, or engineering work.
9.6.3.2. Whether any improvements, such as streets or utilities, have been installed in
phases not yet completed.
9.6.3.3. Whether utilities and other facilities installed in completed phases have been
constructed in such a manner or location or on such a scale, in anticipation of connection
to or interrelationship with approved but incompleted phases, that the investment in such
utilities or other facilities cannot be recouped if such approved but incompleted phases are
constructed in conformity with existing regulations.
9.6.3.4. The Zoning Administrator shall not consider any application for the permit
authorized by subsection 9.6.2 that is submitted more than sixty (60) days after the
effective date of this Ordinance. The Zoning Administrator may waive this requirement for
good cause shown, but in no case may it extend the application deadline beyond one year.
SECTION 9.7 AUTHORIZATION OF NONCONFORMING PROJECTS.
Whenever an amendment to this Ordinance becomes effective after an application for a
development permit is submitted but before the permit is issued, and the effect of the amendment
is to render the proposed development nonconforming in some respect, then the applicant may
choose to proceed with the development under the previous requirements or under the amended
requirements.

SECTION 9.8 NONCONFORMING SIGNS.
9.8.1. Subject to the remaining restrictions of this section, nonconforming signs that were
otherwise lawful on the effective date of this article may be continued.
9.8.2. No person may engage in any activity that causes an increase in the extent of nonconformity
of a nonconforming sign. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, no nonconforming sign
may be enlarged or altered in such a manner as to aggravate the nonconforming condition; nor
may illumination be added to any nonconforming sign.
9.8.3. A nonconforming sign may not be moved or replaced except to bring the sign into complete
conformity with this article.
9.8.4. If a nonconforming sign is destroyed by natural causes, it may not thereafter be repaired,
reconstructed, or replaced except in conformity with all the provisions of this ordinance, and the
remnants of the former sign structure shall be cleared from the land. For purposes of this section,
a nonconforming sign is “destroyed” if damaged to an extent that the cost of repairing the sign to
its former stature or replacing it with an equivalent sign equals or exceeds the value (tax value if
listed for tax purposes) of the sign damaged.
9.8.5. The message of a nonconforming sign may be changed so long as this does not create any
new nonconformity (for example, by creating an off-premises sign under circumstances where such
a sign would not be allowed).
9.8.6. Subject to other provisions of this section, nonconforming signs may be repaired and
renovated so long as the cost of such work does not exceed within any 12-month period 50% of
the value (tax value if listed for tax purposes) of such sign.

PART IV. SIGN REGULATIONS
SECTION 10.20 PURPOSE AND INTENT.
The purpose and intent of this Article is to support and complement the various land uses allowed
in Elizabethtown’s planning jurisdiction by the adoption of policies and regulations concerning the
placement of signs.
10.20.1. The Elizabethtown Town Council does hereby find and declare the outdoor placement of
signs to be a legitimate use of private property but that the erection of signs should be controlled
and regulated in order to promote the health, safety, welfare and convenience and enjoyment of
travel on and protection of the public investment in streets and roads in Elizabethtown and to
promote the reasonable, orderly and effective display of such signs, displays and devices. Signs
may obstruct views, distract motorists, displace alternative uses for land, and pose other problems
that legitimately call for regulation. The purpose of this section is to regulate the size, color,
illumination, movement, materials, location, height, and condition of all signs placed on private
property for exterior observation, thus ensuring the protection of property values, the character
of the various neighborhoods, the creation of a convenient, attractive and harmonious community,
protection against encroachment on public rights-of-way, and encouraging economic development.
This article allows adequate communication through signage while encouraging aesthetic quality
in the design, location, size, and purpose of all signs. This article must be interpreted in a manner
consistent with the First Amendment guarantee of free speech. If any provision of this article is
found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, such finding must not affect the validity
of other provisions of this article which can be given effect without the invalid provision.
10.20.2. A sign placed on land or on a building for the purpose of identification, protection or
directing persons to a use conducted therein must be deemed to be an integral but accessory and
subordinate part of the principal use of land or building. Therefore, the intent of this article is to
establish limitations on signs in order to ensure they are appropriate to the land, building or use
to which they are appurtenant and are adequate for their, intended purpose while balancing the
individual and community interests identified in subsection 10.20.1 of this section.
10.20.3. These regulations are intended to promote signs that are compatible with the use of the
property to which they are appurtenant, landscape and architecture of surrounding buildings, are
legible and appropriate to the activity to which they pertain, are not distracting to motorists, and
are constructed and maintained in a structurally sound and attractive condition.
September 4, 2018 Page 10-22 Article 10
ARTICLE 10. PERFORMANCE STANDARDS
10.20.4. These regulations do not regulate every form and instance of visual communication that
may be displayed anywhere within the jurisdictional limits of the Town. Rather, they are intended
to regulate those forms and instances that are most likely to meaningfully affect one or more of
the purposes set forth above.
10.20.5. These regulations do not entirely eliminate all of the harms that may be created by the
installation and display of signs. Rather, they strike an appropriate balance that preserves ample
channels of communication by means of visual display while still reducing and mitigating the extent
of the harms caused by signs.
SECTION 10.21 SIGN PERMIT REQUIRED.
10.21.1. With the exception of those signs specifically authorized in Section 10.22 of this article,
no sign may be erected without a permit from the Zoning Administrator (including temporary signs
exceeding 6 square feet).
10.21.2. Application for permits shall be submitted on forms obtainable at the Office of the Zoning
Administrator. Each application shall be accompanied by plans which shall:
10.21.2.1. Indicate the proposed site by identifying the property by ownership, location,
and use.
10.21.2.2. Show the location of the sign on the lot in relation to property lines and
buildings, zoning district boundaries, right-of-way lines, and existing signs.
10.21.2.3. Show size, character, complete structural specifications and methods of
anchoring and support.
10.21.2.4. If conditions warrant, the Zoning Administrator may require such additional
information as will enable him to determine if such sign is to be erected in conformance
with this Ordinance.
