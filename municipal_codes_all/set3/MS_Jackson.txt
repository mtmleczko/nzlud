PREFACE 
    This Code constitutes a complete recodification of the general and permanent ordinances of the City of Jackson, Mississippi. 
    Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the 1971 Code, as supplemented through Ordinance No. 1991-14, adopted March 19, 1991, and ordinances subsequently adopted by the city council. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this Code, the reader can locate any section of the 1971 Code, as supplemented, and any subsequent ordinance included herein. 
    The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order, and the various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Notes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state law have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this Code. 
Chapter and Section Numbering System 
    The chapter and section numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and local government codes. Each section number consists of two parts separated by a dash. The figure before the dash refers to the chapter number, and the figure after the dash refers to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the second section of chapter 1 is numbered 1-2, and the first section of chapter 6 is 6-1. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter, and at the same time new sections can be inserted in their proper place by using the decimal system for amendments. For example, if new material consisting of one section that would logically come between sections 6-1 and 6-2 is desired to be added, such new section would be numbered 6-1.5. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject. The next successive number shall be assigned to the new article or division. New chapters may be included by using one of the reserved chapter numbers. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. 
Page Numbering System 
    The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the volume. The number to the right of the colon represents the number of the page in that portion. In the case of a chapter of the Code, the number to the left of the colon indicates the number of the chapter. In the case of an appendix to the Code, the letter immediately to the left of the colon indicates the letter of the appendix. The following are typical parts of codes of ordinances, which may or may not appear in this Code at this time, and their corresponding prefixes: 
CODE CD1:1 CODE APPENDIX CDA:1 CODE COMPARATIVE TABLES CCT:1 STATE LAW REFERENCE TABLE SLT:1 CODE INDEX CDi:1  
Index 
    The index has been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the index itself which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which the user is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
    A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up-to-date. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited, and the affected page or pages will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
    Keeping this publication up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. As revised pages are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
Acknowledgments 
    This publication was under the direct supervision of James S. Vaught, Supervising Editor, and Robert MacNaughton, Editor, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida. Credit is gratefully given to the other members of the publisher's staff for their sincere interest and able assistance throughout the project. 
    The publisher is most grateful to Ms. Pamela R. Taylor, City Clerk, and Ms. Betty A. Mallett, Deputy City Attorney, for their cooperation and assistance during the progress of the work on this publication. It is hoped that their efforts and those of the publisher have resulted in a Code of Ordinances which will make the active law of the city readily accessible to all citizens and which will be a valuable tool in the day-to-day administration of the city's affairs.

Sec. 1-4. - Catchlines. 
    The catchlines of the several chapters, articles, divisions, sections or subsections of this Code are intended as mere catchwords to indicate the contents of the chapter, article, division, section or subsection and shall not be deemed or taken to be the titles of such chapter, article, division, section or subsection, nor as any part thereof, nor shall they be so deemed when any such chapter, article, division, section or subsection, including the catchlines, are amended or reenacted, unless expressly so provided.

(b)  Amendments to any of the provisions of this Code may be made by amending such provisions by specific reference to the section number of this Code in the following language: "That section _____ of the Code of Ordinances, City of Jackson, Mississippi, is hereby amended to read as follows: ___________."

Sec. 1-6. - Supplementation of Code. 
(a)  By contract or by city personnel, supplements to this Code shall be prepared and printed whenever authorized or directed by the city council. A supplement to the Code shall include all substantive permanent and general parts of ordinances adopted during the period covered by the supplement and all changes made thereby in the Code. The pages of a supplement shall be so numbered that they will fit properly in the Code and will, where necessary, replace pages which have become obsolete or partially obsolete, and the new pages shall be so prepared that, when they have been inserted, the Code will be current through the date of the adoption of the latest ordinance included in the supplement. 
(b)  In preparing a supplement to this Code, all portions of this Code which have been repealed shall be excluded from the Code by the omission thereof from reprinted pages. 
(c)  When preparing a supplement to this Code, the codifier (meaning the person, agency or organization authorized to prepare the supplement) may make formal, nonsubstantive changes in ordinances and parts of ordinances included in the supplement, insofar as it is necessary to do so to embody them into a unified code. For example, the codifier may: 
(1)  Organize the ordinance material into appropriate subdivisions. 
(2)  Provide appropriate catchlines, headings and titles for sections and other subdivisions of the Code printed in the supplement, and make changes in such catchlines, headings and titles. 
(3)  Assign appropriate numbers to sections and other subdivisions to be inserted in the Code and, where necessary to accommodate new material, change existing section or other subdivision numbers. 
(4)  Change the words "this ordinance" or words of the same meaning to "this chapter," "this article," "this division," etc., as the case may be, or to "sections _____ to _____" (inserting section numbers to indicate the sections of the Code which embody the substantive sections of the ordinance incorporated into the Code). 
(5)  Make other nonsubstantive changes necessary to preserve the original meaning of ordinance sections inserted into the Code; but in no case shall the codifier make any change in the meaning or effect of ordinance material included in the supplement or already embodied in the Code. 
Sec. 1-7. - Effect of repeal of ordinances. 
    The repeal of any prior ordinance of the city by any subsequent ordinance shall not operate to revive the provisions of any ordinance which may have been repealed by such prior ordinance, unless such revival shall be expressly provided for. Ordinances repealed remain in force for the trial and punishment of all past violations of them, and for the recovery of penalties and forfeitures already incurred, and for the preservation of all rights and remedies existing by them and so far as they apply, to any office, trust, proceeding, right, contract or event, already affected by them. 
(Code 1971, § 1-5) 
Sec. 1-8. - Miscellaneous ordinances not affected by Code. 
    Nothing in this Code or the ordinance adopting this Code shall affect:

(4)  Any ordinance granting any franchise; 
(5)  Any zoning ordinance of the city; 
(6)  Any subdivision ordinance of the city; 
(7)  Any ordinance appointing individuals to hold an office or sit on a board or committee within the city;

(10)  Relating to municipal street maintenance agreements with the state; 
(11)  Establishing or prescribing grades for streets in the city; 
(12)  Any ordinance of the city prescribing traffic regulations on specific streets or highways in the city, not inconsistent with this Code, such as, but not limited to, ordinances prescribing speed limits, establishing areas or spaces where parking is prohibited or limited, or designating one-way streets or alleys or intersections for the control of traffic by signs or signals. 
All such ordinances are hereby recognized as continuing in full force and effect to the same extent as if set out at length in this Code. 
(Code 1971, §§ 1-16, 26-1, 27-3) 
Sec. 1-9. - Altering Code. 
    It shall be unlawful for any person in the city to change or amend, by additions or deletions, any part or portion of this Code or to insert or delete pages, or portions thereof, or to alter or tamper with such Code in any manner whatsoever except pursuant to ordinance or resolution or other official act of the city council, which will cause the law of the city to be misrepresented thereby. 
(Code 1971, § 1-7) 
Sec. 1-10. - General penalty. 
(a)  Whenever in this Code or in any ordinance of the city, any act is prohibited or is made or declared to be unlawful or an offense or the doing of any act is required, or the failure to do any act is declared to be unlawful or a misdemeanor, where no specific penalty is provided therefor, the violation of any such provisions of this Code or ordinance of the city shall be punished by a fine not exceeding $1,000.00, or by imprisonment up to but not exceeding the maximum allowed under state law, or both such fine and imprisonment. Every day any violation of this Code or any such ordinance shall continue shall constitute a separate offense. 
(b)  In addition to the penalties provided in subsection (a) of this section, any condition caused or permitted to exist in violation, of any of the provisions of this Code or any ordinance shall be deemed a public nuisance and may be abated by the city, as provided by law, and each day that such condition continues shall be regarded as a new and separate offense.

(5)  General grounding. Where electrical power is supplied for an amusement ride or attraction erected permanently or temporarily at carnivals, fairs, and amusement parks by a privately operated generating system, the generator and all equipment shall be properly grounded. 
(6)  Circuit and equipment safety. From the service entrance neutral bar, the circuit grounding and equipment safety grounding conductors shall be continuous and separate throughout the entire system. The portable outlet and terminal boxes shall contain a service ground through grounded receptacles for both circuit and safety. The equipment safety grounding conductors shall be attached to each ride or attraction or concession booth such that a grounding resistance of 25 ohms or less is obtained. Separate steel tracks or steel framework, such as roller coaster tracks or big slides, shall have grounding the same as the service equipment. 
(7)  Current limit devices. Conductors shall be fused or protected to their current-carrying capacities. More than six disconnect switches are not to be in the hot truck or generator unless a main switch is provided. Fuses or current-limiting devices may not be installed in the neutral or grounding conductors. Motors and lighting circuits shall be fused separately. 
(8)  High voltage lines. The outlets or electric power lines carrying more than 120 volts shall be clearly marked to show their voltages. 
(9)  Outdoor apparatus and wiring. Electrical apparatus and wiring located outdoors shall be of such quality and so constructed or protected that exposure to weather will not interfere with its normal operation. 
(10)  Elevated lines. Elevated power lines crossing access or other roads within the grounds of a carnival, fair, or amusement park shall be so suspended as to provide minimum vertical clearance of 15 feet from the road surface and minimum horizontal clearance of three feet on each side of the normal passage space of vehicles. 
(11)  Bus bars. Bus bars shall be located low or near the bottom of the cabinet. Separate bus bars shall be provided for grounding neutral and phase conductors. 
(12)  Color codes. Color code requirements are as follows: 
a.  Color codes painted on the inside and outside of the box, but not on contact surfaces of bus bars, are to be: 
1. Ground-Green or green with a yellow strip 1st Phase-Black 
2nd Phase-Red 2. Neutral-White or natural gray 3rd Phase-Blue 3. On a four-wire delta-connected secondary, the phase conductor having the higher voltage to ground shall be orange.  
b.  These color codes are to carry on through all connected wiring from service through portable power outlet and terminal boxes. Buses may not be less than 200 ampere capacity. The load terminals in a switchboard or panel board shall be located so that it will be unnecessary to reach across or beyond a live bus (hot bus) to make a local connection. 
(13)  Portable power outlet and terminal box. Boxes are to be raintight and kept locked during the time when the general public is in the area. Wood boxes may be used if insulated on all sides with fire-resistant material or painted with insulating varnish. The service power shall be connected to the box by receptacles mounted on the exterior walls which include the safety grounding. The distribution within the box shall be accomplished by neutral terminal bars and circuit breakers or fuses. The branch circuits which include the equipment safety grounding shall obtain their power through receptacles mounted on the exterior of the box. The exterior openings of the receptacles shall be at least six inches above ground level and provided with a protective cover, draining eave or canvas, that will avoid the possibility of rain on the receptacle. If it is required to run conductors directly through an opening on the wall of the box for additional service or to obtain required ampacity, the openings shall be color coded and shall be sized to prevent public accessibility to the interior of the box. The fuses or breakers, in the boxes, shall be secured permanently in place, and all connections to the bus bars within the boxes are to be made with threaded screws and lugs of the proper size to fasten wiring in place. 
(14)  Power sources. Electrical power sources shall be located in a manner permitting proper maintenance and shall be protected either by guards, fencing or enclosure to prevent exposure to hazard and to secure the equipment. 
(Code 1971, § 5-95(e)) 
Sec. 14-116. - Maintenance. 
    The maintenance of the equipment and materials of amusement rides and attractions shall conform to the following: 
(1)  Mechanical parts and machinery. Worn mechanical parts and machinery shall be periodically inspected for loose fasteners. Lockout devices shall be engaged before inspecting or servicing a piece of equipment. Equipment and structure for amusement rides, amusement attractions, and concession booths shall be kept free from protruding nails, loose nails, splintered wood, loose and wobbly seats, and rough, loose or dangerous arm rests. 
(2)  Daily inspections. Every amusement ride and attraction shall be inspected each day of operation to determine that no portion of the ride or attraction is damaged, omitted, or worn in a manner that it is unsafe or that unsafe conditions may develop. 
(3)  Performance of recommended maintenance procedures. Every owner or attendant shall perform manufacturers' recommended maintenance procedures at intervals and in a manner specified by operation and maintenance manual, in the following general areas: Lubrication; air and hydraulic systems; torquing of bolts; wear of bolted or pinned joints; adjustments and care of mechanical components such as brakes, clutches, and air compressors; passenger-securing devices; crowd-control devices; operating and emergency controls; electrical systems; and factory-installed safety devices. 
(4)  Wire rope. Wire rope shall meet the following requirements: 
a.  Wire rope shall be thoroughly examined. Wire rope found to be damaged shall be replaced with new rope of proper design and capacity as per manufacturer's data tag. If safety is involved, any of the following conditions shall be cause for rope replacement: 
1.  In running ropes, six randomly distributed broken wires in one rope lay, or three broken wires in one strand in one rope lay. A "rope lay" is the length along the rope in which one strand makes a complete revolution around the rope. 
2.  In pendants or standing ropes (ropes bearing the entire load and subjected to constant pressure and surge shocks), evidence of more than one broken wire in one rope lay. 
3.  Abrasion, scrubbing or peeling causing loss of more than one-third of the original diameter of the outside individual wires. 
4.  Severe corrosion. 
5.  Kinking, crushing, birdcaging, or other damage resulting in distortion of the rope structure. 
6.  Heat damage. 
7.  Reduction from normal diameter of more than 3/64 of an inch for diameters up to and including three-quarters of an inch; 1/16 of an inch for diameters seven-eighths of an inch to 1 1/8 inches; 3/32 of an inch for diameters 11/4 inches to 11/2 inches. Marked reduction in diameter indicates deterioration of the core resulting in lack of proper support for the load-carrying strands. Excessive rope stretch or elongation may be an indication of internal deterioration. 
8.  Birdcaging or other distortion resulting in some members of the rope structure carrying more load than others. 
9.  Noticeable rusting or development of broken wires in the vicinity of attachments. If this condition is localized in an operating rope, the section in question can be eliminated by making a new attachment. This may be done rather than replacing the entire rope. 
b.  Wire ropes used to support, suspend, bear, or control forces and weights involved in the movement and utilization of tubs, cars, chairs, seats, gondolas, other carriers, the sweeps, or other supporting members of a ride or attraction may not be lengthened or repaired by splicing. 
(5)  Wood components. Footings, splices, uprights, track timbers, ledgers, sills, laps, bracing, flooring, and all other wood components of rides, attractions, and structures shall be inspected for deterioration, cracks or fractures. Emphasis shall be given to ensuring tight nails, bolts, lag bolts, and other fasteners. A minimum of 18 inches of soil, with respect to grade, shall be removed around piling or wood members embedded in dirt for support to check deterioration. When wood piling requires replacement ground level concrete piers shall be used. Wood members found to be defective shall be removed and replaced with material of equal or greater strength and capacity. Repairs and replacements to fixed roller coasters shall be made in accordance with the recommendations of the manufacturer. 
(6)  Wire rope rollers, drums, and sheaves. Mechanical devices that brake, control, or come in contact with wire rope, such as rollers, drums, and sheaves shall be examined on a periodic basis to ensure cleanliness and safe condition. Mechanical devices with broken chips, undue roughness, or uneven wear shall be replaced immediately. 
(7)  Articulations and bearings. Articulations and bearings shall meet the following requirements: 
a.  The articulating pinions, frames, sweeps, eccentrics, and other mechanical members shall be inspected for wear, out-of-round, cracks, and other signs of deterioration, and shall be kept in good repair. 
b.  All main center spindles not visible to the naked eye shall be X-rayed or magnafluxed by the owner. Test results shall have listed on them the date of the test, name of the ride owner, and serial number or identification number of the device, and shall be forwarded to the city. 
c.  Bearing surfaces, ball joints and other single- or multiple-direction mechanical surfaces shall be kept well lubricated, clean, and inspected for out-of-round or out-of-spherical and shall be kept in good repair. 
d.  Gear alignment and gear drives shall be kept in good repair. 
(8)  Electrical wiring. Motor wiring, general service circuitry, decorative wiring, and festoon wiring shall be inspected for insulation wear, fraying, or other signs of deterioration such as cracking. Secure tape repairs may be used; however, use of tape repairs shall be kept to a minimum. Wire clips on articulating devices shall be kept in good repair, and wires at elbows and at the end of articulating devices shall be emphasized during inspections. 
(9)  Safety devices. Retaining, restraining, and containing devices shall be inspected to ensure they can continuously fulfill their function. Worn and damaged areas shall be repaired immediately or shall be cause for immediate replacement. 
(10)  Hydraulic systems. The system is to be checked for leaks, damaged pipes, and worn or deteriorated hoses.

(1)  Information contained in the application, or supplemental information requested from the applicant, is found to be false in any material detail; or 
(2)  The applicant fails to complete the application form within five calendar days after having been notified of the additional information or documents required; or 
(3)  Another special event permit application has been received prior in time, or has already been approved, to hold another event at the same time and place requested by the applicant; or so close in time and place as to cause undue traffic congestion; or 
(4)  Another special event permit application has been received prior in time or has already been approved such that the police department is unable to meet the needs for police services for both events; or 
(5)  The time, route, or size of the event will substantially interrupt the safe and orderly movement of traffic contiguous to the event site or route, or disrupt the use of a street at a time when it is usually subject to great traffic congestion; or 
(6)  The concentration of persons, animals and vehicles at the site of the event, or the assembly and disbanding areas around an event, will prevent proper police, fire, or ambulance services to areas contiguous to the event; or 
(7)  The size of the event will require diversion of so great a number of police officers of the city to insure that all participants stay within the boundaries or route of the event, or to protect participants in the event, as to prevent normal protection to the remainder of the city; or 
(8)  The parade, or other event moving along a route, will not move from its point of origin to its point of termination in three hours or less; or 
(9)  The location of the event will substantially interfere with any construction or maintenance work scheduled to take place upon or along the city streets, or along any public right-of-way, or where construction work is scheduled in connection with a previously granted encroachment permit; or 
(10)  The event shall occur at a time when school is in session at a route or location adjacent to the school or class thereof, or on a route or at a location adjacent to any hospital such that the noise created by the activities of the event would substantially disrupt the educational activities of the school or class thereof, or would cause a disturbance and be detrimental to the well-being of any patients at the hospital; or 
(11)  The event is a parade that is scheduled to begin after the hour of 8:00 p.m. 
(b)  Nothing herein authorizes denial of a permit because of the need to protect participants from the conduct of others, if reasonable permit conditions can be imposed to allow for adequate protection of event participants with the number of police officers available to police the event. 
(c)  When grounds for denial of an application for permit specified in subsection (a)(3) through (a)(11) above can be corrected by altering the date, time, duration, route, or location of the event, the special events coordinator shall, instead of denying the application, conditionally approve the application upon the applicants acceptance of conditions for permit issuance. The conditions imposed shall provide for only such modification of the applicants proposed event as are necessary to achieve compliance with subsections (a)(3) through (a)(11) above. Conditions are described in section 14-185 herein.

Sec. 26-463. - Transitional landscaped areas. 
    It is recognized that certain land uses, because of their character and intensity, may have an adverse impact on less intensive adjacent uses. The purpose of this section is to establish minimum landscaping requirements between certain uses that will help mitigate negative impacts that could constitute a nuisance due to noise and lights. Buffers shall be required in accordance with Table 1 when any use is being developed abutting an existing developed lot or vacant lot. Buffer requirements include a minimum distance separation from the property line and required planting of trees and shrubs within the buffer. Buffering between uses shall not be required within the C-4 Central Business District. 
    One hundred percent of the applicable buffer requirements shall be the responsibility of the developing land use, except when a residential or institutional use is developed abutting an existing more intensive use developed prior to the approval of this ordinance and for which no buffer is in place. In this case, the residential or institutional use shall be responsible for providing a minimum of 50 percent of the required buffer of the developing tract. 
    If an abutting parcel contains a required buffer or screen, it shall count towards the buffer requirements of the developing property, subject to the regulations in Table No. 1. If the land use relationships between two abutting lots change so that a lesser buffer would be required under these regulations, the width of the buffer may be reduced accordingly. The width of any required buffer of 15 feet or wider may be reduced by 25 percent if a wall, fence, or berm (with approval of site plan review committee) is provided that meets the following standards: 
(1)  Any fence or wall shall be a minimum of six feet and constructed in a durable fashion of brick, stone, other masonry materials, or any combination thereof as approved by the zoning administrator. A chain link fence with plastic, metal or wooden slats may not be used to satisfy the requirements of this section when abutting residential uses and districts. 
(2)  Berms shall be a minimum height of four feet with a maximum slope of 3:1. Berms in excess of six feet height shall have a maximum slope of 4:1 as measured from the exterior property line. Berms shall be stabilized to prevent erosion and landscaped.

_____
Sec. 26-463.1. - Alternative buffer and screening requirements. 
    In the event that the unusual topography or elevation of a development site, the size of the parcel to be developed, the soil or other sub-surface condition on the site, or the presence of required buffer or screening on adjacent developed property would make strict adherence to the requirements of Section 14 serve no meaningful purpose or would make it physically impossible to install and maintain the required buffer or screen, the zoning administrator may alter the requirements as long as the existing features of the development site comply with the spirit and intent. Such an alteration may occur only at the request of the property owner, who shall submit a plan to the zoning administrator showing existing site features that would buffer or screen the proposed use and any additional buffer materials the property owner will plant or construct to buffer or screen the proposed use. The zoning administrator shall not alter the requirements unless the developer demonstrates that existing site features and any additional buffer materials will screen the proposed use as effectively as the required buffer or screening. In deciding whether to approve such a plan, the zoning administrator shall consult with the director of planning and development and the staff landscape architect. 
(Ord. No. 2005-9(3), § 2, 1-18-05)

Any aggrieved person may submit a written appeal of an administrative decision or interpretation to the construction board of adjustment and appeals. Said board shall affirm, reverse or modify the administrative interpretation rendered by the zoning administrator, or designee, of the city. An interpretation from which an appeal is made must be in writing, and must be in response to a written request for an administrative decision or interpretation. It is expressly intended that such administrative decision or interpretation shall in no manner be construed to permit or grant exceptions or variances to the provisions of this article. Every decision of said board shall be final, subject, however, to such remedy as any aggrieved party may have at law or in equity. 
(Ord. of 1-3-95, § 15; Ord. No. 1996-17(3), § 15, 2-27-96) 
Sec. 26-465. - Variances. 
(a)  Required circumstances. Where there are unusual circumstances peculiar to the site being developed and where a literal application of specific provisions of this article would unnecessarily restrict the development of a site and result in hardship to the owners or other interested persons, a variance from specific provisions of this article may be requested. 
(b)  Application; contents; required demonstration. The application requesting a variance from the requirements of this article shall include a description of the property, the exact nature of the proposed variance, and the grounds upon which it is requested. The applicant shall further demonstrate that the granting of such variance will not adversely affect the properties nor otherwise be detrimental to the public welfare. 
(c)  Filing; recommendation of landscape architect to construction board of adjustment and appeals; consideration by board. The application shall be filed with the zoning administrator, or designee, for the city. Upon receiving an application for a variance, where all required information is supplied, the zoning administrator, or designee, shall make a recommendation within ten working days and forward the application to the construction board of adjustment and appeals for their consideration. Within ten working days after the board's receipt of a recommendation by the zoning administrator, or designee, the board shall meet to consider the request. 
(d)  Grant or denial. Within ten working days after the board's meeting, the board shall grant or deny the variance in whole or in part. If the board fails to take action on the request for the variance within the specified time period, such inaction shall be deemed to grant the variance. Every decision of the board shall be final, subject, however, to such remedy as any aggrieved party may have at law or in equity.

    Violation by any person of the provisions of this article or failure to comply with any of its requirements, after written notification by the zoning administrator, or designee, of the city of the type, nature, and extent of the violation of this article, shall upon conviction thereof, constitute a misdemeanor. 
    Any person who violates the provisions of this article or fails to comply with any of its requirements within days after having been duly notified in writing, by certified mail, return receipt requested, by the zoning administrator, or designee, of the city shall upon conviction thereof, be fined not more than $1,000.00. Each day such violation continues shall be considered a new and separate offense.

Editor's note- Ord. No. 2005-14(21), §§ I-VI, adopted March 22, 2005, amended art. VII, divisions 1-6, to read as herein set out. Formerly, art. VII pertained to similar subject matter as enacted by Ord. No. 2000-26(25), §§ I-VII, adopted July 11, 2000; as amended. 

DIVISION 1. - GENERALLY 

Sec. 30-251. - Purpose and findings. 
(a)  Purpose. That the purpose of this article is to establish reasonable and uniform regulations to minimize and control the negative secondary effects of sexually oriented businesses within the city in order to promote the health, safety, and welfare of the citizens of the city. The provisions of this article have neither the purpose nor the effect of imposing a limitation or restriction on the content of any communicative materials or communication, including sexually oriented entertainment. Similarly, it is not the purpose or effect of this article to restrict or deny access by adults to sexually oriented entertainment protected by the First Amendment, or to deny access by distributors and exhibitors of sexually oriented entertainment to their intended market. Furthermore, it is not the intent of effect of this article to condone or legitimize the distribution or exhibition of entertainment that is obscene. 
(b)  Findings. Based on evidence concerning the adverse secondary effects of sexually oriented businesses on the community presented in hearings before the city council; on findings incorporated in the cases of the MD II Entertainment, Inc. vs. City of Dallas, Texas 28 F. 3d 492 (5th Cir. 1994), City of Renton v. Playtime Theaters, Inc., 475 U.S. 41 (1986), Young v. American Mini Theaters, 426 U.S. 50 (1976) and Barnes v. Glen Theatre, Inc. 501 U.S. 560 (1991); and on studies in other cities and communities, this council finds: 
(1)  Sexually oriented businesses lend themselves to ancillary unlawful and unhealthy activities. 
(2)  Sexual acts, including masturbation and oral and anal sex, occur at sexually oriented businesses, especially those which provide private or semiprivate booths or rooms for viewing films, videos, or live sexually oriented entertainment. Such activities may result in spreading communicable diseases such as syphilis, gonorrhea, and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). 
(3)  Offering sexually oriented entertainment under conditions that encourage such activities creates unhealthy conditions. 
(4)  Sanitary conditions in some sexually oriented businesses are unhealthy, in part because of the failure of owners and operators to regulate those activities and maintain their facilities. 
(5)  Numerous studies and reports have determined that semen is found in the areas of sexually oriented businesses where persons view sexually oriented films. 
(6)  The findings noted in paragraphs number (1) through (5) raise substantial governmental concerns. 
(7)  Sexually oriented businesses have operational characteristics which should be reasonably regulated in order to protect those substantial governmental concerns. 
(8)  A reasonable licensing procedure is an appropriate mechanism to place the burden of that reasonable regulation on the owners and operators of sexually oriented businesses. Further, such a licensing procedure will place a heretofore nonexistent incentive on operators to see that sexually oriented businesses are run in a manner consistent with the health, safety and welfare of patrons and employees, as well as the citizens of the city. It is appropriate to require reasonable assurances that the licensee is the actual operator of the sexually oriented business, and fully in possession and control of the premises and activities occurring therein. 
(9)  Removal of doors on viewing booths in sexually oriented businesses and requiring sufficient lighting on premises with viewing booths will advance the substantial governmental interest in curbing the illegal and unsanitary sexual activity occurring in adult arcades and theaters and will facilitate enforcement of the provisions of this article and other federal, state and local laws, thereby furthering the substantial city's interest in protecting the public health, safety, and welfare. 
(10)  Requiring sufficient lighting in all sexually oriented businesses will advance the substantial governmental interest in curbing illegal sexual activity on the premises of sexually oriented businesses, and will facilitate enforcement of the provisions of this article and other federal, state and local laws, thereby furthering the substantial city's interest in protecting the public health, safety, and welfare. 
(11)  The disclosure of certain information by those persons ultimately responsible for the day-to-day operation and maintenance of sexually oriented businesses, and by employees of such businesses, will facilitate the enforcement of the provisions of this article and other federal, state and local laws, and will thereby further the substantial city's interest in protecting the public health, safety, and welfare. 
(12)  A person who recently has been convicted of a sexually related crime is not an appropriate individual to operate or be employed in a sexually oriented business. 
(13)  Barring such individuals from the management of and employment in sexually oriented businesses for a period of years serves as a deterrent to and prevents the commission of sexually related criminal acts, including conduct which leads to the transmission of sexually transmitted diseases.

(Ord. No. 1996-12(5), § 2(c), 11-28-95) 
Sec. 35-26. - Benefits. 
    The use of public ways via the installation of pipes, conduits, wires, antennas and tower structures for private, profit-oriented enterprise demands fair value for such use. Any person engaged in providing telecommunications service or systems via public ways shall pay a fee for such use and/or provide in-kind services in consideration for such use. 
(1)  Acquiring bandwidth on a broadband network allows the city to develop a wide range of telecommunications-based applications for internal use and for providing services to the community. To the maximum extent practical, the city will secure access to these advanced telecommunications systems for use by city government and members of the public. 
(2)  In addition to compensation for use of its public ways, the city should be compensated for street wear and tear, increased maintenance costs, and similar costs resulting from the installation of fiber optic and other telecommunications wires. 
(3)  The city will assess all fees for use of its public ways in a fair and equitable manner. 
(4)  It is the city's intent and obligation to achieve the maximum return from provider's occupation and use of public ways. Listed below are the forms of compensation which will be most preferred by the city.

Facilities 
Equipment and services 
City use capacity 
(5)  The city reserves the right to decline any provider's proposal for the use of city public ways if the city determines that such use of its public ways will not further the goals set forth in this policy. 
(Ord. No. 1996-12(5), § 2(d), 11-28-95) 
Sec. 35-27. - Consumer issues. 
    The city will attempt to facilitate access for all citizens to telecommunications resources, and will act as a catalyst to encourage, explore and develop public service applications. The city supports the fairest principles that govern the issues of privacy and security for consumers of advanced telecommunications service. 
(1)  The city encourages all providers to provide complete coverage within their service area. The city is particularly interested in the affordability and accessibility of service within the enterprise communities, and to small businesses and residential users.

Connectivity to business, government and schools, as well as residential areas 
Uniform and indiscriminate wiring for all locations in an industrial, business or residential area 
Affordable services, equipment and training 
Flexible service options and delivery mechanisms to reflect the needs of individual neighborhoods and communities 
Competitive choice in consumer service options 
Ability to send and receive information at rates of transmission that are adequate for broadband applications 
(2)  The city may require providers to adhere to certain industry standards for installation, equipment, and equipment utilization for telecommunications service. 
(3)  The city will require providers to give high quality service to its customers. Providers must demonstrate customer responsiveness, truth-in-billing, and demonstrate a commitment to the local community by maintaining a local customer service office within the city. 
(4)  All provider's facilities should be safe and secure. 
(Ord. No. 1996-12(5), § 2(e), 11-28-95) 
Sec. 35-28. - Procedures.

Construction standards 
Customer service standards 
Cost recovery for wear and tear on public ways 
City use of telecommunications resources (local PEG access, I-nets, etc.) 
Method of installation (pedestals, overhead, underground)

(2)  Agreements between the city and providers will be negotiated in consort with the telecommunications review committee on behalf of the city. Members of the telecommunications review committee will be appointed by the mayor. 
(3)  Any agreement between the city and a provider shall incorporate ordinances, rules, and regulations by reference. The rights granted to providers shall become effective upon execution of an agreement unless otherwise provided by state or federal law. Mandatory terms of agreements will be set forth in local ordinances. 
(4)  Rights granted to providers shall not exceed ten years, unless otherwise permitted by state or federal law.

ARTICLE I. - FLOOD DAMAGE PREVENTION 
DIVISION 1. - STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION, FINDINGS OF FACT, PURPOSE, AND OBJECTIVES 

Sec. 62-1. - Title. 
    This article shall be known as the "flood damage prevention ordinance." 
(Ord. No. 2014-14(32), § 1, 5-12-14) 
Sec. 62-2. - Statutory authorization. 
    The Legislature of the State of Mississippi has in MCA 1972, Tit. 17, Ch. 1, delegated the responsibility to local government units to adopt regulations designed to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare of its citizenry. Therefore, the Mayor and City Council of the City of Jackson does hereby adopt the following floodplain management regulations. 
(Ord. No. 2014-14(32), § 1, 5-12-14) 
Sec. 62-3. - Findings of fact. 
(a)  The City of Jackson is subject to periodic inundation, which results in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare. 
(b)  These flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions, both inside and outside the identified special flood hazard areas, causing increases in flood heights and velocities and by the occupancy in flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods or hazardous to other lands which are inadequately elevated, flood proofed, or otherwise unprotected from flood damages. 
(Ord. No. 2014-14(32), § 1, 5-12-14) 
Sec. 62-4. - Statement of purpose. 
    It is the purpose of this article to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to: 
(1)  Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety, and property due to water or erosion hazards, which result in damaging increases in erosion or in flood heights or velocities; 
(2)  Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction; 
(3)  Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural protective barriers which are involved in the accommodation of flood waters; 
(4)  Control filling, grading, dredging, and other development which may increase erosion or flood damage; and 
(5)  Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands. 
(Ord. No. 2014-14(32), § 1, 5-12-14) 
Sec. 62-5. - Objectives. 
    The objectives of this article are: 
(1)  To protect human life and health; 
(2)  To minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects; 
(3)  To minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public; 
(4)  To minimize prolonged business interruptions; 
(5)  To minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located in floodplains; 
(6)  To help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of floodprone areas in such a manner as to minimize flood blight areas, 
(7)  To ensure that potential homebuyers are notified that property is in a floodprone area. 
(Ord. No. 2014-14(32), § 1, 5-12-14) 
Sec. 62-6. - Methods of reducing flood losses. 
    In order to accomplish its purposes, this article includes methods and provisions for: 
(1)  Restricting or prohibiting uses which are dangerous to health, safety, and property due to water or erosion hazards, or which result in damaging increases in erosion or in flood heights or velocities; and 
(2)  Requiring that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction; and 
(3)  Controlling the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural protective barriers, which help accommodate or channel flood waters; and 
(4)  Controlling filling, grading, dredging, and other development which may increase flood damage; and 
(5)  Preventing or regulating the construction of flood barriers that will unnaturally divert floodwaters or may increase flood hazards in other areas.

DIVISION 2. - DEFINITIONS 

Sec. 62-7. - Definitions. 
    Unless specifically defined below, words or phrases used in this article shall be interpreted so as to give them the meaning they have in common usage and to give this article it's most reasonable application. 
    A zone means the area of special flood hazard without base flood elevations determined. 
    AE zone means the area of special flood hazard with base flood elevations determined. 
    Accessory structure (appurtenant structure) means a structure, which is located on the same parcel of property as the principal structure and the use of which is incidental to the use of the principal structure. Accessory structures should constitute a minimal initial investment, may not be used for human habitation, and be designed to have minimal flood damage potential. Examples of accessory structures are detached garages, carports, storage sheds, pole barns, and hay sheds. 
    Addition (to an existing building) means any walled and roofed expansion to the perimeter or height of a building. Any addition shall be considered new construction. If the addition is more than 50 percent of the market value of the structure, then the addition and the existing structure are now new construction. 
    Appeal means a request for a review of the floodplain administrator's interpretation of any provision of this article or a request for a variance. 
    AR/AE, AR/AH, AR/AO, and AR/A zones are SFHAs that result from the decertification of a previously accredited flood protection system or levee that is in the process of being restored to provide a one percent chance or greater level of flood protection. After restoration is complete, these areas will still experience residual flooding from other flooding sources. 
    A99 zone means that part of the SFHA inundated by the one percent chance flood to be protected from the one percent chance flood by a federal flood protection system or levee under construction; no base flood elevations are determined. 
    Area of shallow flooding means a designated AO or AH zone on the community's flood insurance rate map (FIRM) with flood depths from one to three feet where a clearly defined channel does not exist, where the path of flooding is unpredictable and indeterminate, and where velocity flow may be evident. Such flooding is characterized by ponding or sheet flow. 
    Area of special flood hazard means the land in the floodplain within a community subject to a one percent or greater chance of flooding in any given year. This area is also referred to as the special flood hazard area (SFHA). 
    Base flood means the flood having a one percent chance of being equaled or exceeded in any given year (also called the "one percent chance flood"). 
    Base flood elevation (BFE) means the elevation shown in the flood insurance study (FIS) for zones AE, AH, AR, AR/A, AR/AE, AR/AH, AR/AO, and VE that indicates the water surface elevation resulting from a flood that has a one percent or greater chance of being equaled or exceeded in any given year. 
    Basement means any portion of a building having its floor sub-grade (below ground level) on all sides. 
    Building. See "structure." 
    Community means a political entity and/or its authorized agents or representatives that have the authority to adopt and enforce floodplain ordinances for the area under its jurisdiction. 
    Community flood hazard area (CFHA) means an area that has been determined by the floodplain administrator (or other delegated, designated, or qualified community official) from available technical studies, historical information, and other available and reliable sources, which may be subject to periodic inundation by floodwaters that can adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare. This includes areas downstream from dams. 
    Community floodplain management map means any map produced by the community utilizing best available base flood elevation and floodway data that is from a federal, state, or other accepted technical source. 
    Community rating system (CRS) means a program developed by the Federal Insurance Administration to provide incentives for those communities in the regular program that have gone beyond the minimum floodplain management requirements to develop extra measures to provide protection from flooding. 
    Critical facility (also called critical action) means facilities for which the effects of even a slight chance of flooding would be too great. The minimum floodplain of concern for critical facilities is the 0.2 percent chance flood level. Critical facilities include, but are not limited to, facilities critical to the health and safety of the public such as: emergency operations centers, designated public shelters, schools, nursing homes, hospitals, police, fire and emergency response installations, vital data storage centers, power generation and water and other utilities (including related infrastructure such as principal points of utility systems) and installations which produce, use or store hazardous materials or hazardous waste (as defined under the Clean Water Act and other federal statutes and regulations). 
    D zone means an area in which the flood hazard is undetermined. 
    Dam means any artificial barrier, including appurtenant works, constructed to impound or divert water, wastewater, liquid borne materials, or solids that may flow if saturated. All structures necessary to maintain the water level in an impoundment or to divert a stream from its course will be considered a dam. 
    Development means any manmade change to improved or unimproved real estate, including, but not limited to, buildings or other structures, mining, dredging, filling, grading, paving, excavating, drilling operations, or storage of materials or equipment. 
    Dry floodproofing means any combination of structural and nonstructural additions, changes, or adjustments to structures, which reduce or eliminate flood damages to real estate or improved real estate property, water, and sanitary facilities, structures, and their contents. Structures shall be floodproofed with a minimum of 18 inches of freeboard (more is recommended) in relation to the base flood elevation. Dry floodproofing of a pre-FIRM residential structure that has not been substantially damaged or improved is allowed. Dry floodproofing of a post-FIRM residential building is not allowed. Nonresidential structures may be dry floodproofed in all flood zones with the exception of the coastal high hazard area or the coastal AE zone. 
    Elevated building means, for insurance purposes, a non-basement building which has its lowest elevated floor raised above ground level by foundation walls, shear walls, posts, pilings, columns, or piers. 
    Elevation certificate means a FEMA form used as a certified statement that verifies a building's elevation information. 
    Emergency program means the first phase under which a community participates in the NFIP. It is intended to provide a first layer amount of insurance coverage for all insurable buildings in that community before the effective date of the initial FIRM. 
    Enclosure below the lowest floor. See "lowest floor." 
    Encroachment means the advance or infringement of uses, plant growth, fill, excavation, buildings, structures or development into a floodplain, which may impede or alter the flow capacity of a floodplain.

    Executive Order 11990 (Wetlands Protection). This order requires the avoidance of adverse impacts associated with the destruction or modification of wetlands. 
    Existing construction means structures for which the start of construction commenced before the date of the FIRM or before January 1, 1975, for FIRMs effective before that date. Existing construction may also be referred to as existing structures. 
    Existing manufactured home park or subdivision means a manufactured home park or subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including at a minimum the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is completed before the effective date of the floodplain management regulations adopted by a community. 
    Expansion to an existing manufactured home park or subdivision includes the preparation of additional sites by the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads). 
    Fill means a deposit of earthen materials placed by artificial means. 
    Five hundred-year flood means the flood that has a 0.2 percent chance of being equaled or exceeded in any year. Areas subject to the 0.2 percent chance flood have a moderate risk of flooding. 
    Flood or flooding means a general and temporary condition of partial or complete inundation of normally dry land areas from: 
(1)  The overflow of inland or tidal waters. 
(2)  The unusual and rapid accumulation or runoff of surface waters from any source. 
(3)  Mudslides which are proximately caused by flooding and are akin to a river of liquid and flowing mud on the surfaces of normally dry land areas, as when earth is carried by a current of water and deposited along the path of the current. 
(4)  The collapse or subsidence of land along the shore of a lake or other body of water as a result of erosion or undermining caused by waves or currents of water exceeding anticipated cyclical levels or suddenly caused by an unusually high water level in a natural body of water, accompanied by a severe storm, or by an unanticipated force of nature, such as flash flood or an abnormal tidal surge, or by some similarly unusual and unforeseeable event which results in flooding. 
    Flood (insurance definition) means a general and temporary condition of partial or complete inundation of two or more acres of normally dry land areas or of two or more properties (e.g., a building and a public street) from: (1) overflow of inland or tidal waters, (2) unusual and rapid accumulation or runoff of surface waters, (3) mudflows caused by flooding. 
    Flood insurance rate map (FIRM) means an official map of a community, on which FEMA has delineated both the areas of special flood hazard and the risk premium zones applicable to the community. 
    Flood insurance study (FIS) means the document which provides an examination, evaluation, and determination of flood hazards and, if appropriate, corresponding water surface elevations, or an examination, evaluation, and determination of mudslide and/or flood-related erosion hazards. 
    Flood protection elevation means the base flood elevation plus the community freeboard. In areas where no base flood elevations exist from any authoritative source, the flood protection elevation can be historical flood elevations or base flood elevations determined and/or approved by the floodplain administrator plus freeboard. 
    Floodplain means any land area susceptible to being inundated by flood waters from any source. 
    Floodplain administrator means the individual appointed to administer and enforce the floodplain management regulations. 
    Floodplain management means the operation of an overall program of corrective and preventive measures for reducing flood damage and preserving and enhancing, where possible, natural resources in the floodplain, including but not limited to emergency preparedness plans, flood control works, floodplain management regulations, and open space plans. 
    Floodplain management regulations means this article and other zoning ordinances, subdivision regulations, building codes, health regulations, special purpose ordinances, and other applications of police power which control development in floodprone areas. This term describes federal, state, or local regulations in any combination thereof, which provide standards for preventing and reducing flood loss and damage. 
    Floodproofing certificate means an official FEMA form used to certify compliance for nonresidential structures in non-coastal high hazard areas as an alternative to elevating buildings to or above the base flood elevation. 
    Floodway. See "regulatory floodway." 
    Floodway fringe means that area of the special flood hazard area on either side of the regulatory floodway. 
    Freeboard means a factor of safety, usually expressed in feet above the BFE, which is applied for the purposes of floodplain management. Communities are encouraged to adopt at least an 18-inch freeboard to account for the one-foot rise built into the concept of designating a floodway, where floodways have not been designated. 
    Functionally dependent use means a use which cannot perform its intended purpose unless it is located or carried out in close proximity to water. The term includes only docking facilities, port facilities that are necessary for the loading and unloading of cargo or passengers, ship building and ship repair facilities and seafood offloading facilities. The term does not include long-term storage, manufacture, processing functions, sales, administrative functions, or service facilities. 
    Hardship (as related to variances of this article) means the exceptional difficulty that would result from a failure to grant the requested variance. The mayor and city council require that the variance is exceptional, unusual, and peculiar to the property involved. Mere economic or financial hardship alone is not exceptional. Inconvenience, aesthetic considerations, physical handicaps, personal preferences, or the disapproval of one's neighbors likewise cannot, as a rule, qualify as an exceptional hardship. All of these problems can be resolved through other means without granting a variance, even if the alternative is more expensive, or requires the property owner to build elsewhere or put the parcel to a different use than originally intended. 
    Hazard potential means the possible adverse incremental consequences that result from the release of water or stored contents due to failure of a dam or mis-operation of a dam or appurtenances. The hazard potential classification of a dam does not reflect in any way on the current condition of a dam and its appurtenant structures (e.g., safety, structural integrity, and flood routing capacity). 
    High hazard dam means a class of dam in which failure may cause loss of life, serious damage to residential, industrial, or commercial buildings; or damage to, or disruption of, important public utilities or transportation facilities such as major highways or railroads. Dams which meet the statutory thresholds for regulation that are proposed for construction in established or proposed residential, commercial, or industrial areas will be assigned this classification, unless the applicant provides convincing evidence to the contrary. A development permit is required for a structure and any associated fill downstream from a dam at any location where flooding can be reasonably anticipated from principal or emergency spillway discharges, or from overtopping and failure of the dam. 
    Highest adjacent grade means the highest natural elevation of the ground surface, prior to construction, next to the proposed walls of a building. 
    Historic structure means any structure that is: 
(1)  Listed individually in the National Register of Historic Places (a listing maintained by the Department of the Interior) or preliminarily determined by the Secretary of the Interior as meeting the requirements for individual listing on the National Register; 
(2)  Certified or preliminarily determined by the Secretary of the Interior as contributing to the historical significance of a registered historic or a district preliminarily determined by the Secretary to qualify as a registered historic district; 
(3)  Individually listed on the State of Mississippi inventory of historic structures; or 
(4)  Individually listed on a local inventory historic places in communities with historic preservation programs that have been certified by an approved state program as determined by the Secretary of the Interior. 
    Hydrologic and hydraulic engineering analyses means the analyses performed by a professional engineer, registered in the State of Mississippi, in accordance with standard engineering practices as accepted by FEMA, used to determine flood elevations and/or floodway boundaries. 
    Increased cost of compliance (ICC) coverage means under the standard flood insurance policy the cost to repair a substantially flood damaged building that exceeds the minimal repair cost and that is required to bring a substantially damaged building into compliance with the local flood damage prevention ordinance. Acceptable mitigation measures are floodproofing (nonresidential), relocation, elevation, demolition, or any combination thereof. All renewal and new policies with effective dates on or after June 1, 1997, include ICC coverage. 
    Letter of map change (LOMC) means an official FEMA determination, by letter, to amend or revise effective flood insurance rate maps, flood boundary and floodway maps, and flood insurance studies. LOMCs are broken down into the following categories: 
    Letter of map amendment (LOMA). An amendment based on technical data showing that a property was incorrectly included in a designated SFHA, was not elevated by fill (only by a natural grade elevation), and will not be inundated by the one percent chance flood. A LOMA amends the current effective FIRM and establishes that a specific property is not located in a SFHA. 
    Letter of map revision (LOMR). A revision based on technical data that, usually due to manmade changes, shows changes to flood zones, flood elevations, floodplain and floodway delineations, and planimetric features. One common type of LOMR, a LOMR-F, is a determination concerning whether a structure or parcel has been elevated by fill above the BFE and is, therefore, excluded from the SFHA. 
    Conditional letter of map revision (CLOMR). A formal review and comment by FEMA as to whether a proposed project complies with the minimum NFIP floodplain management criteria. A CLOMR does not revise effective flood insurance rate maps, flood boundary and floodway maps, or flood insurance studies. 
    Levee means a manmade structure; usually an earthen embankment designed and constructed in accordance with sound engineering practices to contain, control, or divert the flow of water so as to provide protection from temporary flooding. 
    Levee system means a flood protection system which consists of a levee, or levees, and associated structures, such as closure and drainage devices, which are constructed and operated in accordance with sound engineering practices. For a levee system to be recognized, the following criteria must be met. All closure devices or mechanical systems for internal drainage, whether manual or automatic, must be operated in accordance with an officially adopted operation manual (a copy of which must be provided to FEMA by the operator when levee or drainage system recognition is being sought or revised). All operations must be under the jurisdiction of a federal or state agency, an agency created by federal or state law, or an agency of a community participating in the NFIP. 
    Limit of moderate wave action (LiMWA) means the limit of the AE zone category area exposed to wave attack from waves greater than 1.5 feet during the base (one percent chance) flood on open coastal and inland areas exposed to erosion and wave propagation. 
    Low hazard dam means a class of dam in which failure would at the most result in damage to agricultural land, farm buildings (excluding residences), or minor roads. 
    Lowest adjacent grade means the elevation of the sidewalk, patio, deck support, or basement entryway immediately next to the structure and after the completion of construction. It does not include earth that is placed for aesthetic or landscape reasons around a foundation wall. It does include natural ground or properly compacted fill that comprises a component of a building's foundation system. 
    Lowest floor means the lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area (including basement). An unfinished or flood-resistant enclosure, used solely for parking of vehicles, building access, or storage, in an area other than a basement, is not considered a building's lowest floor, provided that such enclosure is not built so as to render the structure in violation of the non-elevation provisions of this Code. 
    Manufactured home (44 CFR 59.1 definition/FEMA) means a structure, transportable in one or more sections, which is built on a permanent chassis and designed to be used with or without a permanent foundation when attached to the required utilities. The term manufactured home does not include a "recreational vehicle." 
    Manufactured home park or subdivision means a parcel (or contiguous parcels) of land divided into two or more manufactured home lots for rent or sale. 
    Manufactured housing (24 CFR 3280.3 and 3285.5 definitions/HUD) means "...a structure, transportable in one or more sections, which in the traveling mode is 8 body feet or more in width or 40 body feet in length or which when erected on-site is 320 or more square feet, and which is built on a permanent chassis and designed to be used as a dwelling with or without a permanent foundation when connected to the required utilities." 
    Map amendment means a change to an effective NFIP map that results in the exclusion from the SFHA or an individual structure or a legally described parcel of land that has been inadvertently included in the SFHA (i.e., no alterations of topography have occurred since the date of the first NFIP map that showed the structure or parcel to be within the SFHA). 
    Map panel number means the four-digit number followed by a letter suffix assigned by FEMA on a FIRM. The first four digits represent the map panel, and the letter suffix represents the number of times the map panel has been revised. 
    Market value means the property value (as agreed between a willing buyer and seller), excluding the value of land as established by what the local real estate market will bear. Market value can be established by independent certified appraisal; replacement cost depreciated by age of building (actual cash value); or adjusted assessed values. 
    Mean sea level means, for the purposes of the National Flood Insurance Program, the National Geodetic Vertical Datum (NGVD) of 1929, North American Vertical Datum (NAVD) of 1988, or other datum, to which base flood elevations shown on a community's flood insurance rate map (FIRM) are referenced. 
    Mixed-use structure means a single structure containing both residential and nonresidential uses (e.g., a small business and an apartment). For the purpose of this article, a mixed-use structure shall comply with the standards set forth for residential structures. 
    National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) means the federal program that makes flood insurance available to owners of property in participating communities nationwide through the cooperative efforts of the federal government and the private insurance industry. 
    National Geodetic Vertical Datum (NGVD) means a vertical control, corrected in 1929, used as a reference for establishing varying elevations within the floodplain. 
    New construction means a structure or an addition to an existing structure for which the start of construction commenced on or after the effective date of a floodplain management regulation adopted by a community and any subsequent improvements to such structure or the addition. 
    New manufactured home park or subdivision means a manufactured home park or subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including, at a minimum, the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is completed on or after the effective date of floodplain regulations adopted by a community. 
    Nonresidential means, but is not limited to, small business concerns, churches, schools, farm buildings (including grain bins and silos), poolhouses, clubhouses, recreational buildings, mercantile structures, agricultural and industrial structures, warehouses, and hotels and motels with normal room rentals for less than six months' duration. 
    North American Vertical Datum (NAVD) of 1988 means a vertical control, corrected in 1988, used as a reference for establishing varying elevations within the floodplain. 
    Obstruction means, but is not limited to, any dam, wall, wharf, embankment, levee, dike, pile, abutment, protection, excavation, channel construction, bridge, culvert, building, wire, fence, rock, gravel, refuse, fill, structure, vegetation or other material in, along, across or projecting into any watercourse which may alter, impede, retard or change the direction and/or velocity of the flow of water, or due to its location, its propensity to snare or collect debris carried by the flow of water, or its likelihood of being carried downstream. 
    One percent flood (a.k.a. 100-year flood) means the flood that has a one percent chance of being equaled or exceeded in any given year. Any flood zone that begins with the letter A or V is subject to inundation by the one percent chance flood. Over the life of a 30-year loan, there is a 26 percent chance of experiencing such a flood within the SFHA. 
    Participating community means any community that voluntarily elects to participate in the NFIP by adopting and enforcing floodplain management regulations that are consistent with the standards of the NFIP. 
    Post-FIRM construction means new construction and substantial improvements for which start of construction occurred after December 31, 1974, or on or after the effective date of the initial FIRM of the community, whichever is later. 
    Pre-FIRM construction means new construction and substantial improvements for which start of construction occurred on or before December 31, 1974, or before the effective date of the initial FIRM of the community, whichever is later. 
    Probation is a means of FEMA formally notifying participating communities of the first of the two NFIP sanctions due to their failure to correct violations and deficiencies in the administration and enforcement of the local floodplain management regulations. 
    Public safety and nuisance means anything which is injurious to the safety or health of an entire community or neighborhood, or any considerable number of persons, or unlawfully obstructs the free passage or use, in the customary manner, of any navigable lake, or river, bay, stream, canal, or basin. 
    Recreational vehicle means a vehicle that is: 
(1)  Licensed and titled as an RV or park model (not a permanent residence); 
(2)  Built on a single chassis; 
(3)  Four hundred square feet or less when measured at the largest horizontal projection; 
(4)  Has no attached deck, porch, or shed;

(6)  Designed to be self-propelled or permanently towable by a light duty truck; and 
(7)  Designed primarily not for use as a permanent dwelling but as temporary living quarters for recreational, camping, travel, or seasonal use. 
    Regular program means the second phase of the community's participation in the NFIP in which second layer coverage is available based upon risk premium rates only after FEMA has competed a risk study for the community. 
    Regulatory floodway means the channel of a river or other watercourse and the adjacent land areas that must be reserved in order to discharge the base flood without cumulatively increasing the water surface elevation more than one foot. 
    Repair means the reconstruction or renewal of any part of an existing building for which the start of construction commenced on or after the effective date of a floodplain management regulation adopted by a community and all such regulations effective at the time of permitting must be met. 
    Repetitive loss means flood-related damages sustained by a structure on two separate occasions during a ten-year period for which the cost of repairs at the time of each such flood event, on the average, equals or exceeds 25 percent of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred. 
    Repetitive loss property means any insurable building for which two or more claims of more than $1,000.00 were paid by the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) within any rolling ten-year period, since 1978. At least two of the claims must be more than ten days apart but, within ten years of each other. A RL property may or may not be currently insured by the NFIP. 
    Section 1316 means that section of the National Flood Insurance Act of 1968, as amended, which states that no new flood insurance coverage shall be provided for any property that FEMA finds has been declared by a duly constituted state or local zoning authority or other authorized public body to be in violation of state or local laws, regulations, or ordinances that are intended to discourage or otherwise restrict land development or occupancy in floodprone areas. 
    Severe repetitive loss structure means any insured property that has met at least one of the following paid flood loss criteria since 1978, regardless of ownership: 
(1)  Four or more separate claim payments of more than $5,000.00 each (including building and contents payments); or 
(2)  Two or more separate claim payments (building payments only) where the total of the payments exceeds the current market value of the property. 
In either case, two of the claim payments must have occurred within ten years of each other. Multiple losses at the same location within ten days of each other are counted as one loss, with the payment amounts added together. 
    Significant hazard dam means a dam assigned the significant hazard potential classification where failure may cause damage to main roads, minor railroads, or cause interruption of use, or service of relatively important public utilities. 
    Special flood hazard area (SFHA) means that portion of the floodplain subject to inundation by the base flood and/or flood-related erosion hazards as shown on a FHBM or FIRM as zones A, AE, AH, AO, AR, AR/AE, AR/AO, AR/AH, AR/A, A99, or VE. 
    Start of construction (for other than new construction or substantial improvements under the Coastal Barrier Resources Act P.L. 97-348) includes substantial improvement, and means the date the building permit was issued, provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction, or improvement was within 180 days of the permit date. The actual start means the first placement of permanent construction of a building (including a manufactured home) on a site, such as the pouring of slabs or footings, installation of piles, construction of columns, or any work beyond the stage of excavation or placement of a manufactured home on a foundation. Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as clearing, grading and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings, piers or foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main building. For substantial improvement, the actual start of construction means the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building. 
    Structure (for floodplain management purposes) means a walled and roofed building, including a gas or liquid storage tank that is principally above ground, as well as a manufactured home. 
    Structure (for insurance purposes) means a building with two or more outside rigid walls and a fully secured roof, that is affixed to a permanent site; a manufactured home built on a permanent chassis, transported to it site in one or more sections, and affixed to a permanent foundation; or a travel trailer without wheels, built on a chassis and affixed to a permanent foundation, that is regulated under the community's floodplain management and building ordinances or laws.

    Subrogation means an action brought by FEMA when flood damages have occurred, a flood insurance claim has been paid, and all or part of the damage can be attributed to acts or omissions by a community or other third party. 
    Substantial damage means damage of any origin sustained by a structure whereby the cost of restoring the structure to its before damaged condition would equal or exceed 50 percent of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred. Substantial damage also means flood-related damages sustained by a structure on two separate occasions during a ten-year period for which the cost of repairs at the time of each flood event, on the average, equals or exceeds 25 percent of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred. 
    Substantial improvement means any combination of reconstruction, rehabilitation, or other improvement of a structure taking place over a designated ten-year period in which the cumulative percentage of improvement equals or exceeds 50 percent of the current market value of the structure before the "start of construction" of the improvement. The designated ten-year period begins at the date of the initial improvement to the structure. The costs for determining substantial improvement include the costs of additions. This term includes structures which have incurred repetitive loss or substantial damage, regardless of the actual repair work performed. 
The term does not apply to: 
(1)  Any project for improvement of a building required to comply with existing health, sanitary, or safety code specifications which have been identified by the code enforcement official and which are solely necessary to assure safe living conditions, provided that said code deficiencies were not caused by neglect or lack of maintenance on the part of the current or previous owners or; 
(2)  Any alteration of a "historic structure" provided that the alteration will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a "historic structure." 
    Substantially improved existing manufactured home parks or subdivisions means manufactured home parks or subdivisions where the repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation or improvement of the streets, utilities and pads equals or exceeds 50 percent of the value of the streets, utilities and pads before the repair, reconstruction or improvement commenced. 
    Suspension means the removal, with or without probation, of a participating community from the NFIP because the community failed to adopt and enforce the compliant floodplain management regulations required for participation in the NFIP. 
    Variance means a grant of relief from the requirements of this article. 
    Violation means the failure of a structure or other development to be fully compliant with this article. A structure or other development without the elevation certificate, other certifications, or other evidence of compliance required in this article is presumed to be in violation until such time as that documentation is provided. 
    Watercourse means any flowing body of water, including a river, creek, stream, or a branch. 
    Water surface elevation means the height, in relation to the National Geodetic Vertical Datum (NGVD) of 1929, the North American Vertical Datum (NAVD) of 1988, (or other datum, where specified) of floods of various magnitudes and frequencies in the floodplains of coastal or riverine areas. 
    Wet floodproofing means a method of construction which allows water to enter a structure in such a way that will minimize damage to the structure and its contents. Wet floodproofing is appropriate for functionally dependent use and uses that facilitate open space use by variance only, structures utilized for parking or limited storage, or when all other techniques are not technically feasible. Wet floodproofing shall not be utilized as a method to satisfy the requirements of this article for bringing substantially damaged or improved structures into compliance. Wet floodproofing is not allowed in lieu of complying with the lowest floor elevation requirements for new residential buildings. 
    X zones (shaded) are areas of 0.2 percent chance flood that are outside of the SFHA subject to the one percent chance flood with average depths of less than one foot, or with contributing drainage area less than one square mile, and areas protected by certified levees from the base flood.

Dry floodproofing is allowed only where flood velocities are less than or equal to five feet per second. A registered professional engineer or architect shall certify that the standards of this subsection are satisfied. A flood emergency operation plan and an inspection and maintenance plan must be provided by the design professional for the building. Such certification shall be provided to the floodplain administrator. New development proposals will be designed, to the maximum extent practicable, so nonresidential building sites, walkways, driveways, and roadways are located at natural grade with elevation not less than the base flood elevation and with evacuation routes leading directly out of the special flood hazard area. 
(3)  In special flood hazard areas with base flood elevations (AE zones) but without floodways, no encroachments, including fill material or structures, shall be permitted unless certification by a registered professional engineer is provided demonstrating that the cumulative effect of the proposed development, when combined with all other existing and anticipated development, will not increase the water surface elevation of the base flood more than one foot at any point within the community. The engineering certification must be supported by technical data that conforms to standard hydraulic engineering principles. 
(4)  Enclosures. New construction and substantial improvements that include fully enclosed areas formed by foundation and other exterior walls below the lowest floor shall be designed to preclude finished living space and designed to allow for the entry and exit of floodwaters to automatically equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls. Total enclosed areas will be limited 299 square feet. Enclosed areas, including crawl spaces, shall be used solely for parking of vehicles, building access, and storage. 
a.  Designs for complying with this requirement must either be certified by a professional engineer or architect or meet or exceed the following criteria:

2.  The total net area of all openings shall be at least one square inch for each square foot of enclosed area, or the openings shall be designed and the construction documents shall include a statement that the design and installation will provide for equalization of hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls by allowing for the automatic entry and exit of floodwaters; 
3.  The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one foot above interior grade (which must be equal to in elevation or higher than the exterior grade); 
4.  Openings shall allow the passage of a three-inch sphere; and 
5.  Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves or other coverings or devices provided they permit the automatic flow of floodwaters in both directions and automatically equalize hydrostatic flood loads on exterior walls. 
b.  Access to the enclosed area shall be minimum necessary to allow for parking of vehicles (garage door) or limited storage of maintenance equipment used in connection with the premises (standard exterior door) or entry to the living area (stairway or elevator). 
c.  The interior portion of such enclosed area shall not be finished or partitioned into separate rooms. 
d.  Property owners shall be required to execute a flood openings/venting affidavit acknowledging that all openings will be maintained as flood vents, and that the elimination or alteration of the openings in any way will violate the requirements of this section. Periodic inspections will be conducted by the floodplain administrator to ensure compliance. 
(5)  Detached storage buildings, sheds, or other like accessory improvements, excluding detached garages, carports, and boat houses, shall solely be used for parking of vehicles and storage. Such storage space shall not be used for human habitation and shall be limited to storage of items that can withstand exposure to the elements and have low flood damage potential. The storage space shall be constructed of flood-resistant or breakaway materials, and equipment and service utilities, such as electrical outlets, shall be limited to essential lighting and other incidental uses, and must be elevated or floodproofed. Flood openings in accordance with the standards of subsection (4) of this section shall also be required. These accessory structures shall be constructed and placed on the building site so as to offer the minimum resistance to the flow of floodwaters. Accessory improvements and other appurtenant structures shall be firmly anchored to prevent flotation that may result in damage to other structures. 
(6)  Property owners shall be required to execute and record with the structure's deed a nonconversion agreement declaring that the area below the lowest floor of the structure or the detached accessory building shall not be improved, finished or otherwise converted; the community will have the right to inspect the enclosed area.

a.  All manufactured homes placed, or substantially improved, on individual lots or parcels, in existing manufactured home parks or subdivisions, in expansions to existing manufactured home parks or subdivisions, in new manufactured home parks or subdivisions or in substantially improved manufactured home parks or subdivisions, must meet all the requirements for new construction, including elevation and anchoring and the flood openings requirements of subsection 62-42 (4). 
Manufactured homes must be: 
1.  Elevated on a permanent foundation to have its lowest floor elevated to no lower than 18 inches above the base flood elevation, and; 
2.  Securely anchored to an adequately anchored foundation system to resist flotation, collapse, and lateral movement. 
b.  All manufactured homes placed or substantially improved, excepting manufactured homes that have incurred substantial damage as a result of a flood, in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision must be elevated so that: 
1.  The lowest floor of the manufactured home is elevated to no lower than 18 inches above the base flood elevation and be securely anchored to an adequately anchored foundation support system to resist floatation, collapse, and lateral movement, or 
2.  The manufactured home chassis is supported by reinforced piers or other foundation elements of at least an equivalent strength, of no less than 36 inches in height above the highest adjacent grade and adequately anchored foundation support system to resist floatation, collapse, and lateral movement. 
c.  All recreational vehicles placed on sites must either: 
1.  Be on site for fewer than 180 consecutive days and obtain a new permit before returning to the same site, 
2.  Be fully licensed and ready for highway use, or 
3.  Must meet all the requirements for new construction, including anchoring and elevation requirements of this subsection 62-42(7)a. or 62-42(7)b.1. above. 
A recreational vehicle is ready for highway use if it is licensed and insured in accordance with the state of Mississippi motor vehicle regulations, is on its wheels or jacking system, is attached to the site only by quick disconnect type utilities and security devices and has no permanently attached additions. 
(8)  Floodways. Located within areas of special flood hazard adopted by reference in section 62-12, are areas designated as floodways. Since the floodway is an extremely hazardous area due to the velocity of flood waters which carry debris, potential projectiles and has erosion potential, the following provisions shall apply: 
a.  Prohibit encroachments, including fill, new construction, substantial improvements, and other developments unless certification (with supporting technical data) by a registered professional engineer is provided demonstrating that encroachments shall not result in any increase in flood levels during occurrence of the base flood discharge. 
b.  If subsection (8)a. above is satisfied, all new construction and substantial improvements shall comply with all applicable flood damage prevention standards of division 5. 
c.  Prohibit the placement of manufactured homes (mobile homes), except in an existing manufactured homes (mobile homes) park or subdivision. A replacement manufactured home may be placed on a lot in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision provided the anchoring standards of section 62-41(2), and the standards of subsections (1) through (3) of this section and the encroachment standards of this subsection (8)a., are met.

These plans shall be designed to limit adverse impacts to downstream channels and floodplains. Single residential lots involving less than one acre of land disturbance are not subject to this regulation. 
(f)  All preliminary plans for platted subdivisions shall identify the flood hazard area and the elevation of the base flood. 
(g)  All final subdivision plats will provide the boundary of the special flood hazard area, the floodway boundary, and the base flood elevations. 
(h)  In platted subdivisions, all proposed lots or parcels that will be future building sites shall have a minimum buildable area outside the natural (non-filled) one percent chance annual floodplain. The buildable area shall be large enough to accommodate any primary structure and associated structures such as sheds, barns, swimming pools, detached garages, on-site sewage disposal systems, and water supply wells, where applicable. 
(i)  Approval shall not be given for streets within a subdivision which would be subject to flooding in the base flood. All street surfaces must be located at or above the base flood elevation. Such streets shall be constructed in such manner that the street shall not be considered a dam or a levee or function as such unless properly designed by a registered professional engineer and certified by the United States Army Corps of Engineers as a dam or levee. 
(j)  Where only a small portion of the subdivision lot or lots is in an A zone special flood hazard area inundated by one percent chance flood with no base flood elevations determined and there is sufficient ground slope on the site to avoid possible flooding of structures in X zones (unshaded) determined to be outside 0.2 chance flood floodplain. The floodplain administrator may waive the requirement for a study to determine the base flood elevations. 
(k)  In order for the floodplain administrator to consider waiving the requirement of subsection (d) of this section, the applicant must provide an accurate topographic data and map for the lot or lots in question (certified by a licensed land surveyor and/or professional civil engineer) indicating that each lot in a new subdivision is on natural high ground, out of the regulatory floodplain. 
(l)  Each proposed parcel must have a designated buildable pad or site above the one percent chance floodplain. The distance of the buildable pad or site above the one percent chance floodplain shall depend on the slope of the ground and in accordance with the following table: 
Distance in feet 
from A zone 
[one percent chance floodplain] Minimum Slope 
from A zone-one percent floodplain to ground level at pad 20 5% 30 3.33% 40 2.50% 50 2.0% 60 1.67% 70 1.43% 80 1.25% 90 1.11% 100 1.0%  
Residential and nonresidential structures lowest floor elevation also must be elevated 1.5 feet above the ground level on the buildable pad or site. 
(m)  The subdivider/applicant must comply with the following: 
(1)  File restrictive covenants on the lot or lots prohibiting construction within the designated special flood hazard area and requirement for lowest floor elevation. 
(2)  Place a statement on the face of the final plat prohibiting construction in the designated area of special flood hazard. 
(Ord. No. 2014-14(32), § 1, 5-12-14) 
Sec. 62-46. - Critical facilities. 
    Construction of new and substantially improved critical facilities shall be located outside the limits of the special flood hazard area (one percent chance floodplain). Floodproofing and sealing measures must be implemented to ensure that toxic substances will not be displaced by or released into floodwaters. Multiple access routes, elevated to or above the 0.2 percent flood elevation, shall be provided to all critical facilities to the maximum extent possible. Critical facilities must not only be protected to or above the 0.2 percent chance flood, but must remain operable during such an event. The community's flood response plan must list facilities considered critical in a flood, since loss of access can cause a critical situation. Other facilities in low risk flood zones that may also be needed to support flood response efforts must be included on the critical facility list. The use of any structure shall not be changed to a critical facility, where such a change in use will render the new critical facility out of conformance with this section. The list of the operators of the critical facilities affected by flooding must be updated at least annually, as part of the community critical facility planning procedures.

(Ord. No. 2014-14(32), § 1, 5-12-14) 
Sec. 62-63. - Variance procedures. 
    In passing upon such applications, the floodplain management board shall consider all technical evaluations, relevant factors, and standards specified in other sections of this chapter, and: 
(1)  The evaluation must be based on the characteristics unique to that property and not be shared by adjacent parcels. The characteristics must pertain to the land itself, not to the structure, its inhabitants, or its owners; 
(2)  Variances should never be granted for multiple lots, phases of subdivisions, or entire subdivisions; 
(3)  The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the injury of others; 
(4)  The danger of life and property due to flooding or erosion damage; 
(5)  The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner and the community; 
(6)  The importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to the community; 
(7)  The necessity of the facility to be at a waterfront location, where applicable; 
(8)  The availability of alternative locations for the proposed use which are not subject to flooding or erosion damage; 
(9)  The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated development; 
(10)  The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan and floodplain management program for that area; 
(11)  The safety of access to the property in times of flood for ordinary and emergency vehicles; 
(12)  The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise, and sediment transport of the floodwaters and the effects of wave action, if applicable, expected at the site, and; 
(13)  The costs of providing governmental services during and after flood conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water systems, and streets and bridges and culverts. 
(14)  Upon consideration of factors listed above, and the purpose of this chapter, the floodplain management board may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes of this chapter. 
(15)  Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result. 
(Ord. No. 2014-14(32), § 7, 5-12-14; Ord. No. 2017-11(1), § 7, 4-18-17)

(a)  Variances shall only be issued when there is: 
(1)  A showing of good and sufficient cause; 
(2)  A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship, and; 
(3)  A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public expense, create nuisance, cause fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances. 
(b)  The provisions of this chapter are minimum standards for flood loss reduction; therefore any deviation from the standards must be weighed carefully. Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary deviation from the requirements of this chapter, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief. In the instance of a historic structure, a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary so as not to destroy the historic character and design of the building. (See section 62-66.) 
(c)  Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice specifying the difference between the base flood elevation and the elevation to which the lowest floor is to be built and stating that the cost of flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the reduced lowest floor elevation. 
(d)  The floodplain administrator shall maintain the records of all appeal actions and report any variances to the Federal Emergency Management Agency and Mississippi Emergency Management Agency upon request. (See Section 62-65.) 
(e)  Upon consideration of the factors listed above and the purposes of this chapter, the floodplain management board may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes of this chapter. 
(f)  Variances shall not be issued "after the fact."

Sec. 62-65. - Variance notification. 
    Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice over the signature of a community official that: 
(1)  The issuance of a variance to construct a structure below the base flood elevation will result in increased premium rates for flood insurance up to amounts as high as $25.00 for $100.00 of insurance coverage; and 
(2)  Such construction below the base flood level increases risks to life and property. A copy of the notice shall be recorded by the floodplain administrator in the Office of the Hinds County Chancery Clerk, First Judicial District, and shall be recorded in a manner so that it appears in the chain of title of the affected parcel of land. 
    The floodplain administrator will maintain a record of all variance actions, including justification for their issuance, and report such variances issued in the community's biennial report submission to the Federal Emergency Management Agency.

Sec. 66-44. - Cleaning private property; civil debt; lien. 
(a)  Notice; hearing; abatement; lien. The city, acting through the planning and development department, is hereby authorized and empowered, on its own motion, or upon the receipt of a petition requesting the city council to so act, signed by a majority of the residents residing upon any street or alley within 400 feet of any property or parcel of land alleged to be in need of cleaning, to give notice to the property owner by U.S. registered mail or certified mail two weeks before the date of a hearing, or by service of notice as provided in this section by a police officer, or by service of notice as provided in this section by a police officer at least two weeks before the date of a hearing, or if the property owner is unknown or his address is unknown, then by two weeks' notice in a newspaper having a general circulation in the municipality, of a hearing to determine whether or not any property or parcel of land is in such a state of uncleanliness as to be a menace to the public health and safety of the community. If at such hearing, the city council shall, in its resolution, adjudicate such a property or parcel of land in its then condition to be a menace to the public health and safety of the community, the city, acting through the planning and development department shall, if the owner does not do so himself, proceed to clean the land, by the use of municipal employees or by contract, by cutting weeds, filling cisterns, removing rubbish, dilapidated fences, outside toilets, dilapidated buildings and other debris, and draining cesspools and standing water therefrom. Thereafter, the city council may, at its next regular meeting or at a subsequent meeting, by resolution adjudicate the actual cost of cleaning the property and may also impose a penalty of $1,000.00 or 50 percent of the actual cost, whichever is more. The cost and any penalty may become a civil debt against the property owner, or, at the option of the city council, an assessment against the property. The cost assessed against the property means the cost to the municipality of using its own employees to do the work or the cost to the municipality of any contract executed by the municipality to have the work done. The action authorized in this section shall not be undertaken against any one parcel of land more than six times in any one calendar year, and the expense of cleaning the property shall not exceed an aggregate amount of $20,000.00 per year, or the fair market value of the property, subsequent to cleaning, whichever is less. The penalty provided herein shall not be assessed against the State of Mississippi upon request for reimbursement under Section 29-1-145 of Mississippi Code Annotated, nor shall the city clean a parcel owned by the State of Mississippi without first giving notice. 
(b)  Institution of suit. If the city council declares, by resolution, that the cost and any penalty shall be collected as a civil debt, the city council may authorize the institution of a suit on open account against the owner of the property in a court of competent jurisdiction in the manner provided by law for the cost and any penalty, plus court costs, reasonable attorney's fees and interest from the date that the property was cleaned. 
(c)  Lien. If the city council does not declare that the cost and any penalty shall be collected as a civil debt, then the assessment provided for in this section shall be a lien against the property and may be enrolled in the office of the circuit clerk of the county as other judgments are enrolled. The tax collector of the municipality shall, upon order of the city council, proceed to sell the land to satisfy the lien as now provided by law for the sale of lands for delinquent municipal taxes. 
(d)  Appeal. All decisions rendered under the provisions of this section may be appealed in the same manner as other appeals from municipal boards or courts are taken. 
(e)  Return of notice. The police officer's return on the notice may be in one of the following forms:

If the city council does not declare that the cost and any penalty shall be collected as a civil debt, then the assessment provided for in this section shall be a lien against the property and may be enrolled in the office of the circuit clerk of the county as other judgments are enrolled. The tax collector of the municipality shall, upon order of the city council, proceed to sell the land to satisfy the lien as now provided by law for the sale of lands for delinquent municipal taxes.

    Demolition means the complete or partial removal of a building on any site. 
    Demolition by neglect means substantial deterioration of a historic structure that results from improper maintenance or a lack of maintenance. 
    Design review guidelines, if adopted by the commission, shall be in a written form designed to inform local property owners about historical architectural styles prevalent in a community and to recommend preferred treatments and discourage treatments that would compromise the architectural integrity of structures in a historic district or on a landmark site or individually designated as landmarks. 
    Earthworks means any subsurface remains of historic, archaeological or architectural importance or any unusual ground formations of archaeological significance. 
    Exterior features means the architectural style, general design and general arrangement of the exterior of a building or other structure, including the color system, the kind and texture of the building material and the type and style of all windows, doors, light fixtures, signs. And other appurtenant fixtures and natural features such as live tress. 
(1)  In the case of on-premises signs, exterior features shall be construed to mean the style, material, size, color, and location of all such signs. 
(2)  Live trees larger than six inches in diameter at a point five feet above the ground shall be considered as exterior features. 
    Historic district means an area designated by the city through an ordinance which contains a geographically definable area, possessing a significant concentration, linkage, or continuity so sites, buildings, structures, or objects united by past events or aesthetically by plan or physical development, and which meet at least one of the following criteria: 
(1)  Exemplifies or reflects the broad cultural, political, economic or social history of the nation, state, county, or city; 
(2)  Is identified with historic personages or with important events in national, state or local history; 
(3)  Embodies distinguishing characteristics of an architectural type or is a specimen inherently valuable for the study of a period, style, method of construction or use of indigenous materials or craftsmanship; or

    Historic resources means, as recognized by the National Register of Historic Places, consisting of separate and aggregate buildings, districts, structures, sites and objects and are defined as follows: 
    District means a geographically definable area possessing a significant concentration, linkage, or continuity of sites, buildings, structures, or objects united by past events or aesthetically by plan or physical development. 
    Landmark means an improved parcel of ground with a building, structure and/or object designated by the city through an ordinance which possesses particular historic, architectural, cultural significance by meeting at least one of the following criteria: 
a.  Exemplifies or reflects the broad cultural, political, economic or social history of the nation, state, county, or city; 
b.  Is identified with historic personages or with important events in national, state or local history;

    Landmark sites differ from the landmarks in that the physical location, not the building or structure, possesses primary significance. Although some of the criteria for landmark sites parallels the criteria for landmarks, landmark sites which are accompanied by buildings or structures which do or do not possess significance related to the site, may appear eligible as landmarks but must be classified as landmark sites. For the purposes of this chapter, therefore, landmark sites encompass prehistoric or historic sites on unimproved or improved parcels of land. 
    Object means a material thing of functional, aesthetic, cultural, historical or scientific value that may be, by nature or design, movable yet related to a specific setting or environment. 
    Site means the location of a significant event, a prehistoric or historic occupation or activity, or a building or structure, whether standing, ruined, or vanished, where the location itself maintains historical or archeological value regardless of the value of any existing structures. For the intents and purposes of this chapter the definition of a National Register District corresponds as a historic district; buildings, structures or objects correspond as a landmark, and the definition of a National Register Site corresponds as a landmark site. 
    Structure means a work made up of interdependent and interrelated parts in a definable pattern and interrelated parts in a definable pattern of organization. Constructed by man, it is often an engineering project in scale. 
    Ordinary repairs or maintenance means work done to prevent deterioration of a building or any part thereof by restoring the building as nearly as practicable to its condition prior to such deterioration, decay or damage. 
    Owner of record means the holder of title in fee, or mortgagee or trustee, whose interest is shown of record, or the agent of any such person. 
    Period of greater historic significance for a landmark means the time period which the landmark had been essentially completed but not yet altered. It is also the period during which the style of architecture of the landmark was commonplace or typical. If a landmark also achieved historical importance in part because of designed landscape features, the period of greatest historic significance included the time period during which such landscape features were maintained. 
    Planning division means the division of metropolitan planning of the city. 
    Relocation means moving of a structure to a new location on its tax parcel or the relocation of such a structure to a new tax parcel. 
    Secretary of the Interior's Standards for the Rehabilitation and Guidelines for Rehabilitating Historic Buildings (Secretary's Standards) means a federal document delineating ten standards and numerous guidelines for the sensitive rehabilitation for the sensitive rehabilitation and preservation of historic buildings. The Secretary's Standards shall be used as the guideline for judging all applications for a certificate of appropriateness. 
    Substantial deterioration means structural degradation of such a nature that water penetration into a historic structure can no longer be prevented, or structural degradation that causes stress or strain on structural members when supports collapse or warp, evidence of which includes defective roofing materials, broken window coverings and visible interior decay. 
    Unauthorized demolition means the deliberate demolition of a historic structure without prior review and approval by the commission or city to which such a commission has made a recommendation. 
    Unreasonable economic hardship means the definition under constitutional standards used to determine whether a "taking" exists.

(Code 1971, § 151/2-8) 
Sec. 70-5. - Nonrestrictive clause. 
    Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to regulate historic buildings, structures, or sites, areas or objects owned by the United States of America or any of its political subdivisions; or by the state or any of its political subdivisions, agencies or instrumentalities, having been designated state landmarks.

If, after such hearing, the commission shall determine that the resource is being demolished by neglect, it may direct the city building official to bring misdemeanor charges against the owner or owners if the necessary repairs are not completed within 90 days of the determination by the commission that the subject building or structure is being demolished by neglect. 
(4)  In addition to the powers specified in MCA § 21-19-11(1), a governing authority, if the Historic Preservation Division of the Department of Archives and History concurs, may make repairs necessary to correct demolition by neglect, and the cost of such repairs shall become a lien against the property in accordance with MCA § 21-19-11(3). 
(5)  The city is further authorized, in its discretion, to fine any property owner who has been found to own a property that has been determined to be threatened by demolition by neglect as defined herein. Such a property owner, from the date such property is found to be in demolition by neglect by the governing authority until such repairs are made to remove the danger to the property, shall be in violation of the provisions of this section. 
(6)  This section shall not be construed to alleviate the requirements for a certificate of appropriateness as provided in this chapter.

The commission shall affirm, reverse or modify the administrative interpretation rendered by the planning director. An interpretation from which an appeal is made must be in writing, and must be in response to a written request for an administrative interpretation.

(1)  Civil penalty: 
a.  Any person who constructs, alters, relocates, or demolishes any resource in violation of this ordinance shall be required to restore the resource to its appearance or setting prior to the violation. Any action to enforce this provision shall be brought by the City of Jackson. This civil remedy shall be in addition to, and not in lieu of, any criminal prosecution and penalty. 
b.  If construction, alteration, or relocation of any resource occurs without a certificate of appropriateness, then the license of the company, individual, principal owner, or its or his successor in interest performing such construction, alteration, or relocation shall be revoked for a period of three years. 
c.  If demolition of a resource occurs without a certificate of appropriateness, then any permits on subject property will be denied for a period of three years. No permit will be issued for any structure or structures proposed for the same parcel which would require a footprint larger than the footprint of the demolished structure or structures. In addition, the owner must rebuild on the site using as much of the original building material as possible, and in general following the same form. In addition, unauthorized demolition of a portion of a structure shall not serve as justification for a demolition permit whenever it can be shown that restoration or rehabilitation would still be feasible. In addition, the applicant shall not be entitled to have issued to him by any city/town/county office a permit allowing any curb cuts on subject property for a period of three years from and after the date of such demolition. 
d.  If a historic landmark or landmark site of statewide or national significance is demolished without review and approval by a local historic preservation commission, no permit for any construction on the parcel from which the landmark or landmark site has been removed may be issued for a period of up to 24 months. 
e.  If demolition of a resource occurs without a certificate of appropriateness, then the license of the company, individual, principal owner, or its or his successor in interest performing such demolition shall be revoked for a period of five years.

a.  The following aspects of new construction shall be visually compatible with the buildings and environment with which the new construction is visually related, i.e., the height, the gross volume, the proportion between width and height of the facades, the proportions and relationship between door and windows, the rhythm of solids to voids created by openings in the facade, and materials used in the facade, the texture inherent in the facade, pattern and trim used in the facade, and the design of the roof.

a.  Result in such disharmony of scale, materials, massing, spacing and/or style between the proposed project and its immediate surroundings and the historic district, landmark or landmark site as a whole so as to undermine the architectural integrity and character of the historic district, or landmark site or landmark and inhibit the accomplishment of the purpose of this article;

d.  Notwithstanding subsections (7)a-(7)c of this section, a certificate of appropriateness should not be denied if that denial would deprive the owner of earning a reasonable rate of economic return from the building or site. 
(8)  Demolitions. Demolition of a landmark building or site, or a building or site in a historic district, constitutes an irreplaceable loss to the quality and character of the city.

(9)  Stay of demolition. If an application for a certificate of appropriateness is for the demolition of a resource within a historic district or a landmark or landmark site, action upon such application may be stayed for a period of 180 days, during which time the commission and the applicant shall undertake meetings and continuing discussions for the purpose of finding a method to save such property. During such period, the applicant and the commission shall cooperate in attempting to avoid demolition of the property. At the end of the 180-day period, the commission shall meet again to discuss the application and, if no mutually agreeable method of saving the property bearing a reasonable prospect of eventual success is underway, or if no formal application for funds from any governmental unit or nonprofit organization to preserve the property is pending, the commission shall notify the city and the building and housing official, and, upon written notice, the city may, but is not required to, issue a permit for demolition.

Cross reference- Definitions generally, § 1-2. 
Sec. 74-107. - Issuance of citation in lieu of arrest. 
    In the enforcement of any provision of law, ordinance or regulation with which he is charged, an officer may cite a person committing a misdemeanor with a written notice to appear in court rather than incarcerate him. The arresting officer shall have three alternatives when arresting a person who has committed a misdemeanor: 
(1)  Release the violator at the scene of the arrest in lieu of incarcerating him, upon his signing a written notice to appear; 
(2)  Take the violator's photograph and fingerprints for identification purposes, either at the scene of the arrest, or at the police department in lieu of incarceration, and then to release the violator upon his signing a written notice to appear in court; and 
(3)  Make a physical arrest of the violator in the manner prescribed by law and police department arrest procedures for misdemeanor offenses. 
(Code 1971, § 24-47) 
Sec. 74-108. - Conditions requiring physical arrest.

(1)  The violator refuses or fails to offer satisfactory proof of his name and address. 
(2)  The violator refuses to sign the written notice to appear in court. 
(3)  A records check indicates that the violator has previously failed to appear in response to a written notice to appear issued pursuant to this division. 
(4)  The violator has insufficient ties to the jurisdiction reasonably sufficient to ensure his appearance at trial, thereby raising the substantial likelihood that the violator will refuse to respond to the written notice to appear in court. In determining whether a violator has sufficient ties to the jurisdiction, the officer shall consider the following factors: 
a.  Does the violator reside in the jurisdiction? 
b.  Does the violator have family ties to the jurisdiction? 
c.  Does the violator have gainful employment within the jurisdiction? 
(5)  Physical arrest is necessary to prevent imminent bodily harm to the violator or to another person, or to prevent the continuation of the offense committed by the violator. 
(6)  The officer has reason to believe that the violator might be involved in past unsolved felonies, in which case the officer shall immediately notify the officer with primary responsibility for the unsolved crime of the physical arrest subsequent to its completion.

Sec. 74-109. - Chief of police to establish rules governing program.

(Code 1971, § 24-49) 
Sec. 74-110. - Authority of officers; discretion in issuance of citations.

It shall be left to the discretion of the arresting officer under rules and regulations issued by the chief of police whether or not a field release citation may be issued.

Sec. 86-52. - Purpose and findings of article. 
    The City Council of the City of Jackson has determined that juveniles have been congregating in the city causing general disturbances to residents, and contributing to an excessive number of incidents of drug and alcohol related crimes, thefts, homicides and assaults, including a high percentage of crimes committed by and against juveniles; and 
    The City Council of the City of Jackson finds and determines that special and extenuating circumstances presently exist within this city that call for special regulation of minors within the city in order to protect them from each other and from other persons on the street during the nocturnal hours, to aid in crime prevention, to promote parental supervision and authority over minors, and to decrease juvenile crime rates; and 
    In accordance with the prevailing community standards, this article serves to regulate the conduct of juveniles on streets during evening hours, and those hours prohibited by the Mississippi Compulsory School Attendance Law; to be effectively and consistently enforced for the protection of the juveniles in Jackson from each other and from other persons on the streets during nocturnal hours; to support parental control, authority, and responsibility for their children; to protect the public from nocturnal mischief by juveniles; to reduce the incidents of juvenile criminal activity; to further family responsibility; and to promote the public good, safety, and welfare. 
    After further review and continuing evaluation of this article, the City Council finds that there is continued justification for the purposes and findings herein to reinstate the curfew ordinance, as well as to extend the period of restrictions to coincide with the Mississippi Compulsory School Attendance Law.

Editor's note- Ord. No. 2015-19(4), adopted June 16, 2015, did not specifically amend Code, and has been included as Ch. 86, Art. VIII at the editor's discretion in consideration of the prior disposition of ordinances pertaining to tobacco. 

Sec. 86-221. - Findings. 
    The Jackson City Council finds and declares as follows: 
(1)  Tobacco use is the foremost preventable cause of premature death in the United States, causing over 400,000 deaths in the United States each year; 
(2)  Each day, nearly 4,000 children under 18 years of age smoke their first cigarette, and almost 1,500 children under 18 years of age begin smoking daily; more than 75 percent of all current smokers in 2001 began smoking before the age of 18; 
(3)  Tobacco companies sell products that are addictive and inherently dangerous, causing cancer, heart disease, and other serious illnesses; 
(4)  The City of Jackson has a substantial interest in reducing the number of individuals of all ages who use cigarettes and other tobacco products, and a particular interest in protecting adolescents from tobacco dependence and the illnesses and premature death associated with tobacco use; 
(5)  An overwhelming majority of Americans who use tobacco products begin using such products while they are adolescents and become addicted to those products before reaching the age of 18; 
(6)  Tobacco paraphernalia displays lead juveniles to develop favorable beliefs about tobacco use, overestimate the prevalence of tobacco use, and engage in illegal purchases of tobacco products or paraphernalia; 
(7)  The display of tobacco paraphernalia plays a crucial role in the decision of individuals, and adolescents in particular, to begin using tobacco products; 
(8)  The World Health Organization has endorsed a ban on retail tobacco product displays as an effective method of reducing tobacco use; 
(9)  Research suggests that preventing the display of tobacco products will lead to a significant decrease in the number of adolescents becoming addicted to those tobacco products and will assist individuals in their efforts to quit smoking; 
(10)  The Center for Disease Control recognizes that a comprehensive, multi-faceted approach is necessary to adequately address the issue of youth tobacco use; 
(11)  4,700 deaths in Mississippi were attributable to smoking-related diseases; 
(12)  $1.23 billion was estimated total annual economic impact of smoking in the [State of] Mississippi; 
(13)  The 2013 Mississippi Youth Risk Behavior Survey identified 15 percent of all high school students smoked at least one cigarette in the previous 30 days;

(15)  Over 500 deaths caused by exposure to secondhand smoke occur in the state of Mississippi each year; 
(16)  Preventing the display of tobacco products or paraphernalia will reduce the number of adolescents who use tobacco products, while still affording tobacco companies numerous ways to communicate product information and provide other advertising to their legal adult customers; 
(17)  Jackson City Council desires to reduce adolescent smoking and the public health consequences of smoking without prohibiting the sale of tobacco paraphernalia to adult consumers; 
(18)  The purpose of this legislation is to further the strong governmental interest in protecting the health of its citizens, and particularly its children, by restricting the display of tobacco paraphernalia in retail environments that are open to children; and 
(19)  This measure does not restrict expressive conduct any more than necessary and will leave tobacco paraphernalia companies and tobacco paraphernalia retailers with reasonable and adequate ways to communicate non-misleading commercial information to their legal adult customers.

ARTICLE IX. - SALE, TRANSFER AND DISTRIBUTION OF CERTAIN CAFFEINE PRODUCTS TO MINORS[8] 

Footnotes: 
--- (8) --- 
Editor's note- Ord. No. 2016-1(7), adopted Feb. 9, 2016, did not expressly amend the Code and has been codified as herein set out in §§ 86-251-86-262 at the editor's discretion. 

Sec. 86-251. - Short title. 
    This article shall be known as the "caffeine ordinance." 
(Ord. No. 2016-1(7), 2-9-16) 
Sec. 86-252. - Findings. 
(a)  In response to a trend in which caffeine is being added to a growing number of products, the Food and Drug Administration has announced that it will investigate the safety of caffeine in food products, particularly its effects on children and adolescents. 
(b)  The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has cited 400 milligrams a day as a safe amount of daily caffeine for healthy adults. However, the Food and Drug Administration has not set a level for children. 
(c)  Food and Drug Administration Deputy Commissioner for Foods and Veterinary Medicine Michael R. Taylor has stated that the agency is concerned about children and adolescents and the responsibility FDA and the food industry have to protect public health and respect social norms that suggest that stimulants, such as caffeine, should not be marketed to children. 
(d)  The American Academy of Pediatrics discourages the consumption of caffeine and other stimulants by children and adolescents. 
(e)  The FDA advises consumers to avoid powdered pure caffeine, as pure caffeine products are potentially dangerous, and serious adverse events can result, including death. Pure caffeine is a powerful stimulant, and very small amounts may cause accidental overdose. The FDA further advised that people with pre-existing heart conditions should not use them. 
(f)  Several deaths due to caffeine overdose have involved teens and young adults. Noah Smith, a 17-year-old from Yalobusha County, Mississippi, overdosed from caffeine pills. Logan Stiner, an 18-year-old from Lagrange, Ohio suffered cardiac arrhythmia (irregular heartbeat) and a seizure after consuming caffeine powder. The death of a 19-year-old Connecticut resident, James Stone, has been blamed on "caffeine toxicity" from a dose of two dozen No-Doz tablets. 
(g)  The Office of the Mississippi Attorney General has opined that a municipality has the authority to enact an ordinance, under Home Rule, restricting or prohibiting the sale or distribution of caffeine pills or powder to minors under the age of 18, provided that the ordinance comports with constitutional due process requirements. 
(h)  Many states and political subdivisions have banned the sale of powdered caffeine to minors. Suffolk County, New York banned the sale of caffeine powder in November of 2014. Similar proposals to crack down on caffeine powder sales have been introduced in Illinois, New Jersey, New York and Rhode Island. 
(i)  Six U.S. senators have asked the FDA to fully ban the sale of caffeine powder. 
(j)  According to the American Academy of Pediatrics, the American Association of Poison Control Centers reported more than 4,600 calls received for questions regarding caffeine in 2005. Of those calls, 2,600 involved patients younger than 19 years, and 2,345 patients required treatment, although the number of pediatric patients who required treatment was not defined. Pediatrics Volume 127, Number 6, June 2011. 
(k)  Dietary supplement manufacturers and distributors are not required to obtain approval from FDA before marketing dietary supplements. 
(l)  Caffeine is generally recognized as safe. Dietary ingredients (the "active ingredients" in dietary supplements) require no FDA preapproval to be used in a dietary supplement, and the Federal Food Drug and Cosmetic Act (FFDCA) requires FDA to prove that a product is unsafe under the conditions of use suggested in the labeling in order to take the product off the market. 
(m)  A food additive cannot be used in a conventional food unless it has been approved for that use by FDA. However, substances that are generally recognized as safe by qualified experts are not considered to be food additives, and can therefore be added to conventional foods without preapproval from FDA. 
(n)  Manufacturers, packers, and distributors of dietary supplements are required by law to report any serious adverse events to the FDA within 15 business days, and to provide (also within 15 business days) any additional medical information they obtain within a year of the adverse event report. However, the FFDCA does not require manufacturers, packers, or distributors of conventional foods to report serious adverse events to FDA. Therefore, all adverse event reports that FDA has received in connection with these products are voluntary. 
(o)  Manufacturers can add it to products if they decide it meets the relevant safety standards, and if they include it on the ingredient list. While various uses may meet federal food safety standards, the only time FDA explicitly approved adding caffeine was for colas in the 1950s. Existing rules never anticipated the current proliferation of caffeinated products. 
(p)  Labeling requirements for beverages and other conventional foods differ from those for dietary supplements. For example, beverages and other conventional foods are required to bear nutrition information in the form of Nutrition Facts rather than Supplement Facts, and all ingredients in a beverage and other conventional food must be declared in the ingredient statement by their common and usual names, in descending order of predominance. 
(q)  A review of scientific reports and articles reveals that the effects of caffeine powder and caffeine pills as defined herein are detrimental to the youth in Jackson, Mississippi. In 2015, the Mississippi Poison Control Center received referrals and incident reporting that involved the ingestion of caffeine powder and caffeine pills by minors residing in the City of Jackson. 
(r)  The City Council of Jackson, Mississippi has determined that there is a need to establish regulations restricting the sale and purchase of caffeine powder and caffeine pills to persons under the age of 18 years in the City of Jackson.

(1)  That the people of the city have a primary interest in controlling the erection, location and maintenance of signs in a manner to protect the public health, safety and morals, and to promote the public welfare; 
(2)  That the increased number and size of such signs, coupled with the increased use of motor vehicles, make it imperative that the public streets and highways be kept free from signs which detract from traffic safety by diverting drivers' attention away from the flow of traffic; 
(3)  That the number, size and height of signs, both building and ground mounted, in the city is excessive, is unduly distracting and confusing to motorists and pedestrians, creates a traffic hazard, and reduces the effectiveness of signs needed to direct the public; 
(4)  That the appearance of the city, particularly that of its residential and light commercial districts, is marred by the excessive number of signs; 
(5)  That the aforementioned effects detract from the pleasure, safety and economic well being of the community, and that the number of distracting commercial signs ought to be reduced in order to lessen the detrimental effects. 
(6)  That the size and location of such signs may, if uncontrolled, constitute an obstacle to effective firefighting techniques; 
(7)  That in addition thereto, the construction, erection and maintenance of large signs suspended from or erection placed on top of buildings, walls or other structures constitute a direct danger to pedestrian traffic below such signs, especially during periods when winds of high velocity are prevalent; 
(8)  That the natural beauty of landscape, view and attractive surroundings of the city constitute an attraction for tourists and visitors; 
(9)  That the indiscriminate erection and maintenance of large and/or numerous signs seriously detract from the enjoyment and pleasure of the natural scenic beauty of the city which, in turn, injuriously affect the tourist trade and thereby the economic well-being of the city; 
(10)  That portable signs generally create a higher degree of danger and distraction to the public, are less attractive aesthetically, are more difficult to monitor and regulate, are mores susceptible to abuse, and therefore should be prohibited; 
(11)  That, due to technological advances in the outdoor advertising industry, digital electronic signs have been introduced to the city and are in need of strict regulation; 
(12)  That for the promotion and preservation of the public health, safety and welfare of the people of the city it is deemed necessary that the erection, construction, location, maintenance, and type of signs be regulated and controlled; and 
(13)  That the regulations contained in this article are the minimum amount of regulation necessary to achieve its purposes.

Issuance of the permit shall in no way prevent the building official from later declaring said sign to be nonconforming if upon further review of information submitted with the application, or of acquired information, the sign is found not to comply with the requirements of this article or any other ordinances. 
    Before any permit is issued, the applicant shall pay the permit fee established by the city council.

    Any sign not registered shall be considered an illegal sign. The building official shall notify or make reasonable effort to notify the owner, or his agent, of the sign of such condition. If after 30 days of such notification the sign has not been removed by the owner, or his agent, the building official shall have the authority to enter on the private property on which the sign is located to remove such sign and/or institute appropriate action to have the sign removed. The city is further authorized to place a lien, in the amount of the removal cost, against the property upon which the illegal sign is located. 
    The registration of each sign heretofore registered shall be renewed annually. Payment of the fee established by order of the city council shall be due at the same time the business privilege license is due. 
(d)  Work on nonpermitted signs: No person shall knowingly erect or assist in the erection, construction, alteration, relocation, repair or painting of, or do any work upon any sign for which a permit has not been obtained. Any such sign shall be illegal. The building official shall issue a written notice to the owner or agent advising him of the illegal sign and giving him 48 hours within which to obtain a sign permit. If a permit is not obtainable, due to the illegal nature of the sign, the owner or his agent, at his own expense, shall remove the sign immediately.

(b)  General provisions: Subject to the exceptions stated herein, any nonconforming sign may be continued and maintained after the effective date of this article, provided that nonconforming signs shall not be: 
(1)  Changed to or replaced with another nonconforming sign, including changing the sign face, except for changeable copy signs which comply with this regulation and paper copy outdoor advertising signs.

Such signs may be strengthened or restored only to the extent that such cost does not exceed 50 percent of the current market value of the existing sign structure. 
(d)  A nonconforming sign or sign structure which is partially destroyed by fire, accident, or natural cause beyond 50 percent of its current market value shall thereafter be removed or reconstructed in such a way that the sign or sign structure conforms with the provisions of this article. 
(e)  Any nonconforming sign or sign structure which is improved and altered to comply with the provisions of this article shall thereafter be considered to be conforming.

(Ord. No. 1999-6(5), § 1, 1-12-99) 
Sec. 118-592. - Statement of purpose. 
    Traffic calming is a form of traffic planning that seeks to equalize the use of streets between automobiles, pedestrians, bicyclists, and playing children. This is accomplished through the use of devices and techniques that reduce traffic volume and speed in neighborhoods while maintaining maximum mobility and access. Traffic calming also attempts to make drivers aware of the fact that they are sharing the space of a street with other users. While traffic calming will modify traffic patterns, streets will remain in public ownership and be accessible to the general public. 
    The traffic calming ordinance provides a procedure to consider, evaluate, implement and remove traffic calming measures on residential streets in the City of Jackson.

    Dwelling unit means one or more rooms physically arranged to create an independent housekeeping establishment for occupancy by one family. 
    Local street means any two lane street with the primary purpose for providing access to abutting residential properties. 
    Traffic calming committee includes seven-member committee appointed by the mayor from each of the City of Jackson's seven wards and confirmed by the city council.

(a)  A person who receives a notice of violation may contest the imposition of the civil penalty by requesting, in writing, an administrative adjudication of the civil penalty within 15 days after the receipt of the notice of violation (which, in light of the presumption of receipt in subsection 119-6(d), must be received by the department, not merely postmarked, no later than 20 days after the date on the notice of violation). Upon receipt of a timely request, the department shall notify the requestor of the date and time of the hearing on the administrative adjudication. The hearing officer for the administrative adjudication hearing shall be the deputy director of administration for municipal courts or his/her designee. 
(b)  Failure to pay a civil penalty, or to contest liability in a timely manner, is an admission of liability in the full amount of the civil penalty assessed in the notice of violation, and is a waiver of the right to contest or appeal the notice of violation. 
(c)  The civil penalty shall not be assessed if, after a hearing, the hearing officer enters a finding of no liability. 
(d)  In an administrative adjudication hearing, the standard of proof shall be by a preponderance of the evidence. The reliability of the photographic traffic signal enforcement system used to produce the recorded image of the violation may be attested to, in an administrative adjudication hearing, by affidavit of an officer or employee of the City of Jackson, or the entity with which the city contracts to install or operate the system and who is responsible for inspecting and maintaining the system. Said affidavit of an officer or employee of the City of Jackson that alleges a violation based on an inspection of the pertinent recorded image is admissible in a proceeding under this chapter. 
(e)  A person who is found liable after an administrative adjudication hearing, or who requests an administrative adjudication hearing and thereafter fails to appear at the time and place of the hearing, is liable for administrative hearing costs in the amount of $25.00, in addition to the amount of the civil penalty assessed for the violation. Said civil penalty and costs must be paid within ten days of the hearing, unless the person found liable timely files a notice of appeal with the municipal court in accordance with subsection 119-7(i). However, a person who fails to attend the administrative hearing forfeits and waives any rights of appeal. 
(f)  It shall be an affirmative defense to the imposition of civil liability under this chapter that: 
(1)  The traffic-control signal was not in proper position and sufficiently legible to an ordinarily observant person; 
(2)  The operator of the motor vehicle was acting in compliance with the lawful order or direction of a law enforcement officer; 
(3)  The operator of the motor vehicle violated the instructions of the traffic-control signal only to yield to the right-of-way of an immediately approaching authorized emergency vehicle; 
(4)  The motor vehicle was being operated as an authorized emergency vehicle, and the operator of said vehicle was acting in compliance with state statutes in operation thereof; 
(5)  The motor vehicle was a stolen vehicle being operated by a person other than the owner of the vehicle, without the effective consent of the owner; 
(6)  The license plate depicted in the recorded image of the violation was a stolen plate being displayed on the motor vehicle in question, instead of the motor vehicle for which the plate had initially been issued; 
(7)  The presence of ice, snow, unusual amounts of rain or other unusually hazardous road conditions existed that would make compliance with this chapter more dangerous under the circumstances than non-compliance; or 
(8)  The person who received the notice of violation was not the owner and/or operator of the motor-vehicle at the time of the violation. 
(g)  To demonstrate that, at the time of the violation, the motor vehicle was a stolen vehicle or the license plate displayed on the motor vehicle was a stolen plate, the owner must submit sufficient proof, acceptable to the hearing officer, that the theft of the vehicle or license plate had not been timely reported to the appropriate law enforcement agency and, thus, making such information unavailable to the proper law enforcement agency at the time of the violation. 
(h)  Notwithstanding anything in this chapter to the contrary, a person who fails to pay the amount of a civil penalty or to contest liability in a timely manner, is entitled to an administrative adjudication hearing on the violation if: 
(1)  The person files an affidavit with the hearing officer stating the date on which the person received the notice of violation via regular mail, if such date was later than five days from the date of the notice; and 
(2)  The person requests an administrative adjudication hearing within the same period required by subsection 119-7(a) for a hearing to be timely requested, but measured from the date the mailed notice was received, as stated in the affidavit filed under subsection (h)(1). 
(i)  A person who is found liable after an administrative adjudication hearing may appeal the finding of civil liability to the city council by filing a notice of appeal with the city clerk, who shall forward a copy of the notice of appeal to the municipal court administrator. The city council shall appoint, as its designee, a municipal judge to hear any such appeal. The notice of appeal must be filed no later than 31 days after the date on which the administrative adjudication hearing officer entered the finding of civil liability. Unless the person, on or before the filing of the notice of appeal, posts a bond in the amount of the civil penalty and any late fees, an appeal does not stay the enforcement of the civil penalty. The standard of review on appeal shall be trial de novo, and the standard of proof shall remain by preponderance of the evidence. The affidavits submitted under subsection 119-7(d) shall be admitted by the municipal judge during the appellate proceedings. A person found liable by the municipal shall pay an appellate filing fee of $50.00, in addition to the civil penalty and any other fees due the City of Jackson. 
(Ord. No. 2007-21(7), § 1, 8-9-07) 
Sec. 119-8. - Order. 
(a)  The hearing officer at any administrative adjudication hearing under this chapter shall issue an order stating: 
(1)  Whether the person charged with the violation is liable for the violation; and 
(2)  If liable, the amount of any civil penalty, late penalty, and administrative adjudication costs assessed against the person. 
(b)  The orders issued under subsection (a) may be filed with the department records division, and must be kept in a separate index and file. Said orders may be recorded using microfilm, microfiche, or data processing techniques. 
(Ord. No. 2007-21(7), § 1, 8-9-07) 
Sec. 119-9. - Effect of liability, exclusion of civil remedy. 
(a)  The imposition of civil penalty under this chapter is not a criminal conviction for any purpose, and is not reflected on the owner's permanent driving record. 
(b)  A civil penalty may not be imposed under this chapter on the owner of a motor vehicle if the operator of the vehicle was arrested or was issued a citation and notice to appear by a law enforcement officer for the same violation. 
(c)  An owner who fails to pay the civil penalty, or to timely contest liability for the penalty assessed, is considered to admit liability for the full amount of the civil penalty stated in the notice of violation mailed to the owner. 
(d)  A civil penalty, along with any applicable late fee(s), assessed under this chapter, and which remains unpaid, is subject to the prevailing rate of interest authorized by law. 
(Ord. No. 2007-21(7), § 1, 8-9-07) 
Sec. 119-10. - Authorization to file suit. 
    The city attorney is authorized to file suit to enforce collection of a civil penalty imposed under this chapter, and the city attorney is authorized to employ any such attorneys and experts necessary to enforce the same.

DIVISION 6. - ENVIRONMENTAL ENFORCEMENT[4] 

Footnotes: 
--- (4) --- 
Editor's note- Section 5 of Ord. No. 2018-7(8), adopted Feb. 27, 2018, provides for an effective date for division 5 of March 1, 2018. 

Sec. 122-181. - Environmental violations and penalties. 
(a)  Definitions. 
(1)  Administrative penalties. An administrative penalty is a monetary penalty assessed by the director or his designee for violations of article II. Sewage disposal standards, including, but not limited to, the FOG program, violations of the stormwater quality protection ordinance, sections 122-301 through 122-307, and chapter 106, solid waste, sections 106-1 through 106-220. Administrative penalties are to be used as an escalated enforcement action and are not related to a specific cost borne by the director or his designee. Instead, the amount of the penalty should recapture any economic benefit gained by noncompliance and/or deter future violations. An administrative order is to be used to assess an administrative penalty. 
(2)  Administrative orders (AO). Administrative orders are to be issued by the director or the director's designee. Administrative orders are enforcement documents that direct users to undertake and/or to cease specified activities. Administrative orders are to be used as the first formal response to significant noncompliance, and may incorporate compliance schedules, administrative penalties, assessments for costs incurred during investigation and/or enforcement, attorney's fees, assessments for damages and termination of service. The department has adopted three general types of AOs: compliance orders, cease and desist orders, and agreed orders. 
a.  Compliance order. A compliance order directs the user to achieve or restore compliance by a specified date and is the primary means of assessing penalties and costs. The compliance order will document the noncompliance and state required actions to be accomplished by specific dates and is issued by the director or his designee. 
b.  Cease and desist order. A cease and desist order directs the noncompliant user to cease illegal or unauthorized discharge immediately or to terminate discharge altogether. To preserve the usefulness of this order in emergency situations, penalties should not be assessed in this document. A cease and desist order will be used in situations where the discharge is causing interference, pass through, environmental harm, or otherwise creating an emergency situation. The order may be issued immediately upon discovery of an emergency situation or following a hearing. In an emergency, the order to cease and desist may be given by telephone with a subsequent written order to be served by the director or his designee before the close of business on the next working day. If the user fails to comply with the order, the director or his designee may take independent action to halt the discharge. 
c.  Agreed order. The agreed order is an agreement between the department and the user. The agreed order normally contains three elements: 
1.  Compliance schedules with specific milestone dates; 
2.  Stipulated penalties, damages, and/or remedial actions; and 
3.  Signature by the director and the user representative. 
An agreed order is appropriate when the user assumes the responsibility for its noncompliance and is willing (in good faith) to correct the causes. 
(3)  Noncompliance notification (NCN). The noncompliance notification (NCN) is a notification to the user that a practice, an action, or wastewater discharge is noncompliant with department regulations or policies. A NCN informs the user that an action is required of the user within a specified time period designated by the director, or their designee, or the noncompliance will require the director to escalate enforcement action against the user. 
(4)  Notice of violation (NOV). The notice of violation (NOV) is an official communication from the director to the noncompliant user that informs the user that a violation has occurred. The NOV is issued for relatively minor or infrequent violations of standards and requirements, and should be issued within five working days of the identification of a violation. An NOV does not contain assessment of penalties or cost recovery. The NOV provides the regulated entity with an opportunity to correct the noncompliance on its own initiative rather than according to a schedule of actions determined by the director. The NOV documents the initial attempts of the department to resolve the noncompliance. Authenticated copies of NOVs may serve as evidence in judicial proceedings. 
(5)  Schedule of compliance. A schedule of compliance is a detailed list of steps to be taken by a noncompliant user whereby compliance with all pertinent regulations will be achieved. This schedule shall contain increments of progress in the form of dates for the commencement and completion of major events leading to the construction and operation of additional GCD or other facilities required for the regulated entity to meet the applicable standards and requirements (e.g., hiring an engineer, completing preliminary plans, executing contracts for components, commencing construction, etc.). 
(b)  Penalty assessment. The city has categorized the various types of violations of the FOG control program, and assigned a penalty range to each category. Penalty categories are determined by using the enforcement response guide, which is included in the FOG control plan manual. All penalty assessments will be approved and signed by the director or the director's designee. Penalty amounts determined are considered to be an economic deterrent to the noncompliance being addressed. Penalty ranges have been designed to recover any economic benefit gained by the violation through noncompliance. Violations of other environmental ordinances subject to this division shall be assessed consistent with the penalties provided in those ordinances. The ranges of penalties for any violation of the requirements and standards for the FOG control program shall be as follows: 
Category 0 No penalty Category 1 $200.00 to $500.00 Category 2 $500.00 to $1,000.00 Category 3 $1,000.00 to $10,000.00 Category 4 Direct legal action  
    Assessments for damages or destruction of the facilities of the POTW, and any penalties, costs, and attorney's fees incurred by the city as the result of the illegal activity, as well as the expenses involved in enforcement, are not part of this penalty assessment procedure. 
(Ord. No. 2018-7(8), § 4, 2-27-18) 
Sec. 122-182. - Emergency suspension of services. 
    The city may suspend water or wastewater service when such suspension is necessary, and without prior notice, when in the opinion of the director of the department of public works, one of the following situations occurs with respect to the FOG control program: 
(1)  Three notices of violation of the FOG control program have occurred within a 12-month period, 
(2)  There is imminent or substantial endangerment to the health or welfare of persons or the environment, 
(3)  Stoppages or sanitary sewer overflows have occurred, or excessive maintenance has to be performed to prevent stoppages or overflows in the sanitary sewer collection system, 
(4)  Interference occurs with the operation and/or maintenance of the wastewater treatment facility, or 
(5)  Any condition that causes the city to violate any condition of its NPDES permits, agreed orders, or consent decree. 
(Ord. No. 2018-7(8), § 4, 2-27-18) 
Sec. 122-183. - Appeal and waiver provisions. 
(a)  Any person aggrieved by an action of the director of the department of public works or the rejection any FOG control plan, suspending or revoking any plan, or any other final action imposing affirmative or negative obligations on such user, or imposing an administrative penalty under this division may appeal such decision to the administrative law judge. No notice of violation of this division, no requirement only for information or data concerning a regulated activity and no action of the director not imposing specific affirmative or negative obligations or an administrative penalty shall be appealable. The administrative law judge must receive the written appeal within 15 calendar days of the date of the director's action, identifying the action appealed from, the relevant facts, and any information that such person requests the administrative law judge to consider. The administrative law judge may in his or her discretion either informally decide the appeal without a hearing or may hold a hearing at which such person may present his or her arguments and evidence. At any hearing held pursuant this paragraph testimony and evidence will be under oath. The administrative law judge shall endeavor to affirm, modify or rescind the action in writing within 30 calendar days of the appeal or any hearing held hereunder. 
(b)  If an FSE is reasonably unable to install an outside gravity grease interceptor, the FSE must install a properly sized automated interior grease trap or traps. The FSE may submit a written request for a variance to this requirement to the director of the department of public works or his or her designee for consideration. All requests shall contain all such information as the director may require. The director may grant a variance on a case-by-case basis after consideration. No such variance shall authorize the creation or maintenance of a nuisance or any danger to public health or safety. No variance granted by the director shall be construed to authorize any activity in violation of state or any federal pollution control regulation or requirement. 
(Ord. No. 2018-7(8), § 4, 2-27-18) 
Sec. 122-184. - Creation of the administrative law judge for appeals from environmental ordinance violations. 
(a)  The position of administrative law judge for appeals from administrative orders and administrative penalties is hereby created. 
(b)  The mayor shall appoint one or more of the currently serving municipal judges to serve as administrative law judges to hear appeals from administrative orders and administrative penalties issued under the authority of article II. Sewage disposal standards, including, but not limited to, the FOG program; violations of the stormwater quality protection ordinance, sections 122-301 through 122-307; and chapter 106, solid waste, sections 106-1 through 106-220. 
(c)  The decision of the administrative law judge shall constitute final action by the city, which may be appealed by bill of exceptions to a court of competent jurisdiction.

(Code 1971, § 29-66; Ord. of 9-20-94) 
Sec. 122-234. - Methods of determination; rates of charge generally. 
    Sewer service charges for the use of the city sanitary sewage system shall be in accordance with the following: There shall be two classes of charges: one being a volumetric charge and the other being a surcharge for excessive strength of wastewater. These charges shall apply to all users of the city sanitary sewage system, as provided in section 122-232. 
(1)  Volumetric charges. Volumetric charges will be determined as follows: 
a.  The volumetric charge will be determined by the water meter reading, or at the user's option, the user may furnish metering devices approved by the approving authority for measuring wastewater discharged into the city sewer system. This will apply to those users of the city sanitary sewer system who purchase all water from the city or other water utility. Those users having private wells or other sources of water supply shall install either water meters on the wells or other sources of water supply or approved metering devices on wastewater discharged to the city sewers. The schedule of sewer service charges, on a volumetric basis, is as follows: Each customer shall be charged $4.47 per 100 cubic feet of meter water consumption when the monthly water consumption is greater than the minimum amounts described in section 122-235. 
b.  Notwithstanding subsection (1)a. of this section, any business utilizing sewer services provided by the city shall pay a reduced volumetric charge of its sewer usage at the follow rates: 
1.  If the business makes a capital investment of $75,000,000.00 or more, and either employs at least 75 employees or uses a daily average of 133,000 cubic feet of water, it shall receive a 25 percent reduction in its water charges. 
2.  If the business makes a capital investment of at least $50,000,000.00, but less than $75,000,000.00, and employs at least 50 employees, it shall receive a 20 percent reduction in its water charges. 
3.  If the business makes a capital investment of at least $25,000,000.00, but less than $50,000,000.00, and employs at least 25 employees, it shall receive a 15 percent reduction in its water charges. 
4.  If the business makes a capital investment of at least $10,000,000.00, but less than $25,000,000.00, and employs at least 25 employees, it shall receive a ten percent reduction in water charges. 
c.  Nothing in this section shall be construed to allow any business to obtain the reduction in rates set forth in subsections (1)b.1. through (1)b.4. of this section for a period in excess of ten years, and such ten-year period is the maximum period during which the reduction in rates shall apply. 
d.  Prior to qualifying for the rate reduction set forth in subsections (1)b.1. through (1)b.4. of this section, a business seeking such reduction shall be required to enter into an agreement with the city reciting that the business has met one of the conditions of subsections (1)b.1. through (1)b.4. of this section. 
(2)  Surcharge for excessive wastewater strengths. A sewer service surcharge for excessive wastewater strengths shall be assessed for wastewaters discharging to the sewer system having strengths in excess of the limits scheduled in this subsection: 
Wastewater 
Parameter Strength  
Limit  
(milligrams 
per liter)   
Biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) ..... 240 
Suspended solids ..... 300 
Fats, oil and grease ..... 67 
The concentrations in excess of the above limits shall be assessed a surcharge based on the following schedule of rates: 
Wastewater 
Parameter Surcharge 
Rate   
  (per pound)  
Biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) ..... $0.28 
Suspended solids ..... $0.28 
Fats, oil and grease ..... $1.05 
The surcharge shall be computed from the following formula: 
S = 0.00624 × F × (SRB × EBOD + SRS × Ess) + (SRG × Efog)) where: 
S = surcharge in dollars F = wastewater flow expressed in 100 cubic feet SRB = surcharge rate for BOD expressed in dollars per pound BOD SRS = surcharge rate for suspended solids expressed in dollars per pound suspended solids SRG = surcharge rate for fats, oil and grease expressed in dollars per pound FOG EBOD = excess BOD concentration, expressed in milligrams per liter, where BOD = BOD concentration, as discharged, less the scheduled strength limit for BOD. If EBOD results in a negative number, a value of zero shall be used for EBOD in the surcharge formula. Ess = excess suspended solids concentration, expressed in milligrams, where Ess = suspended solids concentration, as discharged, less the scheduled strength limit for suspended solids. If Ess results in a negative number, a value of zero shall be used for Ess in the surcharge formula. Efog = excess fats, oil and grease concentration, expressed in milligrams, where Efog = fats, oil and grease concentration, as discharged, less the scheduled strength limit for fats, oils and grease. If Efog results in a negative number, a value of zero shall be used for Efog in the surcharge formula.  
All users subject to sewer service surcharge shall, at the request and with the approval of the department of public works shall: 
a.  Install and maintain a suitable flow measuring device. 
b.  Provide and maintain an accessible sampling manhole in the user's wastewater discharge line or lines. 
c.  Report average monthly flow, biochemical oxygen demand, suspended solids and any other scheduled parameter, as required. All analytical results shall be made by an approved laboratory. 
d.  Provide instrumentation for and report results of any characteristics of the wastewater which are required in order to be in compliance with this article. 
e.  Provide flow regulation to limit the maximum hourly flow to four times the average 24-hour flow of the individual user.

Sec. 122-236. - Summer sewer credit for single-family residential users. 
(a)  Single-family residences shall be given a 15 percent summer sewer credit during the months of June through September to account for water metered but not actually entering the sewer system due to lawn watering and other uses. This credit shall apply only to those single-family residences whose sewer charges are determined solely from the volume of water recorded by their water meters. Single-family residences whose sewer charges are determined either by directly measuring that portion of the water supply which serves a lawn-sprinkling load or other load not directly connected to the sewer system or by directly measuring wastewater discharged will not receive the automatic summer credit as stated. The credit shall apply to single-family residential users both inside and outside the corporate limits of the city. 
(b)  A user may, at his own expense, and with the city's approval, install a secondary meter or meters on that portion of his water supply system which serves only his lawn-sprinkling load so as to measure directly the amount of water that does not enter the public sewers, and that user will not receive a summer sewer credit.

Sec. 126-80. - Taximeter; specifications. 
    Indications of fare shall be displayed through, and entirely protected by, glass or other suitable transparent material securely attached to the housing of the taximeter. A taximeter shall calculate fares only upon the basis of initial money drop and of distance traveled, time elapsed, or a combination of distance traveled and time elapsed. 
(1)  A taximeter shall be equipped with a primary indicating element which shall be susceptible of advancement only by the rotation of the vehicle wheels or by the time mechanism. Except when a taximeter is being cleared, indications of fare and extras shall be clearly visible at all times and at least ten mm high for the fare and four mm high for all other indications. If needed, artificial illumination of the taximeter face shall be provided. When a taximeter designed to calculate fares upon the basis of a combination of distance traveled and time elapsed is operative with respect to fare indication, the fare-indicating mechanism shall be actuated by the distance mechanism whenever the vehicle is in motion at such a speed that the rate of distance revenue equals or exceeds the time rate, and may be actuated by the time mechanism whenever the vehicle speed is less than this and when the vehicle is not in motion. Means shall be provided for the vehicle operator to render the time mechanism either operative or inoperative with respect to the fare-indicating mechanism. 
(2)  Whenever the indicating elements of a taximeter are set to indicate a charge for the hire of the vehicle, the character of the fare indication shall be clearly shown on the taximeter face. When a taximeter is cleared, the indication "not registering," "vacant," or an equivalent expression shall be shown. Whenever a single-tariff taximeter is set so as to register charges, the indication "registering," hired," or an equivalent expression shall be shown. Whenever a multiple-tariff taximeter is set so as to register charges, the basis for the particular tariff for which it is set shall be shown. 
(3)  Design of the operating control shall be as follows: 
A control lever-arm knob, handle, or other convenient and effective means shall be provided to set the taximeter mechanism for the desired operating condition and to clear the taximeter. The several positions of the control lever shall be mechanically defined, and displacement from any of these positions shall be sufficiently obstructed that the accidental or inadvertent changing of the operating condition of the taximeter is improbable. Possible movement of this control to an operating position immediately following its movement to the cleared position shall automatically be delayed enough to permit the taximeter mechanism to come to complete rest in the cleared condition. 
(4)  Adequate provision shall be made for affixing lead-and-wire seals to a taximeter and to other parts required for service operation of a complete installation on a vehicle, so that no adjustments, alterations or replacement affecting in any way the accuracy or indications of the device or the assembly can be made without mutilating the seal or seals. The sealing means shall be such that it is not necessary to disassemble or remove any part of the device or of the vehicle to apply or inspect the seals. 
(5)  To determine compliance with distance tolerances, the vehicle shall be driven over a precisely measured road course. 
(6)  The time mechanism shall be tested at least through the first five time intervals. 
(7)  The operational tire pressure recommended by the manufacturer shall be maintained. 
(8)  Whenever a taximeter has been damaged, or repairs that might in any way affect the accuracy of its indications have been made, or any of the official security seals have been mutilated, such device shall not thereafter be used until it has been officially examined and re-approved by the city.

Editor's note- Ord. No. 2015-24(3), adopted July 14, 2015, did not specifically amend the Code and has been codified herein as Ch. 127, Art. II, at the editor's discretion and with the city's approval. 

Sec. 127-51. - Findings. 
(a)  For several decades, the City of Jackson has conducted numerous disparity and availability studies that have documented the discriminatory practices and barriers to public procurement within the City of Jackson that have plagued minority business enterprises and women business enterprises. 
(b)  Historical, systemic and institutionalized discrimination against minority and women owned businesses exists in the Jackson business sector, which has restricted their access to private and public contracting markets and which has emerged as the major factor responsible for their marginal economic position in the Jackson business population. 
(c)  The specific industries that showed discrimination against women and other minorities include construction, commodity sales, and professional services. 
(d)  The contracting and procurement practices of the City of Jackson, prior to the inception of a minority and female business enterprise program, were dominated by an historical, institutional and systematic network from which women and minorities were excluded. 
(e)  Market place discrimination against minorities and women business owners occurred in the Jackson marketplace across a wide range of businesses, including evidence of double standards in work appraisals, denials of opportunities to bid, discrimination in bonding, financing and in payments, lack of access to contracts, unnecessarily restrictive specifications, the existence of and the exclusion from the historical, systematic, and institutional network, subcontracting, bid shopping, and bid manipulation. 
(f)  The statistical comparison suggested by the U.S. Supreme Court in Croson, between the number of available qualified minority businesses, and the total contract dollar awards going to minority businesses, referred to as the utilization percentage ratio (UPR), yields significant statistical disparities in all industries between majority and minority businesses who contract with the City of Jackson. Moreover, this comparison suggested by the court, although showing a significant degree of disparity, results in a deficient measure of discrimination, failing to take into account those minority or female individuals or firms who were discouraged, deterred and/or disadvantaged by the discriminating practice in the marketplace. 
(g)  Race and gender neutral policies, including those suggested by the U.S. Supreme Court in Croson, although helpful in improving minority and women owned business development, are found to be inadequate standing alone to eliminate discriminatory practices which continue to deny women and minority business owners access to public and private contracts in the Jackson marketplace. 
(h)  Women and minorities have been discriminated against in public and private markets for contractual services. There is a presence of discrimination in Jackson in various industry classifications and by employer status which has persisted over time. Moreover, there is strong anecdotal and statistical evidence that African American businesses continue to suffer the effects of past and present discrimination in the Jackson business markets both public and private. 
(i)  Female, African American, and other minority owned businesses continue to suffer discrimination in the local business market when competing for construction contracts. Given the strikingly low participation of minority enterprises in private construction markets, the City of Jackson should leverage behavior in the private market to assure the effective development of minority and female business enterprises and to eradicate discriminatory practices. 
(j)  The City of Jackson was a passive participant in discriminatory practices in both public and the private commercial markets. 
(k)  Past and present discrimination in public and private markets for contractual services and the inability of race and gender-conscious programs standing alone, make race and gender-conscious programs necessary in order to remedy economic disparities between minority, female and majority contractors. 
(l)  Utilization goals, attainable by good faith efforts, not quotas, for African-American, female, Hispanic, and Asian American owned businesses are necessary to mitigate the competitive disadvantages which are caused by discrimination and are justified by evidence in the record. 
(Ord. No. 2015-24(3), 7-14-15) 
Sec. 127-52. - Definitions. 
    [The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this article, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this section, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning:] 
    Female business enterprise (FBE) means a business owned and controlled by one or more females and certified as such by the division of business development, which is an independent and continuing enterprise for profit, performing real and actual services in the discharge of any contractual endeavor. The contractor must perform a distinct element of work in which the business has the skill and expertise as well as the responsibility of actually performing, managing and supervising. 
    Minority business enterprise (MBE) means a business which is an independent and continuing operation for profit, performing real and actual services in the discharge of any contractual endeavor. The contractor must perform a distinct element of work in which the business has the skill and expertise as well as the responsibility of actually performing, managing and supervising. A minority business enterprise is owned and controlled by one or more minority group members, which include African-American, Asian American and Hispanic American, as such groups have been determined to have suffered discrimination requiring amelioration and the owners are certified as such by the city. 
(Ord. No. 2015-24(3), 7-14-15) 
Sec. 127-53. - Policy. 
    It is the policy of the city council to require the completion of a disparity and availability study not less than every five years in an attempt to provide a remedy for past underutilization of minority and woman-owned businesses and to prevent any ongoing underutilization of minority and women's business enterprises in the city's contracting process by ensuring the full and equitable participation of minority and female business enterprises in the provision of goods and services to the city on a contractual basis. 
(Ord. No. 2015-24(3), 7-14-15) 
Sec. 127-54. - Goal. 
    The ultimate goal of this policy is to remedy the effects of past underutilization in the local marketplace by increasing the use of minority and women's business enterprises to one more comparable to their representation in the City of Jackson business community. 
(Ord. No. 2015-24(3), 7-14-15) 
Sec. 127-55. - Determination of continuing need; amendments. 
    The city council shall, every five years, appropriate funds necessary to determine whether there is a continuing need for a minority and woman business enterprise program, make relevant findings, and, if necessary, enact appropriate amendments to this article. 
(Ord. No. 2015-24(3), 7-14-15)

Rather, cohesion and identity can be demonstrated in similar building scale or mass; consistent use of facade materials; similar ground level detailing, color or signage; consistency in functional systems such as roadway or pedestrian way surfaces, signage, or landscaping; the framing of outdoor open space and linkages, or a clear conveyance in the importance of various buildings and features on the site. Except for architectural insulated metal panels, all proposed new metal buildings are prohibited in Corridor 80 District unless covered with brick or other masonry material.
Buildings adjacent to usable open space should generally be oriented to that space, with access to the building opening onto the open space.
Landscaped space, and particularly usable open space, shall be designed and located to connect as a network throughout the proposed development. It is also generally intended that said space be designed and located to connect with existing offsite usable open space, and provide potential for connection with future open space by extending to the perimeter of the development, particularly when a plan exists for the location and networking of such future open space.
Commercial uses shall be designed and operated, and hours of operation limited where appropriate, so that neighboring residents are not exposed to offensive noise, especially from traffic or late-night activity. No amplified music shall be audible to neighboring residents. Vehicular access to and from public roads is intended to be consolidated. Vehicular access to development sites from a public roadway shall generally be limited to one (1) access point, particularly when a proposed development frontage along said roadway is three hundred (300) feet or less.
Internal streets shall consist of local and collector roadways, designed in accordance with standard traffic engineering practice. Any street proposed for public dedication shall be designed and constructed in accordance with City of Jacksons Subdivision Regulations.
The design should preserve and enhance natural features such as topography, waterways, vegetation, and drainage ways.

For multi-tenant buildings, at least 50% of the entrances shall be oriented to the primary street or pedestrian or public zone. Facades with principal customer entrances may be turned perpendicular to the primary street if they provide a direct pedestrian connection from a public sidewalk to the major customer entrance without interruption by vehicular traffic. The primary street for a development is Highway 80, or other arterial or collector streets that fronts the development. When the development has two primary streets, the site plan shall determine orientation.
Developments at inters shall identify or emphasize their corners with significant landscaping or similar public feature.
A clearly delineated pathway or route should connect all principal building or business entrances to any sidewalks or trails on streets adjacent to the project.
706.13.2 B Pedestrian Access: Developments shall provide a continuous walkway connection at least 5 feet in width from the public sidewalk to the customer entrances of all principal buildings on the site.

Multi-building developments shall provide clear and safe walkways at least 5 feet in width that connect all buildings on the site. Buildings not intended for routine customer access or intended solely for drive-up services are excluded from this requirement.
Where the required walkways specified in this cross drives, parking aisles, or other vehicular ways, the crosswalks shall be distinguished from driving surfaces by the use of durable, low-maintenance surface materials such as concrete or brick pavers; scored, colored concrete; or painted concrete.
Pedestrian connections to adjacent developments should be provided.
706.13.3 B Vehicular Access: Developments should make maximum use of internal cross-easements and shared access points when possible. Main driveways and drive aisles shall provide a continuous system that connects to the main site entrance. Commercial developments are encouraged to provide means of access to residential areas that avoid requiring residents to use arterial streets for short-distance trips. Such connections must be
City of Jackson Zoning Ordinance  August 26, 2019 Page 109
designed to avoid channeling commercial traffic onto residential streets outside of comprehensively planned, mixed use projects. When possible, shared service and delivery access should be provided between adjacent parcels and buildings.

708- A Old Capitol Green Mixed Use District
708.01-A Purpose of OG MU District - The purpose and intent of the Old Capitol Green Mixed Use District (hereinafter referred to as OCG-MUD) is to develop within the Central Business District of the City of Jackson an area unique with sustainable, energy efficient and environmentally friendly technologies that creates a sense of place where people will live, work, and play. The OCE-MUD is designed to protect the public health, safety, general welfare and environmental health of downtown Jackson. The Mixed Use District will be a mixed-use area with an improved pedestrian environment that creates supportive green public spaces, promotes healthy physical activities and supports creative arts. The intent of the OCG-MUD is to encourage the integration of residential, commercial, recreational, arts and retail markets in Downtown while at the same time introducing green, energy efficient, and eco-friendly techniques and materials to sustain a healthier and vibrant living, working and recreational environment. In creating a sustainable development, OCG-MUD will meet the needs of the present environment without comprising the ability of the future generations to meet their own needs. The OCG-MUD is compatible with the Downtown Regional Mixed Use Center found in the Land Use Plan portion of Jacksons Comprehensive Plan.
The business intent of OCG-MUD is to encourage and enable the creation of complimentary commercial, residential, arts and educational uses scaled to form a cohesive urban fabric and foster long-term sustainable growth in Downtown Jackson. This new fabric will create street walls with retail businesses along major pedestrian routes, public and private courtyards and squares to maximize year round use of outdoor spaces, sidewalk vending and dining, outdoor performance spaces, curbside on-street parking, and multi-deck parking garages with roof top green space. Above the street wall setbacks, the intent will be to create residential uses with specific height and density minimums and maximums. The OCG-MUD when paired with the OCG Master Plan will create new focal points for pedestrian, for artistic activity and commercial activity and contribute to creating a vibrant 24-hour downtown to support other public and private investment in the downtown Jackson community. The OCG-MUD and OCG Master Plan will encourage development around public plazas, street medians, and park nodes. This strategy will serve to ensure the appropriate density and mix of residential, commercial, retail, and public green spaces throughout the District. The scale of all buildings will be complimentary one to another and provide a transition axis between intensive commercial areas and low, medium and high-density residential uses. While at the same time creating the potential for exciting contemporary architecture, the zoning district will respect Jacksons architectural past. These regulations shall apply to all new development and to all enlargements, alterations, or changes of use of existing buildings within the district.

1. Pre-Application Conference(s)
2. Master Development Plan and Rezoning Application submitted
3. Planning Board Public Hearing (Recommendation on rezoning and approval of Master Development Plan)
4. Revision of Site Plan Review (if needed)
5. City Council Hearing (officially rezone land)
6. Construction Plans Approval (Subdivision Review Engineer)
7. Final Plat Approval and Dedication of Streets (City Council)

B. Specifics of Approval Process
The procedure for the rezoning aspect of a TND is the same as that outlined in Article XVII Rezoning (Map Amendments). The rezoning application must be accompanied by the Master Development Plan and verification of the pre-application conference with the Site Plan Review Committee. The specific development requirements and procedures for the subdivision can be found in the Subdivision Ordinance.

(e) Changes in non-residential floor plans, of up to five (5%) percent of the total floor area, which do not alter the character of the use or increase the amount of required parking
2. Major Use Change - A major use change is one that will have significant impacts on the approved Uses within the Traditional Neighborhood Development, or on the site surrounding the Traditional Neighborhood Development. This type of change will be subject to a regulatory review and approval process.
3. Major Site Change - A major site change is one that that will have significant impact on the site and layout of the development in the Traditional Neighborhood Development, or on the site surrounding the Traditional Neighborhood Development.

1104.15.4 Criteria
1104.15.4.1 Site Design Objectives
1. Sites should be developed in a coordinated manner to complement adjacent structures through placement, architecture, colors, and size/mass.
2. Whenever possible, buildings on the same site should be clustered and incorporate plazas, courtyards, pocket parks, and other pedestrian use areas.
3. Sites should be designed to avoid the appearance of domination by automobiles. Positive methods to achieve this concept include:
? Orienting buildings to fronting streets and placing parking at the rear and/or sides;
? Designing the required parking area into smaller, discrete, connected lots rather than large, single-use lots;
? Convenience food stores, and/or gas stations shall be designed so that a traditional building front shall be the primary façade facing the street and gas islands with accompanying protective awnings shall be located on the site so that their presence will not dominate the site. This will require gas islands/canopies to be located in the rear of the building or to the side of the building in such a manner that their presence is not the dominate presence when viewed from the street.
? Restaurants with drive through windows shall have the window and other accompanying apparatus located in such a manner so as to not be visible from the street.
? Providing well-defined pedestrian walkways through parking areas and from public sidewalks into the site. Well-defined walkways use pavers, changes in color, texture, and composition of paving materials and vertical plantings such as trees and shrubs. The minimum width of walkways shall be five feet.
? Parking areas shall be designed to be partially screened from view from adjacent streets and building occupants. Screening can be accomplished through a number of methods including:
? Orienting buildings away from parking areas
? Placing buildings between streets and parking lots
City of Jackson Zoning Ordinance  August 26, 2019 Page 179
? Using extensive landscape screening, berms, and architecturally treated walls.
All measures should be designed to accomplish the intended screening while allowing adequate safety and surveillance of the parking areas.
4. Sites shall incorporate transit compatible designs where appropriate. Transit compatibility means designs that are pedestrian oriented, provide safe and convenient access to transit facilities, and foster efficient transit service.
5. Where appropriate, site plans shall be designed to provide vehicle and pedestrian connections with adjacent sites.
1104.15.4.2 Building Design Objectives
1. No single architectural style is required. However, reliance on or use of standardized corporate or franchise style is strongly discouraged. Buildings should reflect an individual design that has considered site location, conditions, and surrounding development.
2. Building design should provide a sense of permanence and timelessness. High quality construction and materials should be used to ensure that buildings will not look dated or worn down over time. Building designs should reflect an individual style and form and not merely current trends.
3. A consistent visual identity shall be applied to all sides of buildings visible to the general public. In these areas, all building sides shall have an equivalent level of quality of materials, detailing, and window placement. Abrupt ending of architectural details shall be avoided with no radical change in details or features or materials.
4. Long blank walls are to be avoided. Positive methods to achieve this objective include changes in colors and materials, placement of windows, use of awnings and canopies, and architectural details and features such as corners, setbacks and offsets. Windows at ground level may be tinted; however, reflective and mirrored windows are not allowed.
5. Buildings facing streets shall incorporate pedestrian-scaled entrances. Pedestrian scaled entrances are those that provide an expression of human activity or use in relation to building size. Doors, windows, entrances, and other features should be designed to respond to the size of the human body and not give the appearance of anonymity or overwhelming the buildings users.
6. Modulation (defined as a measured setback or offset in a building face) shall be incorporated to reduce overall bulk and mass of buildings. The planes of exterior walls should not run in one (1) continuous direction more than 50 to 60 feet without an offset or setback.
7. Large buildings should have height variations to give the appearance of distinct elements.
8. Building design shall incorporate traditional building materials such as masonry, stone, heavy timbers, brick, and other natural appearing materials.
9. Building colors should accent, blend with, or complement surroundings. Bright or brilliant colors should be reserved for trim and accents.
10. Landscape areas or planting beds having a minimum width of five (5) feet should be provided around perimeters to separate buildings from surrounding pavement areas.
City of Jackson Zoning Ordinance  August 26, 2019 Page 180
11. Outdoor storage areas, mechanical equipment, utility vaults, and trash receptacles must not be visible from adjacent streets and pedestrian walkways.
12. Outdoor mechanical equipment shall be appropriately screened from view. The method of screening shall be architecturally integrated with the building with respect to materials, color, shape, and size.
13. Site services should be located on the least visible side of a building or site or within interior building spaces.
14. Ground level outdoor enclosures shall be composed of materials similar to the main structure.
15. Materials used for site features such as fences, screen walls, and signs should be appropriate to the zone district where the development is located and should complement building design through materials, color, shape, and size.
16. Developments should provide transition with adjacent uses especially regarding building location, size and scale. No single building or development should dominate adjacent uses in terms of size, bulk, view blockage, or shading.
1104.15.4.3 Sign Objectives
1. Building Signs
? Individual letters rather than cabinet signs are preferred.
? Backlit individual letters are a preferred alternative.
? Sign colors should be coordinated with building colors.
? Signs should be compatible in scale and proportion with building design and other signs.
? A specific sign program or concept should be designed for multiple tenant buildings or complexes. Color and letter style shall be coordinated when businesses share the same building and consistent sign patterns placement on buildings) shall be utilized.
? Exposed neon tubes are acceptable for non-letter sign elements but are discouraged for letters.
2. Freestanding Signs
? All signs shall be ground-mounted signs whose overall height shall not exceed six (6) feet.
? Freestanding signs should provide only name and address of the building and/or building tenants.
? Freestanding signs shall not be internally illuminated.
? Project landscaping should be designed to incorporate freestanding signs.
1104.15.4.4 Landscaping Objectives
1. Provide unity of design through repetition of plants and coordination with adjacent developments.
2. Landscape materials should be hardy and adaptable to local conditions, easily maintained, and drought tolerant. Use of native plants is strongly encouraged.
3. The design for parking areas shall include deciduous and evergreen trees to provide shade and break up expanses of asphalt. One tree, a minimum of 2½ -3 inch caliper at the time of planting, shall be required for every 5 parking spaces. There should be no more than 10 spaces between landscape islands or medians.
City of Jackson Zoning Ordinance  August 26, 2019 Page 181
4. Landscape islands or medians shall have no dimension narrower than five (5) feet.
5. Interior landscaping is required for parking lots containing ten or more spaces at a ratio of 20 square feet of landscape area for every 100 square feet of parking area. All landscaped areas should be protected by wheel stops or curbing, or be of sufficient width to prevent damage to plants by overhanging vehicles.
6. Existing vegetation should be incorporated into overall site design.
7. Landscaped areas shall be irrigated by mechanical sprinkler systems.
8. Required perimeter setback areas shall be densely landscaped with a combination of trees and shrubs, which form a 90 percent ground cover within three years of planting.
9. Required landscaping shall include a combination of trees and shrubs as follows:
? For every 20 square feet of landscaped area: three (3) shrubs and either one (1) deciduous tree, 2½ to 3 inch caliper at time of planting, or one (1) evergreen tree, having a minimum height of 10 feet at the time of planting.
? Tree spacing shall be as follows: Perimeter areas around parking lots 20 to 30 feet on center; other perimeter areas 30 feet on center.
? Interior site landscaping is required to define pedestrian ways, enclose outdoor gathering and seating areas, and reduce building mass.
10. Architectural features such as low walls, fountains, and sculptures may be used in places where planting areas are limited or restricted.
11. Project entrances should be enhanced through changes in paving materials such as brick pavers, textured and colored concrete, providing entry structures and unity in planting of trees and shrubs.
12. Individual trees along walkways and along sidewalks in the internal portions of projects should be planted in tree wells or planter boxes.
13. Open storm water detention facilities should be incorporated into project landscaping and open space where geographically feasible.
14. Open storm water detention facilities shall be landscaped and screened.
1104.15.4.4 Lighting Objectives

Procedure to follow in using the Shared Parking Calculations Table
1. Applications shall be reviewed by the Zoning Administrator and either approved or denied within thirty (30) days; said approval may establish conditions and limitations.
A. Calculate the number of spaces required for each individual use of the mixed use building or building using the minimum on-site parking requirements in 1108-A.
B. Multiply the number of spaces required for each individual use for each of the six (6) time periods by the percentages found in each use and time slot. This will give you the amended number of spaces required.
C. Add the number of spaces required for all land uses to obtain a total parking requirement for each time period.
The total required parking for the time period with the highest total parking requirement is the total required off-street parking needed for the entire development.
City of Jackson Zoning Ordinance  August 26, 2019 Page 195
2. Pursuant to the same procedure and subject to the same limitations and requirements by which the shared off-street parking plan was approved and filed, any parking plan may be amended or withdrawn, either partially or completely, if all land and structures remaining under the parking plan comply with all the conditions and limitations of the parking plan and all land and structures withdrawn from the plan comply with all regulations established by this Ordinance unrelated to off-site or shared off-street parking.

ARTICLE XIII-A NON-CONFORMING USE OF LANDS AND/OR STRUCTURES
1301-A Purpose of Regulation
Within the districts established by this Ordinance, it is recognized that the following residentially, commercially and industrially zoned properties exist:
1. Undeveloped lots as defined in this Ordinance;
2. Buildings and structures; and
3. Buildings and premises in combination which were lawful before this Ordinance was adopted, but which would be prohibited, regulated, or restricted under the terms of this Ordinance. To eliminate as many of the elements of undue hardship as possible in such cases, it is the intent of this Ordinance to permit these non-conformities to continue until they are removed, but not to encourage their survival
1302-A Non-Conforming Structure
Any non-conforming structure which was lawful before the adoption of this Ordinance may continue to be used as long as it is adequately maintained and does not constitute a public hazard or nuisance, and provided that it is not expanded, extended, enlarged in
City of Jackson Zoning Ordinance  August 26, 2019 Page 203
floor area, or changed in basic structural design and integrity. Non-conforming structures may be improved to an extent not exceeding fifty percent (50%) of the current market value of the existing structure. Nothing in this Ordinance shall prevent the strengthening or restoring to a safe condition of any portion of a building or structure declared unsafe by proper authority. (Cross references: 602.08.4(a); 702.05.01(a) and 707.08-A)
1302.01-A Termination of Non-Conforming Structure:
Any non-conforming structure which is partially destroyed or damaged by fire, accident, or natural causes beyond sixty percent (60%) of its current market value shall thereafter conform to the regulations of this Ordinance for the district in which it is located.
Any non-conforming structure which has been improved and altered to comply with the provisions of this Ordinance shall be considered as conforming.
1303-A Non-Conforming Use of Structures and Premises
Any non-conforming use of buildings and land which was lawful before the adoption of this Ordinance may be continued, and provided further that these regulations shall not be construed to require a change in plans, construction, or designated use of any building or land upon which construction and/or other improvements were lawfully begun prior to the effective date of adoption of this Ordinance.
1303.01-A Limitations:
A non-conforming use shall not be expanded, extended or enlarged in floor area, or changed to another non-conforming use. Structures housing a non-conforming use may be improved to an extent not exceeding fifty percent (50%) of the current market value of the existing structure.
1303.02A Termination of Non-Conforming Use:
When use of either the premises and/or structure, in regard to its zoning classification, and not otherwise, ceases for a period of more than six (6) consecutive months, any subsequent use shall conform to the regulations of this Ordinance for the district in which it is located; unless prior to the expiration of the said six (6) month period, the owner shall have applied to the Zoning Administrator for an extension of the non-conforming status, which extension shall not be unreasonably withheld.
Structures housing non-conforming uses when partially destroyed or damaged by fire, accident, or natural causes beyond sixty percent (60%) of its current market value shall thereafter conform to the regulations of this Ordinance for the district in which it is located. Removal or destruction of the structure beyond sixty percent (60%) of its current market value shall also eliminate non-conforming use of the land, the existence or nonexistence of lease obligations, as well as any contingency clauses therein permitting termination of such lease.
City of Jackson Zoning Ordinance  August 26, 2019 Page 204
1303.03-A Amortization of Non-Conforming Use:
Any adult arcade, adult bookstore, adult cabaret, adult entertainment establishment, adult motel, or adult motion picture theater, as defined in this Ordinance, in existence at the time of adoption of this Ordinance which violates or does not conform to the provisions hereof (hereafter, a "pre-existing, non-conforming business") shall conform to the provisions of this Ordinance within a period of three (3) years from said adoption of this Ordinance.
The City Planning Board may grant an extension of time for continued operation after the conclusion of this grace period if the owner of the pre-existing, non-conforming business proves that he is unable to recoup his investment in such enterprise by that date. In order to secure an extension of time, the owner must submit to the City Planning Board a written request for such extension at least sixty (60) days prior to the expiration of the three (3) year grace period. No application for extension received by the City Planning Board after such time shall be considered. This information shall be supported by relevant documentary evidence such as financial statements and tax records. Copies of such documentary evidence must be attached to the request for extension, and refusal or failure to provide this information as required shall constitute a waiver of the right to seek an extension of time in which to operate.
Such written request shall set forth the following information:
A. The amount of the owner's investment in the pre-existing, non-conforming business through the effective date of this Ordinance;
B. The amount of such investment that has been or will have been realized at the conclusion of the three-year grace period;
C. The life expectancy of the existing enterprise;
D. The existence or nonexistence of lease obligations, as well as any contingency clauses therein permitting termination of such lease.
The City Planning Board shall notify an applicant for an extension of time of the time and place of a hearing to be held on such request before the City Planning Board. After such hearing, the City Planning Board shall issue a written order on the request for extension. If the owner desires to appeal the City Planning Board's order, said appeal may be taken by following the procedures for appeal to the City Council pursuant to the provisions of the Zoning Ordinance of Jackson, Mississippi, as amended. Extensions that are granted shall specify a date certain for closure and not be valid for operation at any other location.
1303.04-A Catastrophic Provision:
In the event of a natural disaster of catastrophic proportions, non-conforming uses may be continued, where such continuance is declared to be in the public interest by the City Council, though existing structures and other improvements on the premises of the non-conforming use have suffered damages exceeding sixty percent (60%) of their market value.
