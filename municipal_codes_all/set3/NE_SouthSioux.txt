PREFACE 
    This Code constitutes a complete recodification of the general and permanent ordinances of the City of South Sioux City, Nebraska. 
    Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the 1975 Code, as supplemented through January 8, 1991, and ordinances subsequently adopted by the mayor and city council. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this Code, the reader can locate any section of the 1975 Code, as supplemented, and any subsequent ordinance included herein. 
    The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order, and the various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Notes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state law have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this Code. 
Chapter and Section Numbering System 
    The chapter and section numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and local government codes. Each section number consists of two parts separated by a dash. The figure before the dash refers to the chapter number, and the figure after the dash refers to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the second section of chapter 1 is numbered 1-2, and the first section of chapter 6 is 6-1. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter, and at the same time new sections can be inserted in their proper place by using the decimal system for amendments. For example, if new material consisting of one section that would logically come between sections 6-1 and 6-2 is desired to be added, such new section would be numbered 6-1.5. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject. The next successive number shall be assigned to the new article or division. New chapters may be included by using one of the reserved chapter numbers. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. 
Page Numbering System 
    The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the volume. The number to the right of the colon represents the number of the page in that portion. In the case of a chapter of the Code, the number to the left of the colon indicates the number of the chapter. In the case of an appendix to the Code, the letter immediately to the left of the colon indicates the letter of the appendix. The following are typical parts of codes of ordinances, which may or may not appear in this Code at this time, and their corresponding prefixes: 
CODE CD1:1 CODE APPENDIX CDA:1 CODE COMPARATIVE TABLES CCT:1 STATE LAW REFERENCE TABLE SLT:1 CODE INDEX CDi:1  
Index 
    The index has been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the index itself which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which the user is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
    A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up-to-date. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited, and the affected page or pages will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
    Keeping this publication up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. As revised pages are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
Acknowledgments 
    This publication was under the direct supervision of James S. Vaught, Supervising Editor, and John Welch, Editor, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida. Credit is gratefully given to the other members of the publisher's staff for their sincere interest and able assistance throughout the project. 
    The publisher is most grateful to Mr. Lance Hedquist, City Administrator, Ms. Brenda Westphalen, City Clerk/Treasurer, and Mr. Wayne E. Boyd, City Attorney, for their cooperation and assistance during the progress of the work on this publication. It is hoped that their efforts and those of the publisher have resulted in a Code of Ordinances which will make the active law of the city readily accessible to all citizens and which will be a valuable tool in the day-to-day administration of the city's affairs.

DIVISION 11. - DRUG AND ALCOHOL POLICY 

Sec. 2-361. - Statement of purpose. 
(a)  The city recognizes its responsibilities toward the maintenance of the physical and emotional well-being of its employees. It is recognized that employee drug/alcohol problems are inherent in any work force and that this, in turn, impacts on the personal life of employees and their families. Since these problems not only affect the employee's personal life but can also result in deteriorating job performance, the city believes that it is in the best interest of its employees, their families, and the city to provide the opportunity to deal with these personal problems. 
(b)  There is no intent to intrude upon the private lives of employees. The city recognizes that employees with drug and alcohol abuse problems make up only a fraction of the work force, and the city understands that inconveniences may be caused to the many nonabusers by the problems of a few. It is believed, however, that the benefits to be derived will more than make up for any inconvenience to the majority of employees. 
(c)  The purpose of this division is to: 
(1)  Establish and maintain a safe, healthy, working environment for all employees. 
(2)  Ensure the reputation of city employees as good, responsible citizens worthy of public trust. 
(3)  Reduce the incidents of accidental injury to person or property. 
(4)  Reduce absenteeism, tardiness and indifferent job performance. 
(5)  Provide assistance toward rehabilitation for any employee who seeks the city's help in overcoming any addiction to, dependence upon or problem with alcohol or drugs. 
(d)  The city is committed to maintaining a safe, healthful and productive work environment for all employees and to ensure the safe and efficient delivery of services to the citizens of the city. To that end the city will attempt to eliminate the abuse of alcohol, illegal drugs, prescription drugs or any other substance that could impair an employee's ability to perform safely and effectively the functions of any given job. All city employees are covered by this division and should be aware that violation of this division can result in discipline up to and including discharge. 
(Code 1975, § 1-1501) 
Sec. 2-362. - Definitions. 
    The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this division, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this section, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning: 
    Alcohol means any product of distillation of any fermented liquid, whether rectified or diluted, whatever may be its origin, synthetic ethyl alcohol, the four varieties of liquor defined in R.R.S. 1943, § 53-103(2)-(5), alcohol, spirits, wine, and beer, every liquid or solid, patented or not, containing alcohol, spirits, wine, or beer, and alcohol used in the manufacture of denatured alcohol, flavoring extracts, syrups, or medicinal, mechanical, scientific, culinary, and toilet preparations. 
    Alcohol or drug abuse means an employee's dependence or addiction of sufficient severity to have the effect of impairing the performance of his official duties or his job behavior. 
    Drug means any substance, chemical or compound as described, defined or delineated in R.R.S. 1943, §§ 28-405 and 28-419 or any metabolite or conjugated form of such substance, chemical or compound; except that any substance, chemical or compound containing any product as defined in the term "alcohol" may also be defined as alcohol. 
    E.A.P. means the employee assistance program provided by the city for the benefit of its employees. 
    Impaired means the inability of an employee to perform his usual and normal work assignments with normal effectiveness and efficiency. 
    Reasonable suspicion is a belief based on objective facts sufficient to lead a reasonably prudent person to suspect that an employee is under the influence of a substance so that the employee's ability to perform the functions of the job is impaired or that the employee's ability to perform his job safely is reduced. Reasonable suspicion may result from actual observation of the use or ingestion of a substance by an employee. It may be based on reliable information that the employee is currently using or possessing or has recently used or possessed a controlled substance or open container with alcohol on the job. Reasonable suspicion may result from an observation of physical symptoms such as slurred speech; red, watery eyes; unsteady gait; dilated pupils; and drowsiness or actual sleeping on the job. In addition, reasonable suspicion may result from the observation of behavioral symptoms such as severe mood swings, unexplained personality changes, inattention to personal hygiene, and frequent accidents. 
(Code 1975, § 1-1502) 
Cross reference- Definitions generally, § 1-2. 
Sec. 2-363. - Prohibited acts. 
(a)  Generally. Abuse of alcohol and drugs by city employees will not be tolerated. 
(b)  Drugs. 
(1)  Employees of the city shall not: 
a.  Report to work impaired by any drug. 
b.  Whether on or off duty, use, manufacture, possess, sell or provide to another any drug. 
(2)  Use or possession of medically prescribed drugs or medications, that have been legally prescribed to the employee by a person licensed to do so is not a violation of this division. However, no prescription medication of any sort shall be brought upon city property by any person other than the person for whom the medication is prescribed and shall be used only in the manner, combination and quantity prescribed. 
(3)  A city employee who is taking any medication, whether prescribed or nonprescribed, that may interfere with the safe and effective performance of the duties or operation of city equipment is required to advise his supervisor of that fact before beginning work. If there is a question regarding an employee's ability to safely and effectively perform assigned duties while using such medication, clearance from a physician shall be required. Failure to advise a supervisor of the use of any medication that may interfere with the safe and effective performance of duties or operation of city equipment may result in discipline. 
(4)  Any employee who is convicted of a violation of any criminal drug statute for an incident occurring in the workplace shall notify the city of the conviction within five calendar years of the conviction. If the city department in which the convicted employee is assigned receives any grant funding from the federal government, the conviction is to be reported by the city to the granting agency within ten days of receiving notice of the conviction.

(1)  Employees of the city shall not: 
a.  Report to work impaired by the use of alcohol. 
b.  On duty, use, possess, sell or provide to another alcohol. 
c.  While on duty or on call, be impaired by the use of alcohol. On call means that situation in which an employee has been specifically and personally notified that he is on standby for a specific period of time (not to exceed 72 hours) and subject to being called in for city work on any emergency basis. Such notification must occur either at the end of an employee's work shift before the employee leaves work or either eight hours before any call-in would occur. 
(2)  For the purposes of this division, an employee whose blood, breath or urine, when tested, contains an alcohol concentration of five percent or above is presumptively deemed to be impaired by the use of alcohol. For the purposes of this division, an employee whose blood, breath or urine, when tested, contains an alcohol concentration of less than five percent may be considered impaired, depending on a consideration of all of the circumstances. 
(Code 1975, § 1-1503) 
Sec. 2-364. - Education and training of employees. 
(a)  The city will develop and implement a drugfree awareness program to inform its employees of the: 
(1)  Dangers of drug/alcohol abuse in the workplace. 
(2)  City's policy regarding drug and alcohol use. 
(3)  Availability of counseling, rehabilitation, etc., through the city's E.A.P. program. 
(4)  Penalties that may be imposed upon employees for substance abuse violations. 
(b)  Additionally, educational activities focusing on stress, substance abuse, and other problem areas may also be provided. These activities are designed to promote early identification and self-referral, to prevent problems from developing and/or becoming more severe, and to enhance the quality of life. 
(c)  Employees are encouraged to utilize the E.A.P. programs provided by the city in seeking assistance with drug/alcohol problems. Employees' use of these services privately and on their own initiative will not jeopardize job security, promotional opportunity and/or reputation. When such use is private and voluntary, no report of any kind will be made by the E.A.P. to the city unless the employee freely and willingly chooses. 
(d)  The city will develop and implement a program of training to assist supervisory personnel and the union in the recognition of conduct and behavior that gives rise to suspicion that an employee may be a drug/alcohol abuser. The intent of this training is not to put the supervisor in a position to diagnose alcohol/drug problems, but simply to make such supervisors sufficiently aware of the causes and symptoms that they may seek proper referral. Such training program shall also inform the supervisors of the city's E.A.P. policies and encourage the supervisor to seek proper consultation with other city officials and the E.A.P. when attempting to deal with employees deteriorating job performance. 
(Code 1975, § 1-1504) 
Sec. 2-365. - Testing procedures. 
(a)  Any time a supervisor has reasonable suspicion to believe an on-duty employee is impaired by alcohol or drugs, he shall immediately place such employee on special assignment in order to protect the employee, fellow employees and the public from harm. The supervisor shall immediately notify his supervisor of such action and the particular employee's union representative. 
(b)  Both supervisors and the union representative, if available, will interview the employee and if both supervisors believe, based upon reasonable suspicion, that the employee is impaired by the use of alcohol or drugs; then the employee will be ordered, pursuant to this division, to submit to a test of his blood, breath or urine. In determining whether or not the employee is impaired, the supervisors shall consult with the labor relations director, personnel director, safety inspectors, law department, or any other appropriate city official and utilize any reasonable means or procedures available to confirm or disprove such suspicion. 
(c)  A supervisor shall transport the employee to that facility designated by the city for the performance of drug or alcohol tests. As soon as practically possible after the administration of such test, each supervisor shall document to the department head the reasons and causes that give rise to the reasonable suspicion. Additionally this documentation shall include a narrative of what steps where taken by the supervisor. 
(d)  Before a drug or alcohol test is administered, employees will be ordered to sign a consent form authorizing the test and permitting release of test results to designated city officials. The consent form shall provide space for employees and applicants to acknowledge that they have been notified of the city's drug/alcohol testing policy. 
(e)  The consent form for drug tests shall also set forth the following information: 
(1)  The procedure for confirming an initial positive test result. 
(2)  The consequences for a confirmed positive test result. 
(3)  The consequences of refusing to undergo a drug test. 
(f)  The initial drug screening shall be the enzyme immunoassay techniques (EMIT) test which shall be administered at city expense. An employee or job applicant whose drug test indicates the presence of a drug group listed further in subsection (n) of this section shall be given a second test, at city expense, using a gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) test. The second test shall use a portion of the same test sample withdrawn from the employee or applicant for use in the first test. If this GC/MS test confirms the drug group presence, both tests will be reviewed by a medical review officer, who shall be a properly licensed and trained medical doctor. The purpose of this review is to see if the drug presence can be explained by the individual employee's medical history. In completing this review, the medical review officer shall interview the employee and may perform a physical examination on such employee. Refusal to cooperate in such an interview or to consent to such physical examination shall be grounds for disciplinary action up to and including termination. 
(g)  If the medical review confirms the presence of drugs in the employee's body fluids, such test shall be considered positive. The employee or applicant shall be notified confidentially in a sealed envelope so marked of the results in writing by the appropriate department head or designee using a standard form. The letter of notification shall identify the particular substance found. 
(h)  An employee who tests positive for drugs may, at the employees' own expense, have a third test conducted on the same sample at a laboratory selected and preapproved by the city meeting minimum criteria for drug testing. If the test is for alcohol and the city orders a breath test, the employee has the right to another test. That test may be for blood, breath or urine. 
(i)  If an employee refuses to consent to drug or alcohol testing, such refusal shall be considered grounds for discipline up to and including termination of employment. An employee who refuses shall be immediately and indefinitely suspended with pay pending disciplinary action. The supervisor shall make every reasonable effort to ensure that such employee does not operate a motor vehicle (i.e. provide transportation for employee to his home). Should the employee refuse to cooperate, and attempts to operate a motor vehicle, the police shall be immediately notified. 
(j)  When an alcohol or drug test is administered, the employee shall continue on special assignment until test results are available. In no event shall such employee be allowed to operate a motor vehicle or any city equipment during this period. Final test results shall be reported directly and immediately to the department head or his designee. If the results and the facts of the particular case indicate impairment from alcohol, or are positive for drugs, the employee shall be immediately and indefinitely suspended with pay. The city shall make every reasonable effort to ensure that such employee does not operate a motor vehicle (i.e. provide transportation for employee to his home). Should the employee refuse to cooperate, and attempts to operate a motor vehicle, the police shall be immediately notified. 
(k)  At all stages of this drug/alcohol testing process the employee's right to confidentiality will be respected and maintained as much as reasonably possible. Only those persons with a need to know are to be informed of the test results. Disclosure of test results to any other person, agency or organization is prohibited unless written authorization is obtained from the employee. All records relating to the taking of a drug/alcohol test or the order to take a drug/alcohol test shall be deemed confidential unless written authorization has been obtained freely and willingly from the employee or the records become the subject of a personnel board or arbitration hearing or judicial proceeding. All records relating to the taking or ordering of a drug/alcohol test shall be kept in a separate file. Each department head shall implement procedures to prevent the unauthorized distribution of the results of an order to take such a test. 
(l)  The facility designated by the city will be licensed pursuant to the Federal Clinical Laboratories Improvement Act of 1967, 42 USC 263a, or be accredited by the College of American Pathologists. The above does not apply for breath tests. Any breath-testing device shall conform to the rules and regulations of the state department of health, and the operators of such devices shall be persons who have obtained or been issued a permit to operate such device pursuant to the rules and regulations of the state department of health. 
(m)  The facility designated by the city shall use strict chain of custody procedures that ensure proper identification, labeling and handling of test samples. Such samples, except for breath test specimens, that result in a finding of drugs or alcohol shall be refrigerated and preserved in a sufficient quantity for retesting for a period of at least 108 days. Furthermore, such facility shall in all respects comply with R.R.S. 1943, §§ 48-1901-48-1910, and all applicable state and federal statutes, rules and regulations. 
(n)  When drug testing is required under the provisions of this division, a urinalysis test will be given to detect the presence of the following drug groups:

(o)  Any applicant for any city job may, at the discretion of the city, be required, as a part of a preemployment physical, to undergo drug testing pursuant to this section. Any applicant who refuses such testing or who tests positive shall have his hiring process terminated. Such person will not be allowed to reapply for any city position for a period of one year. Supervisors are responsible for consistent enforcement of this division. Any supervisor who knowingly permits a violation of this division shall be subject to disciplinary action. Any nonsupervisory employee who believes that any other city employee (supervisor or nonsupervisor) is in violation of this division may report that belief by contacting the city administrator at 402-494-7500. 
(p)  In addition to the testing procedures outlined in this section and based upon reasonable suspicion and for preemployment purposes, the city will randomly test sworn police officers in the narcotics unit pursuant to previous policy. 
(Code 1975, § 1-1505) 
Sec. 2-366. - Positive test results. 
(a)  An employee who tests positive for drugs, or who is determined based upon the test or circumstances to be impaired by alcohol pursuant to the procedures outlined in section 2-365 may be subject to disciplinary action up to and including termination. Any disciplinary action shall be in conformance with appropriate labor agreements, and any due process rights employees have under those agreements will be adhered to. 
(b)  Factors to be considered in determining appropriate discipline, which may include termination, include but are not limited to the following: 
(1)  The position held by the employee and the resulting danger to the health and safety of the employee or the public by such an employee's use of controlled substances or alcohol. 
(2)  The impact of an employee's use of controlled substances or alcohol or the employee's ability to perform his job in the future. 
(3)  The employee's past job performance. 
(4)  The length of employment with the city. 
(5)  The employee's current job performance. 
(6)  The extent and nature of past disciplinary actions. A second violation of the city's policy regarding alcohol or controlled substances will generally result in termination. 
(7)  Whether the employee's conduct is scandalous to the service. 
(c)  Any sworn police officer who tests positive for drugs pursuant to this division shall be terminated. When any other employee tests positive for drugs or is impaired by alcohol, if the employee is not terminated but is either not disciplined or disciplined in some lesser manner, the employee shall be referred to the city's E.A.P. program for assessment, counseling, treatment and rehabilitation. This shall be a management referral, and as such the employee shall be required to execute the necessary medical releases so that the E.A.P. may communicate to the city whether or not such employee is in compliance with directed treatment. Failure of the employee to comply with such directives shall be considered insubordination and, as such, new and separate grounds for disciplinary action up to and including termination. 
(d)  In addition, such employees shall be required, in order to maintain their employment with the city, to submit to random testing for the consumption of alcohol or drugs for a period of time (not to exceed two years) reasonably determined based upon the circumstances of the case. Any employee who tests positive for drugs or is shown to be impaired by alcohol pursuant to this random test shall be terminated.

(1)  Incompetency, inefficiency or inattention to or dereliction of duty;

(5)  Conviction of a felony or misdemeanor tending to injure the employee's ability to effectively perform the duties of his position; or 
(6)  Any other act or failure to act that in the judgment of the commissioners is sufficient to justify the offender to be an unsuitable and unfit person to be employed in the public service. 
(c)  Disciplinary action procedure. 
(1)  No employee in the civil service who shall have been permanently appointed or inducted into civil service shall be removed, suspended, demoted or discharged except for cause and then only upon the written accusation of the fire chief or police chief, city administrator or any citizen or taxpayer. 
(2)  The written accusation shall set forth the alleged misconduct, charges or grounds for investigation against the employee. The written accusations shall be filed by the complainant with the secretary of the commission, who shall cause a copy of such written accusation to be delivered within 48 hours after the filing to the: 
a.  Police chief or fire chief; 
b.  City administrator; and, 
c.  Employee personally or by certified mail addressed to the employee at the residence address of the employee shown in the personnel records. 
The secretary of the commission shall cause a return showing such delivery or mailing to be executed and filed in the secretary's office. 
(3)  The police chief or fire chief shall have the authority to immediately suspend, with pay, an employee against whom such written accusation has been filed, pending the confirmation of suspension, or a decision of the city administrator to reinstate the employee, remove, demote, discharge or suspend the employee, with or without pay. 
(4)  Prior to any decision by the city administrator to reinstate the employee or remove, demote, discharge or suspend the employee, with or without pay, the police chief or fire chief shall within a reasonable period of time investigate the alleged misconduct, charges or grounds against the employee and explain the basis of the employer's evidence to the employee and provide the employee an opportunity to present his version of the circumstances that resulted in the filing of the written accusation. If the chief's investigation reveals other misconduct, charges or grounds, the chief shall amend the written accusation to include the other misconduct, charges or grounds by filing an amendment to the written accusation with the secretary of the commission, who shall cause a copy of such amended accusation to be delivered within 48 hours after the filing to the: 
a.  Police chief or fire chief; 
b.  City administrator; and, 
c.  Employee personally or by certified mail, addressed to the employee at the residence address of the employee shown in the personnel records. 
The secretary of the commission shall cause a return showing such delivery or mailing to be executed and filed in the secretary's office. If a police chief or fire chief is being disciplined, the city administrator shall follow the same procedures as are followed by the police chief or fire chief in disciplining employees under the act. Upon completion of this procedure and within a reasonable period of time, the police chief or fire chief shall recommend in writing to the city administrator that the alleged misconduct, charges or grounds set forth in the written accusation be deemed to be without merit; to not warrant disciplinary action; to warrant disciplinary action less severe than removal, demotion, discharge or suspension, with or without pay, such as an oral or written reprimand; or to warrant removal, demotion, discharge or suspension, with or without pay. 
(5)  Within three calendar days after receiving the written recommendation of the police chief or fire chief, the city administrator shall decide to accept the recommendation of the police chief or fire chief, or shall decide that the alleged misconduct, charges or grounds for investigation against the employee set forth in the written accusation be deemed to: 
a.  Be without merit; 
b.  Not warrant disciplinary action; 
c.  Warranty disciplinary action less severe than removal, demotion, discharge or suspension, with or without pay, such as an oral or written reprimand; or 
d.  Warrant removal, demotion, discharge or suspension, with or without pay. 
The city administrator shall file a copy of his decision within seven calendar days after receiving the written recommendation of the police chief or fire chief with the secretary of the commission, who shall cause a copy of such decision to be delivered within 48 hours after filing to the police chief or fire chief and to the employee, personally or by certified mail, addressed to the employee at the residence address of the employee shown in the personnel records. The secretary of the commission shall cause a return showing such delivery or mailing to be executed and filed in the secretary's office. 
(6)  Any employee so removed, suspended, demoted or discharged may, within ten calendar days after receiving written notice of the city administrator's decision, file a written demand for an investigation and public hearing by the commission. The employee shall file the request for the hearing with the secretary of the commission and simultaneously send a copy of the request to the city administrator. The failure to file such request with the secretary of the commission within ten calendar days of receipt of notice of the action by the city administrator shall constitute a waiver of the employee's right to review by the commission, and the city administrator's decision shall become final. 
(7)  Within three calendar days after receipt of the employee's notice of appeal, the city administrator shall cause to be mailed or delivered the following notice to the employee and secretary of the commission: 
a.  A statement of the charges; 
b.  The names of the witnesses who will be called on behalf of the city administrator and a general statement of the nature of their testimony; and, 
c.  Copies of the documents to be introduced. 
(8)  Within ten calendar days after the filing of the written demand for an investigation and public hearing by the commission, the employee shall mail or deliver the following to the city administrator and the commission: 
a.  A response to the statement of the charge(s); 
b.  The names of witnesses who will be called on behalf of the employee and a general statement of the nature of their testimony; and 
c.  Copies of the documents to be introduced. 
(9)  Upon receipt of a written demand, the commission shall conduct an investigation. The commission may be represented in such investigation and public hearing by the city attorney if authorized by the city administrator. If the city attorney does not represent the commission, the commission may be represented by special counsel appointed by the commission for any such investigation and hearing. The investigation shall consist solely of a review of the written submissions to the city administrator and employee to determine whether any individuals or documents should be subpoenaed by the commission for the subsequent public hearing before the commission ultimately to determine whether the city administrator acted in good faith for cause, which shall mean that the action was not arbitrary or capricious and was not made for political or religious reasons. 
(10)  The commission shall schedule a public hearing no less than ten nor more than 20 calendar days from the date of filing of the employee's written demand for an investigation. The commission shall notify the city administrator and employee in writing at least five calendar days prior to the date of the hearing of the date, time and place of hearing. 
(11)  The city administrator shall be permitted to appear in person and by counsel and to present his case. The city administrator may present evidence by testimony and documents and shall be permitted to cross examine the employee's witnesses. At the hearing, the employee shall be permitted to appear in person and by counsel and to present his defense. The employee may present evidence by testimony and documents and shall be permitted to cross examine the witnesses called by the city administrator. 
(12)  The commission may affirm the action taken by the city administrator if such action is supported by a preponderance of the evidence. If the commission finds that the removal, suspension, demotion or discharge was made for political or religious reasons or was not made in good faith for cause, it shall order the immediate reinstatement or re-employment of such employee in the position or employment from which such employee was removed, suspended, demoted or discharged, which reinstatement shall, if the commission in its discretion so provides, be retroactive and entitle such person to compensation and restoration of benefits and privileges from the time of such removal, suspension, demotion or discharge. 
(13)  After the hearing, in lieu of affirming the removal, suspension, demotion or discharge, the commission may modify the order of removal, suspension, demotion or discharge by directing a suspension, with or without pay, for a given period and the subsequent restoration to duty or demotion in position or pay. No later than ten calendar days after the hearing, the commission shall certify its findings in writing to the employee and to the city administrator, who shall enforce them. 
(14)  If such judgment or order be concurred in by the commission or a majority thereof, the accused or governing body may appeal to the district court. Such appeal shall be taken within 45 days after the entry of such judgment or order by serving the commission with a written notice of appeal stating the grounds and demanding that a certified transcript of the record and all papers, on file in the office of the commission affecting or relating to such judgment or order, be filed by the commission with such court. The commission shall, within ten days after the filing of such notice, make, certify, and file such transcript with and deliver such papers to the district court. The district court shall proceed to hear and determine such appeal in a summary manner. The hearing shall be confined to the determination of whether or not the judgment or order of removal, discharge, demotion, or suspension made by the commission was made in good faith for cause which shall mean that the action of the commission was based upon a preponderance of the evidence, was not arbitrary or capricious, and was not made for political or religious reasons. No appeal to such court shall be taken except upon such ground or grounds. 
If such appeal is taken by the governing body and the district court affirms the decision of the commission, the municipality shall pay to the employee court costs and reasonable attorney's fees incurred as a result of such appeal and as approved by the district court. If such appeal is taken by the governing body and the district court does not affirm the decision of the commission, the court may award court costs and reasonable attorney's fees to the employee as approved by the district court.

Sec. 2-482. - Bonds required. 
    Official bonds of the city shall be in form, joint and several, and shall be made payable to the city in such penalty as the governing body may set by resolution, which sums shall be on file at the office of the city clerk. The penalty amount on any bond shall not fall below the legal minimum, when one has been set by the state, for each particular official. All official bonds of city officials shall be executed by the principal named in such bonds and by at least two sufficient sureties who shall be freeholders of the county, or by the official as principal and by a guaranty, surety, fidelity or bonding company. No city official, while still in his official term of office, shall be accepted as surety on any other official's bond, contractor's bond, license bond or appeal bond under any circumstances. Only companies that are legally authorized to transact business in the state shall be eligible for suretyship on the bond of an official of the city. All bonds shall obligate the principal and sureties for the faithful discharge of all duties required by law of such principal, and shall inure to the benefit of the city and any persons who may be injured by a breach of the conditions of such bonds. No bond shall be deemed to be given or complete until the approval of the governing body and all sureties are endorsed in writing on the instrument by the mayor and city clerk pursuant to the said approval of the governing body. The premium on any official bond required to be given may be paid out of the general fund, or other proper city fund, upon a resolution to that effect by the governing body at the beginning of any city year. All official bonds, meeting the conditions in this section, shall be filed with the city clerk for his official records; and it shall be the duty of the city clerk to furnish a certified copy of any bond so filed upon the payment of a fee, which shall be set by resolution of the governing body. If the sureties on the official bond of any officer of the city, in the opinion of the governing body, become insufficient, the governing body may, by resolution, fix a reasonable time within which the officer may give a new bond or additional sureties as directed. If the officer should fail, refuse or neglect to give a new bond or additional sureties to the satisfaction and approval of the governing body, then the office shall, by such failure, refusal or neglect, become vacant; and it shall be the duty of the governing body to appoint a competent and qualified person to fill the office. Any official who is reelected to office shall be required to file a new bond after each election.

Such challenge shall be overruled only by a majority vote of the members of the public body. Such challenge and its disposition shall be recorded in the minutes.

This definition shall not apply to dogs utilized by law enforcement officers in the performance of their duties. The term "dangerous dog" includes any dog that according to the records of the city animal shelter, the city department of animal control, or any law enforcement agency: 
(1)  Has aggressively bitten, attacked, endangered, or inflicted severe injury on a human being on public or private property, or when unprovoked, has chased or approached a person or domestic animal upon the street, sidewalks, or any public grounds in a menacing fashion or apparent attitude of attack, provided that such actions are attested to in a sworn statement by one or more persons and dutifully investigated by any of the above-referenced authorities; 
(2)  Has more than once severely injured or killed a domestic animal while off the owner's property; or 
(3)  Has been used primarily or in part for the purpose of dog fighting, or is a dog trained for dog fighting.

    Direct control means immediate, continuous physical control of a dog such as by means of a leash, cord, secure fence, or chain of such strength to restrain the dog and controlled by a person capable of restraining the dog, or safe and secure restraint within a vehicle.

Direct control shall not be required of dogs actually participating in a legal sport in an authorized area or to government police dogs.

    Impoundment means the taking or picking up and confining of an animal by any police officer, animal control officer or any other public officer under the provisions of this division.

a.  Inflicts a wound on a human or injures a domestic animal either on public or private property, or

(2)  Any dog with a known propensity, tendency, or disposition to attack when unprovoked, to cause injury, or to threaten the safety of humans or domestic animals; and, 
(3)  There shall be an irrefutable presumption that any pit bull dog is a potentially dangerous dog and is therefore subject to the requirements of this chapter. 
    Owner means any person, partnership, corporation or other legal entity owning, harboring or keeping any animal, or in the case of a person under the age of 18, that person's parent or legal guardian. An animal shall be deemed to be harbored if it is fed or sheltered for three or more consecutive days. This definition shall not apply to any veterinary clinic or boarding kennel.

Footnotes:

Editor's note- Ord. No. 2015-08, § I, adopted October 26, 2015, set out provisions intended for use as §§ 150.6, 150.60-150.70. For purposes of classification, and at the editor's discretion, these provisions have been included as article XV, §§ 18-660-18-670. 

Sec. 18-660. - Establishment of rental inspection program. 
    A rental inspection program is hereby established for the City of South Sioux City, Nebraska pursuant to authority granted by Nebraska law, as adopted or amended from time to time, including, but not limited to, R.R.S. 1943, § 16-246. 
(Ord. No. 2015-08, § I, 10-26-15) 
Sec. 18-661. - Findings, purpose and intent of the rental inspection program. 
    The mayor and city council make the following findings: 
(1)  As housing ages, as determined by previous housing studies and related housing information, there is an increasing need for regular monitoring and action to maintain it and keep the city's neighborhoods in good, safe and sanitary condition and repair. 
(2)  A significant portion of the original housing and neighborhoods of the city have transitioned from owner occupied homes to rental dwellings, as determined by previous housing studies and related housing information, making consistent monitoring and necessary maintenance more difficult. 
(3)  Transition to rental properties can be a significant factor contributing to the risk of deteriorating conditions of original housing and neighborhoods of the city. 
(4)  Multi-unit residential apartment complexes have been constructed in the city in recent years. 
(5)  Failure to properly maintain multi-unit apartment complexes places multiple tenants at risk. 
(6)  In cases of both single family and multi-unit residential housing, failure to properly maintain rental property can have an adverse effect and be a significant contributing factor to the decline of entire neighborhoods. 
(7)  Tenants in rental property can face property owner resistance to needed maintenance or repairs; and tenants might be reluctant to report deficiencies to property owners, property managers, or property owner's agents. 
(8)  A program that requires regular maintenance and repair of rental dwellings to keep them in safe, sanitary, and properly maintained condition is good for tenants and neighborhoods in which such rental properties are located, and in the public interests of all residents of the city. Additionally, livable housing and well-kept neighborhoods also sustain the city's property tax base. 
(9)  The City of Sioux City, Iowa, passed municipal code section 20.05 with an effective date of July 1, 2001, which created a rental housing inspection program. Enactment of such public policy within the Siouxland metro area has permitted a disparity in the condition of rental dwellings within the corporates limits of South Sioux City, Nebraska. 
    Based on the foregoing, the mayor and city council have determined that it is desirable, appropriate, in the public interest, and therefore necessary to implement a uniform rental inspection program to maintain safe housing for tenants and safe and livable neighborhoods for South Sioux City's residents. 
    The purpose of this rental inspection program is to provide for the inspection and licensing of all rental dwellings, to promote compliance with the International Property Maintenance Code (IPMC) and other applicable laws, and to require property owners of rental dwellings, including single-family rental dwellings, to obtain licenses for the occupancy of rental dwellings. The intent of this rental inspection program includes: 
(1)  Promoting the health, safety, and welfare of the persons living in and near rental dwellings; 
(2)  Preserving of the existing housing supply and neighborhoods; 
(3)  Helping to maintain property values and the city's tax base; 
(4)  Prevent or eliminate substandard and deteriorating rental dwellings; and 
(5)  Maintain a living environment that contributes to the health, safety, and welfare of individual and family living. 
(Ord. No. 2015-08, § I, 10-26-15) 
Sec. 18-662. - Scope. 
    The rental inspection program (this article) shall apply, on and after the effective date to any rental property and/or rental dwelling within the corporate limits of the City of South Sioux City, Nebraska, and the extraterritorial zoning jurisdiction with the following exceptions:

Correction of minor code violations noted shall be deemed to be a condition of the rental license that is issued or renewed immediately following the primary inspection during which the violations were noted. If a minor code violation noted in a primary inspection exists upon primary inspection two years later, a follow-up inspection shall be required to confirm that all outstanding violations have been corrected before a rental license is issued/renewed. Major code violations shall be corrected to the satisfaction of the code official before any license is issued or renewed. 
(d)  A follow-up inspection of any major code violation will be conducted by the code official at the end of the time frame set to correct the violations and before a rental license is issued or renewed.

(f)  Additional follow-up inspections may be conducted as the code official determines necessary, including but not limited to on a complaint-basis. 
(g)  Primary inspections, follow-up inspections, and re-inspections provided for herein shall be in addition and supplemental to any other inspection or access authorized under applicable law. 
(Ord. No. 2015-08, § I, 10-26-15) 
Sec. 18-667. - Inspection access.

Sec. 66-216. - Theft. 
(a)  For purposes of this section: 
(1)  The definitions found in Neb. R.S. § 28-509 shall apply; and 
(2)  The offenses described in divisions (b) through (g) shall exist when the value of the thing involved is under $500.00. 
(b)  (1)  A person commits theft if he or she takes, or exercise control over, movable property of another with the intent to deprive him or her thereof. 
(2)  A person commits theft if he or she transfers immovable property of another or any interest therein with the intent to benefit himself or herself or another not entitled thereto. 
(3)  Except as provided for rental or lease of a motor vehicle in subsection (4) of Neb. R.S. § 28-511, it shall be presumed that a lessee's failure to return leased or rented movable property to the lessor after the expiration of a written lease or written rental agreement is done with intent to deprive if such lessee has been mailed notice by certified mail that such lease or rental agreement has expired and he or she has failed within ten days after such notice to return such property. (Neb. R.S. § 28-511) 
(c)  A person commits theft if he or she obtains property of another by deception as defined in Neb. R.S. § 28-512. (Neb. R.S. § 28-512) 
(d)  (1)  A person commits theft if he or she obtains property of another by threatening to: 
a.  Inflict bodily injury on anyone or commit any other criminal offense; 
b.  Accuse anyone of a criminal offense; 
c.  Expose any secret tending to subject any person to hatred, contempt, or ridicule, or to impair his or her credit or business repute; 
d.  Take or withhold action as an official, or cause an official to take or withhold action; 
e.  Bring about or continue a strike, boycott, or other collective unofficial action, if the property is not demanded or received for the benefit of the group in whose interest the actor purports to act; or 
f.  Testify or provide information or withhold testimony or information with respect to another's legal claim or defense. 
(2)  It is an affirmative defense to prosecution based on subdivisions (d)(1)b., c., or d. that the property obtained by threat of accusation, exposure, lawsuit, or other invocation of official action was honestly claimed as restitution or indemnification for harm done in the circumstances to which such accusation, exposure, lawsuit, or other official action relates, or as compensation for property or lawful services. (Neb. R.S. § 28-513) 
(e)  A person who comes into control of property of another that he or she knows to have been lost, mislaid, or delivered under a mistake as to the nature or amount of the property or the identity of the recipient commits theft if, with intent to deprive the owner thereof, he or she fails to take reasonable measures to restore the property to a person entitled to have it.

When compensation for service is ordinarily paid immediately upon the rendering of such service, as in the case of hotels and restaurants, refusal to pay or absconding without payment or offer to pay gives rise to a presumption that the service was obtained by deception as to intention to pay. 
(2)  A person commits theft if, having control over the disposition of services of others to which he or she is not entitled, he or she diverts such services to his or her own benefit or to the benefit of another not entitled thereto. (Neb. R.S. § 28-515)

DIVISION 3. - GRAFFITI 

Sec. 66-230. - Purpose and intent. 
(a)  The city council of South Sioux City, Nebraska, is enacting this division to help prevent the spread of graffiti vandalism and to establish a program for the removal of graffiti from public and private property. The council is authorized to enact this division pursuant to its police powers. 
(b)  The council finds that graffiti is a public nuisance and destructive of the rights and values of property owners as well as the entire community. Unless the city acts to remove graffiti from public and private property, the graffiti tends to remain. Other properties then become the target of graffiti, and entire neighborhoods are affected and become less desirable places in which to be, all to the detriment of the city. 
(c)  The city council intends, through the adoption of this division, to provide additional enforcement tools to protect public and private property from acts of graffiti vandalism and defacement. The council does not intend for this division to conflict with any existing antigraffiti state laws.

Sec. 66-235. - Removal.

(b)  By owner or city. If graffiti is not removed by the perpetrator according to subsection (a) of this section, graffiti shall be removed pursuant to the following provisions:

d.  An information sheet identifying any graffiti removal assistance programs available through the city. 
(2)  Exceptions to property owner responsibility. The removal requirements of subsection (a)(1) of this section shall not apply if the property owner or responsible party can demonstrate that: 
a.  The property owner or responsible party lacks the financial ability to remove the defacing graffiti; or 
b.  The property owner or responsible party has an active program for the removal of the graffiti as part of that program, in which case it shall be unlawful to permit such property to remain defaced with graffiti for a period of 15 days after service by first class mail of notice of defacement. 
(3)  Right of city to remove. 
a.  Use of public funds. Whenever the city becomes aware or is notified and determines that graffiti is located on publicly or privately owned property viewable from a public or quasi-public place, the city shall be authorized to use public funds for the removal of the graffiti, or for the painting or repairing of the graffiti, but shall not authorize or undertake to provide for the painting or repair of any more extensive an area than that where the graffiti is located, unless the chief of police, or the designee of the chief of police, determines in writing that a more extensive area is required to be repainted or repaired in order to avoid an aesthetic disfigurement to the neighborhood or community, or unless the property owner or responsible party agrees to pay for the costs or repainting or repairing the more extensive area. 
b.  Right of entry on private property. Prior to entering upon private property or property owned by a public entity other than the city for the purpose of graffiti removal the city shall attempt to secure the consent of the property owner or responsible party and a release of the city from liability for property damage or personal injury. If the property owner or responsible party fails to remove the offending graffiti within the time specified by this division, or if the city has requested consent to remove or paint over the offending graffiti and the property owner or responsible party has refused consent for entry on terms acceptable to the city and consistent with the terms of this section, the city shall commence abatement and cost recovery proceedings for the graffiti removal according to the provisions specified in subsection (a)(4) of this section. 
(4)  Abatement and cost recovery proceedings. 
a.  Notice of due process hearing. The city administrator, or the designee of the city administrator, serving as the hearing officer, shall provide the property owner of record and the party responsible for the maintenance of the property, if a person different from the owner, not less than 48 hours' notice of the city's intent to hold a due process hearing at which the property owner or responsible party shall be entitled to present evidence and argue that the property does not constitute a public nuisance. Notice shall be served in the same manner as a summons in a civil action. If the owner of record cannot be found after a diligent search, the notice may be served by posting a copy thereof in a conspicuous place upon the property for a period of ten days and publication thereof in a newspaper of general circulation published in the area in which the property is located. 
b.  Determination of hearing officer. The determination of the hearing officer after the due process hearing shall be final and not appealable. If, after the due process hearing, regardless of the attendance of the owner of the responsible party or their respective agents, the hearing officer determines that the property contains graffiti viewable from a public or quasi-public place, the hearing officer shall give written notice in an eradication order that unless the graffiti is removed within ten days, the city shall enter upon the property, cause the removal, painting over (in such color as shall meet with the approval of the hearing officer), or such other eradication thereof as the hearing officer determines appropriate, and shall provide the owner and the responsible party thereafter with an accounting of the costs of the eradication effort on a full cost recovery basis. 
c.  Eradication effort. Not sooner than the time specified in the order of the hearing officer, the city administrator, or the designee of the city administrator, shall implement the eradication order and shall provide an accounting to the owner and the responsible party of the costs thereof. 
d.  Cost hearing. The owner or responsible party may request a cost hearing before the hearing officer on the eradication accounting, and appropriate due process must be extended to the owner or responsible party. If following the cost hearing or, if no hearing is requested, after the implementation of the eradication order, the hearing officer determines that all or a portion of the costs are appropriately chargeable to the eradication effort, the total amount set forth in the eradication accounting, or an amount thereof determined as appropriate by the hearing officer, shall be due and payable by the owner or responsible party within 30 days. Any amount or eradication charges assessed by the hearing officer that are less than the total amount set forth in the eradication accounting shall be explained by written letter from the hearing officer to the city council. 
e.  Lien. As to such property where the responsible party is the property owner, if all of any portion of the assessed eradication charges remain unpaid after 30 days, the portion thereof that remains unpaid shall constitute a lien on the property that was the subject of the eradication effort. The city administrator shall present a resolution of lien to the city council, and upon passage and adoption thereof, shall cause a certified copy of the lien to be recorded with the register of deeds office.

In exercising the authority hereunder, the city may not impose a cost on the property owner of greater than $500.00. 
(2)  At city's cost. The owner of property used for nonresidential purposes on which is located a surface of a structure that has been defaced with graffiti more than five times in 12 months shall permit the city to enter the property and, at the city's cost, make modifications as necessary to reduce the attractiveness of the surface for graffiti, or as necessary to permit more convenient or efficient removal of graffiti.

(3)  Where by reason of exceptional narrowness, shallowness or shape of a specific piece of property at the time of the enactment of the zoning regulations or by reason of exceptional topographic conditions or other extraordinary and exceptional situation or condition of such piece of property the strict application of any zoning regulation would result in peculiar and exceptional practical difficulties to or exceptional and undue hardships upon the owner of such property, authorize, upon an appeal relating to the property, a variance from such strict application so as to relieve such difficulties or hardship if such relief may be granted without substantial detriment to the public good and without substantially impairing the intent and purpose of any ordinance or resolution.

(1)  The strict application of the zoning regulation would produce undue hardship; 
(2)  Such hardship is not shared generally by other properties in the same zoning district and the same vicinity; 
(3)  The authorization of such variance will not be of substantial detriment to adjacent property, and the character of the district will not be changed by the granting of the variance; and 
(4)  The granting of such variance is based upon reason of demonstrable and exceptional hardship as distinguished from variations for purposes of convenience, profit or caprice. 
No variance shall be authorized unless the board finds that the condition or situation of the property concerned or the intended use of the property is not of so general or recurring a nature as to make reasonably practicable the formulation of a general regulation to be adopted as an amendment to the zoning regulations. 
(e)  In exercising the powers authorized by this section, the board may reverse or affirm, wholly or partly, or may modify the order, requirement, decision or determination appealed from, and may make such order, requirement, decision or determination as ought to be made, and to that end shall have all powers of the officer from whom the appeal is taken. The concurring vote of four members of the board shall be necessary to reverse any order, requirement, decision or determination of any such city official, or to decide in favor of the applicant on any matter upon which it is required to pass under any such regulation or to effect any variation in such regulation.

new	
All deployments within the city's public rights-of-way must conform to the general design and aesthetic standards set forth in this section.

(1)City's right to propose alternative. With regard to the placement of a utility pole in the ROW, the city reserves the right to propose a technically feasible alternate to the location proposed in the application provided that such alternate location is within a 300-foot radius of the proposed location or within a distance that is equivalent to the width of the ROW in or on which the deployment is proposed, whichever is greater, which the applicant may use, provided:a.Applicant has the right to use the alternate location on reasonable terms and conditions consistent with the Act; andb.The alternate location is technically feasible and does not impose technical limits or additional costs.(2)Equipment. All equipment serving a deployment must be limited to such structures and equipment that are necessary, as determined by the applicant, in its sole discretion, for the operation of the deployment.(3)Lighting. Deployments may not be illuminated except as otherwise required for compliance with state or federal regulations. To the extent technically feasible, any lights associated with electronic equipment must be shielded from public view. This subsection does not prohibit deployments on streetlight poles, nor does it prohibit the installation of deployments designed to look like streetlight poles.(4)Signs. No deployment may bear any signs or advertising devices other than certifications, warning, or other information as required by federal or state law and/or regulation or by the city Code of Ordinances.(5)Security. All boxes, cases, covers, or similar enclosures associated with a deployment must be reasonably secured in a manner which prevents unauthorized access.(6)Utilities. All utilities serving a deployment should be installed underground to the maximum extent possible, provided doing so is technically feasible.(7)Antenna. If technically feasible, antennas must either be mounted to the top of the wireless support structure pole and aligned with the centerline of the wireless support structure or mounted to the side of the wireless support structure such that the vertical centerline of the antenna enclosure is parallel with the wireless support structure. If technically feasible, a side-mounted antenna must be placed at least 15 feet above ground level at its lowest point.(8)Cables and wires. External cables and wires related to deployments must not hang off the deployment. Excess cables or wires may not be spooled or otherwise visibly stored on or near the deployment except within the structure or other enclosure. New service lines must be undergrounded whenever technically feasible.(9)Alignment. If technically feasible, new deployments should be placed in alignment with existing trees and utility poles relative to the width of the ROW and equidistant between existing trees and utility poles, with a minimum of 15 feet separation from any existing tree.(10)Restrictions on placement. No deployment may impede, obstruct, or hinder public pedestrian or vehicular traffic; obstruct the legal use of a ROW by a utility provider; violate or conflict with city code or state or federal laws or regulations; or be placed in a manner that negatively affects the structural integrity of the associated support structure or utility pole. If technically feasible, a new structure should not be placed in line with the centerline of an entrance or window of a commercial building or residence.(11)Ground-mounted equipment. Outdoor ground-mounted equipment serving a deployment should be avoided to the greatest extent technically feasible, and any such equipment or structures mounted on the ground should be similar in character to adjacent deployments in the ROW and the surrounding environment.(12)Pole-mounted equipment. To the extent technically feasible, all deployments installed on utility poles should: (i) be installed to minimize impacts to the visual profile; (ii) be painted, color-blended, or coated in flat, non-reflective colors to reasonably match the utility pole; and (iii) must not unreasonably obstruct the view of vehicular or pedestrian traffic signals or road signs. In the case of existing wood utility poles, finishes of conduit shall be zinc, aluminum, or stainless steel, or colored to match those metal finishes, and equipment cabinets shall be the color of brushed aluminum.(13)New poles. If technically feasible, new utility poles installed to support deployments must be made of the same or similar material as existing utility poles in the immediate area.

Sec. 88-8. - Action on applications.
new	
This section is intended to codify the applicable state and federal laws and/or regulations pertaining to the reasonable periods of time the city has to act on applications. To the extent this section is inconsistent with or overruled by state and federal laws and/or regulations, the applicable laws and/or regulations govern the city's obligations.

(1)Review of small wireless facility requests. If the city fails to act on an application on or before the shot clock date for the application, as defined in this section, then the application shall be deemed approved.(2)Presumptively reasonable periods of time. The following are the presumptively reasonable periods of time for action on applications in the categories set forth below:a.Review of an application to collocate a small wireless facility using an existing structure or utility pole: 60 days.b.Review of an application to deploy a small wireless facility using a new structure: 90 days.c.If a single application seeks authorization for multiple deployments, all of which fall within a category set forth in either subsection (2)a. or subsection (2)b. of this section, then the presumptively reasonable period of time for the application as a whole is equal to that for a single deployment within that category.d.If a single application seeks authorization for multiple deployments, the components of which are a mix of deployments that fall within subsection (2)a. and deployments that fall within subsection (2)b. of this section, then the presumptively reasonable period of time for the application as a whole is 90 days.e.The denial of one or more facilities in a consolidated application does not delay processing of any other facilities in the same batch.(3)Tolling period. Unless a written agreement between the applicant and the city provides otherwise, the tolling period for an application is as set forth below.a.For an initial application to deploy small wireless facilities, if the city notifies the applicant on or before the 20th day after submission that the application is materially incomplete, and clearly and specifically identifies the missing documents or information and the specific rule or regulation creating the obligation to submit such documents or information, the shot clock date calculation will restart on the date on which the applicant submits all the documents and information identified by the city to render the application complete.b.For resubmitted applications following a notice of deficiency, the tolling period will be the number of days from:1.The day after the date when the city notifies the applicant in writing that the applicant's supplemental submission was not sufficient to render the application complete and clearly and specifically identifies the missing documents or information that need to be submitted based on the city's original request; until2.The date when the applicant submits all the documents and information identified by the city to render the application complete; but3.Only if the notice is effectuated on or before the 10th day after the date when the applicant makes a supplemental submission in response to the siting authority's request.(4)Computation of deadline to act on application. The computation of the deadline to act for a siting application is determined by counting forward, beginning on the day after the date when the application was submitted, by the number of calendar days and including any pre-application period asserted by the city; provided, that if the date calculated in this manner is a legal holiday defined by the state or city, the deadline is the next business day after such date. The term "business day" means any day that is not a legal holiday as defined by the state or city.(5)Denial of application. The city may deny a proposed collocation of a small wireless facility or installation, modification, or replacement of a utility pole if the proposed deployment would:a.Materially interfere with the safe operation of traffic control equipment or the right-of-way;b.Materially interfere with sight lines or clear zones for transportation or pedestrians;c.Materially interfere with compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act or similar federal or state standards regarding pedestrian access or movement;d.Fail to comply with reasonable and nondiscriminatory spacing requirements of general application adopted by ordinance or resolution that apply to other similar infrastructure deployments in the ROW and that concern the location of ground-mounted equipment and new utility poles. Such requirements shall not prevent a small wireless facility from serving any location; ore.Fail to comply with applicable codes of general application that do not apply exclusively to wireless facilities, including but not limited to general design and aesthetic standards that are reasonable, objective, and published in advance, as adopted on or before the date applicant submits an application.(6)Documentation of reason for denial. The city will document the basis for a denial, including the specific code provisions on which the denial was based, and send the documentation to the applicant on or before the day the city denies an application. The applicant may cure the deficiencies identified by the city and resubmit the application within 30 days of the denial without paying an additional application fee. The city will approve or deny the revised application within 30 days. Any subsequent review will be limited to the deficiencies cited in the denial.(7)Scope and effect of approval. Installation, modification, or collocation for which an application is approved pursuant to this section shall be completed within one year of the later of the completion of all make-ready work or the application approval date unless a delay is caused by the lack of commercial power or communications transport facilities at the site. In such case the applicant shall have an extension of up to nine months. The city and the applicant may also agree to an additional extension. Applications for collocations on utility poles owned, managed, or operated by the city shall be processed in a manner consistent with the Act. Approval of an application authorizes the applicant to:a.Undertake the installation, modification, or collocation; andb.Subject to applicable relocation requirements and the applicant's right to terminate at any time, operate and maintain the small wireless facilities and any associated utility pole covered by the permit for a period of not less than five years, which must be renewed for equivalent durations so long as they are in compliance with the criteria set forth in Section 37(5)(j) of the Act as such criteria existed at the time the permit was granted.(8)Authority granted; no property right or other interest created. An approval by the city authorizes an applicant to undertake only certain activities in accordance with this chapter and does not create a property right or grant authority to the applicant to impinge upon the rights of others who may already have an interest in the ROW.

Sec. 94-9. - City property; sale and conveyance. 
(a)  The city may sell and convey any real or personal property owned by the city, including park land, in such manner and upon such terms and conditions as may be deemed in the best interests of the city, except that real estate owned by the city may be conveyed without consideration to the state for state armory sites or, if acquired for state armory sites, shall be conveyed in the manner strictly as provided in R.R.S. 1943, §§ 18-1001 to 18-1006. 
(b)  The power to sell and convey any real estate owned by the city, including park land, except real estate used in the operation of public utilities and except real estate for state armory sites for the use of the state as expressly provided in subsection (a) of this section, shall be exercised by ordinance directing the conveyance of such real estate and the manner and terms thereof. Notice of such sale and the terms thereof shall be published for three consecutive weeks in a legal newspaper published in or of general circulation in the city immediately after the passage and publication of such ordinance. 
(c)  If within 30 days after the passage and publication of such ordinance a remonstrance against such sale is signed by registered voters of the city equal in number to 30 percent of the registered voters of the city voting at the last regular municipal election held therein and is filed with the governing body, the property shall not then, nor within one year thereafter, be sold. If the date for filing the remonstrance falls upon a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday, the signatures shall be collected within the 30-day period, but the filing shall be considered timely if filed or postmarked on or before the next business day. 
(d)  Upon the receipt of the remonstrance, the governing body, with the aid and assistance of the election commissioner or county clerk, shall determine the validity and sufficiency of signatures on the remonstrance. The governing body shall deliver the remonstrance to the election commissioner or county clerk by hand carrier, by use of law enforcement officials, or by certified mail, return receipt requested. Upon receipt of the remonstrance, the election commissioner or county clerk shall issue to the governing body a written receipt that the remonstrance is in the custody of the election commissioner or county clerk. The election commissioner or county clerk shall compare the signature of each person signing the remonstrance with the voter registration records to determine if each signer was a registered voter on or before the date on which the remonstrance was filed with the governing body. The election commissioner or county clerk shall also compare the signer's printed name, street and number or voting precinct, and municipal or post office address with the voter registration records to determine whether the signer was a registered voter. The signature and address shall be presumed to be valid only if the election commission or county clerk determines that the printed name, street and number or voting precinct, and city or post office address matches the registration records and that the registration was received on or before the date on which the remonstrance was filed with the governing body. The determinations of the election commissioner or county clerk may be rebutted by any credible evidence which the governing body finds sufficient. The express purpose of the comparison of names and addresses with the voter registration records, in addition to helping to determine the validity of the remonstrance, the sufficiency of the remonstrance, and the qualifications of the signer, shall be to prevent fraud, deception, and misrepresentation in the remonstrance process. Upon completion of the comparison of names and addresses with the voter registration records, the election commissioner or county clerk shall prepare in writing a certification under seal setting forth the name and address of each signer found not to be a registered voter and the signature page number and line number where the name is found, and if the reason for the invalidity of the signature or address is other than the nonregistration of the signer, the election commissioner or county clerk shall set forth the reason for the invalidity of the signature. If the election commissioner or county clerk determines that a signer has affixed his signature more than once to the remonstrance and that only one person is registered by that name, the election commissioner or county clerk shall prepare in writing a certification under seal setting forth the name of the duplicate signature and shall count only the earliest dated signature. The election commissioner or county clerk shall certify to the governing body the number of valid signatures necessary to constitute a valid remonstrance. The election commissioner or county clerk shall deliver the remonstrance and the certifications to the governing body within 40 days after the receipt of the remonstrance from the governing body. The delivery shall be by hand carrier, by use of law enforcement officials, or by certified mail, return receipt requested. Not more than 20 signatures on one signature page shall be counted. 
(e)  The governing body shall, within 30 days after the receipt of the remonstrance and certifications from the election commissioner or county clerk, hold a public hearing to review the remonstrance and certifications and receive testimony regarding them. The governing body shall, following the hearing, vote on whether or not the remonstrance is valid and shall uphold the remonstrance if sufficient valid signatures have been received.

(Code 1975, § 8-605) 
Sec. 94-231. - Surety bond. 
    Before an excavation permit as provided in this article is issued, the applicant shall deposit with the city clerk surety bond in the amount established by the council by resolution payable to the city. The surety bond must be: 
(1)  With good and sufficient surety; 
(2)  By a surety company authorized to transact business in the state; 
(3)  Satisfactory to the city attorney in form and substance; 
(4)  Conditioned upon the permittee's compliance with this article and to secure and hold the city and its officers harmless against any and all claims, judgments or other costs arising from the excavation and other work covered by the excavation permit or for which the city, the city council or any city officer may be made liable by reason of any accident or injury to persons or property through the fault of the permittee either in not properly guarding the excavation or for any other injury resulting from the negligence of the permittee, and further conditioned to fill up, restore and place in good and safe condition as near as may be to its original condition, and to the satisfaction of the street superintendent, all openings and excavations made in streets, and to maintain any street where excavation is made in as good condition for the period of 24 months after the work shall have been done, usual wear and tear excepted, as it was in before the work shall have been done. Any settlement of the surface within the two-year period shall be deemed conclusive evidence of defective backfilling by the permittee. Nothing contained in this section shall be construed to require the permittee to maintain any repairs to pavement made by the city if such repairs should prove defective. Any owner of real estate repairing or engaging another to repair his own sidewalk shall not be required to give such bond. Recovery on such bond for any injury or accident shall not exhaust the bond, but it shall in its entirety cover any or all future accidents or injuries during the excavation work for which it is given. In the event of any suit or claim against the city by reason of the negligence or default of the permittee, upon the city's giving written notice to the permittee of such suit or claim, any final judgment against the city requiring it to pay for such damages shall be conclusive upon the permittee and his surety. An annual bond may be given under this provision, which shall remain in force for one year conditioned as above, in the amount specified above and in other respects as specified above but applicable as to all excavation work in streets by the principal in such bond during the term of one year from such date. 
(Code 1975, § 8-606)

    The application for an excavation permit to perform excavation work under this article shall be accompanied with a cash deposit, made to the street superintendent for deposit with the city treasurer, a sum equal to such amounts as established by the council by resolution. Any person intending to make openings, cuts or excavations in streets may make and maintain with the city clerk a general deposit in such amount as established by the council by resolution; and the person so depositing shall not be required to make the special deposits provided in this section but shall, however, be required to comply with all other applicable provisions of this article. Any special or general deposit made under this section shall serve as security for the repair and performance of work necessary to put the street in as good a condition as it was prior to the excavation if the permittee fails to make the necessary repairs or to complete the proper refilling of the opening and the excavation work under the excavation permit. Upon the permittee's completion of the work covered by such permit in conformity with this article as determined by the street superintendent, such cash deposit shall be promptly refunded by the city to the permittee. The city may use any or all of any such deposit to pay the cost of any work the city performs to restore or maintain the street if the permittee fails to perform such work, in which event the amount refunded to the permittee shall be reduced by the amount thus expended by the city. 
(Code 1975, § 8-607) 
Sec. 94-233. - Routing of traffic. 
    The permittee shall take appropriate measures to assure that during the performance of the excavation work traffic conditions as nearly normal as practicable shall be maintained at all times so as to cause as little inconvenience as possible to the occupants of the abutting property and to the general public. The street superintendent may permit the closing of streets to all traffic for a period of time prescribed by him if in his opinion it is necessary. The permittee shall route and control traffic, including its own vehicles, as directed by the police department. The following steps shall be taken before any highway may be closed or restricted to traffic: 
(1)  The permittee must receive the approval of the street superintendent and the police department;

(4)  Where flagmen are deemed necessary by the street superintendent, they shall be furnished by the permittee at its own expense. Through traffic shall be maintained without the aid of detours, if possible. In instances in which this would not be feasible, the street superintendent will designate detours. The city shall maintain roadway surfaces of existing highways designated as detours without expense to the permittee; but if there are no existing highways, the permittee shall construct all detours at its expense and in conformity with the specifications of the street superintendent. The permittee will be responsible for any unnecessary damage caused to any highways by the operation of its equipment.

If it becomes necessary to remove an existing utility, this shall be done by its owner. No utility owned by the city shall be moved to accommodate the permittee unless the cost of such work be borne by the permittee. The cost of moving privately owned utilities shall be similarly borne by the permittee unless it makes other arrangements with the person owning the utility. The permittee shall support and protect by timbers or otherwise all pipes, conduits, poles, wires or other apparatus that may be in any way affected by the excavation work, and do everything necessary to support, sustain and protect them under, over, along or across the work. In case any pipes, conduits, poles, wires or apparatus should be damaged, they shall be repaired by the agency or person owning them; and the expense of such repairs shall be charged to the permittee, and its bond shall be liable. The permittee shall be responsible for any damage done to any public or private property by reason of the breaking of any water pipes, sewer, gas pipe, electric conduit or other utility; and its bond shall be liable.

Sec. 94-237. - Protection of adjoining property. 
    The permittee shall at all times and at its own expense preserve and protect from injury any adjoining property by providing proper foundations and taking other measures suitable for the purpose. Where in the protection of such property it is necessary to enter upon private property for the purpose of taking appropriate protective measures, the permittee shall obtain a license from the owner of such private property for such purpose. The permittee shall, at its own expense, shore up and protect all buildings, walls, fences or other property likely to be damaged during the progress of the excavation work and shall be responsible for all damage to public or private property or highways resulting from its failure to properly protect and carry out the work. Whenever it may be necessary for the permittee to trench through any lawn area, the sod shall be carefully cut and rolled and replaced after ditches have been backfilled as required in this article. All construction and maintenance work shall be done in a manner calculated to leave the lawn area clean of earth and debris and in a condition as nearly as possible to that which existed before such work began. The permittee shall not remove even temporarily any trees or shrubs that exist in parking strip areas or easements across private property without first having notified and obtained the consent of the property owner, or in the case of public property the appropriate city department or city official having control of such property. 
(Code 1975, § 8-612) 
Sec. 94-238. - Sidewalk excavations. 
    Any excavations made in any sidewalk or under a sidewalk shall be provided with a substantial and adequate footbridge over the excavation on the line of the sidewalk, which bridge shall be at least three feet wide and securely railed on each side so that foot passengers can pass over safely at all times. 
(Code 1975, § 8-613) 
Sec. 94-239. - Protective measures. 
    The permittee shall erect such fence, railing or barriers about the site of the excavation work as shall prevent danger to persons using the city streets or sidewalks, and such protective barriers shall be maintained until the work shall be completed or the danger removed. At twilight there shall be placed upon such place of excavation and upon any excavated materials or structures or other obstructions to streets suitable and sufficient lights, which shall be kept burning throughout the night during the maintenance of such obstructions.

(Code 1975, § 8-615) 
Sec. 94-241. - Care of excavated material. 
    All material excavated from trenches and piled adjacent to the trench or in any street shall be piled and maintained in such manner as not to endanger those working in the trench, pedestrians or users of the streets, and so that as little inconvenience as possible is caused to those using streets and adjoining property. Where the confines of the area being excavated are too narrow to permit the piling of excavated material beside the trench, such as might be the case in a narrow alley, the street superintendent shall have the authority to require that the permittee haul the excavated material to a storage site and then rehaul it to the trench site at the time of backfilling. It shall be the permittee's responsibility to secure the necessary permission and make all necessary arrangements for all required storage and disposal sites. 
(Code 1975, § 8-616)

(Code 1975, § 8-618) 
Sec. 94-244. - Cleanup. 
    As the excavation work progresses, all streets and private properties shall be thoroughly cleaned of all rubbish, excess earth, rock and other debris resulting from such work. All cleanup operations at the location of such excavation shall be accomplished at the expense of the permittee and shall be completed to the satisfaction of the street superintendent. From time to time as may be ordered by the street superintendent and in any event immediately after completion of the work, the permittee shall at its own expense clean up and remove all refuse and unused materials of any kind resulting from the work; and upon failure to do so within 24 hours after having been notified to do so by the street superintendent, the work may be done by the street superintendent and the cost charged to the permittee; and the permittee shall also be liable for the cost under the surety bond provided under this article. 
(Code 1975, § 8-619) 
Sec. 94-245. - Protection of watercourses.

The face of the remaining pavement shall be approximately vertical. A power-driven concrete saw shall be used so as to permit complete breakage of concrete pavement or base without ragged edges. Asphalt paving shall be scored or otherwise cut in a straight line. No piledriver may be used in breaking up the pavement. 
(Code 1975, § 8-621) 
Sec. 94-247. - Tunnels. 
    Tunnels under pavement shall not be permitted except by permission of the street superintendent and if permitted shall be adequately supported by timbering and backfilling under the direction of the street superintendent. 
(Code 1975, § 8-622) 
Sec. 94-248. - Backfilling. 
    Backfilling in any street opened or excavated pursuant to an excavation permit issued under this article shall be compacted to a degree such that the backfill will perform in a manner similar to that of the undisturbed ground in which the trench was dug. Compaction of the backfill shall be performed with the proper equipment based on the type of backfill material. Backfill shall be placed and compacted in thin lifts three to 12 inches. Acceptable lift thickness will depend on material type and compaction equipment used. Backfill placed under pavements, sidewalks, driveways or any structural sections shall be compacted to at least 95 percent of the soil's maximum dry density as determined by ASTM D698. Grassed or other noncritical areas should be compacted to at least 90 percent of the soil's maximum dry density. A minimum of one in-place field density test must be performed by an independent soils laboratory for every 150 linear feet of trench or 5,000 square feet of excavated area per two-foot backfill depth or as specified by the street superintendent to verify the backfill has been properly compacted. The test results must be provided to the street superintendent for review. The contractor is responsible to see the tests are performed and will be conducted at his expense. When water is taken from a fire hydrant for the purpose of compaction, the permittee shall assign one man to operate the hydrant and shall make certain that he had been instructed by the city water department in the operation of the hydrant. The city water department shall likewise be notified at both the beginning and end of the job so that the condition of the fire hydrants can be checked on both occasions. Any damage done to the hydrant or mains due to improper handling or construction shall be the responsibility of the permittee. Water shall be paid for by the permittee on the terms agreed upon with the city water department. 
(Code 1975, § 8-623) 
Sec. 94-249. - Backfill material. 
    The backfill material shall be approved by the street superintendent and shall in no way contain any organic materials, roots, construction debris or foreign material. The moisture content should be controlled at an optimum range to permit compaction and assure quality backfill as specified by the street superintendent. 
(Code 1975, § 8-624) 
Sec. 94-250. - Restoration of street surface. 
(a)  The permittee shall restore the surface of all streets broken into or damaged as a result of the excavation work to their original condition in accordance with the specifications of the street superintendent. The permittee may be required to place a temporary surface over openings made in paved traffic lanes. Except when the pavement is to be replaced before the opening of the cut to traffic, the fill above the bottom of the paving slab shall be made with suitable material well tamped into place; and this fill shall be topped with a minimum of at least one inch of bituminous mixture suitable to maintain the opening in good condition until permanent restoration can be made. The crown of the temporary restoration shall not exceed one inch above the adjoining pavement. The permittee shall exercise special care in making such temporary restorations and must maintain such restorations in safe traveling condition until such time as permanent restorations are made. The asphalt used shall be in accordance with the specifications of the street superintendent. If in the judgment of the street superintendent it is not expedient to replace the pavement over any cut or excavation made in the street upon completion of the work allowed under such permit by reason of the looseness of the earth or weather conditions, he may direct the permittee to lay a temporary pavement of wood or other suitable material designated by him over such cut or excavation to remain until such time as the repair of the original pavement may be properly made. 
(b)  Permanent restoration of the street shall be made by the permittee in strict accordance with the specifications prescribed by the street superintendent to restore the street to its original and proper condition, or as near as may be. 
(c)  Acceptance or approval of any excavation work by the street superintendent shall not prevent the city from asserting a claim against the permittee and its surety under the surety bond required under this article for incomplete or defective work if discovered within 24 months from the completion of the excavation work. The street superintendent's presence during the performance of any excavation work shall not relieve the permittee of its responsibilities under this article. 
(Code 1975, § 8-625) 
Sec. 94-251. - City's right to restore street surface. 
    If the permittee shall have failed to restore the surface of the street to its original and proper condition upon the expiration of the time fixed by such permit or shall otherwise have failed to complete the excavation work covered by such permit, the street superintendent, if he deems it advisable, shall have the right to do all work and things necessary to restore the street and to complete the excavation work. The permittee shall be liable for the actual cost and 25 percent of such cost in addition for general overhead and administrative expenses. The city shall have a cause of action for all fees, expenses and amounts paid out and due it for such work and shall apply in payment of the amount due it any funds of the permittee deposited as herein provided, and the city shall also enforce its rights under the permittee's surety bond provided pursuant to this article. It shall be the duty of the permittee to guarantee and maintain the site of the excavation work in the same condition as it was prior to the excavation for two years after restoring it to its original condition. 
(Code 1975, § 8-626) 
Sec. 94-252. - Restoration of paving, curb and sidewalk surfaces. 
    When the person is ready to close the opening made for a paving, curb or sidewalk excavation, he shall inform the street superintendent, who shall supervise and inspect the materials used and the work done in such closing. It shall be discretionary with the governing body to order the street superintendent to do the work of cutting and closing the paving and charge the costs to the party who obtained such permit. Before any permit is issued by the governing body, the applicant for such permit shall deposit with the city treasurer a sum set by resolution of the governing body for all paving, curb or sidewalk to be cut. Such sum shall be computed on a per-square-foot construction basis. The deposit shall be retained by the city for the purpose of replacing the paving, curb or sidewalk if the work is done by the city. If the city elects to require the applicant to replace the paving, curb or sidewalk, the deposit shall be retained by the city until the work is completed to the satisfaction of the city engineer. No permit shall be granted unless the applicant shall, in addition to all other requirements, agree in writing to the following conditions: 
(1)  That the applicant will, if requested by the city, promptly replace and repair each place cut into any pavement, curb or sidewalk under such rules as may be prescribed by the street superintendent as approved by the governing body and leave the same in as good a condition as before the same was cut. 
(2)  That the applicant will promptly compensate the city for all work done by the city in replacing or repairing any places cut in the pavement, curb or sidewalk by the applicant. 
(3)  That the applicant will obey all laws of the city in doing such work and will save the city harmless from any damages that may occur as the result of either cutting or repairing the pavement, curb or sidewalk. 
(4)  That the applicant will maintain and keep in repair the place where the pavement, curb or sidewalk is cut to the satisfaction of the city and its officers for a period of one year after the completion of the work.

ARTICLE IV. - DESIGN STANDARDS 

Sec. 98-116. - Street arrangement. 
    Unless otherwise approved by the planning commission, provision must be made for the extension of existing dead-end streets.

(Code 1975, § 12-401) 
Sec. 98-117. - Street drainage. 
    Proposed streets must conform to existing topography as nearly as possible in order that drainage problems may be reduced. Streets should, wherever possible, follow valleys so as to form a collection system for surface water. Surface drainage across residential lots or along the side or rear lot lines shall be avoided wherever possible. Where such drainage on residential lots is necessary, easements shall be provided; and the planning commission may require installation of pipe, masonry or riprap flumes or such other protective devices in order that adjacent or surrounding property or the welfare of the public shall not be endangered and maintenance will be kept at a minimum. Sizes of pipe and other drainage structures shall be computed with sufficient accuracy to assure their adequacy, particular attention being given to the drainage areas of surrounding land. All drainage plans shall be approved by the city engineer before the final plat is approved. 
(Code 1975, § 12-402) 
Sec. 98-118. - Street plan. 
(a)  For the purpose of facilitating the movement of traffic, certain streets are designated by the major street plan as major streets. A map showing these major streets will be on file in the office of the planning commission, and reference shall be made to this system of major streets before any preliminary plan is approved. 
(b)  When a proposed subdivision abuts a major street or is bounded by a line that will in the future lie in a major street or is divided by a major street as shown on the major street plan, the owner of that subdivision shall dedicate, without charge, any land within such subdivision that is necessary to provide conformity with the major street plan, such dedication to be shown on the preliminary plan and final plat. 
(Code 1975, § 12-403) 
Sec. 98-119. - Street widths and grades. 
    The minimum width of a street shall be 60 feet; the minimum gradient shall be one percent, and the maximum gradient shall be ten percent.

Sec. 98-120. - Adjoining streets and land. 
    The system of streets designated for a subdivision, except in unusual cases, must connect with streets already dedicated in adjacent subdivisions and where no adjacent connections are platted, must in general be the reasonable projection of streets in nearest subdivided tracts and must be continued to the boundaries of the tract subdivided so that other subdivisions may connect with the new subdivision. 
(Code 1975, § 12-405) 
Sec. 98-121. - Large parcels. 
    If a tract is subdivided into larger parcels than normal building lots, such parcels shall be arranged to permit the opening of future streets and logical resubdivision. 
(Code 1975, § 12-406) 
Sec. 98-122. - Dead-end streets and culs-de-sac. 
    Except in unusual cases, no dead-end streets will be approved unless such dead-end streets are provided to connect with future streets in adjacent land. Culs-de-sac may be permitted where the form or contour of the land makes it difficult to plat with connecting streets and where they are desirable. Such culs-de-sac shall provide proper access to all lots and shall generally not exceed 400 feet in length. A turnaround shall be provided at the closed end of a cul-de-sac with an outside radius of at least 50 feet (except in unusual cases). Culs-de-sac will not be permitted where the turnaround is not clearly visible from the entrance to the street. 
(Code 1975, § 12-407) 
Sec. 98-123. - Blocks. 
    In general, intersecting streets determining block lengths shall be provided at such intervals as to serve cross traffic adequately and to meet existing or future streets. Where no existing plats control, the blocks shall not exceed 800 feet in length. 
(Code 1975, § 12-408) 
Sec. 98-124. - Alleys and alley widths. 
    Except in unusual cases, alleys or loading courts must be provided in business blocks. Alleys are optional in residential districts but are considered undesirable except where alleys of adjoining subdivisions would be closed or shut off from access by the failure to provide alleys in the new subdivision. Alleys shall have a minimum width of 20 feet. In case of intersecting alleys, a cutoff shall be required of at least five feet measured from the point of intersection of the alley lines, the resultant connecting lot line to be at least five feet in length. 
(Code 1975, § 12-409) 
Sec. 98-125. - Lots. 
    All rectangular lots and all other lots, so far as practicable, shall have the side lines at right angles to the street on which the lot faces or radial to curved street lines. Lots shall be of width and area to conform to the zoning provisions of this Code. Corner lots shall be at least five feet wider than the average lot in the subdivision. The minimum average depth of a lot shall be 100 feet.

Sec. 106-62. - Initial review of basic cable rates. 
(a)  Notice. Upon certification of the city by the FCC, the city shall notify all cable operators in the city, by certified mail, return receipt requested, that the city intends to regulate subscriber rates charged for the basic service tier and associated equipment as authorized by the Cable Act of 1992. 
(b)  Cable operator response. Within 30 days of receiving notice from the city, a cable operator shall file with the city its current rates for the basic service tier and associated equipment and any supporting material concerning the reasonableness of its rates. 
(c)  Expedited determination and public hearing. 
(1)  If the city council is able to expeditiously determine that the cable operator's rates for the basic service tier and associated equipment are within the FCC's reasonable rate standard, as determined by the applicable benchmark, the city council shall: 
a.  Hold a public hearing at which interested persons may express their view; and 
b.  Act to approve the rates within 30 days from the date the cable operator filed its basic cable rates with the city. 
(2)  If the city council takes no action within 30 days from the date the cable operator files its basic cable rates with the city, the proposed rates will continue in effect. 
(d)  Extended review period. 
(1)  If the city council is unable to determine whether the rates in issue are within the FCC's reasonable rate standard based on the material before it, or if the cable operator submits a cost-of-service showing, the city council shall, within 30 days from the date the cable operator filed its basic cable rates with the city and by adoption of a formal resolution, invoke the following additional periods of time, as applicable, to make a final determination: 
a.  If the city council needs more time to ensure that a rate is within the FCC's reasonable rate standard, 90 days; or 
b.  If the cable operator has submitted a cost-of-service showing seeking to justify a rate above the applicable benchmark, 150 days. 
(2)  If the city council has not made a decision within the 90- or 150-day period, the city council shall issue a brief written order at the end of the period requesting the cable operator to keep accurate account of all amounts received by reason of the proposed rate and on whose behalf the amounts are paid. 
(e)  Public hearing. During the extended review period and before taking action on the proposed rate, the city council shall hold at least one public hearing at which interested persons may express their views and record objections. 
(f)  Objections. An interested person who wishes to make an objection to the proposed initial basic rate may request the city clerk to record the objection during the public hearing or may submit the objection in writing anytime before the decision resolution is adopted. In order for an objection to be made part of the record, the objector must provide the city clerk with the objector's name and address. 
(g)  Benchmark analysis. If a cable operator submits its current basic cable rate schedule as being in compliance with the FCC's reasonable rate standard, the city council shall review the rates using the benchmark analysis in accordance with the standard form authorized by the FCC. Based on the city council's findings, the initial basic cable rates shall be established as follows: 
(1)  If the current basic cable rates are below the benchmark, those rates shall become the initial basic cable rates; and the cable operator's rates will be capped at that level. 
(2)  If the current basic cable rates exceed the benchmark, the rates shall be the greater of the cable operator's per-channel rate on September 30, 1992, reduced by ten percent, or the applicable benchmark, adjusted for inflation and any change in the number of channels occurring between September 30, 1992, and the initial date of regulation. 
(3)  If the current basic cable rates exceed the benchmark, but the cable operator's per-channel rate was below the benchmark on September 30, 1992, the initial basic cable rate shall be the benchmark, adjusted for inflation. 
(h)  Cost-of-service showings. If a cable operator does not wish to reduce the rates to the permitted level, the cable operator shall have the opportunity to submit a cost-of-service showing in an attempt to justify initial basic cable rates above the FCC's reasonable rate standard. The city council will review a cost-of-service submission pursuant to FCC standards for cost-of-service review. The city council may approve initial basic cable rates above the benchmark if the cable operator makes the necessary showing; however, a cost-of-service determination resulting in rates below the benchmark or below the cable operator's September 30, 1992, rates minus ten percent will prescribe the cable operator's new rates. 
(i)  Decision. 
(1)  By formal resolution. After completion of its review of the cable operator's proposed rates, the city council shall adopt its decision by formal resolution. The decision shall include one of the following: 
a.  If the proposal is within the FCC's reasonable rate standard or is justified by a cost-of-service analysis, the city council shall approve the initial basic cable rates proposed by the cable operator; or 
b.  If the proposal is not within the FCC's reasonable rate standard and the cost-of-service analysis, if any, does not justify the proposed rates, the city council shall establish initial basic cable rates that are within the FCC's reasonable rate standard or that are justified by a cost-of-service analysis. 
(2)  Rollbacks and refunds. If the city council determines that the initial basic cable rates as submitted exceed the reasonable rate standard or that the cable operator's cost-of-service showing justifies lower rates, the city council may order the rates reduced in accordance with subsection (g) or (h) of this section, as applicable. In addition, the city council may order the cable operator to pay to subscribers refunds of the excessive portion of the rates with interest (computed at applicable rates published by the Internal Revenue Service for tax refunds and additional tax payments), retroactive to September 1, 1993. The method for paying any refund and the interest rate will be in accordance with FCC regulations as directed in the city council's decision resolution. 
(3)  Statement of reasons for decision and public notice. If rates proposed by a cable operator are disapproved in whole or in part, or if there were objections made by other parties to the proposed rates, the resolution must state the reasons for the decision; and the city council must give public notice of its decision. Public notice will be given by advertisement once in the official newspaper of the city. 
(j)  Appeal. The city council's decision concerning rates for the basic service tier or associated equipment may be appealed to the FCC in accordance with applicable federal regulations. 
(Ord. No. 93-40, § 2, 10-19-93) 
Sec. 106-63. - Review of request for increase in basic cable rates. 
(a)  Notice. A cable operator in the city who wishes to increase the rates for the basic service tier or associated equipment shall file a request with the city and notify all subscribers at least 30 days before the cable operator desires the increase to take effect. This notice may not be given more often than annually and not until at least one year after the determination of the initial basic cable rates. 
(b)  Expedited determination and public hearing. 
(1)  If the city council is able to expeditiously determine that the cable operator's rate increase request for basic cable service is within the FCC's reasonable rate standard, as determined by the applicable price cap, the city council shall: 
a.  Hold a public hearing at which interested persons may express their views; and 
b.  Act to approve the rate increase within 30 days from the date the cable operator filed its request with the city. 
(2)  If the city council takes no action within 30 days from the date the cable operator filed its request with the city, proposed rates will go into effect. 
(c)  Extended review period. 
(1)  If the city council is unable to determine whether the rate increase is within the FCC's reasonable rate standard based on the material before it, or if the cable operator submits a cost-of-service showing, the city council shall, by adoption of a formal resolution, invoke the following additional periods of time, as applicable, to make a final determination: 
a.  If the city council needs more time to ensure that the requested increase is within the FCC's reasonable rate standard as determined by the applicable price cap, 90 days; and 
b.  If the cable operator has submitted a cost-of-service showing seeking to justify a rate increase above the applicable price cap, 150 days. 
(2)  The proposed rate increase is tolled during the extended review period. 
(3)  If the city council has not made a decision within the 90- or 150-day period, the city council shall issue a brief written order at the end of the period requesting the cable operator to keep accurate account of all amounts received by reason of the proposed rate increase and on whose behalf the amounts are paid. 
(d)  Public hearing. During the extended review period and before taking action on the requested rate increase, the city council shall hold at least one public hearing at which interested persons may express their view and record objections. 
(e)  Objections. An interested person who wishes to make an objection to the proposed rate increase may request the city clerk to record the objection during the public hearing or may submit the objection in writing anytime before the decision resolution is adopted. In order for an objection to be made part of the record, the objector must provide the city clerk with the objector's name and address. 
(f)  Delayed determination. If the city council is unable to make a final determination concerning a requested rate increase within the time period, the cable operator may put the increase into effect, subject to subsequent refund if the city council later issues a decision disapproving any portion of the increase. 
(g)  Price cap analysis. If a cable operator presents its request for a rate increase as being in compliance with the FCC's price cap, the city council shall review the rate using the price cap analysis in accordance with the standard form authorized by the FCC. Based on the city council's findings, the basic cable rates shall be established as follows: 
(1)  If the proposed basic cable rate increase is within the price cap established by the FCC, the proposed rates shall become the new basic cable rates. 
(2)  If the proposed basic cable rate increase exceeds the price cap established by the FCC, the city council shall disapprove the proposed rate increase and order an increase that is in compliance with the price cap. 
(h)  Cost-of-service showings. If a cable operator submits a cost-of-service showing in an attempt to justify a rate increase above the price cap, the city council will review the submission pursuant to FCC standards for cost-of-service review. The city council may approve a rate increase above the price cap if the cable operator makes the necessary showing; however, a cost-of-service determination resulting in a rate below the price cap or below the cable operator's then current rate will prescribe the cable operator's new rate. 
(i)  Decision. The city council's decision concerning the requested rate increase shall be adopted by formal resolution. If a rate increase proposed by a cable operator is disapproved in whole or in part, or if objections were made by other parties to the proposed rate increase, the resolution must state the reasons for the decision. Objections may be made at the public hearing by a person requesting the city clerk to record the objection or may be submitted in writing at any time before the decision resolution is adopted. 
(j)  Refunds. 
(1)  The city council may order refunds of subscribers' rate payments with interest if the: 
a.  City council was unable to make a decision within the extended time period as described in subsection (c) of this section; 
b.  Cable operator implemented the rate increase at the end of the extended review period; and 
c.  City council determines that the rate increase as submitted exceeds the applicable price cap or that the cable operator failed to justify the rate increase by a cost-of-service showing, and the city council disapproves any portion of the rate increase. 
(2)  The method for paying any refund and the interest rate will be in accordance with FCC regulations as directed in the city council's decision resolution. 
(k)  Appeal. The city council's decision concerning rates for the basic service tier or associated equipment may be appealed to the FCC in accordance with applicable federal regulations. 
(Ord. No. 93-40, § 3, 10-19-93) 
Sec. 106-64. - Cable operator information. 
(a)  City may require. 
(1)  In those cases in which the cable operator has submitted initial rates or proposed an increase that exceeds the reasonable rate standard, the city council may require the cable operator to produce information in addition to that submitted, including proprietary information, if needed to make a rate determination. In these cases, a cable operator may request the information be kept confidential in accordance with this section. 
(2)  In cases where initial or proposed rates comply with the reasonable rate standard, the city council may request additional information only in order to document that the cable operator's rates are in accord with the standard. 
(b)  Request for confidentiality. 
(1)  A cable operator submitting information to the city council may request in writing that the information not be made routinely available for public inspection. A copy of the request shall be attached to and cover all of the information and all copies of the information to which it applies. 
(2)  If feasible, the information to which the request applies shall be physically separated from any information to which the request does not apply. If this is not feasible, the portion of the information to which the request applies shall be identified. 
(3)  Each request shall contain a statement of the reasons for withholding inspection and a statement of the facts upon which those reasons are based. 
(4)  Casual requests which do not comply with the requirements of this subsection shall not be considered. 
(c)  City council action. Requests that comply with the requirements of subsection (b) of this section will be acted upon by the city council. The city council will grant the request if the cable operator presents by a preponderance of the evidence a case for nondisclosure consistent with applicable federal regulations. If the request is granted, the ruling will be placed in a public file in lieu of the information withheld from public inspection. If the request does not present a case for nondisclosure and the city council denies the request, the city council shall take one of the following actions: 
(1)  If the information has been submitted voluntarily without any direction from the city, the cable operator may request that the city return the information without considering it. Ordinarily, the city will comply with this request. Only in the unusual instance that the public interest so requires will the information be made available for public inspection. 
(2)  If the information was required to be submitted by the city council, the information will be made available for public inspection. 
(d)  Appeal. If the city council denies the request for confidentiality, the cable operator may seek review of that decision from the FCC within five working days of the city council's decision, and the release of the information will be stayed pending review. 
(Ord. No. 93-40, § 4, 10-19-93) 
Sec. 106-65. - Automatic rate adjustments. 
(a)  Annual inflation adjustment. In accordance with FCC regulations, the cable operator may adjust its capped base per-channel rate for the basic service tier annually by the final GNP-PI index. 
(b)  Other external costs. 
(1)  The FCC regulations also allow the cable operator to increase its rate for the basic service tier automatically to reflect certain external cost factors to the extent that the increase in cost of those factors exceeds the GNP-PI. These factors include retransmission consent fees, programming costs, state and local taxes applicable to the provision of cable television service, and costs of franchise requirements. The total cost of an increase in a franchise fee may be automatically added to the base per-channel rate, without regard to its relation to the GNP-PI. 
(2)  For all categories of external costs other than retransmission consent and franchise fees, the starting date for measuring changes in external costs for which the basic service per-channel rate may be adjusted will be the date on which the basic service tier becomes subject to regulation or February 28, 1994, whichever occurs first. The permitted per-channel charge may not be adjusted for costs of retransmission consent fees or changes in those fees incurred before October 6, 1994. 
(c)  Notification and review. The cable operator shall notify the city at least 30 days in advance of a rate increase based on automatic adjustment items. The city shall review the increase to determine whether the items qualify as automatic adjustments. If the city makes no objection within 30 days of receiving notice of the increase, the increase may go into effect. 
(Ord. No. 93-40, § 5, 10-19-93) 
Sec. 106-66. - Enforcement. 
(a)  Refunds. The city may order the cable operator to refund to subscribers a portion of previously paid rates under the following circumstances: 
(1)  A portion of the previously paid rates have been determined to be in excess of the permitted tier charge or above the actual cost of equipment; or 
(2)  The cable operator has failed to comply with a valid rate order issued by the city. 
(b)  Penalty. If the cable operator fails to comply with a rate decision or refund order, the cable operator shall be subject to a fine of $100.00 for each day the cable operator fails to comply.

    Whenever traffic is controlled by traffic control signals exhibiting different colored lights or colored lighted arrows, successively one at a time or in combination, only the colors green, red and yellow shall be used, except for special pedestrian signals carrying a word legend or symbol; and such lights shall indicate and apply to drivers of vehicles and pedestrians as follows: 
(1)  a. 
Vehicular traffic facing a circular green indication may proceed straight through or turn right or left unless a sign at such place prohibits either such turn; but vehicular traffic, including vehicles turning right or left, shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles and to pedestrians lawfully within the intersection or an adjacent crosswalk at the time such indication is exhibited; 
b.  Vehicular traffic facing a green arrow indication, shown alone or in combination with another indication, may cautiously enter the intersection only to make the movement indicated by such arrow or such other movement as is permitted by other indications shown at the same time; and such vehicular traffic shall yield the right-of-way to pedestrians lawfully within an adjacent crosswalk and to other traffic lawfully using the intersection; and 
c.  Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian control signal, pedestrians facing any green indication, except when the sole green indication is a turn arrow, may proceed across the roadway within any marked or unmarked crosswalk; 
(2)  a. 
Vehicular traffic facing a steady yellow indication is thereby warned that the related green movement is being terminated or that a red indication will be exhibited immediately thereafter when vehicular traffic shall not enter the intersection, and upon display of a steady yellow indication, vehicular traffic shall stop before entering the nearest crosswalk at the intersection; but if such stop cannot be made in safety, a vehicle may be driven cautiously through the intersection; and 
b.  Pedestrians facing a steady yellow indication, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian control signal, are thereby advised that there is insufficient time to cross the roadway before a red indication is shown and no pedestrian shall then start to cross the roadway; 
(3)  a. 
Vehicular traffic facing a steady red indication alone shall stop at a clearly marked stop line or shall stop, if there is no such line, before entering the crosswalk on the near side of the intersection or, if there is no crosswalk, before entering the intersection; and the traffic shall remain standing until an indication to proceed is shown except as provided in subsections (3)b. and (3)c. of this section; 
b.  Except where a traffic control device is in place prohibiting a turn, vehicular traffic facing a steady red indication may cautiously enter the intersection to make a right turn after stopping as required by subsection (3)a. of this section; and such vehicular traffic shall yield the right-of-way to pedestrians lawfully within an adjacent crosswalk and to other traffic lawfully using the intersection; 
c.  Except where a traffic control device is in place prohibiting a turn, vehicular traffic facing a steady red indication at the intersection of two one-way streets may cautiously enter the intersection to make a left turn after stopping as required by subsection (3)a. of this section; and such vehicular traffic shall yield the right-of-way to pedestrians lawfully within an adjacent crosswalk and to other traffic lawfully using the intersection; and 
d.  Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian control signal, pedestrians facing a steady red indication alone shall not enter the roadway; and 
(4)  If a traffic control signal is erected and maintained at a place other than an intersection, the provisions of this section shall be applicable except as to those provisions which by their nature can have no application. Any stop required shall be made at a sign or marking on the pavement indicating where the stop shall be made; but in the absence of any such sign or marking, the stop shall be made at the signal.

The rules, regulations and rates for electric service shall be considered a part of every application made for electric service and shall be considered a part of the contract between every consumer served by the electrical department. Without further formality, the making of application on the part of any applicant or the use or consumption of electric energy by customers and the furnishing of electric service to an applicant or customer shall constitute a contract between the applicant or customer and the city, to which both parties are bound. If the customer should violate any of the provisions of the contract or any reasonable rules and regulations the electrical department may adopt, the electrical superintendent or his agent shall cut off or disconnect the electric service from the building or place of such violation and no further connection of electric service for such building or place shall again be made save or except by order of the superintendent or his agent.

If a meter is broken or otherwise fails to register accurately the use of electricity by any consumer, the monthly bill one year previous to such breakage shall be used for billing purposes. All electrical meters shall be provided by the city at the expense of the city. The city shall have the responsibility of maintaining the meters except where the electrical superintendent determines that the damage to the meter was caused by the negligent or intentional acts of the customer, in which case the customer shall pay for such repair. The owner or occupant shall at all times provide convenient access to the meter so that it may be examined by the authorized agents of the city. All meters shall be tested at the customer's request at the expense of the customer any reasonable number of times; however, if the test shows the electrical meter to be running two percent or more fast, the expense of such test shall be borne by the city. The city reserves the right to test any electrical service meter at any time; and if the meter is found to be beyond repair, the city shall always have the right to place a new meter on the customer's electrical service fixtures at city expense. It shall be unlawful for any person to employ any scheme, device or contrivance for the purpose of evading the proper service and registration of any electric meter or to employ any scheme or device whereby he may obtain electric current that does not pass through the meter furnished him. 
(Code 1975, § 3-706) 
Sec. 114-142. - Fees and collections. 
    The governing body has the power and authority to fix the rates to be paid by electrical consumers for the use of electricity.

The city collector shall bill the consumers and collect all money received by the city on the account of the city electrical system. He shall faithfully account for and pay over to the city clerk all revenue collected by him, taking his receipt in duplicate, filing one with the city clerk and keeping the other on file in his official records. The governing body shall set rates to be charged by resolution for each class of customer. All rates and customer classifications shall be on file in the office of the city clerk for public inspection at any reasonable time. Revenue from customers shall be deposited by the city clerk in the light fund and shall be kept, disbursed and allocated in strict conformity with the directives of the governing body. All rates prescribed by the governing body shall be uniform insofar as they affect the users of equal amounts of current in the various categories of customers. No electric current shall be furnished to any customer under any other rate than that provided for other members of the same category; however, the governing body may establish rates for nonresidents, whether the nonresident is a person, association, corporation or municipality, without regard to the rates established for other categories of users as long as the rates charged are reasonable considering the type of customer and the expense of bringing that customer electrical service. One bill only shall be computed for each meter; however, where two or more customers share the same meter, each customer shall be required to pay the minimum charge assessed. 
(Code 1975, § 3-707) 
Sec. 114-143. - Minimum rates. 
    All electrical consumers shall be liable for the minimum rate provided by resolution unless the consumer shall by written order direct the electrical superintendent to shut off the electricity, in which case he shall not be liable for electrical service until the electricity is turned on again. 
(Code 1975, § 3-708) 
Sec. 114-144. - Delinquent payments.

(Code 1975, § 3-709) 
Sec. 114-145. - Restricted use. 
(a)  The city electrical system does not guarantee the delivery of electric current over the lines of the distribution system except when it has sufficient power, current, equipment and machinery to do so. The electrical superintendent has the power and authority to disconnect or discontinue such service for any good and sufficient reason without liability. The following reasons shall always be deemed to be sufficient: 
(1)  For repairs necessary to be made on any part of the plant, power house, equipment, system or distribution system; 
(2)  For nonpayment of bills when due; 
(3)  For fraudulent representations in regard to the consumption of current for light, cooking, heat and power; 
(4)  For the protection of persons or property; and 
(5)  For violation of any of the rules or requirements of this article. 
(b)  The city shall use due care and reasonable diligence to provide and supply uninterrupted service to consumers, but shall not be liable for damages resulting from interruption of service due to causes over which the city has no control; and the city expressly reserves the right to discontinue or disconnect any consumer's service without preliminary notice. 
(Code 1975, § 3-710) 
Sec. 114-146. - Building moving. 
    Should any house or building moving occur or be necessary and it becomes necessary in such work to remove or disturb any of the property or wires of the city electrical system, the moving should not be done except upon written permission received from the electrical superintendent, who shall then order paid in advance the actual cost of moving the wires; and such cost shall be paid by the applicant prior to the moving of the building or house. All expense of removing, changing and replacing the wires or apparatus of the electrical system shall be paid out of the deposit made prior to moving, and any surplus remaining after all expenses are paid shall be returned to the applicant; however, if in the course of moving the building or house it becomes apparent that additional expense will be incurred, such additional deposit as deemed necessary may be demanded.

    Approved means that a backflow prevention device or method has been accepted by the water foreman as being suitable for the intended use. 
    Atmospheric vacuum breaker means a device that restricts the backflow of water into a potable water system by a simple check valve. The vacuum is broken by allowing air to enter upstream of the check valve. 
    Auxiliary water system means any water supply system available to the premises other than the public water supply system and includes the water supplied by such system. These auxiliary water systems may include water from another owner's public water supply system; polluted or contaminated water, process fluids; used water; or other sources of water over which the owner of the public water supply system does not have sanitary control. 
    Backflow or backsiphonage means the flow of water or other liquids, mixtures or substances into the water distribution system from any source other than the intended source of the potable water supply. 
    Backflow prevention device means any device, method or type of construction intended to prevent backflow into a potable water system. Devices such as an approved air gap, double check valve assembly, atmospheric vacuum breaker or a reduced pressure principle device that have been approved by the water foreman can be used. 
    Consumer means the owner or person in control of any premises supplied by or in any manner connected to a public water supply system. 
    Consumer's water supply system means any water supply system, located on the consumer's premises, supplied by or in any manner connected to a public water supply system. A household plumbing system is considered to be a consumer's water supply system. A fire suppression system is also considered a consumer's water supply system. 
    Contamination means an impairment of the quality of the water by sewage or waste to a degree that could cause an actual hazard to the public health through poisoning or through spread of disease by exposure. 
    Cross connection means any arrangement whereby contamination due to backflow or backsiphonage can occur.

    Nonpotable water means water not safe for drinking, personal or culinary use, or which does not meet the requirements of the state department of health. 
    Owner means the person delivering water through a public water supply system. The owner is the city operating through the public works committee. 
    Person means the state, any political subdivision, public or private corporation, individual, partnership or other legal entity. 
    Plumbing hazard means a plumbing type cross connection in a consumer's potable water system that has not been properly protected by air gap separation or backflow prevention devices. 
    Pollution means the presence in water of any foreign substance (organic, inorganic or biological) that degrades the quality of water to a degree that does not necessarily cause an actual hazard to the public health but does adversely and unreasonably affect such waters for any desired use. 
    Pollution hazard means a condition through which an aesthetically objectionable or degrading material not dangerous to health may enter the public water supply system or the consumer's water supply system. 
    Potable water means water that is satisfactory for drinking, culinary and domestic purposes and meets the requirements of the state department of health. 
    Public water supply system means a water supply system designed and intended to provide potable water to a designated consumer. The water supply shall include the water supply source and distribution piping network. The water supply source is defined as any artificial or natural accumulation of water used to supply the potable water system. The distribution piping network includes all piping, pumping and treatment devices used to convey an adequate quality and quantity of potable water to the consumer. 
    Reduced pressure zone backflow prevention device means a device containing a minimum of two independently acting check valves together with an automatically operated pressure differential relief valve located between two check valves. During normal flow and at the cessation of normal flow, the pressure between these two checks shall be less than the supply pressure. In case of leakage of either check valve, the differential relief valve, by discharging to the atmosphere, shall operate to maintain the pressure between the check valves at less than the supply pressure. The unit must include 100 percent closing shutoff ball valves located at each end of the device, and each device shall be fitted with properly located test cocks. 
    Service connection means the terminal end of a service line from the public water system. If a meter is installed at the end of the service, the service connection means the downstream end of the meter. 
    System hazard means a condition posing an actual or potential threat of damage to the physical properties of the public's or the consumer's water supply system. 
    Used water means any water supplied by the public water supply system to a consumer's water supply system after it has passed through the service connection and is no longer under the sanitary control of the water supplier.

(a)  if any premises connected directly or indirectly to the sanitary sewer system of the city obtains a part or all of the water used or consumed thereon from a source of supply other than the water distribution system owned and operated by the city, the sewer service charge for such property shall be computed in accordance with the schedule established by resolution of the governing body from time to time during the period for which charges shall be billed. Sewer service charges computed as provided in this subsection shall be billed and be payable at the same time and place and in the same manner as would be the case if all water used on such premises were obtained from the city water distribution system. For the purpose of determining sewer service charges under this subsection, each contributor to the city's sanitary sewer system shall, at his own expense, cause all sources of water, other than the city's water distribution system to be properly metered and provide access to such meter or meters to authorized representatives of the city for the purpose of examination, testing and reading. If the director approves the adequacy of such metering and the method of installation thereof, such metering shall be used for the purpose of determining sewer user charges under this subsection. If any contributor fails to provide such metering of water or fails to maintain any such meters in satisfactory operating condition or refuses access to the same by representatives of the city, or if the director does not approve the adequacy or method of metering, the director shall cause either: 
(1)  Sewage service to such premises to be terminated; or 
(2)  An estimate to be made of quantities of water consumed on such premises, in which case, sewer user charges shall be made in accordance with such estimate. 
(c)  Normal users shall not be charged a sewer user charge for water passing through a separate meter, the type and installation of which shall be approved by the director, and purchased and installed at the consumer's expense, when the meter shall be connected to outside taps for the purpose of the lawn sprinklers or for the operation of air conditioners when such water is not discharged through or into the sanitary sewer system. 
(d)  If the director determines that a water meter has been out of order, and has failed to register properly, the user will be charged at the average consumption of water as shown by the water meter during the preceding billing period or fraction thereof when such meter was in working order. If no such data is available, the user shall be charged the minimum bill monthly until winter quarter water usage can be determined. The user shall then be billed retroactively for any amount due over the minimum bills paid. 
(e)  Surcharges shall be paid by normal users who discharge wastes with strengths in excess of normal domestic waste strengths. Surcharges shall be as shown in the user charge plan. 
(f)  Any user which discharges any toxic pollutants which cause an increase in the cost of managing the effluent, or any user which discharges any substance which singly or by interaction with other substances causes identifiable increases in the cost of operation, maintenance, or replacement of the sewer system, shall pay for such increased costs. The charge to each such user shall be as determined by the director and approved by the city council.

(Ord. of 11-8-99, § 101) 
Sec. 130-2. - Purpose. 
    The purpose of this Code is to safeguard the health, property and public welfare by controlling the design, location, use or occupancy of all buildings through the regulated and orderly development of land and land uses within this jurisdiction. The provisions of this Code are to lessen congestion in the streets; to secure safety from fire, panic, and other dangers; to provide adequate light and air to prevent the overcrowding of land; to avoid undue concentration of population; and to facilitate the adequate provisions of transportation, water, sewerage, schools, parks, and other public requirements. 
(Ord. of 11-8-99, § 102) 
Sec. 130-3. - Jurisdiction. 
    The provisions of this Code and the building regulations chapter shall apply within the corporate limits of the municipality and within the territory beyond said corporate limits as now or hereafter fixed, for a distance of two miles in all directions, as established on the two maps entitled "Use and Height District Maps of South Sioux City," as the same may be amended by subsequent annexation. Said maps and amendments thereto and all explanatory matter thereof are hereby made a part of this chapter. Said maps shall be on file in the office of the register of deeds, and a certified copy thereof shall be furnished to the municipal clerk-treasurer.

    In fulfilling these purposes, this ordinance is intended to benefit the public as a whole and not any specific person or class of persons. Although through the implementation, administration and enforcement of this code, benefits and detriments will be enjoyed or suffered by specific individuals, such is merely a byproduct of the overall benefit to the whole community.

(1)  No existing structure devoted to a use not permitted by this Chapter in the district in which it is located shall be enlarged, extended, constructed, reconstructed, moved or structurally altered except in changing the use of the structure to a use permitted in the district in which it is located. 
Exception. The board of adjustment may determine that the failure to allow such changes would bring hardship to the owner or occupant or such failure would be a miscarriage of justice. 
(2)  When a nonconforming use of a structure or premise is discontinued or abandoned the structure or premise for a period of 12 months, or as otherwise indicated by this code, shall not thereafter be used except in conformance with the regulations of the district in which it is located. 
(3)  Any use, which becomes a nonconforming use, may be extended throughout the building in which it is located; provided, no structural alterations, or additions are made to the building other than those required by law or ordinance. 
(4)  Whenever a use district shall be hereafter changed, any then existing nonconforming use in such changed district may be continued or changed to a use permitted in that district; provided, all other regulations governing the new use are complied with. 
(5)  Whenever a nonconforming use of a building has been changed to a more restricted use or to a conforming use, such use shall not hereafter be changed to a less restricted use. 
(b)  Maintenance. All buildings or uses, both existing and new, and all parts thereof, shall be maintained. The owner or designated agent shall be responsible for the maintenance of buildings and parcels of land. To determine compliance with this section, the code official may cause any structure or use to be inspected.

(2)  The planning commission, after proper notice, shall hold a public hearing and act upon each application. 
(3)  The planning commission may recommend amendments to MU district applications. 
(4)  The recommendation of the planning commission shall be transmitted to the city council for final action. 
(5)  The city council, after proper notice, shall hold a public hearing and act upon any ordinance establishing an MU district. Proper notice shall mean the same notice established for any other zoning amendment. 
(6)  An ordinance adopting an MU district shall require a favorable simple majority of the city council for approval; however, the favorable vote of three-fourths of the city council shall be required if the planning commission has recommended denial to the change of zone to the MU district. 
(7)  Any approval of an MU district shall be contingent upon the approval by city council of a mixed use development agreement. 
(8)  The city shall not issue a building permit, certificate of occupancy or other permit for a building, structure or use within an MU district unless it is in compliance with the approved mixed use development agreement, including any approved amendments.

Sec. 130-121. - Off-street parking. 
(a)  General. There shall be provided at the time of erection of any main building or at the time such buildings are altered, enlarged, converted or increased in capacity minimum off-street parking space with adequate provision for ingress and egress by standard-sized vehicles in accordance with the requirements of this Code. 
(b)  Parking space requirements. 
(1)  Required number. The off-street parking spaces required for each use permitted by this code shall not be less than that found in the off-street parking schedule table following this section, provided that any fractional parking space be computed as a whole space. 
Notwithstanding the amount of off-street parking required by this code, the city council may approve less off-street parking when the proponent of a use demonstrates that, because of special circumstances involved with a particular use, it is obvious that the off-street parking required by this code exceeds any reasonable likely need. 
(2)  Contractual parking. Contractual agreements may be made between uses which generate parking demands at different times in such a manner that the requirements of more than one use may be met by the same space. Provided, the parking demand for each such use involved is in fact met. In a commercial planned unit development where parking cannot reasonably be assigned to individual uses, two square feet of gross parking lot shall be provided for each square foot of gross floor area. Such contractual agreements shall be approved by the building official and kept on file. The building official shall be contacted within three business days at such time the parking agreement is dissolved or any changes to the agreement have been made. At such time the building official shall determine if the intent of this section has been maintained. The city council may at any time terminate a parking agreement when it is determined that the intent of this section has not been met. 
(3)  Combination of uses. Where there is a combination of uses on a lot, the required number of parking spaces shall be the sum of that found for each use. 
(4)  Location of lot. The parking spaces required by this code shall be provided on the same lot as the use or where the exclusive use of such is provided on another lot not more than 150 feet radially from the subject lot within the same or less restrictive zoning district.

No automobile shall be required to back onto any public street or sidewalk to leave any parking stall when such stall serves more than two dwelling units or other than residential uses. All portions of a public lot or garage shall be accessible to other portions thereof without requiring the use of any public street. 
(4)  Compact-to-standard stall ratio. The maximum ratio of compact stalls to standard stalls in any parking area shall not exceed 1 to 4. 
(5)  Parking lot screening. Reserved. 
(6)  Striping. All parking stalls shall be striped in a manner approved by the code official. 
Exception: A private garage or parking area for the exclusive use of a single-family dwelling. 
(7)  Lighting. All lights illuminating a parking area shall be designed and located so as to reflect away from any street and adjacent property. 
(8)  Parking location. Parking is permitted within any enclosed structure when the structure otherwise conforms to the requirements of its specific zoning district. Parking is permitted outside of an enclosed structure in the side yard, behind the line of the required front yard setback, or in the rear provided the space is on a paved hard surfaced driveway or paved pad adjacent to the driveway.

ARTICLE 6. - PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENT 

Sec. 130-211. - General. 
    Planned unit developments may be allowed by planning commission approval in any zoning district. No such planned unit development permit shall be granted unless such development will meet the use limitations of the zoning district in which it is located and meet the density and other limitations of such districts, except as such requirements may be lawfully modified as provided by this code. Compliance with the regulations of this code in no way excuses the developer from the applicable requirements of a subdivision ordinance, except as modifications thereof are specifically authorized in the approval of the application for the planned unit development. 
(1)  Purpose. This zoning district is designed to provide for innovations in siting new and modern design developments, that are not possible under the regulations designed for control of individual and independent buildings. 
(2)  Considerations. Before approving a PUD, the planning commission and city council shall find that: 
a.  That the proposed space limits of the plan and siting of buildings will be in the public interest; in harmony with the purposes of this Chapter and will not adversely affect nearby properties. 
b.  That the overall density of the development and the proportions of units allowed will not adversely affect nearby properties. 
c.  That the amount of open space will be provided in harmony with nearby properties. 
(Ord. of 11-8-99, § 1301) 
Sec. 130-212. - Conditions. 
(a)  Area. No planned unit development shall have an area less than that approved by the planning commission as adequate for the proposed development. 
(b)  Uses. A planned unit development that will contain uses not permitted in the zoning district in which it is to be located will require a change of zoning district and shall be accompanied by an application for a zoning amendment, except that any residential use shall be considered a permitted use in a planned unit development which allows residential uses and shall be governed by density, design and other requirements of the planned unit development permit. The proponents shall submit a site plan of the proposed development as an exhibit accompanying the request for a change of zone. The site plan shall become an exhibit accompanying the change of zone amendment if such amendment is passed. Such plan shall be filed on record in the county offices specified for recording deeds, and shall form the basis for any building permits. 
(c)  Ownership. The development shall be in single or corporate ownership at the time of application, or the subject of an application filed jointly by all owners of the property. 
(d)  Design. The planning commission shall require such arrangements of structures and open spaces within the site development plan as necessary to ensure that adjacent properties will not be adversely affected. 
(1)  Density. Density of land use shall in no case be more than two percent higher than in residential districts. 
(2)  Lot size. Minimum lot size shall be no less than 10,000 square feet in area. 
(3)  Arrangement. No building shall be closer than 20 feet to any bounding lot line of the zoning lot. Where feasible, the least height and density of buildings and uses shall be arranged around the boundaries of the development. 
(4)  Specific regulations. Lot area, width, yard, height, density and coverage regulations shall be determined by approval of the site development plan. 
(e)  Open spaces. Preservation, maintenance and ownership of required open spaces within the development shall be accomplished by either: 
(1)  Dedication of the land as a public park or parkway system, or 
(2)  Granting to the jurisdiction a permanent, open space easement on and over the said private open spaces to guarantee that the open space remain perpetually in recreational use, with ownership and maintenance being the responsibility of an owners' association established with articles of association and bylaws which are satisfactory to the legislative body. 
(f)  Landscaping. Landscaping, fencing and screening related to the uses within the site and as a means of integrating the proposed development into its surroundings shall be planned and presented to the planning commission for approval, together with other required plans for the development. A planting plan showing proposed tree and shrubbery plantings shall be prepared for the entire site to be developed. A grading and drainage plan shall also be submitted to the planning commission with the application. 
(g)  Signs. The size, location, design and nature of signs, if any, and the intensity and direction of area or floodlighting shall be detailed in the application and must conform to the regulations as outlined in article 3. 
(h)  Desirability. The proposed use of the particular location shall be shown as necessary or desirable, to provide a service or facility which will contribute to the general well being of the surrounding area. It shall also be shown that under the circumstances of the particular case, the proposed use will not be detrimental to the health, safety or general welfare of persons residing in the vicinity of the planned unit development. 
(i)  Market survey. The commission and the council shall take into consideration the ability of nearby streets to handle traffic generated by the proposed development and shall take into consideration the effects upon the value and amenities of the nearby properties and in the event of conflict between the maintenance of such values and the proposed development, shall weigh the equities between the two using the criterion of the community service and maintaining the concept of the zoning plan in assessing the position of the proposed development.

Sec. 130-213. - Planning commission determination. 
    In carrying out the intent of this section, the planning commission shall consider the following principles: 
(1)  It is the intent of this section that site and building plans for a planned unit development shall be prepared by a designer or team of designers having professional competence in urban planning as proposed in the application, and shall be identified as a registered design professional with the State of Nebraska. The commission may require the applicant to engage such professional expertise as a qualified designer or design team. 
(2)  It is not the intent of this section that control of the design of a planned unit development by the planning commission be so rigidly exercised that individual initiative be stifled and substantial additional expense incurred; rather, it is the intent of this section that the control exercised be the minimum necessary to achieve the purpose of this section. 
(3)  The planning commission may approve or disapprove an application for a planned unit development. In an approval, the commission may attach such conditions as it may deem necessary to secure compliance with the purposes set forth in this chapter. The denial of an application for a planned unit development by the planning commission may be appealed to the legislative body of the jurisdiction. 
(Ord. of 11-8-99, § 1303) 
Sec. 130-214. - Planning commission action. 
(a)  Approval. In order that it may approve a planned unit development, the planning commission shall have authority to require that the applicant meet the following conditions (among others it deems appropriate): 
(1)  That the proponents of the planned unit development have demonstrated to the satisfaction of the planning commission that they are financially able to carry out the proposed project. 
(2)  That the proponents intend to start construction within one year of either the approval of the project or of any necessary zoning district change, and intend to complete said construction, or approved stages thereof, within four years from the date construction begins if such construction is not commenced and pursued in an orderly manner toward completion, the commission and council may initiate action to abolish the zoning or reduce the size of the tract to fit the scope of the actual development. It is intended that a PUD be designed to carryout the objective of the planning practices established by the commission and council for development of the municipality and to be so developed within a reasonable time. It is here by declared that the holding for speculative purposes of undeveloped land zoned as a PUD is contrary to the purposes of said planning practices established by the commission and council. 
(3)  That the development is planned as one complex, or land use, rather than as an aggregation of individual and unrelated buildings and uses. 
(b)  Limitations on application. 
(1)  Upon approval of a planned unit development, construction shall proceed only in accordance with the plans and specifications approved by the planning commission, and in conformity with any conditions attached by the jurisdiction as to its approval. 
(2)  Amendment to approved plans and specifications for a planned unit development shall be obtained only by following the procedures here outlined for first approval. 
(3)  The building official shall not issue any permit for any proposed building, structure or use within the project unless such building, structure or use is in accordance with the approved development plan and with any conditions imposed in conjunction with its approval.

ARTICLE 7. - FLOODWAY AND FLOODWAY FRINGE OVERLAY 

Sec. 130-231. - Authority. 
    The Legislature of the State of Nebraska under the provision of 19-901 R.R.S. delegated the responsibility to local governmental units to adopt zoning regulations designed to protect the health, safety, and general welfare. Therefore, the city council of South Sioux City, Nebraska ordains as follows. 
(Ord. of 11-8-99, § 1401) 
Sec. 130-232. - Finding of fact. 
    The flood hazards of South Sioux City, Nebraska, are subject to inundation which results in loss of life and property, health, and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base all of which adversely affect the public health, safety, and general welfare. 
    These flood losses are caused by (1) the cumulative effect of obstruction in floodways causing increases in flood heights and velocities; (2) the occupancy of flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods or hazardous to others which are inadequately elevated or otherwise protected from flood damages. 
(Ord. of 11-8-99, § 1402) 
Sec. 130-233. - Analysis. 
    This section uses a reasonable method of analyzing flood hazards, which consists of a series of interrelated steps. 
(1)  Selection of a base flood which is based upon engineering calculations which permit a consideration of such flood factors as its expected frequency of occurrence, the area inundated, and the depth of inundation. The base flood selected for this section is representative of large floods which are reasonably characteristic of what can be expected to occur on the particular streams subject to this section. It is in the general order of a flood which could be expected to have a one percent chance of occurrence in any one year, as delineated in the official flood plain study and illustrative materials dated 6 th day of January, 2012, as amended. 
(2)  Calculation of water surface profiles based upon a hydraulic engineering analysis of the capacity of the stream channel and over bank areas to convey the base flood. 
(3)  Computation of the floodway required to convey this flood without increasing flood heights more than one foot at any point. 
(4)  Delineation of floodway encroachment lines within which no obstruction is permitted which would cause any increase in flood height. 
(5)  Delineation of the floodway fringe, i.e. that area outside the floodway encroachment lines but which still is subject to inundation by the base flood. 
(Ord. of 11-8-99, § 1403; Ord. No. 2011-12, § 1, 10-10-11) 
Sec. 130-234. - Purpose. 
    It is the purpose of this section to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare and to minimize those losses described in section 130-232 of this code by applying the provisions of this section to: 
(1)  Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety, or property in times of flooding or cause undue increases in flood heights or velocities. 
(2)  Required that uses vulnerable to floods, including public facilities which serve such uses, be provided with flood protection at the time of initial construction. 
(3)  Protect individuals from buying lands which are unsuited for intended purposes because of flood hazard. 
(4)  Assure that eligibility is maintained for property owners in the community to purchase flood insurance in the National Flood Insurance program when identified by the Federal Insurance Administration as a flood prone community. 
(Ord. of 11-8-99, § 1404) 
Sec. 130-235. - Jurisdiction. 
    This section shall apply to all lands within the jurisdiction of the city of South Sioux City, Nebraska identified on the Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) dated 6 th day of January, 2012, as numbered and unnumbered A zones and/or within the zoning districts FW and FF established in section 130-242 of this Code. In all areas covered by this section no development shall be permitted except upon a permit to develop granted by the governing body or its duly designated representative under such safeguards and restriction as they may reasonably impose for the promotion and maintenance of the general welfare, health of the inhabitants of the community and where specifically noted in sections 130-243 through 130-247 of this Code. 
(Ord. of 11-8-99, § 1405; Ord. No. 2011-12, § 2, 10-10-11) 
Sec. 130-236. - Enforcement officer. 
    The code official of the city is hereby designated as the council's duly designated enforcement officer under this section. 
(Ord. of 11-8-99, § 1406) 
Sec. 130-237. - Interpretative and miscellaneous provisions. 
(a)  The boundaries of the floodway and floodway fringe overlay districts shall be determined by scaling distances on the official zoning map. Where interpretation is needed to the exact location of the boundaries of the districts as shown on the official zoning map, as for districts as shown on the official zoning map, as for example where there appears to be a conflict between a mapped boundary and actual field conditions, this enforcement officer shall make the necessary interpretation. In such cases where the interpretation is contested, the board of adjustment will resolve the dispute. The base flood elevation for the point in question shall be the governing factor in locating the district boundary on the land. The person contesting the location of the district boundary shall be given a reasonable opportunity to present his case to the board and to submit his own technical evidence, if he so desires. 
(b)  To development located within known flood hazard areas of the community shall be located, extended, converted, or structurally altered without full compliance with the terms of this section and other applicable regulations. 
(c)  It is not intended by this section to repeal, abrogate, or impair any existing easements, covenants, or deed restrictions. However, where this section imposes greater restrictions, the provision of the section shall prevail. All other sections inconsistent with this section are hereby repealed to the extent of the inconsistency only. 
(d)  In their interpretation and application, the provisions of this section shall be held to the minimum requirements and shall be liberally construed in favor of the governing body and shall not be deemed a limitation or repeal of any other powers granted by state statutes. 
(e)  The degree of flood protection required by this section is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on engineering and scientific methods of study. Larger floods may occur on rare occasions or the flood height may be increased by man-made or natural causes, such as ice jams and bridge openings restricted by debris. This section does not imply that areas outside floodway and floodway fringe district boundaries or land uses permitted within such districts will be free from flooding or flood damages. This section shall not create liability on the part of the city of South Sioux City, Nebraska, or any officer or employee thereof for any flood damages that may result from reliance on this section or any administrative decision lawfully made thereunder. 
(f)  If any section, clause, provision, or portion of this section is adjudged unconstitutional or invalid by a court of competent jurisdiction, the remainder of this section shall not be affected thereby. 
(Ord. of 11-8-99, § 1407) 
Sec. 130-238. - Appeal. 
    Where the code official denies a request for a permit to develop or a variance, the applicant may apply for such permit or variance directly to the board of adjustment.

Such flooding is characterized by ponding or sheet flow. 
    Area of special flood hazard the land in the flood plain within a community subject to one percent or greater chance of flooding in any given year. 
    Base flood elevation elevation indicated in the official flood plain study as the elevation of the 100-year flood. 
    Base flood protection elevation an elevation one foot higher than the water surface elevation of the base flood. 
    Channel a natural or artificial water course of perceptible extent, with a definite bed and banks to confine and conduct continuously or periodically flowing water. Channel flow, thus is that water which is flowing within the limits of a defined channel. 
    Community any state or area or political subdivision thereof which has authority to adopt and enforce flood plain management regulations for the areas within its jurisdiction. 
    Development Any man-made change to improved or unimproved real estate, including but not limited to buildings or other structures, mining, dredging, filling, grading, paving, excavation, or drilling operations. 
    Existing construction (for the purposes of determining rates) structures for which the "start of construction" commenced before the effective date of the FIRM or before January 1, 1975, for FIRM's effective before that date. "Existing construction" may also be referred to as "existing structures." 
    Flood or Flooding a general and temporary condition of partial or complete inundation of normally dry land area from: 
(1)  The overflow of inland or tidal waters. 
(2)  The unusual and rapid accumulation of runoff of surface waters from any source. 
    Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) an official map of a community, on which the flood insurance study has delineated the flood hazard boundaries and the zones establishing insurance rates applicable to the community.

    Flood protection system those physical structural works constructed specifically to modify flooding in order to reduce the extent of the area within a community subject to a "special flood hazard." Such a system typically includes levees or dikes. These specialized modifying works are those constructed in conformance with sound engineering standards. 
    Flood proofing any combination of structural and non-structural additions, changed, or adjustments to structures, including utility and sanitary facilities, which would preclude the entry of water. Structural components shall have the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and the effect of buoyancy. 
    Floodway (FW) the channel of a river or other water course and the adjacent portion of the flood plain that must be reserved in order to discharge the 100 year flood without cumulatively increasing the water surface elevation more than one foot at any point assuming equal conveyance reduction outside the channel from the two sides of the flood plain. 
    Floodway fringe (FF) that area of the flood plain, outside of the floodway that on the average is likely to be flooded once every 100 years (i.e., that has a one percent chance of flood occurrence in any one year). 
    Freeboard a factor of safety usually expressed in feet above a flood level for purposes of flood plain management. "Freeboard" tends to compensate for the many unknown factors that could contribute to flood heights greater than the height calculated for a selected size flood and floodway conditions, such as wave action, clogged bridge openings, and the hydrological effect of urbanization of the watershed. 
    Highest adjacent grade the highest natural elevation of the ground surface prior to construction next to the proposed walls of a structure. 
    Lowest floor the lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area (including basement). An unfinished or flood resistant enclosure, usable solely for parking of vehicles, building access or storage, in an area other than a basement area, is not considered a building's lowest floor, provided that such enclosure is not built so as to render the structure in violation of the applicable non-elevation design requirements of this section.

    Start of construction for other than new construction or substantial improvements under the Coastal Barrier Resources Act (Pub. L. 94-348) includes substantial improvement, and means the date the building permit was issued, provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction, placement, or improvement was within 180 days of the permit date. The actual start means the first placement of permanent construction of a structure on a site, such as the pouring of slab or footings, the installation of piles, the construction of columns, or any work beyond the stage of excavation or the placement of a manufactured home on a foundation. Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as clearing, grading and filling; nor does it include installation of street and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footing, or foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main structure.

(1)  Before the improvement or repair is started, or 
(2)  If the structure has been damaged and is being restored, before the damage occurred. 
    For the purpose of this definition "substantial improvement" is considered to occur when the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of the building commences, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the structure. The term does not, however, include either (1) any project for improvement for a structure to comply with existing state or local health, sanitary, or safety codes specifications which are solely necessary to assure safe living conditions, or (2) any alteration of a structure listed on the National Register of Historic Places or a state inventory of historic places.
