PREFACE 
    This Code constitutes a recodification of the general and permanent ordinances of the City of Cleveland, Mississippi. 
    Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the 1996 Code, and ordinances adopted by the mayor and board of aldermen. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this Code, the reader can locate any section of the 1996 Code, and any ordinance included herein. 
    The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order, and the various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Notes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state law have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this Code. 
Chapter and Section Numbering System 
    The chapter and section numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and local government codes. Each section number consists of two parts separated by a dash. The figure before the dash refers to the chapter number, and the figure after the dash refers to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the second section of chapter 1 is numbered 1-2, and the first section of chapter 6 is 6-1. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter, and at the same time new sections can be inserted in their proper place by using the decimal system for amendments. For example, if new material consisting of one section that would logically come between sections 6-1 and 6-2 is desired to be added, such new section would be numbered 6-1.5. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject. The next successive number shall be assigned to the new article or division. New chapters may be included by using one of the reserved chapter numbers. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. 
Page Numbering System 
    The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the volume. The number to the right of the colon represents the number of the page in that portion. In the case of a chapter of the Code, the number to the left of the colon indicates the number of the chapter. In the case of an appendix to the Code, the letter immediately to the left of the colon indicates the letter of the appendix. The following are typical parts of codes of ordinances, which may or may not appear in this Code at this time, and their corresponding prefixes: 
CODE CD1:1 CODE APPENDIX CDA:1 CODE COMPARATIVE TABLES CCT:1 STATE LAW REFERENCE TABLE SLT:1 CODE INDEX CDi:1  
Index 
    The index has been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the index itself which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which the user is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
    A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up to date. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited, and the affected page or pages will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
    Keeping this publication up to date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. As revised pages are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
Acknowledgments 
    This publication was under the direct supervision of Roger D. Merriam, Senior Code Attorney, and Amy Norton, Editor, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida. Credit is gratefully given to the other members of the publisher's staff for their sincere interest and able assistance throughout the project. 
    The publisher is most grateful to Ms. Jamie Jacks, City Attorney, for her cooperation and assistance during the progress of the work on this publication. It is hoped that her efforts and those of the publisher have resulted in a Code of Ordinances which will make the active law of the city easily accessible to all citizens and which will be a valuable tool in the day-to-day administration of the city's affairs.

Upon entry of said order, the municipal judge shall impose, and the clerk shall collect, said costs as costs of court on each and every misdemeanor conviction (including traffic offenses), unless said cost is specifically waived by the municipal judge. 
(2)  The costs so collected shall be paid into the municipal treasury and shall be subject to budget and appropriation for lawful purposes by the mayor and board of aldermen; however; these funds as accumulated shall be budgeted and used only for the promotion and funding of the program for crime prevention and drug education and the training of crime prevention and drug education officers of the programs for crime prevention and drug education of the city police department and for no other purposes.

(Ord. of 12-5-1995, §§ 1-4) 
Sec. 1-10. - Citations. 
(a)  Title. This section may be referred to and cited as the "Uniform Citation Ordinance." 
(b)  Definitions. The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this section, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this subsection, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning: 
    Citation means any summons, citation, ticket, or other document issued by an enforcement officer as herein defined for the violation of the ordinances, and rules or regulations therein embraced, ordering an alleged offender to appear in the municipal court, and the terms "cite," "summons," and "ticket" mean the issuance of such citation. 
    Enforcement officer or officer means any person designated to inspect or enforce the ordinances aforesaid, including, but not limited to, the building inspector, the code enforcement officer, the building official, the plumbing inspector, the fire inspector, the electrical inspector, and the deputies or directed employee of any such enforcing person, and other superintendents and directors of public works, streets, water, wastewater management, mosquito control, and parks and recreation, and any police officer duly employed and under the direction of the marshal or chief of police, it being understood that moving and other traffic violations not involving damage to public properties remain within the exclusive jurisdiction of the police department under the ordinances of this city and the laws of the State of Mississippi. 
    Ordinance means any ordinance regulating the maintenance and construction of buildings and structures and the land use and development of property within this city and damage to public property, including, but not limited to, ordinances regulating subdivision development, floodplain management, litter, wastewater, water and sewer systems, fire prevention, plumbing and electrical installations and safety, housing, zoning and other land use, traffic and other uses of public streets and sidewalks, the municipal airport, and public parks and public playgrounds, meaning to embrace all ordinances and standard codes designated to be enforced by a building official or fire inspector. 
(c)  Citations generally. 
(1)  An enforcement officer, in lieu of arrest for an ordinance violation, may issue a citation, as would be appropriate under the circumstances. Upon failure of any person to appear or otherwise comply with the terms of the citation, the officer may request that a warrant be issued under the authority of the municipal court judge for the arrest of the offender, whereupon such warrant shall be executed and the offense dealt with as provided by law and the rules of the municipal court. 
(2)  Every ticket shall show, among other necessary information, the name of the issuing officer, the name of the court in which the cause is to be heard, and the date and time such person is to appear to answer the charge. The ticket shall include information which will constitute a complaint charging the offense for which the ticket was issued, and when duly sworn to and filed with the municipal court, prosecution may proceed thereunder. 
(3)  All tickets shall be printed and filled out in an original and at least two copies, and such other copies as may be requested by the municipal court or enforcing agency, 
(4)  The original ticket shall be delivered by the officer issuing the ticket to the municipal court clerk to be retained in the court's records and it shall be assigned a number and noted upon the docket. The officer issuing the ticket shall also give the accused a copy of the ticket. 
(5)  These procedures shall govern all officers enforcing the ordinances herein provided in making arrests without a warrant for violations committed in their presence, but the procedure herein shall not be exclusive of any other method prescribed by law for the arrest and prosecution of a person for an offense of like grade. Offenses not provided for herein may nevertheless be enforced in any manner permissible under the law and the applicable rules of court. 
(d)  Advance payment of fine, or default on appearance bond, as waiver of further proceedings. 
(1)  In all cases in the municipal court involving any violation herein, where a person has been issued a ticket and desires to waive a trial and not appear in court and defend the charge, the amount of the fine may, in the discretion of the court, be paid in advance to the clerk of the court. When the fine is so paid in advance, the person cited must be notified by language plainly printed on the ticket of their right to a trial and the consequences of the voluntary advance payment of such fine. In such cases where charges have been made and the person charged has been notified to appear in court at a certain date and time, the clerk of the justice court is authorized to accept a cash appearance bond not to exceed the amount of the fine, conditioned upon the appearance of such person in court at such date and time. In the event of default, the cash bond may be forfeited in payment of any judgment in the case in an amount not to exceed the amount of the bond; and in such cases of forfeiture, it shall be final without necessity of judgment nisi and issuance of the writ of scire facias. In the event a person so cited pays a fine in advance after notice of their rights, this shall constitute a waiver of formal charge, arraignment and trial; and in such cases and in cases of default on appearance bond, such action shall be a plea of nolo contendere by such person and the court may, upon the advance payment of fine or the default on appearance bond, convict such person of the offense stated in the traffic ticket or charges without further appearance by such person, and such conviction shall be entered upon the court records. 
(2)  For the purposes of this subsection, the term "fine" shall mean, in addition to the pecuniary punishment, all fees, costs, assessments and other such charges required by law to be imposed in such cases. Failure to bring or present the ticket form to court for examination by the court will require the payment of $5.00 for location and production of a copy in addition to all other fines, penalties, costs or fees imposed by the court, and whether such other fines, penalties, costs or fees are in fact imposed, or not. 
(e)  Citation form and contents. The form and contents of the citation herein authorized may be substantially as follows, provided the issuer may insert such other information as may be needed for court or agency records or administration:

This ticket may be disposed of by mail or personal appearance on or before the appearance date as noted. However, you have a right to a trial if you so desire. 
The law does permit persons charged with such violations, in most cases, to dispose of such charge by mail or personal appearance on or before the appearance date as noted on the ticket. If you pay your fine in advance it shall constitute a waiver of further or formal charges, appearance or arraignment and trial, or if you post cash bail bond and default on your appearance, and the court so elects to forfeit the bond in payment of the judgment rendered, such action shall be tantamount to entry of a plea of nolo contendere, or no contest, by you on the charges made against you, and the court may convict you of the offense stated on the ticket without further appearance by you. If you desire to dispose of this ticket by mail or otherwise before the date before you are required to appear in court, contact the municipal court clerk noted on the front side, referring to any ticket or case number indicated and your name as it appears on the ticket address, et cetera, and inquire as to the amount of fine which may be imposed. Be sure to give your correct address, zip code, telephone number, or other information so that you may be notified promptly of the fine required.

ARTICLE III. - PIT BULL DOGS 

Sec. 10-53. - Findings. 
(a)  The city has experienced a series of incidents in which citizens and animals have been threatened or attacked and injured by pit bull dogs. 
(b)  The pit bull breed was developed for the purpose of producing fighting dogs. 
(c)  To increase its effectiveness as a fighter, certain pit bull traits have been selected and maximized by controlled breeding, including: 
(1)  A set of powerful jaws with an exceptional ability to grip, lock and tear when the dog bites; 
(2)  A unique sensitivity to pain that causes pit bulls to be exceedingly tenacious in attack; 
(3)  An unusually aggressive temperament toward human beings and animals; and 
(4)  An extraordinary directness in their method of attack that does not include the common warning signs such as barking or growling as displayed by other breeds. 
(d)  For the reasons provided in this section, pit bull dogs present a present danger to the health and welfare of the citizens and animals in the city different in degree and kind from the dangers presented by other breeds of dogs. 
(Ord. of 1-2-2007, § I) 
Sec. 10-54. - Violation. 
    It shall be unlawful for any person to own, possess, keep, exercise control over, maintain, harbor, or transport any pit bull dog within the city in violation of the regulations, requirements and provisions of this article, and such violation shall be punishable as provided by law. 
(Ord. of 1-2-2007, § V) 
Sec. 10-55. - Regulations. 
(a)  Generally. This article is intended to utilize the authority and powers of the city in order to secure for the citizens of the city the protection of their health, safety and welfare. This article is intended to be applicable to dogs which are commonly referred to as "pit bulls" and which are defined herein. This article is designed to regulate these pit bull dogs and to ensure responsible handling by their owners through containment and registration. The unique history, nature and characteristics of pit bull dogs have been determined to require the special regulations and provisions contained within this article which the board of aldermen hereby finds reasonable and necessary. 
(b)  Definition of owner. The term "owner," for purposes of this article, is defined as any person who owns, possesses keeps, exercises control over, maintains, harbors, transports or sells an animal.

Technical deficiencies in a dog's conformance to the standards described herein shall not be considered to indicate that the subject dog is not a pit bull dog pursuant to this article. Testimony by a veterinarian or an animal behaviorist that a particular dog exhibits distinguishing physical characteristics of a pit bull stall establish a rebuttable presumption that the dog is a pit bull. 
(d)  Confinement of pit bull dogs. 
(1)  Because of the pit bull dog's inbred propensity to attack other animals, and because of the danger posed to humans and animals alike by a pit bull dog when running loose or while running together in a pack, pit bull dogs must at all times be securely confined indoors, or confined in a securely and totally enclosed and locked pen, constructed with cyclone type fencing material of at least nine gauge wire in thickness; with all four sides to be at least six feet in height; with concrete slab foundation at least four inches in thickness; and a secured cyclone fence top; such enclosure shall likewise have a conspicuous sign affixed thereto displaying the words "Dangerous Dog." The enclosure must have a bottom permanently attached to the sides or sides embedded into the ground not less than one foot. This section does not relieve the owner, possessor or keeper of a dog from the obligation to comply with any provisions of the municipal codes or zoning requirements for fences. 
(2)  At any time that a pit bull dog is not confined as required in subsection (d)(1) of this section, the dog shall be muzzled in such a manner as to prevent it from biting or injuring any person or animal, and kept on a leash with the owner or custodian in attendance; provided, however, that no pit bull dog may be walked within 50 feet of any public school ground, nor enter onto such school ground. 
(3)  An exception to these confinement requirements is hereby provided for any pit bull dog in attendance at, and participating in, any lawful dog show, contest or exhibition sponsored by a dog club, association, society or similar organization. 
(e)  Registration of pit bull dogs. Every owner of a pit bull dog within the city shall register said dog with the manager of the Cleveland-Bolivar County Animal Shelter (the "manager" and the "animal shelter" hereinafter). The registration shall include the following: name, address and telephone number of the dog's owner, the address where the dog is harbored, if different front that of the owner; a complete identification of the dog, including the dog's sex, color and other distinguishing physical characteristics; a color photograph of the dog, and a description of the method of compliance with the confinement requirements. The registration tag shall be worn on the dog's collar at all times. Such registration is not transferable except to a member of the immediate family of such registrant. Certification of rabies vaccination shall be presented upon registration. The manager of said animal shelter shall issue evidence of registration to the owner or custodian which must be available for examination by any lawful officer at any time. Any owner or custodian of any pit bull shall immediately notify the manager of any change of residence or address where the dog is harbored for revision of said registration. 
(f)  Owner age requirement. Owners, keepers or harborers of pit bull dogs or the like must be 21 years of age. A person must be 21 years of age to walk a pit bull dog or the like on a leash. 
(g)  Limits of confinement. No more than three pit bull dogs or the like shall be confined at any single dwelling or business in the city. 
(h)  Altering of pit bull dogs. All pit bull dogs shall be neutered or spayed, and the appropriate certification shall be provided to the animal shelter upon registration. 
(i)  Liability insurance. Owners of pit bull dogs or the like shall maintain a liability insurance policy in an amount not less than $100,000.00, for bodily injury or property damages arising from events or occurrences associated with owning, keeping or harboring pit bull dogs or the like. Evidence of such insurance must be presented to manager upon registration and shall be available for examination by any lawful officer at any time 
(j)  Enforcement. It shall be the duty and responsibility of the chief of police utilizing the city animal control officer, or any law enforcement officer, to enforce the provisions of this article. Owners, keepers or harborers of pit bull dogs or the like, may be subjected to spot checks by said enforcement officers, as well as by the municipal building official in charge of building inspections, and must be able to produce registration, proof of liability insurance and show confinement to the satisfaction of this article. Any of said enforcement officers may make lawful arrests for violations as provided by law or issue and enforce citations for such violations as provided by the uniform citations ordinance. Any of said enforcement officers may make lawful arrests for violations as provided by law or issue and enforce citations for such violations as provided by the uniform citations ordinance of the city. 
(k)  Jurisdiction. Enforcement of penalties for violations of this section shall be within the jurisdiction of the municipal court or any other court of competent jurisdiction 
(l)  Other regulations. Nothing in this article shall prevent the city from providing more stringent regulations of pit bull dogs and pit bull dog owners or of other types of animals deemed to be a threat to the safety and welfare of the community. 
(m)  Penalty. Any pit bull found in violation of this article may be immediately taken into custody by any lawful enforcement office and placed at the animal shelter as provided in other cases within the provisions of this section and subject to the penalties, fees and conditions therein provided.

    Master contractor shall mean any qualifying person engaged in the business of installing, maintaining, altering, or repairing, electrical, gas pipe fitting, lawn irrigation, mechanical, or plumbing systems in, on, or under all types of buildings or structures and outside installations and licensed as such. A master contractor is allowed to work on any type of structure or project in the field(s) in which they hold a valid license. 
    Qualifying person shall mean the individual who has passed the appropriate examination from any source recognized herein. The license holder of a master or residential license must also be either:

(c)  Relative to the requirements of subsection (b) of this section, when successive improvements are made or permits issued therefor, the values of such improvements shall be counted cumulatively for at least five years. When such values accumulate and aggregate 50 percent of the value of the existing building, then such original building must meet the aforesaid flood protection standards. The director of public works and building inspector may establish and maintain records by parcel number or address in such manner that the history of improvements to a particular structure may be checked before the next permit is issued, and no permit shall be issued without the improvements meeting the applicable requirements.

DIVISION 1. - STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION, FINDINGS OF FACT, PURPOSE, AND OBJECTIVES. 

Sec. 34-21. - Statutory authorization. 
    The Legislature of the state of Mississippi has in Title 17, Chapter 1, Mississippi Code of 1972 Annotated delegated the responsibility to local government units to adopt regulations designed to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare of its citizenry. Therefore, the mayor and board of aldermen of the City of Cleveland, Mississippi does hereby adopt the following floodplain management regulations. 
( Ord. of 01-10-2017, art. 1, § A ) 
Sec. 34-22. - Findings of fact. 
(a)  The city is subject to periodic inundation, which results in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare. 
(b)  These flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions, both inside and outside the identified special flood hazard areas, causing increases in flood heights and velocities and by the occupancy in flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods or hazardous to other lands which are inadequately elevated, floodproofed, or otherwise unprotected from flood damages. 
( Ord. of 01-10-2017, art. 1, § B ) 
Sec. 34-23. - Statement of purpose. 
    It is the purpose of this article to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to: 
(1)  Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety, and property due to water or erosion hazards, which result in damaging increases in erosion or in flood heights or velocities; 
(2)  Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction; 
(3)  Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural protective barriers which are involved in the accommodation of flood waters; 
(4)  Control filling, grading, dredging, and other development which may increase erosion or flood damage, and; 
(5)  Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands. 
( Ord. of 01-10-2017, art. 1, § C ) 
Sec. 34-24. - Objectives. 
    The objectives of this article are: 
(1)  To protect human life and health; 
(2)  To minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects; 
(3)  To minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public; 
(4)  To minimize prolonged business interruptions; 
(5)  To minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located in floodplains; 
(6)  To help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of flood prone areas in such a manner as to minimize flood blight areas, and; 
(7)  To ensure that potential homebuyers are notified that property is in a floodprone area. 
( Ord. of 01-10-2017, art. 1, § D ) 
Sec. 34-25. - Methods of reducing flood losses. 
    In order to accomplish its purposes, this article includes methods and provisions for: 
(1)  Restricting or prohibiting uses which are dangerous to health, safety, and property due to water or erosion hazards, or which result in damaging increases in erosion or in flood heights or velocities; 
(2)  Requiring that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction; 
(3)  Controlling the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural protective barriers, which help accommodate or channel flood waters; 
(4)  Controlling filling, grading, dredging, and other development which may increase flood damage, and; 
(5)  Preventing or regulating the construction of flood barriers that will unnaturally divert floodwaters or may increase flood hazards in other areas. 
( Ord. of 01-10-2017, art. 1, § E )

    AE zone means the area of special flood hazard with base flood elevations determined. 
    Accessory structure (appurtenant structure) means a structure, which is located on the same parcel of property as the principal structure and the use of which is incidental to the use of the principal structure. Accessory structures should constitute a minimal initial investment, may not be used for human habitation, and be designed to have minimal flood damage potential. Examples of accessory structures are detached garages, carports, storage sheds, pole barns, and hay sheds. 
    Addition (to an existing building) means any walled and roofed expansion to the perimeter or height of a building. Any addition shall be considered new construction. If the addition is more than 50 percent of the market value of the structure, then the addition and the existing structure are now new construction. 
    Appeal means a request for a review of the floodplain administrator's interpretation of any provision of this article or a request for a variance. 
    AR/AE, AR/AH, AR/AO, and AR/A zones are SFHAs that result from the decertification of a previously accredited flood protection system or levee that is in the process of being restored to provide a one percent chance or greater level of flood protection. After restoration is complete, these areas will still experience residual flooding from other flooding sources. 
    A99 zone means that part of the SFHA inundated by the one percent chance flood to be protected from the one percent chance flood by a Federal flood protection system or levee under construction, no base flood elevations are determined. 
    Area of special flood hazard means the land in the floodplain within a community subject to a one percent or greater chance of flooding in any given year. This area is also referred to as the special flood hazard area (SFHA). 
    Base flood means the flood having a one percent chance of being equaled or exceeded in any given year (also called the "one percent chance flood"). 
    Base flood elevation (BFE) is the elevation shown in the flood insurance study (FIS) for zones AE, AH, AR, AR/A, AR/AE, AR/AH, AR/AO, and VE that indicates the water surface elevation resulting from a flood that has a one percent or greater chance of being equaled or exceeded in any given year. 
    Basement means any portion of a building having its floor sub-grade (below ground level) on all sides. 
    Building. See Structure. 
    Community means a political entity and/or its authorized agents or representatives that have the authority to adopt and enforce floodplain ordinances for the area under its jurisdiction. 
    Community floodplain management map means any map produced by the community utilizing best available base flood elevation and floodway data that is from a federal, state, or other accepted technical source. 
    Community rating system (CRS) is a program developed by the Federal Insurance Administration to provide incentives for those communities in the regular program that have gone beyond the minimum floodplain management requirements to develop extra measures to provide protection from flooding. 
    Community flood hazard area (CFHA) is an area that has been determined by the floodplain administrator (or other delegated, designated, or qualified community official) from available technical studies, historical information, and other available and reliable sources, which may be subject to periodic inundation by floodwaters that can adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare. This includes areas downstream from dams. 
    Critical facility (also called critical action) means facilities for which the effects of even a slight chance of flooding would be too great. The minimum floodplain of concern for critical facilities is the 0.2 percent chance flood level. Critical facilities include, but are not limited to facilities critical to the health and safety of the public such as: emergency operations centers, designated public shelters, schools, nursing homes, hospitals, police, fire and emergency response installations, vital data storage centers, power generation and water and other utilities (including related infrastructure such as principal points of utility systems) and installations which produce, use or store hazardous materials or hazardous waste (as defined under the Clean Water Act and other federal statutes and regulations). 
    D zone is an area in which the flood hazard is undetermined. 
    Dam means any artificial barrier, including appurtenant works, constructed to impound or divert water, waste water, liquid borne materials, or solids that may flow if saturated. All structures necessary to maintain the water level in an impoundment or to divert a stream from its course will be considered a dam. 
    Development means any man-made change to improved or unimproved real estate, including, but not limited to, buildings or other structures, mining, dredging, filling, grading, paving, excavating, drilling operations, or storage of materials or equipment. 
    Dry floodproofing means any combination of structural and nonstructural additions, changes, or adjustments to structures, which reduce or eliminate flood damages to real estate or improved real estate property, water, and sanitary facilities, structures, and their contents. Structures shall be floodproofed with a minimum of 12 inches of freeboard (more is recommended) in relation to the base flood elevation. Dry floodproofing of a pre-FIRM residential structure that has not been substantially damaged or improved is allowed. Dry floodproofing of a post-FIRM residential building is not allowed. Non-residential structures may be dry floodproofed in all flood zones with the exception of the coastal high hazard area or the coastal AE zone. 
    Elevated building means for insurance purposes, a non-basement building which has its lowest elevated floor raised above ground level by foundation walls, shear walls, posts, pilings, columns, or piers. 
    Elevation certificate is a FEMA form used as a certified statement that verifies a building's elevation information. 
    Emergency program means the first phase under which a community participates in the NFIP. It is intended to provide a first layer amount of insurance coverage for all insurable buildings in that community before the effective date of the initial FIRM. 
    Enclosure below the lowest floor. See Lowest floor. 
    Encroachment means the advance or infringement of uses, plant growth, fill, excavation, buildings, structures or development into a floodplain, which may impede or alter the flow capacity of a floodplain.

    Executive Order 11990 (Wetlands Protection). This order requires the avoidance of adverse impacts associated with the destruction or modification of wetlands. 
    Existing construction means structures for which the start of construction commenced before July 17, 1989 (Initial FIRM Date). Existing construction may also be referred to as existing structures. 
    Existing manufactured home park or subdivision means a manufactured home park or subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including at a minimum the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is completed before the effective date of the floodplain management regulations adopted by a community. 
    Expansion to an existing manufactured home park or subdivision includes the preparation of additional sites by the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads). 
    Fill means a deposit of earthen materials placed by artificial means. 
    500-year flood means the flood that has a 0.2 percent chance of being equaled or exceeded in any year. Areas subject to the 0.2 percent chance flood have a moderate risk of flooding. 
    Flood or flooding means a general and temporary condition of partial or complete inundation of normally dry land areas from: 
(1)  The overflow of inland or tidal waters. 
(2)  The unusual and rapid accumulation or runoff of surface waters from any source. 
(3)  Mudslides which are proximately caused by flooding and are akin to a river of liquid and flowing mud on the surfaces of normally dry land areas, as when earth is carried by a current of water and deposited along the path of the current. 
(4)  The collapse or subsidence of land along the shore of a lake or other body of water as a result of erosion or undermining caused by waves or currents of water exceeding anticipated cyclical levels or suddenly caused by an unusually high water level in a natural body of water, accompanied by a severe storm, or by an unanticipated force of nature, such as flash flood or an abnormal tidal surge, or by some similarly unusual and unforeseeable event which results in flooding. 
    Flood (insurance definition) means a general and temporary condition of partial or complete inundation of two or more acres of normally dry land areas or of two or more properties (e.g., a building and a public street) from: 
(1)  Overflow of inland or tidal waters; 
(2)  Unusual and rapid accumulation or runoff of surface waters; and 
(3)  Mudflows caused by flooding. 
    Flood insurance rate map (FIRM) means an official map of a community, on which FEMA has delineated both the areas of special flood hazard and the risk premium zones applicable to the community. 
    Flood insurance study (FIS) is the document which provides an examination, evaluation, and determination of flood hazards and, if appropriate, corresponding water surface elevations, or an examination, evaluation, and determination of mudslide and/or flood-related erosion hazards. 
    Floodplain means any land area susceptible to being inundated by flood waters from any source. 
    Floodplain administrator means the individual appointed to administer and enforce the floodplain management regulations. 
    Floodplain management means the operation of an overall program of corrective and preventive measures for reducing flood damage and preserving and enhancing, where possible, natural resources in the floodplain, including but not limited to emergency preparedness plans, flood control works, floodplain management regulations, and open space plans. 
    Floodplain management regulations means this article and other zoning ordinances, subdivision regulations, building codes, health regulations, special purpose ordinances, and other applications of police power which control development in flood-prone areas. This term describes federal, state, or local regulations in any combination thereof, which provide standards for preventing and reducing flood loss and damage. 
    Floodproofing certificate is an official FEMA form used to certify compliance for non-residential structures in non coastal high hazard areas as an alternative to elevating buildings to or above the base flood elevation. 
    Floodway. See Regulatory floodway. 
    Floodway fringe means that area of the special flood hazard area on either side of the regulatory floodway. 
    Flood protection elevation is the base flood elevation plus the community freeboard. In areas where no base flood elevations exist from any authoritative source, the flood protection elevation can be historical flood elevations or base flood elevations determined and/or approved by the floodplain administrator plus freeboard. 
    Freeboard means a factor of safety, usually expressed in feet above the BFE, which is applied for the purposes of floodplain management. 
    Functionally dependent use means a use which cannot perform its intended purpose unless it is located or carried out in close proximity to water. The term includes only docking facilities, port facilities that are necessary for the loading and unloading of cargo or passengers, ship building and ship repair facilities and seafood offloading facilities. The term does not include long-term storage, manufacture, processing functions, sales, administrative functions, or service facilities. 
    Hardship (as related to variances of this ordinance) means the exceptional difficulty that would result from a failure to grant the requested variance. The mayor and board of aldermen of the city requires that the variance is exceptional, unusual, and peculiar to the property involved. Mere economic or financial hardship alone is not exceptional. Inconvenience, aesthetic considerations, physical handicaps, personal preferences, or the disapproval of one's neighbors likewise cannot, as a rule, qualify as an exceptional hardship. All of these problems can be resolved through other means without granting a variance, even if the alternative is more expensive, or requires the property owner to build elsewhere or put the parcel to a different use than originally intended. 
    Hazard potential means the possible adverse incremental consequences that result from the release of water or stored contents due to failure of a dam or mis-operation of a dam or appurtenances. The hazard potential classification of a dam does not reflect in any way on the current condition of a dam and its appurtenant structures (e.g., safety, structural integrity, and flood routing capacity). 
    High hazard dam means a class of dam in which failure may cause loss of life, serious damage to residential, industrial, or commercial buildings; or damage to, or disruption of, important public utilities or transportation facilities such as major highways or railroads. Dams which meet the statutory thresholds for regulation that are proposed for construction in established or proposed residential, commercial, or industrial areas will be assigned this classification, unless the applicant provides convincing evidence to the contrary. A development permit is required for a structure and any associated fill downstream from a dam at any location where flooding can be reasonably anticipated from principal or emergency spillway discharges, or from overtopping and failure of the dam. 
    Highest adjacent grade means the highest natural elevation of the ground surface, prior to construction, next to the proposed walls of a building. 
    Historic structure means any structure that is: 
(1)  Listed individually in the National Register of Historic Places (a listing maintained by the Department of Interior) or preliminarily determined by the Secretary of the Interior as meeting the requirements for individual listing on the National Register; 
(2)  Certified or preliminarily determined by the Secretary of the Interior as contributing to the historical significance of a registered historic or a district preliminarily determined by the Secretary to qualify as a registered historic district; 
(3)  Individually listed on the State of Mississippi inventory of historic structures, or; 
(4)  Individually listed on a local inventory historic places in communities with historic preservation programs that have been certified by an approved state program as determined by the Secretary of the Interior. 
    Hydrologic and hydraulic engineering analyses means the analyses performed by a professional engineer, registered in the state of Mississippi, in accordance with standard engineering practices as accepted by FEMA, used to determine flood elevations and /or floodway boundaries. 
    Increased cost of compliance (ICC) coverage means under the standard flood insurance policy the cost to repair a substantially flood damaged building that exceeds the minimal repair cost and that is required to bring a substantially damaged building into compliance with the local flood damage prevention ordinance. Acceptable mitigation measures are floodproofing (nonresidential), relocation, elevation, demolition, or any combination thereof. All renewal and new policies with effective dates on or after June 1, 1997, include ICC coverage. 
    Letter of map change (LOMC) means an official FEMA determination, by letter, to amend or revise effective flood insurance rate maps, flood boundary and floodway maps, and flood insurance studies. LOMC's are broken down into the following categories: 
    Conditional letter of map revision (CLOMR) means a formal review and comment by FEMA as to whether a proposed project complies with the minimum NFIP floodplain management criteria. A CLOMR does not revise effective flood insurance rate maps, flood boundary and floodway maps, or flood insurance studies. 
    Letter of map amendment (LOMA) means an amendment based on technical data showing that a property was incorrectly included in a designated SFHA, was not elevated by fill (only by a natural grade elevation), and will not be inundated by the one percent chance flood. A LOMA amends the current effective FIRM and establishes that a specific property is not located in a SFHA. 
    Letter of map revision (LOMR) means a revision based on technical data that, usually due to manmade changes, shows changes to flood zones, flood elevations, floodplain and floodway delineations, and planimetric features. One common type of LOMR, a LOMR-F, is a determination concerning whether a structure or parcel has been elevated by fill above the BFE and is, therefore, excluded from the SFHA. 
    Levee means a man-made structure; usually an earthen embankment designed and constructed in accordance with sound engineering practices to contain, control, or divert the flow of water so as to provide protection from temporary flooding. 
    Levee system means a flood protection system which consists of a levee, or levees, and associated structures, such as closure and drainage devices, which are constructed and operated in accordance with sound engineering practices. For a levee system to be recognized, the following criteria must be met. All closure devices or mechanical systems for internal drainage, whether manual or automatic, must be operated in accordance with an officially adopted operation manual (a copy of which must be provided to FEMA by the operator when levee or drainage system recognition is being sought or revised). All operations must be under the jurisdiction of a federal or state agency, an agency created by federal or state law, or an agency of a community participating in the NFIP. 
    Low hazard dam means a class of dam in which failure would at the most result in damage to agricultural land, farm buildings (excluding residences), or minor roads. 
    Lowest adjacent grade means the elevation of the sidewalk, patio, deck support, or basement entryway immediately next to the structure and after the completion of construction. It does not include earth that is placed for aesthetic or landscape reasons around a foundation wall. It does include natural ground or properly compacted fill that comprises a component of a building's foundation system. 
    Lowest floor means the lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area (including basement). An unfinished or flood resistant enclosure, used solely for parking of vehicles, building access, or storage, in an area other than a basement, is not considered a building's lowest floor, provided that such enclosure is not built so as to render the structure in violation of the non-elevation provisions of this code. 
    Manufactured home (44 CFR 59.1 definition/FEMA) means a structure, transportable in one or more sections, which is built on a permanent chassis and designed to be used with or without a permanent foundation when attached to the required utilities. The term manufactured home does not include a "recreational vehicle." 
    Manufactured housing (24 CFR 3280.3 and 3285.5 definitions/HUD) means "...a structure, transportable in one or more sections, which in the traveling mode is eight body feet or more in width or 40 body feet in length or which when erected on-site is 320 or more square feet, and which is built on a permanent chassis and designed to be used as a dwelling with or without a permanent foundation when connected to the required utilities." 
    Manufactured home park or subdivision means a parcel (or contiguous parcels) of land divided into two or more manufactured home lots for rent or sale. 
    Map amendment means a change to an effective NFIP map that results in the exclusion from the SFHA or an individual structure or a legally described parcel of land that has been inadvertently included in the SFHA (i.e., no alterations of topography have occurred since the date of the first NFIP map that showed the structure or parcel to be within the SFHA. 
    Map panel number means the four-digit number followed by a letter suffix assigned by FEMA on a FIRM. The first four digits represent the map panel, and the letter suffix represents the number of times the map panel has been revised. 
    Market value means the property value (as agreed between a willing buyer and seller), excluding the value of land as established by what the local real estate market will bear. Market value can be established by independent certified appraisal; replacement cost depreciated by age of building (actual cash value); or adjusted assessed values. 
    Mean sea level means, for the purposes of the national flood insurance program, the National Geodetic Vertical Datum (NGVD) of 1929, North American Vertical Datum (NAVD) of 1988, or other datum, to which base flood elevations shown on a community's flood insurance rate map (FIRM) are referenced. 
    National flood insurance program (NFIP) is the federal program that makes flood insurance available to owners of property in participating communities nationwide through the cooperative efforts of the federal government and the private insurance industry. 
    National geodetic vertical datum (NGVD) means a vertical control, corrected in 1929, used as a reference for establishing varying elevations within the floodplain. 
    New construction means a structure or an addition to an existing structure for which the start of construction commenced on or after the effective date of a floodplain management regulation adopted by a community and any subsequent improvements to such structure or the addition. 
    New manufactured home park or subdivision means a manufactured home park or subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including at a minimum, the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is completed on or after the effective date of floodplain regulations adopted by a community. 
    Non-residential means, but is not limited to; small business concerns, churches, schools, farm buildings (including grain bins and silos), poolhouses, clubhouses, recreational buildings, mercantile structures, agricultural and industrial structures, warehouses, and hotels and motels with normal room rentals for less than six months' duration. 
    North American Vertical Datum (NAVD) of 1988 means a vertical control, corrected in 1988, used as a reference for establishing varying elevations within the floodplain. 
    Obstruction means, but is not limited to, any dam, wall, wharf, embankment, levee, dike, pile, abutment, protection, excavation, channel construction, bridge, culvert, building, wire, fence, rock, gravel, refuse, fill, structure, vegetation or other material in, along, across or projecting into any watercourse which may alter, impede, retard or change the direction and/or velocity of the flow of water, or due to its location, its propensity to snare or collect debris carried by the flow of water, or its likelihood of being carried downstream. 
    One percent flood (100-year flood) is the flood that has a one percent chance of being equaled or exceeded in any given year. Any flood zone that begins with the letter A or V is subject to inundation by the one percent chance flood. Over the life of a 30-year loan, there is a 26 percent chance of experiencing such a flood within the SFHA. 
    Participating community means any community that voluntarily elects to participate in the NFIP by adopting and enforcing floodplain management regulations that are consistent with the standards of the NFIP. 
    Post-FIRM construction means new construction and substantial improvements for which start of construction occurred after December 31, 1974, or on or after the effective date of the initial FIRM of the community, whichever is later. 
    Pre-FIRM construction means new construction and substantial improvements for which start of construction occurred on or before December 31, 1974, or before the effective date of the initial FIRM of the community, whichever is later. 
    Probation is a means of FEMA formally notifying participating communities of the first of the two NFIP sanctions due to their failure to correct violations and deficiencies in the administration and enforcement of the local floodplain management regulations. 
    Public safety and nuisance means anything which is injurious to the safety or health of an entire community or neighborhood, or any considerable number of persons, or unlawfully obstructs the free passage or use, in the customary manner, of any navigable lake, or river, bay, stream, canal, or basin. 
    Recreational vehicle means a vehicle that is: 
(1)  Licensed and titled as an RV or park model (not a permanent residence); 
(2)  Built on a single chassis; 
(3)  400 square feet or less when measured at the largest horizontal projection; 
(4)  Has no attached deck, porch, or shed; 
(5)  Has quick-disconnect sewage, water, and electrical connectors; 
(6)  Designed to be self-propelled or permanently towable by a light duty truck, and; 
(7)  Designed primarily not for use as a permanent dwelling but as temporary living quarters for recreational, camping, travel, or seasonal use. 
    Regular program means the second phase of the community's participation in the NFIP in which second layer coverage is available based upon risk premium rates only after FEMA has competed a risk study for the community. 
    Regulatory floodway means the channel of a river or other watercourse and the adjacent land areas that must be reserved in order to discharge the base flood without cumulatively increasing the water surface elevation more than one foot. 
    Repair means the reconstruction or renewal of any part of an existing building for which the start of construction commenced on or after the effective date of a floodplain management regulation adopted by a community and all such regulations effective at the time of permitting must be met 
    Repetitive loss means flood-related damages sustained by a structure on two separate occasions during a ten-year period for which the cost of repairs at the time of each such flood event, on the average, equals or exceeds 25 percent of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred. 
    Repetitive loss property is any insurable building for which two or more claims of more than $1,000.00 were paid by the national flood insurance program (NFIP) within any rolling ten-year period, since 1978. At least two of the claims must be more than ten days apart but, within ten years of each other. A repetitive loss property may or may not be currently insured by the NFIP. 
    Section 1316 means that section of the National Flood Insurance Act of 1968, as amended, which states that no new flood insurance coverage shall be provided for any property that FEMA finds has been declared by a duly constituted state or local zoning authority or other authorized public body to be in violation of state or local laws, regulations, or ordinances that are intended to discourage or otherwise restrict land development or occupancy in flood-prone areas. 
    Severe repetitive loss structure means any insured property that has met at least one of the following paid flood loss criteria since 1978, regardless of ownership: 
(1)  Four or more separate claim payments of more than $5,000.00 each (including building and contents payments); or 
(2)  Two or more separate claim payments (building payments only) where the total of the payments exceeds the current market value of the property. 
In either case, two of the claim payments must have occurred within ten years of each other. Multiple losses at the same location within ten days of each other are counted as one loss, with the payment amounts added together. 
    Significant hazard dam means a dam assigned the significant hazard potential classification where failure may cause damage to main roads, minor railroads, or cause interruption of use, or service of relatively important public utilities. 
    Special flood hazard area (SFHA) means that portion of the floodplain subject to inundation by the base flood and/or flood-related erosion hazards as shown on a FHBM or FIRM as zones A, AE, AH, AO, AR, AR/AE, AR/AO, AR/AH, AR/A, A99, or VE. 
    Start of construction (for other than new construction or substantial improvements under the Coastal Barrier Resources Act P. L. 97-348), includes substantial improvement, and means the date the building permit was issued, provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction, or improvement was within 180 days of the permit date.

(9)  Any alteration, repair, reconstruction or improvements to a building that is in compliance with the provisions of this article shall meet the requirements of new construction as contained in this article. 
(10)  Any alteration, repair, reconstruction or improvements to a building that is not in compliance with the provisions of this article, shall be undertaken only if said non-conformity shall meet the requirements of new construction as contained in this article. 
(11)  All gas and liquid storage tanks (both above and below ground) shall be adequately anchored to prevent floatation, lateral movement resulting from hydrodynamic forces, and the effects of buoyancy. 
(12)  When new construction and substantial improvements are located in multiple flood zones or in a flood zone with multiple base flood elevations, they shall meet the requirement for the more stringent flood zone and the highest base flood elevation. 
(13)  New construction and substantial improvement of any building (both in and outside the SFHA) shall have the lowest floor (including basement) at least six inches above the centerline of the designated street, unless the topography of the property does not allow for strict adherence as determined by the floodplain administrator. 
(14)  All new horizontal additions must have the lowest floor and all HVAC elevated to the regulatory base flood elevation. 
(15)  New construction and substantial improvements of structures built on fill (only allowed outside of the CHHA and Coastal AE Zone) shall be constructed on properly designed and compacted fill that extends ten feet to 15 feet beyond the building walls before dropping below the base flood elevation, and shall have appropriate protection from erosion and scour as follows: 
a.  Fill sites, upon which structures will be constructed or placed, must be compacted to 95 percent of the maximum density obtainable with the standard proctor test method or an acceptable equivalent method. 
b.  Fill slopes shall be no steeper than one foot vertical to two feet horizontal. 
c.  Adequate protection against erosion must be provided for fill slopes. When expected velocities during the occurrence of the base flood are greater than five feet per second, armoring with stone or rock protection or material that will provide equivalent resistance will be provided. When expected velocities during the base flood are five feet per second or appropriate protection shall be provided by covering them with vegetative cover at a minimum. 
d.  Fill shall be composed of clean granular or earthen material. 
(16)  Storage or processing of materials that are hazardous, flammable, explosive, or in time of flooding could become buoyant and pose an obstruction to flow, are prohibited within the community special flood hazard areas, to include identified floodways. Storage of material or equipment not otherwise prohibited shall be firmly anchored to prevent flotation. 
( Ord. of 01-10-2017(2), art. 5, § A ) 
Sec. 34-82. - Specific standards for Riverine zones. 
    In all areas of special flood hazard designated on the community's FIRM, where base flood elevation data have been provided (excluding CHHA and Coastal AE Zone), as set forth in section 34-33, the following provisions, in addition to the standards of 34-81, are required: 
(1)  Residential construction. New construction and substantial improvement of any residential building (including manufactured home) shall have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated to no lower than the base flood elevation. Should solid foundation perimeter walls be used to elevate a structure, flood openings sufficient to automatically equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls of enclosures that are subject to flooding, shall be provided in accordance with standards of subsection (4) of this section. 
(2)  Non-residential construction. New construction and substantial improvement of any commercial, industrial, or non-residential building (including manufactured building) shall have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated to no lower than the base flood elevation. Buildings located in all A zones may, together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities, be floodproofed in lieu of being elevated provided that all areas of the building below the base flood elevation plus a minimum of 12 inches of freeboard are water tight with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water, and use structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and the effect of buoyancy. Dry floodproofing is allowed only where flood velocities are less than or equal to five feet per second. A registered professional engineer or architect shall certify that the standards of this subsection are satisfied. A flood emergency operation plan and an inspection and maintenance plan must be provided by the design professional for the building. Such certification shall be provided to the floodplain administrator. 
(3)  In special flood hazard areas with base flood elevations (AE zones) but without floodways, no encroachments, including fill material or structures, shall be permitted unless certification by a registered professional engineer is provided demonstrating that the cumulative effect of the proposed development, when combined with all other existing and anticipated development, will not increase the water surface elevation of the base flood more than one foot at any point within the community. The engineering certification must be supported by technical data that conforms to standard hydraulic engineering principles. 
(4)  Enclosures. New construction and substantial improvements that include fully enclosed areas formed by foundation and other exterior walls below the lowest floor shall be designed to preclude finished living space and designed to allow for the entry and exit of floodwaters to automatically equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls. Enclosed areas, including crawl spaces, shall be used solely for parking of vehicles, building access, and storage. 
a.  Designs for complying with this requirement must either be certified by a professional engineer or architect or meet or exceed the following criteria:

    When base flood elevation data and floodway data are not available in accordance with section 34-32, in special flood hazard areas and community flood hazard areas without base flood elevation data, new construction and substantial improvements shall be elevated or floodproofed to elevations established by the community. The following provisions in addition to the standards of section 34-81 and the enclosure standards of section 34-82(4) shall apply: 
(1)  Require that all new subdivision proposals and other proposed developments (including proposals for manufactured home parks and subdivisions) greater than 50 lots or five acres, whichever is lesser, include within such proposals base flood elevation data; 
(2)  The floodplain administrator shall obtain, review, and reasonably utilize any base flood elevation and floodway data available from a federal, state, or other source, in order to administer the provisions of this division. When such data are available, standards of section 34-82, shall apply. If data is not available from section 34-82(4)or outside sources, then the following provisions shall apply. 
(3)  No encroachments, including fill material or other development, shall be located within a distance of the stream bank equal to five times the width of the stream at the top of the bank or 20 feet each side from the top of the bank, whichever is greater, unless certification by a registered professional engineer is provided demonstrating that such encroachment shall not result in any increase in flood levels during the occurrence of the base flood discharge. The enclosure standards of section 34-82(4) shall apply. 
(4)  Fill within the area of special flood hazard shall result in no net loss of natural floodplain storage. The volume of loss of floodwater storage due to filling in the special flood hazard area shall be offset by providing an equal volume of flood storage by excavation or other compensatory measures at or adjacent to the development site. 
(5)  Notify, in riverine situations, adjacent communities and the state coordinating office prior to any alteration or relocation of a watercourse, and submit copies of such notifications to FEMA. Assure that the flood carrying capacity within the altered or relocated portion of any watercourse is maintained. 
(6)  Require that all manufactured homes be placed or installed using methods and practices which minimize flood damage. Manufactured homes must be elevated and anchored to resist flotation, collapse, or lateral movement.

(e)  All preliminary plans for platted subdivisions shall identify the flood hazard area and the elevation of the base flood. 
(f)  All final subdivision plats will provide the boundary of the special flood hazard area, the floodway boundary, and the base flood elevations. 
(g)  In platted subdivisions, all proposed lots or parcels that will be future building sites shall have a minimum buildable area outside the natural (non-filled) 1 percent chance annual floodplain. The buildable area shall be large enough to accommodate any primary structure and associated structures such as sheds, barns, swimming pools, detached garages, on-site sewage disposal systems, and water supply wells, where applicable. 
( Ord. of 01-10-2017(2), art. 5, § D ) 
Sec. 34-85. - Critical facilities. 
    Construction of new and substantially improved critical facilities shall be located outside the limits of the special flood hazard area (one percent chance floodplain). Floodproofing and sealing measures must be implemented to ensure that toxic substances will not be displaced by or released into floodwaters. Multiple access routes, elevated to or above the 0.2 percent flood elevation, shall be provided to all critical facilities to the maximum extent possible. Critical facilities must not only be protected to or above the 0.2 percent chance flood, but must remain operable during such an event. The community's flood response plan must list facilities considered critical in a flood, since loss of access can cause a critical situation. Other facilities in low risk flood zones that may also be needed to support flood response efforts must be included on the critical facility list.

( Ord. of 01-10-2017(2), art. 6, § B ) 
Sec. 34-103. - Variance procedures. 
    In passing upon such applications, the board of appeals/planning commission shall consider all technical evaluations, relevant factors, and standards specified in other sections of this article, and: 
(1)  The evaluation must be based on the characteristics unique to that property and not be shared by adjacent parcels. The characteristics must pertain to the land itself, not to the structure, its inhabitants, or its owners; 
(2)  Variances should never be granted for multiple lots, phases of subdivisions, or entire subdivisions; 
(3)  The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the injury of others; 
(4)  The danger of life and property due to flooding or erosion damage; 
(5)  The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner and the community; 
(6)  The importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to the community; 
(7)  The necessity of the facility to be at a waterfront location, where applicable; 
(8)  The availability of alternative locations for the proposed use which are not subject to flooding or erosion damage; 
(9)  The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated development; 
(10)  The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan and floodplain management program for that area; 
(11)  The safety of access to the property in times of flood for ordinary and emergency vehicles; 
(12)  The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise, and sediment transport of the floodwaters and the effects of wave action, if applicable, expected at the site, and;

(1)  A showing of good and sufficient cause; 
(2)  A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship, and; 
(3)  A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public expense, create nuisance, cause fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances. 
(b)  The provisions of this article are minimum standards for flood loss reduction; therefore any deviation from the standards must be weighed carefully. Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary deviation from the requirements of this article, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief. In the instance of a historic structure, a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary so as not to destroy the historic character and design of the building. (See section 34-106.) 
(c)  Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice specifying the difference between the base flood elevation and the elevation to which the lowest floor is to be built and stating that the cost of flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the reduced lowest floor elevation. 
(d)  The floodplain administrator shall maintain the records of all appeal actions and report any variances to the federal emergency management agency and state emergency management agency upon request. (See section 34-105.) 
(e)  Upon consideration of the factors listed above and the purposes of this article, the board of appeals/planning commission may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes of this article. 
(f)  Variances shall not be issued after the fact. 
( Ord. of 01-10-2017(2), art. 6, § D ) 
Sec. 34-105. - Variance notification. 
(a)  Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice over the signature of a community official that: 
(1)  The issuance of a variance to construct a structure below the base flood elevation will result in increased premium rates for flood insurance up to amounts as high as $25.00 for $100.00 of insurance coverage, and; 
(2)  Such construction below the base flood level increases risks to life and property. A copy of the notice shall be recorded by the floodplain administrator in the Office of the Chancery Clerk of Bolivar County and shall be recorded in a manner so that it appears in the chain of title of the affected parcel of land. 
(b)  The floodplain administrator will maintain a record of all variance actions, including justification for their issuance, and report such variances issued in the community's biennial report submission to the Federal Emergency Management Agency. 
( Ord. of 01-10-2017(2), art. 6, § E ) 
Sec. 34-106. - Historic structures. 
    Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic structures only upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a historic structure and the variance is the minimum to preserve the historic character and design of the structure. 
( Ord. of 01-10-2017(2), art. 6, § F ) 
Sec. 34-107. - Special conditions.

DIVISION 1. - GENERALLY 

Sec. 42-36. - Authority. 
    By virtue of MCA 1972, § 39-13-5, as amended, the city is authorized to establish a preservation commission to preserve, promote and develop the city's historical resources and to advise the city on the designation of preservation districts, landmarks and landmark sites and perform such other functions as may be provided by law. 
(Code 1996, § 42-36; Ord. of 6-6-1995, § III) 
Sec. 42-37. - Created. 
    There is hereby created the Cleveland Heritage Commission. 
(Code 1996, § 42-37; Ord. of 6-6-1995, § III) 
Sec. 42-38. - Appointment, terms. 
    The members of the commission shall be appointed by the city and shall serve at the will and pleasure of the city. All members of the commission shall serve for terms established by the city and shall be eligible for reappointment. 
(Code 1996, § 42-38; Ord. of 6-6-1995, § III) 
Sec. 42-39. - Composition, qualifications. 
(a)  The commission shall consist of not fewer than nine members resident in the city unless the state enabling legislation is amended to allow for a smaller commission, at which time the city may choose to decrease the size of the commission in conformity with state law. 
(b)  All commission members shall have a demonstrated knowledge of or interest, competence or expertise in historic preservation. To the extent available in the community, the city shall appoint professional members from the primary historic preservation-related disciplines such as urban planning, American studies, American civilization, cultural geography, cultural anthropology, interior design, law and related fields. In conformity with the State of Mississippi, Guidelines and Regulations for the Certified Local Government Program, the city shall document a good faith effort to locate professionals to serve on the commission before appointing lay members. 
(c)  The city shall publish at least one notice in a newspaper in its jurisdiction to solicit responses from citizens who are professionals in the related fields of historic preservation and who are interested in serving on the commission. The city may contact known professionals and interested lay persons and invite submission of their qualifications in written resume form. 
(d)  The city shall provide three weeks (15 working days) for responses. Respondents shall submit, in written resume form, information concerning their demonstrated interest, competence, knowledge or expertise. Such information should include, but is not limited to, educational and professional background, membership in appropriate preservation organizations, subscriptions to suitable professional publications, volunteer work, attendance at workshops and seminars and other relevant experience. 
(e)  When the city has collected adequate information concerning the potential appointees to the commission, it shall decide, with the assistance of the state historic preservation office, if desired, which candidates can be considered professionals and thereby qualified for appointment to the commission. 
(Code 1996, § 42-39; Ord. of 6-6-1995, § III) 
Sec. 42-40. - Disqualification of members by conflicts of interest. 
    Because the city may possess few residents with experience in the individual fields of history, architecture, architectural history, archaeology, urban planning, law, or real estate, and in order not to impair such residents from practicing their trade for hire, members of the commission are allowed to contract their services to an applicant for a certificate of appropriateness, and, when doing so, must expressly disqualify themselves from the commission during all discussions for that application. In such cases, the city shall, upon the request of the chairperson of the commission or the vice-chairperson in his stead, appoint a substitute member who is qualified in the same field as the disqualified member, and who will serve for that particular case only. If no qualified resident of the city is able to substitute for the disqualified member, the city may appoint, in this case only, a qualified substitute who is a resident of the state but not a resident of the city. If any member of the commission must be disqualified due to a conflict of interest on a regular and continuing basis, the chairperson or the vice-chairperson, in his stead, shall encourage the member to resign his commission seat. Failing this resignation, and, if the commission member continues to enter into conflict of interest situations with the commission, the chairperson or vice-chairperson of the commission shall encourage the city to replace the member. Likewise, any member of the commission who has an interest in the property in question or in property within 300 feet of such a property, or who is employed with a firm that has been hired to aid the applicant in any matter whatsoever, or who has any proprietary, tenancy or personal interest in a matter to be considered by the commission shall be disqualified from participating in the consideration of any request for a certificate of appropriateness involving such a property. In such cases, a qualified substitute shall be appointed as provided above. 
(Code 1996, § 42-40; Ord. of 6-6-1995, § XIX) 
Sec. 42-41. - Rules of procedure. 
    To fulfill the purposes of this chapter and carry out the provisions contained therein: 
(1)  The commission annually shall elect from its membership a chairperson and vice-chairperson. It shall select a secretary from its membership or its staff. If neither the chairperson nor the vice-chairperson attends a particular meeting, the remaining members shall select an acting chairperson from the members in attendance at such meeting. 
(2)  The commission shall develop and adopt rules of procedure which shall govern the conduct of its business, subject to the approval of the city. Such rules of procedure shall be a matter of public record. 
(3)  The commission shall develop design review guidelines for determining appropriateness as generally set forth in section 42-117. Such criteria shall, insofar as possible, be consistent with local, state and federal guidelines and regulations, including, but not limited to, building safety and fire codes and the Secretary of the Interior's Standards for Rehabilitation. 
(4)  The commission shall keep minutes and records of all meetings and proceedings including voting records, attendance, resolutions, findings, determinations and decisions. All such material shall be a matter of public record.

(5)  Notice of the time and place of said hearing shall be given by publication in a newspaper having general circulation in the city at least ten days before such hearing and by posting such notice on the bulletin board in the lobby of city hall. 
(6)  At such hearing, the applicant for a certificate of appropriateness shall have the right to present any relevant evidence in support of the application. Likewise, the board of aldermen shall have the right to present any additional relevant evidence in support of the application. 
(7)  The commission shall have the right to recommend changes and modifications to enable the applicant to meet the requirements of the commission. 
(8)  Within not more than 21 days after the hearing on an application, the commission shall act upon it, either approving, denying or deferring action until the next meeting of the commission, giving consideration to the factors set forth in section 42-117. Evidence of approval of the application shall be by certificate of appropriateness issued by the commission and, whatever its decision, notice in writing shall be given to the applicant and the city building inspector.

(1)  Property values and general welfare of the community are founded, in part, upon the appearance and maintenance of private property;

Such system may hereinafter be referred to as "alarm system" or "E.A.S." and such designation may be used in any proceedings or circumstances of which it may be a subject. It is understood that this does not include alarm systems owned by the city when the systems are utilized on premises owned or operated by the city. The provisions of this section shall not be applicable to audible alarms affixed to automobiles nor to audible smoke detectors. 
    False alarm means the activation of an alarm system when no emergency exists through mechanical failure, malfunction, improper installation or through the negligence of the owner or user of the alarm system, which activation results in a response by the police or fire department or other emergency service agency. 
    Malicious false alarm means the intentional and false reporting to the police, fire or other emergency department of an emergency condition, or the intentional setting off of an alarm system which will be transmitted to, or which will cause another to report the signal to, the police, fire or other emergency service, and which setting off or reporting will call upon the such service to respond, when no emergency exists. However, this is not to include the testing of an alarm system by a licensed alarm business under guidelines established by the police, fire or other emergency service agency. This section shall not apply to the testing of alarms or alarm systems when the testing has been done in accordance with instructions or prescribed guidelines set by the police department or other emergency department and when the police or other emergency department has been given advance notice of such testing. 
    Notice means written notice, given by the issuance of a citation left at the scene from which a false alarm originated by officers of the police or fire departments, or given by U.S. mail addressed to the owner, lessee or other designated operator to be notified at his last known address. Service of such notice shall be effective upon the completion of personal service or upon the placing of the same in the custody of the U.S. Postal Service.

Sec. 50-25. - Curfew for minors. 
(a)  This section shall be known and may be cited as the "Nocturnal Curfew Ordinance." 
(b)  The mayor and board of aldermen hereby determines that large numbers of juveniles have been congregating in the city after dark causing general disturbances to residents and contributing to an excessive number of incidents of drug and alcohol related crimes, thefts, homicides and assaults, including a high proportion of crimes committed by and against juveniles. 
(c)  Said board finds and determines that special and extenuating circumstances presently exist within this city that call for special regulations of minors within the city in order to protect them from each other and from other persons on the street during the nocturnal hours, to aid in crime prevention, to promote parental supervision and authority over minors and to decrease incidents of nocturnal juvenile crime. 
(d)  In accordance with the prevailing community standards, this section serves to regulate the conduct of juveniles on streets during nocturnal hours, to be effectively and consistently enforced for the protection of the juveniles in this city from each other and from other persons on the streets during the nocturnal hours, for the enforcement of parental control of, authority over and responsibility for their children, for the protection of the public from nocturnal mischief by juveniles, for the reduction in the incidents of juvenile criminal activity and for the furtherance of family responsibility and for the public good, safety and welfare. 
(e)  The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this section, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this subsection, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning. When not inconsistent with the context, words used in the present tense include the future, words in the plural number include the singular, and words in the singular number include the plural. The word "shall" is always mandatory and not merely directory. 
    Minor or juvenile means any un-emancipated person under the age of 18 years, or in equivalent phrasing often herein employed, any person 17 or less years of age. 
    Parent means any person having legal custody of a minor: 
(1)  As a natural or adoptive parent; 
(2)  As a legal guardian; 
(3)  As a person to whom legal custody has been given by order of the court; or 
(4)  As a person, caretaker or other custodian responsible for the care or support of such minor. 
    Police department means the police department headquarters, or police station, located at the intersection of South Street and Sharpe Avenue, in the city. 
    Remain means to stay behind, to tarry and to stay unnecessarily upon the street, including the congregating of groups (or of interacting minors) totaling four or more persons in which any minor involved would not be using the streets for ordinary or serious purposes as mere passage or going home. To implement that thought with additional precision and precaution, numerous exemptions are expressly defined in subsection (h) of this section so that this is not a mere prohibitory or presence type curfew ordinance. 
    Street means a way or place, of whatsoever nature, open to the use of the public right for purposes of vehicular travel or, in the case of a sidewalk thereof, for pedestrian travel. The term "street" includes the legal right-of-way, including, but not limited to, the traffic lanes, the curb, the sidewalk, whether paved or unpaved and any grass, plots or other grounds found within the legal right-of-way of the street. The term "street" applies irrespective of what it is called or formally named, whether alley, avenue, court, circle or road, or dedicated or otherwise. 
    Time of night referred to herein is based upon the prevailing standard of time, whether central standard time or daylight savings time, generally observed at that hour by the public in the city, and prima facie the time when observed in the city administrative offices and the police department. 
    Year of age continues from one birthday, such as the seventeenth, to (but not including the day of) the next, making it clear that 17 or less years of age is herein treated as equivalent to the phrase "under 18 years of age." 
(f)  It shall be unlawful for any minor under 18 years of age to remain in or upon any public street, highway, park, vacant lot, parking lot or other public place, including private or commercial places and parking lots open to and intended for use by the public, within the city during the period ending at 6:00 a.m. and beginning at: 
(1)  12:00 midnight Saturday and Sunday morning (i.e., also referred to as being 12:00 midnight on Fridays and Saturdays); and 
(2)  11:00 p.m. on Sunday night through Thursday night. 
(g)  It shall further be unlawful for a parent of a minor to knowingly permit or by inefficient or ineffective control to allow such minor to be or remain upon any city street or other public place as provided in subsection (f) of this section under circumstances not constituting any exception to, or otherwise beyond the scope of, the curfew ordinance. The term "knowingly" includes knowledge which a parent should reasonably be expected to have concerning the whereabouts of a minor in that parent's legal custody. It is intended to continue to keep neglectful or careless parents up to a reasonable community standard of parental responsibility through an objective test. It shall, a fortiori, be no defense that a parent was completely indifferent to the activities or conduct or whereabouts of such minor child. 
(h)  The following shall constitute valid exceptions to the operation of the curfew: 
(1)  At any time, if a minor is accompanied by his parent. 
(2)  When accompanied by an adult authorized by a parent of such minor to take said parent's place in accompanying said minor for a designated period of time and purpose within a specified time. 
(3)  Until the hour of 12:30 a.m. if the minor is on an errand as directed by his parent. 
(4)  If the minor is legally employed, for the period from 45 minutes before to 45 minutes after work, while going directly between his home and place of employment. This exception shall also apply if the minor is in a public place during curfew hours in the course of his employment. To come within this exception, the minor must be carrying a written statement of employment issued by employer pursuant to authorization of the chief of police to expire within 90 days. 
(5)  Until the hour of 12:30 a.m. if the minor is on the property of, or the sidewalk directly adjacent to, the place where such minor resides or the place immediately adjacent thereto if the owner of the adjacent building does not communicate an objection to the minor and the police officer. 
(6)  When returning home by a direct route from, and within 30 minutes of the termination of, a school activity or an activity of a religious or other voluntary organization, or a place of public entertainment, such as a movie, play or sporting event. This exception will not apply beyond 1:30 a.m. If the event is not commercial in nature or does not have a fixed, publicly known time at which it will or does end, the sponsoring organization must register the event with the chief of police or his designated representative at least 24 hours in advance, informing the police department of the time such event is scheduled to begin, the place at which it shall be held, the time at which it shall end and the name of the sponsoring organization. 
(7)  In the case of reasonable necessity, but only after such minor's parent has communicated to the police department personnel the facts establishing such reasonable necessity relating to specified streets at a designated time for a described purpose, including place or origin and destination. A copy of such communication, or the police record thereof, duly certified by the chief of police or his designee, as aforesaid, to be correct, an appropriate notation of the time it was received and of the names and addresses of such parent and minor shall constitute evidence of qualification under this exception. 
(8)  When exercising first amendment rights protected by the United States Constitution, such as the free exercise of religion, freedom of speech and the right of assembly. Such minor shall evidence the bona fides of such exercise and provide notice to city officials by first delivering to the police department a written communication, signed by such minor, and countersigned if practicable by a parent of such minor, with their home address and telephone number, addressed to the mayor of the city, specifying when, where, and in what manner said minor will be on the streets at night (including hours when the curfew ordinance is still otherwise applicable to said minor) in the exercise of a first amendment right specified in such communication. 
(9)  When a minor is, with parental consent, in a motor vehicle engaged in bona fide interstate travel through the city, particularly on U.S. Highway 61 and State Highway 8, and access roads to these interstate systems. This also exempts all interstate travel beginning or ending in the city. 
(10)  Each of the foregoing exceptions, and their several limitations, such as provisions for notification, are severable, as hereinafter provided, but here re-emphasized. 
(i)  A police officer of the city who has probable cause to believe a minor is in violation of this section shall: 
(1)  Ascertain the name and address of the minor; 
(2)  Issue the minor a written warning that the minor is in violation of this ordinance; and 
(3)  Order the minor to go promptly home by a direct route. 
(j)  Notwithstanding subsection (i)(1) of this section, a police officer who has probable cause to believe that a minor is in violation of this section shall transport the minor to the police department if: 
(1)  The minor has received one previous written warning for violation of this section; or 
(2)  Reasonable grounds exist to believe the minor has engaged in delinquent conduct. 
(k)  When a minor is taken to the police department, the minor's parents shall be immediately contacted. If after this contact there is still probable cause to believe the minor was violating this section, the minor shall be held until the parent comes to take the minor home. When the parent arrives, he shall be given a copy of this section. If no parent has arrived within two hours, the minor may be turned over to custody of the local youth court authorities until a parent can take custody of him. 
(l)  Parental notification; violation and penalty. 
(1)  In case of a second violation by a minor, the chief of police shall, by certified mail, send to the minor's parent written notice of said violation with a warning that any subsequent violation will result in a full or penal enforcement of the curfew ordinance, including the enforcement of parental responsibility and of applicable penalties. Said notice shall be sent to the minor's parent at his or her last known address and evidence of its mailing shall constitute sufficient notice of the minor's violation. 
(2)  If, after the mailing of the warning notice set forth in subsection (l)(1) of this section, of a second violation by a minor, a parent violates subsections (f) or (g) of this section in connection with a third violation by a minor, this shall be treated as a first offense by the parent. For such first parental offense, a parent shall be fined $25.00. For each subsequent offense by a parent the fine shall be increased by an additional $25.00 (e.g., $50.00 for the second, and $75.00 for the third offense). 
(m)  Any minor who shall violate any of the provisions of this article for more than two times shall be dealt with according to the Youth Court Law of the state as an offender thereunder, and in accordance with the directives of the county youth court, or such other court as shall have jurisdiction of said minor.

Sec. 70-25. - Enforcement of payment. 
(a)  If any consumer of the health and sanitation services furnished by the city fails to pay his fees, rents, tax or levies therefor, including those for water, garbage pickup, sanitary sewer or wastewater treatment and mosquito control, as hereinbefore set forth, by the tenth of the month next succeeding that for which the bill is rendered, the city water rate collector shall add a penalty of $25.00 as a late charge to the total charges due at that time. If any consumer of the health and sanitation services furnished by the city fails to pay his fees, rent, tax or levies for such services and the late charge by 5:00 p.m. on the 20th of the month next succeeding that for which the bill is rendered, the city shall cut off the water services and such other services from the premises of such delinquent consumer as provided by law, and it shall so remain until the customer pays in full such bill, tax, fee, rent or levy in arrears, including late charges. No separate notice of impending disconnection will be sent to the customer prior to interruption of service. For each service call to the premises of any water consumer, such consumer shall be charged the sum of $35.00 for service disconnection, providing reconnection only occurs upon payment in full of an account in arrears. Changes or revisions of the times, dates, or charges herein, or of the manner of collection, may hereafter be made by or upon order of the mayor and board of aldermen within their discretion. 
(b)  If the check for the payment of water, sewer and garbage is not honored upon the first presentation to the bank, a returned check/ACH fee in the amount of $40.00 will be charged to the customer. In the event of a returned check, payment in the form of credit/debit, cash, or money order must be remitted for a period of six months from the date of the returned payment. 
(Code 1996, § 66-30; Ord. of 2-6-1990, § 7(a), (b); Ord. of 4-2-1991, § 1; Ord. of 12-05-2017(3) ) 
Sec. 70-25-1. - Water leak adjustments. 
(a)  The City of Cleveland Water Department, in conjunction with Severn Trent, Inc. monitors customer water consumption per the Mi.Net meter reading web portal. In the event Mi.Net provides notification of a leak, the customer will be notified with the placement of a door hanger at the residence. The customer shall repair leaks promptly and may request an adjustment. 
(b)  Before a leak adjustment can be considered, the customer's usage shall be at least 100 percent above the customer's normal usage (Determined by meter readings). The customer's normal usage is determined by averaging the consumption of the prior two months. 
(c)  The customer must complete the leak adjustment request form to include documentation of the leak, as well as proof of repair (invoice, statement of work) and proof of payment (receipt, check copy, bank statement) for the repairs. If the repair was made by the customer, receipts for any material used in the repair will be considered proof. 
(d)  A leak adjustment is usually made on the basis of two months usage, as an undetectable leak will overlap two billing periods. However, the adjustment may be made for only one month. 
(e)  The customer's normal usage is determined by averaging the consumption of the prior two months. If the customer has no prior usage history, the normal usage will be determined from average customer usage for the customer classification, (i.e. commercial, residential). The adjustment shall be made for half the leak amount above the normal usage. For example, if normal usage is 10,000 gallons and the total usage including leakage is 50,000 gallons. The leakage amount is 40,000 and the adjustment shall be made for half or 20,000 gallons and the customer shall pay for the adjusted usage of 30,000 gallons (normal usage plus half of the leak). Adjustments will be made to water consumption charges only. However, sewer charges will be adjusted if the leak did not flow into the sewer system. As such, sewer adjustments for leaking toilets will not be allowed. 
(f)  The customer must continue to pay their normal usage charges during the processing of the leak adjustment to avoid service interruption. Failure to remit such payment prior to the 21st of the month will result in the disconnection of services. 
(g)  Only one leak adjustment shall be made for a customer in a 12 month period. 
( Ord. of 12-05-2017(3) ) 
Sec. 70-25-2. - Additional water service policies. 
    Water will also be disconnected and customers will be assessed additional charges under the following conditions. 
(a)  If a water meter is intentionally defaced, destroyed, or in any manner altered or tampered with, the customer will be charged a minimum of $100.00 for unreported water consumption plus the cost of repairs, including labor and materials. Materials include the cost of the meter and any devices attached to aid in the reading of the meter. 
(b)  Water service may be disconnected if service personnel identify a major leak, technical or mechanical problem that requires immediate attention. Water will be reinstated as soon as the problem has been corrected. 
(c)  Special cases: fire, acts of God and other unpredictable situations, will be reviewed on a case-by-case basis. 
(d)  It is the responsibility of the customer to notify the utility when there is a change in mailing address and a change in tenant if in an owner-renter situation. The owner of the property is ultimately responsible for payment on the account in the event of a dispute between the property owner and the tenant.

ARTICLE 1. - INTRODUCTORY PROVISIONS 

Sec. 101. - Title. 
    This document shall be known and referred to as the Land Development Ordinance of the City of Cleveland, Mississippi. 
Sec. 102. - Purpose. 
    This Land Development Ordinance has been prepared in accordance with the City of Cleveland's Comprehensive Plan and is enacted to preserve and promote the public health, safety, and general welfare of the citizens of the City of Cleveland. This Ordinance is to generally encourage and facilitate orderly, healthy, and efficient, physical and economical growth and expansion of the City. Specific Articles within this Ordinance may create regulations applicable to certain areas of the City for the purpose of reasonably preserving and promoting the character of these specific areas and encouraging the most appropriate use of land. 
    Specific Purposes. In addition to the overall general purpose and goal of this Land Development Ordinance, the City of Cleveland also recognizes individual and specific purposes for the enactment of this Ordinance. Those more specific purposes and goals are: 
1.  To avoid undue concentration of population and prevent the overcrowding of land by controlling the division of land and regulating the density of existing and proposed developments. 
2.  To prevent injury and secure safety from fire, crime, panic, flooding, and other dangers. 
3.  To protect property values along with the integrity and character of neighborhoods by establishing design regulations for existing buildings or sites, and new construction. 
4.  To separate incompatible uses and prevent the unusual mixture of land uses, indoors and outdoors, by enacting zoning districts and regulations which control the location of uses. 
5.  To lessen congestion on the streets by establishing minimum standards governing the construction of streets and utilities as well as other public improvements and by ensuring proper coordination of future planned streets and future improvements to existing streets. 
6.  To facilitate the provision of transportation, water, sewerage, schools, parks, and other public facilities and requirements. 
7.  To promote a pro-active growth and development strategy that will maintain the long-term economic viability and the quality of life of the City of Cleveland. 
8.  To preserve, enhance, and perpetuate those aspects of the City having historical, cultural, architectural, and archeological merit. 
9.  To encourage specific design and architectural principles for developments which create innovative and unique solutions that are practical as well as aesthetically pleasing and harmonious in appearance. 
10.  To promote and enhance the City's attractions to visitors and to support business and industry through the continued use, preservation, and revitalization of its resources. 
Sec. 103. - Interpretation. 
    In interpreting and applying this Ordinance, its provisions shall be held to the minimum requirements for the promotion of the public safety, health, convenience, comfort, morals, prosperity, and general welfare. It is not the intent of this Ordinance to interfere with, abrogate or annul any ordinance, rules, regulations, or permits previously adopted or issued that are not in conflict with any of the provisions of this Ordinance. Nor is it the intent of this Ordinance to interfere with, abrogate or annul any easement, covenant, or other agreements between parties except where this Ordinance imposes greater restrictions, in which case this Ordinance shall control. 
Sec. 104. - Conflict and repeal. 
    All ordinances or parts of ordinances in conflict with this Land Development Ordinance are repealed, but nothing contained herein shall prevent the prosecution of any person or the bringing of a civil action to enjoin any person for the prior violation of any ordinance or part of any ordinance hereby repealed. 
Sec. 105. - Severability 
    If any part, section, subsection, paragraph, sentence, clause, or phrase of this Ordinance should be declared invalid for any reason whatsoever, such decision shall not affect the remaining portion of this Ordinance, which shall remain in full force and effect. To this end the provisions of this Ordinance are hereby declared severable. It is intended that the Ordinance be held inapplicable in such cases, if any, where its application would be unconstitutional. A constitutional construction is intended and shall be given. The Mayor and Board of Aldermen do not intend to violate the Constitution of the State of Mississippi or the Constitution of the United States of America. 
Sec. 106. - Effective date 
    This ordinance shall be published and shall become effective and be in force one month from and after its passage as provided by law. 
ARTICLE 2. - REVIEW AND DECISION-MAKING BODIES 

Sec. 201. - Mayor and Board of Aldermen. 
    The Mayor and Board of Aldermen act as the Governing Body for the City of Cleveland. They have authorized the establishment of the other decision-making bodies as described below. As specifically related to the Land Development Ordinance, their primary duties include, but are not limited to, the following: 
A.  Appointing Committee Members. The Mayor and Board of Aldermen appoint members to the various committees and boards such as the Planning Commission, Board of Appeals, and Heritage Commission and shall determine the appropriate terms for members to serve. 
B.  Hearings and Decisions. The Mayor and Board of Aldermen shall hear recommendations from the Planning Commission regarding rezoning and subdivision applications and shall make the final decision. Final approval of subdivision plats and other data shall be the responsibility of the Mayor and Board of Aldermen as prescribed by law. In regards to rezoning, the Mayor and Board of Aldermen shall also hold the appropriate public hearing and publish sufficient notice according to Article 5, Section 507. The Mayor and Board of Aldermen and the City Clerk shall hold the Official version of the Zoning Map. 
The Mayor and Board of Aldermen shall hear any appeals from decisions of the Board of Appeals regarding Special Exceptions, Variances, and appeals of decisions made by the Building Official, Code Enforcement officer, and the Plan Review Committee. 
The Mayor and Board of Aldermen shall hear recommendations from the Board of Appeals regarding special exceptions for restaurant uses located in the B-1 zoning district and be the body with approval authority for such uses. A notice and public hearing shall be required prior to approval of any B-1 restaurant use. 
The Mayor and Board of Aldermen shall also hear recommendations from the Board of Appeals regarding special approval for the consumption of alcoholic beverages. They shall specifically review and be the only body with approval authority for all applications for facilities that provide for the consumption of beer, wine or alcoholic beverages upon the premises. Such approvals shall be personal to the applicant and therefore not transferable, may be reviewed at any time, and terminated by the Mayor and Board of Aldermen upon finding that such uses are adversely affecting the public interest. Prior to the special approval and granting of uses with the sale alcoholic beverages to be consumed upon any premises by the Mayor and Board of Aldermen, public notices shall not be required but such notices may be given within the discretion of the Mayor and Board of Aldermen. 
The Mayor and Board of Aldermen shall also hear appeals from the Heritage Commission and shall designate historic districts, landmarks, or sites in consultation with the Heritage Commission. 
Sec. 202. - Planning commission. 
    The City of Cleveland Planning Commission is authorized and directed to advise and assist the Mayor and Board of Aldermen in the administration and coordination of these regulations. The Department of Community Development is authorized and directed to enforce all provisions of this Land Development Ordinance. 
    The Planning Commission is charged with the responsibility of reviewing and making recommendations to the Mayor and Board of Aldermen regarding amendments to Article 6, Zoning and to the Official Zoning Map and regarding preliminary subdivision plat approval. Where the Plan Review Committee feels additional review is necessary, the Planning Commission may also be responsible for reviewing and approving site plans for multi-family and other non-residential developments in Cleveland. 
Sec. 203. - Planning commission acting as the board of appeals. 
    The City of Cleveland Planning Commission is also designated as the Board of Appeals. The Planning Commission and/or Board of Appeals shall adopt rules necessary to the conduct of its affairs and in accordance with the provisions of this Ordinance. 
    An appeal stays all proceedings in furtherance of the action appealed from unless a stay would cause eminent peril to life or property as certified to the Board of Appeals by the officer from whom the appeal is taken. In such cases, proceedings shall not be stayed other than by a restraining order which may be granted by the Board of Appeals or by a Court of Record, on application or notice to the officer from whom the appeal is taken and on cause shown. 
    The Board of Appeals shall have the following powers and duties: 
A.  Administrative Review. To hear and decide appeals from persons aggrieved by any officer, department, board or bureau of the City of Cleveland, or affected by any decision of the Building Official, Code Enforcement Officer, or Plan Review Committee; OR where it is alleged there is an error in any order, requirement, decision or determination made by an administrative official in the enforcement of this Ordinance. Upon the hearing of an appeal, the Board of Appeals is empowered to permit the following exceptions: 
1.  To permit the extension of a zoning use district where the boundary line of a district divides a lot or parcel of land in single ownership as shown on record, provided the distance involved does not exceed fifty (50) feet. 
2.  To permit the erection and use of a building or the use of premises in any location of a public service corporation for public utility purposes which the Board deems reasonably necessary for the public convenience or welfare. 
3.  To interpret the provisions of this Ordinance, where street layout actually on the ground varies from the street layout as shown by the Official Zoning Map. 
4.  The Board of Appeals shall make a finding, and may grant the special exception as authorized, provided such special exception will not adversely affect the public interest. 
5.  In the granting of any exception or special exception, the Board of Appeals may prescribe appropriate conditions and safeguards in conformity with this Ordinance. Violations of such conditions and safeguards when made a part of the terms under which the special exception is granted, shall be deemed a violation of this Ordinance and shall be punishable under Article 3 of this Ordinance. 
6.  Every special exception authorized shall not be personal to the applicant, but shall be transferable and shall run with the land until change pursuant to the provisions of this Ordinance for changes or amendments. 
7.  The Board of Appeals shall prescribe a time limit which action on the special exception will be commenced, completed, or both. Failure to commence or complete such action within the time limit set shall void the special exception. 
B.  Variances. Where the strict application of this Ordinance would result in peculiar and exceptional practical difficulties to or exceptional hardship upon the owner of such property, the Board of Appeals is empowered to authorize upon an appeal relating to such property, a variation from such strict application so as to relieve such difficulties or hardships. For example, by reason of exceptional narrowness, shallowness, or shape of a specific piece of property at the time of the original adoption of the regulations, or by reason of exceptional topographical conditions or other extraordinary or exceptional situation or condition of a specific piece of property, or by reason of the location of trees, natural drainage courses, lakes or other desirable or attractive features, which condition is not generally prevalent in the neighborhood. 
The potential for economic loss or gain on the part of the applicant resulting from the action of the Board of Appeals shall not be considered a sufficient basis for the approval of any variance. The fact that an owner could realize a greater financial return by a use of his property that is contrary to these regulations is not a sufficient reason for change. Hardship cannot be proved where it can be shown that property was purchased with the knowledge of existing restrictions, nor can hardship be claimed in terms of prospective sales or potential customers. 
C.  Nonconforming Uses. The Board of Appeals is further granted the power and authority to permit extensions and enlargements to existing buildings being utilized for nonconforming uses, provided the total of such extensions or enlargements shall not exceed 25 percent of the total area of the existing principal structure and shall not infringe on the side, front and rear yard requirements for the particular district in which the nonconforming use is located, and provided further that the Board of Appeals shall first find that such extension or enlargement does not result in a diminution of conforming uses, will not be detrimental to and will not tend to alter the character of the neighborhood. 
D.  Exercising of Powers Granted. In the exercising of the powers granted, such Board of Appeals may, in conformity with the provisions of this Ordinance, reverse or affirm, wholly or partly, or may modify the order, requirement, decisions, or determination appealed from and may make such order, requirement, decision or determination as ought to be made, and to that end shall have all the powers of the office from whom the appeal is taken. 
E.  Consideration of Appeals. In any consideration of all appeals, the Board of Appeals shall, before making any finding in a specific case, first determine that the proposed change will not constitute change in the Official Zoning Map and will not impair an adequate supply of light and air to adjacent property or impair established property values within the surrounding area or in any other respect impair the public health, safety, comfort, morals, and general welfare of the City of Cleveland. 
F.  Required Appeal Vote. The concurring vote of two-thirds of the members of the Board of Appeals shall be necessary to reverse any order, requirement, decision, or determination of an administrative official. 
Sec. 204. - Cleveland Heritage Commission. 
    The Cleveland Heritage Commission has been duly established and is reaffirmed by this Ordinance to preserve, promote, and develop the City's historical resources and to advise the City on the designation of preservation districts, landmarks, and landmark sites and perform such other functions as may be provided by law. 
Sec. 205. - Plan review committee. 
    A Plan Review Committee for the City of Cleveland, Mississippi, is re-established and confirmed through this Ordinance. The Committee shall have the structure, powers and functions as described below. The Committee consists of the following City staff members: Building Official, City Engineer, and Fire Inspector. This Committee shall review Development Plans submitted for multi-family and all non-residential developments within the City based on requirements and criteria discussed in Article 5, Section 509 and Article 10.

ARTICLE 5. - PROCEDURES FOR DEVELOPMENT APPROVAL 

Sec. 501. - General requirements. 
    In presenting any application for approval as required by this Ordinance, the burden of proof shall rest with the applicant to provide the necessary evidence to clearly show that the proposal meets the minimum standards defined within this Ordinance. 
    All decisions made by the appropriate Boards, Committees, or Commissions shall be in writing and shall state the findings, recommendations, and reasons for approval or disapproval. 
Sec. 502. - General appeals. 
    Aggrieved applicants of decisions regarding any matter of this Ordinance shall appeal to the appropriate Board or Commission of higher authority within ten (10) days of the decision. 
1.  Any decisions made by the City of Cleveland Department of Community Development, Building Official, Code Enforcement Officer, or Plan Review Committee shall seek appeal through the Board of Appeals. 
a.  Appeals to the Board of Appeals shall be discussed at the next meeting of the Board of Appeals, or within one (1) month after the date of the appeal. The appeal of a decision shall be filed in writing with the Department of Community Development. The staff shall transmit the information to the Board of Appeals including all papers constituting the record upon which the action appealed from was taken. 
b.  When an appeal has been filed with the Board of Appeals, the Department of Community Development shall immediately notify the Chairman of the Board of Appeals, who shall fix a time for the holding of the meeting to hear such appeal and shall issue a call, if a regular meeting is not to be held within a reasonable time, and give public notice of such hearing, if required. 
2.  Any decisions made by the Planning Commission, Heritage Commission, or Board of Appeals shall seek appeal through the Mayor and Board of Aldermen. 
a.  Appeals to the Mayor and Board of Aldermen shall be discussed at the next meeting of the Board, or within one (1) month after the date of the appeal. The appeal of a decision shall be filed in writing with the Department of Community Development. 
b.  When an appeal has been filed to the Board of Aldermen, the Mayor shall fix a time for the holding of the meeting to hear such appeal and shall issue a call, if a regular meeting is not to be held within a reasonable time, and give public notice of such hearing, if required. 
3.  Any decisions made by the Mayor and Board of Aldermen shall seek appeal through any court of competent jurisdiction as provided by law. 
Sec. 503. - General amendments. 
    No change of any nature shall be made to this Land Development Ordinance except in conformity with the procedures set forth in this Ordinance. Any unauthorized change by any person or persons shall be considered a violation and punishable under Article 3 of this Ordinance. 
Sec. 504. - Zoning changes and amendments. 
504.1. - Reasons for amendments. 
    Article 6 and the Official Zoning Map shall not be amended except to correct an error in the text, to reflect changed or changing conditions in a particular area or in the municipality generally, to rezone an area or to extend the boundary of an existing zone, or to change the regulations and restrictions of existing zones. 
504.2. - Eligible bodies to request amendments. 
    Zoning changes can occur at the request of two main bodies: the City (Staff, Planning Commission, Board of Appeals, or Mayor and Board of Aldermen) and the citizens/property owners. Requested changes to the zoning map or zoning text by the City (Staff, Planning Commission, Board of Appeals, or Mayor and Board of Aldermen) are typically more general in nature. Requested zoning changes by the citizens/property owners of Cleveland are more personal in nature and involve specific pieces of property that the applicant either owns or has the option to buy. Individuals requesting specific changes shall follow a more detailed procedure for zoning amendments as described in Section 504.4 of this Article. 
    Depending on the type of amendment, zoning changes can either affect the zoning text or the zoning map or possibly both. Amendments or changes to the zoning text are typically done by the City to either update current regulations or correct past errors. These amendments are based on the overall well-being of the City as opposed to specific properties. Amendments to the zoning map are more commonly at the request of citizens/property owners who want different uses allowed on their property, but they are also made by the City to correct past errors and update and reflect development changes. 
504.3. - Types of zoning amendments. 
Zoning text amendments 
The Mayor and Board of Aldermen may, from time to time, amend the zoning text of Article 6 in accordance with this Ordinance and the Mississippi code. All amendments are to be approved only as reasonably necessary to promote the purpose of this Ordinance and namely the promotion of the public health, safety or general welfare. Text amendments may be initiated by the Mayor and Board of Aldermen, Board of Appeals, Planning Commission, City staff, or citizens. Typically, text amendments are concerned with a specific section of the zoning article. Another common text change is when the entire Article 6 may be amended to update existing regulations and reflect proactive development standards for the future of the City. 
Zoning map amendments or replacement 
In the event that the Official Zoning Map becomes damaged, destroyed, lost or difficult to interpret because of the nature or number of changes and additions, the Mayor and Board of Aldermen, Board of Appeals, Planning Commission, or City staff may initiate revisions or replacement of the Official Zoning Map. The new Official Zoning Map may also correct drafting and other errors or omissions in the prior Official Zoning Map, but no such corrections shall have the effect of amending Article 6, or any subsequent amendment thereof. Citizens/property owners seeking a change in zoning on their personal piece of property may also initiate amendments to the Official Zoning Map.

6.  Upon receipt of application for the special exception from the Department of Community Development, the Board of Appeals shall review the proposed application and shall either approve or disapprove the request based upon criteria in Section 505.2. 
7.  Any party aggrieved by the decision of the Board of Appeals may submit an appeal to the Mayor and Board of Aldermen.

505.3. - Expiration. 
    All special exceptions shall not be personal to the applicant but shall be transferable and shall run with the land unless other provisions are made in this Ordinance and until change occurs within the provisions of this Ordinance.

    Where the strict application of this Ordinance would result in peculiar and exceptional practical difficulties to or exceptional hardship upon the owner of such property, a variation from such strict application may be permitted so as to relieve such difficulties or hardships for example, by reason of exceptional narrowness, shallowness, or shape of a specific piece of property at the time of the original adoption of the regulations, by reason of exceptional topographical conditions or other extraordinary or exceptional situation or condition of a specific piece of property, or by reason of the location of trees. Natural drainage courses, lakes or other desirable or attractive features, which condition is not generally prevalent in the neighborhood. 
    The potential for economic loss or gain on the part of the applicant resulting from the action of the Board of Appeals shall not be considered a sufficient basis for the approval of any variance. The fact that an owner could realize a greater financial return by a use of his property that is contrary to these regulations is not a sufficient reason for change. Hardship cannot be proved where it can be shown that property was purchased with the knowledge of existing restrictions, nor can hardship be claimed in terms of prospective sales or potential customers. 
506.1. - Application procedures. 
1.  All applications for variances shall be filed with the Department of Community Development. 
2.  Variance applications shall contain the following: 
a.

7.  Any party aggrieved by the decision of the Board of Appeals may submit an appeal to the Mayor and Board of Aldermen. 
506.2. - Approval criteria.

b.  Exceptional topographical conditions or other extraordinary or exceptional situation or condition of a specific piece of property 
c.  The location of trees 
d.  The location of natural drainage courses, lakes or other desirable or attractive features 
2.  The variance shall NOT significantly alter the character of or be detrimental to the neighborhood.

4.  In the granting of any variance, the Board of Appeals may prescribe appropriate conditions and safeguards. Non-compliance of such conditions and safeguards when made a part of the approval terms under which the special exception is granted, shall be deemed a violation and shall be punishable under Article 3 of this Ordinance.

    Before filing an application for preliminary subdivision approval, the sub-divider may submit plans and data to the Plan Review Committee.

The purpose of this conference is to afford the sub-divider an opportunity to consult early and informally with the Plan Review Committee before preparation of the preliminary plat. The Plan Review Committee shall promptly inform the sub-divider that the plans and data as submitted or as modified meet the objectives of these regulations, and if they do not meet the objectives, the respects in which they do not. 
508.2. - Preliminary plat-Application and approval. 
    On reaching conclusions, informally as recommended above, regarding the general program and objectives, the sub-divider shall prepare a preliminary subdivision plat together with improvement plans and other supplementary material, including an application and fees, for submission to the City Planning Commission and the Plan Review Committee.

This is done so that each said subdivision plat or map may be so drawn and designed as to permit the extension of all such facilities in a reasonable manner, with a minimum of expense and a maximum of efficiency, provided the Governing Body of the City of Cleveland deems proper to do so. They are to make report to the Planning Commission and Governing Body promptly of findings.

    Regardless of the existence of purported copies of the Official Zoning Map, which may from time to time be made or published, the Official Zoning Map, located in the office of the City Clerk, shall be the final authority as to the current zoning status of the land, buildings, and other structures in the City of Cleveland. 
    Interpretation of Boundaries -Where boundaries of zoning districts are uncertain as shown on the Official Zoning Map, the following rules shall apply:

Sec. 606. - Nonconforming uses and structures. 
    While non-conforming uses, structures, buildings, signs, etc., will be allowed to continue under certain circumstances, it is the policy of the City of Cleveland to bring these nonconformities into compliance with the city Ordinances and Codes as is reasonably practical.

Sec. 607. - A-1 Agricultural District. 
    The City of Cleveland understands that large areas around the fringe of the City may be used for agricultural purposes for many years. Further, the taxes that a property owner pays are based on the use of the land and not the zoning of the land. So the City may influence the development of the agricultural fringe, most of the lands inside the City shall be designated as a zone other than agricultural. The land that is to be zoned agricultural is zoned in this manner to minimize its development because of the need to protect it from dense development. The primary reason for this designation would be because it is located in the floodplain as designated on the FIRM maps, but there could be other reasons for it to remain minimally developed. 
    Permitted Uses: The following uses are identified as permitted uses in the A-1 zone. 
1.  Agricultural and accessory uses provided, however, that no permits shall be required with reference to land used for the growing of the usual farm products or raw materials such as cotton, vegetables, fruit, trees and grain. 
2.  Gardens. 
3.  Single-family detached homes on at least two (2) acres. 
    Special Exceptions: All non-residential proposals shall provide information as required for Plan Review Committee review and approval. The following uses are allowed in the A-1 zone by special exception only: 
1.  Churches and institutions of an educational, religious, charitable, or philanthropic nature, provided, however, that such buildings shall not be located upon sites containing an area of less than two (2) acres, shall not occupy over thirty (30) percent of the total area of the lot; that the buildings shall be set back from all lot lines a distance of not less than two (2) feet for each foot of building height. 
2.  Public riding stables on at least five (5) acres. 
3.  Radio and television studios or transmitting stations. 
4.  Wireless telecommunications towers not to exceed three hundred (300) feet in height. 
Dimensional Standards: 
1. Minimum Lot Area 2 acres 2. Minimum Lot Width 100 feet 3. Maximum Percent of Lot Occupied by Buildings 30 percent 4. Minimum Setback    a. Front 35 feet    b. Side 15 feet*    c. Rear 30 feet 5. Maximum Height of Structure/Number of Stories 50 feet/2.5 stories  
*The setback line for a side yard abutting a side street shall be the same as the front setback. 
    Accessory structures shall be setback at least five (5) feet from any property line or eight (8) feet of another structure, and shall not be located on any type of easement. When an accessory structure is to be located in the rear yard of a corner lot, the accessory structure shall be setback at least ten (10) feet from the side street property line. 
    Fences may be located on the side or rear property lines unless an easement exists, in which case they shall not be located on any easement area without special approval from the Building Official. Front and side fences shall be no closer than ten (10) feet from any street right-of-way line and shall not be located within any sight distance area.

Sec. 616. - B-2H: Central Business Historic Crosstie District. 
    The Historic Crosstie District represents the original settlement of Cleveland and covers the traditional downtown area. This historic preservation area has been identified for special standards of design and review. Because of the character of the buildings and street parking for the downtown strip along the old railroad line this area has setbacks that are different from the rest of the Central Business District. 
    The Crosstie Historic District represents the core of Cleveland and the natural location of establishments engaged in retail, entertainment, financial, professional and related services. The particular nature of their businesses can be aided by the centralized location and concentration provided in this environment. Cleveland needs an active downtown to best serve the City's citizens and the regional community. 
    Emphasis is placed on more intimate, pedestrian-scale development rather than development oriented singly for the automobile. Pedestrian-scale developments typically pay more attention to architectural details, bring buildings closer to the street, have on-street parking, provide for wider sidewalks between parking and storefronts, incorporate elements and amenities within the sidewalk zone, etc. All of these characteristics provide a safe and interesting environment that invites pedestrians to walk within the downtown. It is the intent of this zoning district to preserve the character of this geographic area, especially the original downtown, and to support the reliance on pedestrians and nearby residents utilizing establishments within this district. Cleveland has been fortunate to be able to develop the former railroad tracks as a pedestrian oriented park through the middle of downtown. 
    Scale of businesses is important when encouraging pedestrian circulation, so no single business, store or building shall be in excess of ten thousand (10,000) square feet or six thousand (6,000) square feet per floor of a multi-story building. 
    Development within this zoning district must also conform to the requirements of the Historic Preservation Ordinance, Historic Preservation Manual, and Cleveland Heritage Commission. 
    Permitted Uses: The following uses are identified as permitted uses in the B-2H zone provided their total building area is less than ten thousand (10,000) square feet: 
1.  Apparel shops or clothing stores. 
2.  Appliance, radio, television, telephone, etc. sales, service or repair but not vehicles or heavy equipment. 
3.  Banks or credit unions without drive through services. 
4.  Barber and beauty shops. 
5.  Department stores. 
6.  Drug stores, without drive through services. 
7.  Flower, jewelry, art, antique, book and gift shops. 
8.  Ice cream parlor, coffee shop, candy store, or bakery. 
9.  Printing, copying, and publishing establishments. 
10.  Professional offices and office buildings.

Sec. 621. - PUD: Planned Unit Development. 
    In order to provide for flexibility of design for mixed types of uses and for mixed sizes of residential lots in one unified project, the Planned Unit Development (PUD) zoning designation has been established. The PUD allows for a large or small tract to be designed as one unit for development, subject to overall density and use restrictions that are approved as a part of the proposal. A proposal for rezoning to PUD may be located anywhere and may include a mix of residential lot sizes and types, and/or commercial lots, and/or government or public and semi-public uses. Whether it is appropriate for the area is left to the Planning Commission and Board of Aldermen and depends on the specifics of the PUD proposed outline plan. The proposal should generally conform to the Future Land Use Plan Map of the Cleveland Comprehensive Plan. If the proposal does not conform to the Future Land Use Plan Map evaluation should be conducted to see if the Future Land Use Plan Map should be amended. Any PUD proposed outline plan is subject to revision of the Planning Commission and/or Mayor and Board. 
    Site Plan Required: A detailed site plan of the proposed Planned Unit Development shall be submitted to the Plan Review Committee for study and approval; which shall be considered as a recommendation to the Planning Commission and then to the Board of Aldermen for final approval. 
    Building permits for improvement of such property shall be issued only when in conformance with the binding elements of the PUD outline development plan as approved by the Planning Commission and Mayor and Board of Aldermen for the property in question. Such plan shall be strictly complied with and be enforceable in the same manner as the zoning district regulations. 
    Permitted Uses: A detailed list of possible/proposed uses is required for the PUD document that may propose any uses not otherwise prohibited in the zoning districts. The list is subject to review and approval by the Planning Commission and Board of Aldermen. Uses permitted in the Planned Unit Development are expected to be those normally necessary to make up a total neighborhood community, specifically including the following: 
1.  Residential Uses: Single-family detached, attached, or multi-family units in all forms. 
2.  Commercial Uses-Permitted commercial uses shall be those of retail type and personal service type commercial associated with community shopping centers and high quality office park type development. 
3.  Public and Semi-Public Facilities-Community centers, schools, parks and other recreational facilities, churches, clubs, public utilities, libraries and other public buildings and structures required to provide essential public services, including, but not limited to, fire stations and any other use which primarily serves the residents of such a development. 
    Residential Lot Size: No minimum lot sizes are established per se, so that housing can be clustered or otherwise concentrated or arranged in planned locations on the site to take advantage of its natural features. This will allow clustering of dwellings to provide maximum open space. Zero-lot line developments are an acceptable specialized type of residential PUD. The overall gross density for residential development shall be as follows: 
  Detached or attached single-family residential development shall not exceed eight (8) dwelling units per acre. 
  Multi-family residential development shall not exceed fifteen (15) dwelling units per acre. 
    Development Density: Commercial uses in any Planned Unit Development District shall not constitute over twenty-five (25) percent of the land area of such development and land area occupied by residential, public and other buildings and accessory structures shall not exceed forty-five (45) percent of the total land area of such development. 
    Parking areas for commercial facilities are considered a commercial use of land. Commercial development may not start construction until the residential development is at least one-fourth (1/4) complete. 
    Open Space Reservation: In any Planned Unit Development the amount of land not used by residential buildings, accessory structures, and yards but required by the residential zoning of the site, shall be reserved collectively in contiguous units accessible to all the building sites in the development as maintained open space for the purpose of providing parks, recreational facilities, ways for pedestrian movement and circulation, and conserving visually pleasing elements of the environment. Prior to the sale of any lot, site, home or other structure, a bond of sufficient surety shall be posted with the Mayor and Board of Aldermen for completion of said open space improvements prior to such sale. The open space developed will constitute no less than an equivalent proportional amount to the area being developed in the case of partial development. 
    Responsibility for Open Space: Nothing in this section of the Ordinance shall be construed as a responsibility of the City of Cleveland, either for maintenance or liability of the following, which shall include but not be limited to: any private open areas, parks, recreational facilities, and a hold-harmless clause shall be incorporated in the covenants running with the land to this effect. It shall be provided further, however, that when an owner of a Planned Unit Development desires to dedicate certain land areas to the City for public parks and recreational facilities and the City approves the nature and location of such lands and accepts the dedicated areas, the City shall be responsible for the operation and maintenance of these lands and properties. 
    Homes Association: As part of the plan proposed for any Planned Unit Development, the developer shall submit a set of covenants running with the land providing for an automatic membership Homes Association, to be an incorporated non-profit organization, operating under recorded land agreements, through which each property owner in the Planned Unit Development is automatically subject to a charge for an appropriate proportionate share of the expenses for maintaining the common property, open space, and/or other activities of the Association. Once established the covenants shall continue and remain in force during the entire existence of the Planned Unit Development. 
    Appearance of Public Utility Facilities: Public utility facilities and structures shall be architecturally compatible or shall be properly screened and landscaped in keeping with the character and appearance of the neighborhood, all as approved by the City Planning Commission. 
    Approval by Board of Aldermen: Planned Unit Developments and establishment of zoning therefore must be approved by the Planning Commission and the Board of Aldermen. However, development shall be in accordance with the approved site plan. Any contemplated deviation from the approved plan shall be reviewed by the Plan Review Committee and recommendations submitted successively to the Planning Commission and the Board of Aldermen for approval. The City Planning Commission has the authority to require reasonable plan changes for the Planned Unit Development as a prerequisite to approval. 
    Accessory structures shall be setback at least five (5) feet from any property line or eight (8) feet from another structure in any residential development or twenty (20) feet from another structure in any commercial or industrial development, and shall not be located on any type of easement or buffer area. When an accessory structure is to be located in the rear yard of a corner lot, the accessory structure shall be setback at least ten (10) feet in any residential development or twenty-five (25) feet in any commercial or industrial development from the side street property line. 
    Fences may be located on the side or rear property lines unless an easement exists, in which case they shall not be located on any easement area. Front and side fences shall be no closer than ten (10) feet from any street right-of-way line and shall not be located within any sight distance area. 
    Provisions for Off-street parking and loading are required and defined in Article 8. 
    Provisions for signage are defined in Article 9. 
    Planned Unit Developments shall have a fifteen (15) foot wide buffer area along the side and rear property lines. Additional details and provisions for buffering and landscaping are defined in Article 10, Section 1005. 
Sec. 622. - Zero lot line developments (A specialized kind of PUD). 
    The principal purposes of the Zero Lot line concept are: (1) the more efficient use of land, as compared with the typical single-family development, making available needed housing at a more affordable cost; (2) the design of dwellings that integrate and relate internal-external living areas resulting in more pleasant and enjoyable living facilities; (3) by placing the dwelling against one of the property lines, permitting the outdoor space to be grouped and utilized to its maximum benefit. 
    Site Plan Required: A detailed site plan of the proposed Zero Lot line (PUD) shall be submitted to the Plan Review Committee for study and approval. The application shall next be considered by the Planning Commission and then by the Board of Aldermen for final approval. 
    Development Parameters: All applications for a Zero Lot Line Development shall comply with the following applicable development parameters. 
    Permitted Uses: 
1.  Lot-Line Houses-Detached single-family dwellings on individually platted lots. Instead of being centered on the lots, they are placed against one of the side lot lines. Customary accessory uses not inconsistent with residential lots shall be permitted. See Illustration below. 

2.  Fencing, walls, trellises, and other similar uses can be used as connecting elements between one-family dwellings on adjacent lots, subject to site plan review by the Planning Commission. 
3.  Twin Houses-Semi-detached, single-family dwellings which are connected along a common party wall (a code-approved firewall) to a similar unit. Each structure has only two dwellings. For a Twin House, the structure shall be set back a minimum of ten (10) feet from the side yard opposite of the common party wall. See Illustration below. 
4.  Garages, carports, utility storage structures shall be permitted accessory uses and may be either attached as part of the main building or detached; however, said structures shall not be used as connecting elements and shall meet the setback requirements for accessory structures if detached or for primary structure if attached. 

Dimensional Standards: 
1. Minimum Development Area: None 2. Maximum Development Density: 8 units/gross acre 3. Minimum Average Net Lot Area: 5,000 square feet * 4. Minimum Lot Width: 50 feet     Minimum Corner Lot Width: 50 feet 5. Maximum Percent of Lot Occupied by Buildings: 50/60 percent ** 6. Minimum Setbacks from Property Lines    a. Front 25 feet    b. Interior Side Yard 0 feet    c. Opposite Interior Side Yard 20 feet ***    d. Street Side Yard 25 feet    e. Rear 25 feet 7. Maximum Height of Structure/Number of Stories 35 feet/2.5 stories  
* This shall not include any credit for streets, recreation areas, common open space or water bodies. Private roads shall not be used in calculating the net lot area. 
** Where there is not maintained common open space, a zero lot line dwelling including accessory structures shall not occupy more than fifty (50) percent of the lot area, sixty (60) percent coverage is allowed if there is maintained common open space. 
*** The connecting elements such as fences, walls, trellises, patios, garden features, and other similar elements shall be permitted within the ten (10) foot setback area provided, however, no structure, with the exception of fences or walls, shall be placed within the required five (5) foot utility, wall maintenance, drainage, or other easements, or in an buffer area. And, in no case shall a zero lot line dwelling be built closer than fifteen (15) feet to the property line of a lot which is zoned as R-1 or R-2 Residential. 
    Accessory structures shall be setback at least five (5) feet from any property line or eight (8) feet from another structure in any residential development or twenty (20) feet in any commercial or industrial development, and shall not be located on any type of easement or buffer area. When an accessory structure is to be located in the rear yard of a corner lot, the accessory structure shall be setback at least ten (10) feet in any residential development or twenty-five (25) feet in any commercial or industrial development from the side street property line. 
    Fences may be located on the side or rear property lines unless an easement exists, in which case they shall not be located on any easement area. Front and side fences shall be no closer than ten (10) feet from any street right-of-way line and shall not be located within any sight distance area. 
    Street Frontage: Each lot shall have a clear, direct frontage on public streets or to accessways complying with private street requirements. 
    Platting Requirements: Each dwelling shall be located on its own individual platted lot. If areas for common use by occupants of the development are shown on the plat, satisfactory arrangements shall be made for the maintenance of the common open space and facilities as provided herein. The plat shall indicate the zero lot lines and all related easements. 
    Openings Prohibited on the Zero Lot Line Side: The wall of the dwelling located on the lot line shall have no windows, doors, air conditioning units, or any other type of openings, provided, however, that atriums or courts shall be permitted on the zero lot line side when the court or atrium is enclosed by three (3) walls of the dwelling unit and a solid wall of at least eight (8) feet in height is provided on the zero lot line. Said wall shall be constructed of the same material as exterior walls of the dwelling unit. Where adjacent zero lot line dwellings are not constructed against a common lot line, the builder or developer must provide for a perpetual wall-maintenance easement of five (5) feet in width along the adjacent lot and parallel with such wall. 
    Maintenance and Drainage Easements: A perpetual five (5) feet wide wall-maintenance easement shall be provided on the lot adjacent to the zero lot line property line which, with the exception of walls and/or fences, shall be kept clear of structures. This easement shall be shown on the plat and incorporated into each deed transferring title of the property. The wall shall be maintained in its original color and treatment unless otherwise agreed to in writing by the two affected lot owners. Roof overhangs may penetrate the easement on the adjacent lot a maximum of twenty-four (24) inches, but the roof shall be so designed that water runoff from the dwelling placed on the lot line is limited to the easement area. 
    Off-street Parking: A minimum of two (2) off-street parking spaces shall be provided on each platted lot. Except for parallel parking on public roads, tandem parking is permitted only on individual lots and in the driveways connecting such lots with the adjacent roads, provided said driveways are for the exclusive use of each individual lot. However, tandem parking shall be limited to no more than one (1) such tandem parking space for each individual lot. Parking shall be prohibited on sidewalks or in the front yard area directly in front of the home. Additional provisions for Off-street parking and loading are required and defined in Article 8. 
    Trees and Landscaping: Every development is unique and planting of trees and landscaping is required for all developments. A landscaping plan shall be submitted for approval by the Plan Review Committee. 
    Common Open Space and Maintenance of Facilities: Common open space is not required but may be permitted. If common open space is provided, satisfactory provisions shall be made to assure that nonpublic areas and facilities for the common use of occupants of Zero Lot Line development shall be maintained in a professional manner without expense to the general taxpayer of the City of Cleveland. Such may be provided by the incorporation of an automatic-membership home association for the purpose of continually holding title to such nonpublic areas and facilities and levying assessments against each lot, whether improved or not, for the purpose of paying the taxes and maintaining such common open space. Such assessments shall be a lien superior to all other liens save and except tax liens and first mortgage liens, which are amortized in monthly or quarter - annual payments over a period of not less than ten (10) years. Other methods may be acceptable if the same positively provide for the proper and continuous payment of taxes and maintenance without expense to the general taxpayers. The instrument incorporating such provisions shall be approved by the City Attorney, as to form legal sufficiency, before submission to the Board of Alderman and shall be recorded in the public records of Bolivar County, if satisfactory to the Board of Aldermen. 
    Commencement of Development: If development is not commenced within twelve (12) months from the date of approval of a site development plan, the approval hereof shall become null and void and the same may not be developed in accordance with said plan; provided, if development is permitted in stages, subsequent stages may be commenced within eighteen (18) months after the completion of the previous stage; otherwise, such subsequent stage may not be developed in accordance with the previously approved plan and such approval shall be null and void. Commencement of construction shall include, where necessary, substantial site improvement, which shall include but not be limited to active and continuous road improvement, excavation, grading and leveling, installation of utilities, and the like. 
    Provisions for signage are defined in Article 9. 
    Planned Unit Developments and Zero Lot line developments shall have a fifteen (15) foot wide buffer area along the side and rear property lines of the overall property. Additional details and provisions for buffering and landscaping are defined in Article 10, Section 1005.

ARTICLE 7. - SUBDIVISIONS 

Sec. 701. - General. 
    A "subdivision" has been previously defined in this document as the division of a parcel of land into two or more lots for the purpose of transferring ownership or construction of a building. If a new street is being built, any division of land is a subdivision. 
    All land subdivisions developed, redeveloped, or constructed within the City of Cleveland shall comply with the provisions of these regulations. 
    It shall be unlawful for any person, firm or corporation to lay out for the purpose of selling, or offering for sale, a tract or parcel of land within the City of Cleveland into two or more building sites without first having the tract or parcel of land surveyed and platted by a Licensed Professional Engineer or Licensed Land Surveyor. Also the plat of the proposed subdivision must be submitted to the Planning Commission and Plan Review Committee for their evaluation and recommendation to the Mayor and Board of Aldermen. After approval by the Mayor and Board of Aldermen of Preliminary and Final versions of the proposed subdivision plat, the approved Final Plat shall be recorded as provided by law with said Professional Engineer's or Surveyor's signature and seal. 
    All proposed subdivisions shall conform to the Cleveland Comprehensive Plan, Zoning Ordinance and other regulations such as building codes, in effect at the time of submission to the Planning Commission. All highways, streets, and other features of the Comprehensive Plan shall be platted by the subdivider in the location and to the dimensions, if any, indicated by the Comprehensive Plan, Zoning Ordinance, and other regulations. 
    Where community or public facilities of the Comprehensive Plan are located in whole or in part of a proposed subdivision, the public board, commission, or body having jurisdiction and/or financial responsibility for the acquisition of such facility or facilities shall execute a written option to acquire by purchase, file suit for condemnation, or relinquish the location of such facility or facilities. Provided further, however, the option to acquire must be exercised and fully consummated within twelve (12) months following the date of the recording of the final plat. 
    No final plat of land within the force and effect of an existing zoning code, building code, or other official code, ordinance, or regulation shall be approved unless it conforms to all such regulations. 
    General subdivision information shall describe or outline the existing conditions of the site and the proposed development as necessary to supplement the drawings required below. This information may include data on existing covenants, land characteristics, and available community facilities and utilities, and information describing the subdivision proposal such as number of residential lots, typical lot width and depth, price range, business areas, playgrounds, park areas, and other public areas, proposed protective covenants and proposed utilities and street improvements. 
    No building or structure, or any portion thereof, shall be constructed within the limits of special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year flood, as identified in the applicable Flood Insurance Rate Map distributed by the Federal Emergency Management Agency, unless the lowest floor elevation of the building or structure is higher than, or is raised by filling to, an elevation at least to or higher than the Base Flood Elevation. The applicant shall conduct on-site topographic surveys to locate the precise floodplain line on the subject parcel. Any structure placed within the floodplain shall be anchored firmly to prevent floodwaters from carrying it downstream. 
    No building or structure shall be erected, structurally altered, or added to, until a building permit has been issued by the City of Cleveland. All building permit applications shall be in accordance with the requirements of this ordinance, and no building permits shall be issued unless it conforms to all regulations. No building permit shall be accepted or processed until and unless the property where the proposed building will be situated has been given Preliminary and Final subdivision Plat approval and the approved Final Plat has been properly recorded. 
Sec. 702. - Design and construction. 
    In consideration of acceptance by the City of Cleveland and the assumption of the responsibility for maintaining the utilities and streets constructed therein, the owner or owners of the subdivision shall cause to be constructed where required by the Governing Body and at no expense to the City, the following improvements according to the specifications set forth in this Article and the specifications of the Building Official, the City Engineer, or other authorized staff of the City of Cleveland. Design and supervision of work shall be conducted and acknowledged by a Licensed Professional Engineer. After acceptance of the subdivision by the City, following the required period of maintenance by the developer, all such improvements shall become property of the City and the plat shall so state. 
    Prior to the installation of paving, easements for the installation of gas mains, telephone and television cable and electric lines shall be granted and such of said utilities as go beneath pavement shall have been installed by the respective parties to insure no cutting of pavement. If such improvement installation is required after the pavement is installed, then those improvements will be installed in a manner that does not require cutting of, or other damage to, the pavement. 
    Prior to the sale of any subdivision lots or the recording of the Final Plat, the sub-divider shall furnish a Surety Bond or Maintenance Bond in the amount of the estimated cost of construction for any and all work that is not fully completed, guaranteeing the faithful performance of all covenants, stipulations and agreements regarding construction, and guaranteeing the work against the incorporation of faulty materials or poor workmanship for a period of one (1) year after the date that construction was certified as complete by the City Engineer. The bond shall be held for a period of at least one (1) year before being released by the Governing Authority upon recommendation of the City Engineer. 
702.1. - Survey Monuments. 
    Survey monuments shall be placed at all corners or changes of alignment along the boundary of the subdivision and at all block corners, angle points, or points of curves in street right-of-way boundary lines and at all lot corners in alignment in lot boundaries. These monuments shall consist of iron pipe of not less than one-half (1/2) inch in diameter and not less than twenty-four (24) inches in length or steel rod of not less than three-eighths (3/8) inch diameter and not less than twenty-four (24) inches in length. 
    Should conditions prohibit the placing of monuments on the property line; offset marking will be permitted; provided, however, that exact offset courses and distances are shown on the subdivision plat. Iron pipes or steel rods shall be set at all lot corners. If survey monuments are removed during construction, they shall be replaced. 
702.2. - Blocks. 
    The lengths, widths and shapes of blocks shall be designed with due regard to: 
a.  Provision of adequate building sites suitable to the special needs of the type of use contemplated. 
b.  Zoning requirements as to minimum lot sizes, setbacks, required yards, and required buffers. 
c.  Needs for convenient access, circulation, control and safety of street traffic. 
d.  Limitations and opportunities of easements or topography. 
    As a usual practice blocks shall be generally rectangular. Block lengths shall not exceed one thousand (1,000) feet or be less than four hundred (400) feet. Blocks shall normally be wide enough to allow two (2) tiers of lots of appropriate depth. 
    The Governing Body, following consultation with the Planning Commission and Plan Review Committee may elect to make exceptions for block design in particular cases. 
702.3. - Lots. 
    The lot size, width, depth, shape, orientation, and the minimum building setback lines shall be appropriate for the location of the subdivision and for the type of development and use contemplated. 
    Lot dimensions shall conform to the requirements of the zoning portion of this ordinance and as approved by the Planning Commission or Governing Body. 
    The minimum size of residential lots where a public sanitary sewer is not available shall be determined by the Governing Body after studies have been made of the soil condition existing on the site of the proposed subdivision and upon recommendations of the City Engineer with the approval of the Mississippi State Health Department. 
    Depth and width of properties reserved or laid out for commercial and industrial purposes shall be adequate to provide for off-street service and parking facilities required by the type of use and development contemplated on the site. 
    All new developments in Cleveland shall be part of a subdivision and shall be assigned to a platted lot and numbered. There shall be no "leftover" lots or land created by "default" through being omitted or excluded from a subdivision. 
    Corner lots for residential use shall have extra width to permit appropriate building setback from and orientation to both streets. 
    The subdividing of the land shall be such as to provide, by means of a public street, each lot with satisfactory access to an existing public street. 
    Double frontage and reverse frontage lots should be avoided except where essential to provide separation of residential development from traffic arteries or to overcome specific disadvantages of topography and orientation. 
    Corner lots and double frontage lots shall have access from only one (1) street. This shall be the street inside the subdivision, a local road and not an arterial. This shall be noted on the subdivision plat. 
    Side lot lines shall be substantially at right angles or radial to street right-of-way lines. 
    All lots or spaces intended for permanent detention area, common areas, parks, drainage paths, or other open spaces shall be designated as such on the Preliminary and Final Plat with a note that states how these spaces will be maintained and that these areas will not be developed. 
702.4. - Streets. 
    Streets shall be designed and constructed in conformance with the design standards set forth in this ordinance, the Future Transportation Plan portion of the Comprehensive Plan, and/or as specified by the Plan Review Committee, and approved by the Governing Body. 
    The arrangement, character, extent, width, grade, and location of all streets shall conform to the Future Transportation Plan portion of the Comprehensive Plan and shall be considered in their relation to existing and planned streets, to topographical conditions, to public convenience and safety, and in their appropriate relation to the proposed uses of the land to be served by such streets. 
    Where such is not shown in the Future Transportation Plan portion of the Comprehensive Plan, the arrangement of streets in a subdivision shall either: 
a.  Provide for the continuation or appropriate projection of existing principal streets in surrounding areas; or 
b.  Conform to a plan for the neighborhood reviewed by the Planning Commission and the Governing Body to meet a particular situation where topographical or other conditions make continuance or conformance to existing streets impracticable. 
    Such a neighborhood plan shall be prepared by the subdivider or developer and shall be approved by the Plan Review Committee and Planning Commission. Street stubs to adjacent, undeveloped properties shall be required to ensure adequate future circulation. Any time that a street terminates at the edge of undeveloped property there is the intent to extend the street when the property develops. In such cases, a cul-de-sac or other approved turn-around is required. 
    Minor streets shall be so laid out that their use by through traffic will be discouraged. But, the city's general grid system shall be continued and encouraged so as to allow multiple options for traffic trips inside the city. 
    Where a subdivision abuts or contains an existing or proposed arterial street direct driveway access to the arterial shall be minimized for adequate protection of residential properties and to afford separation of through and local traffic. Residential subdivisions shall require reverse frontage extra deep lots with a non-access reservation strip along the rear property line. This non-access strip shall be a landscaped buffer zone. Other special design may be considered for the subdivision including rear access service alleys. Commercial or industrial subdivisions may be allowed to access the arterial in a limited manner or may be designed to create a limited access frontage road. The commercial or industrial development may be allowed to face the arterial and "front" the arterial or frontage road, or it may have a reverse frontage lot with landscaped buffer as described for residential lots. The preferred access to all lots that are adjacent to an arterial street is through a side road. 
    Where a subdivision borders on or contains a limited access highway right-of-way (ROW) or railroad right-of-way (ROW), the subdivision may be designed to require a street approximately parallel to the ROW at a distance suitable to allow for the land to be appropriately used on both sides. Such distances shall also be determined with due regard for the requirements of approach grades and future grade separations. 
    Street segments that do not intersect directly across from one another, but where there is an "offset" or "jog" of the street continuation, centerline offsets of less than one hundred twenty-five (125) feet apart shall be avoided. 
    Streets shall be laid out so as to intersect as nearly as possible at right angles, and no street shall intersect any other street at less than sixty (60) degrees unless approved by the Plan Review Committee. 
    Property lines at street intersections shall be rounded with a radius of twenty (20) feet on a minor street and twenty-five (25) feet on a collector, or major street. The Plan Review Committee may require comparable cutoffs or chords in place of rounded corners. A comparable chord shall be considered a chord or line connecting the points of tangency of the radius it is replacing. 
    A tangent of at least one hundred (100) feet shall be introduced between reverse curves on arterial and collector streets. 
    When connecting street lines deflect from each other at any one point by more than ten (10) degrees, they shall be connected by a curve with a radius sufficient to insure an adequate sight distance for minor and collector streets, or of such radii as the Plan Review Committee shall determine for special cases: 
Type Minimum Sight Distance Arterial Thoroughfare 350' Major Street 275' Collector or Business Street 150' Minor or Local Street 100'  
    Half streets shall be prohibited, except where essential to the reasonable development of the subdivision in conformity with the other requirements of these regulations and where the Plan Review Committee finds it will be practical to require the dedication of the other half when the adjoining property is subdivided. Wherever a half street is adjacent to a tract to be subdivided, the other half of the street shall be platted within such tract and two full lanes of pavement shall be required on the developing property. 
    Culs-de-sac or "dead-end" streets, designed to be so permanently, shall be of such length as may be deemed necessary and adequate by the Plan Review Committee, and shall be provided at the closed end with a turn-around having an outside roadway diameter of at least one hundred ten (110) feet. 
    No street names shall be used which will duplicate or be confused with names of existing streets. Street names shall be subject to the approval of the Governing Body. 
    Street signs shall be placed by the developer at time of construction of the subdivision and then become the responsibility of the City. 
    Street grades shall be approved by the City Engineer. Care shall be exercised in construction of curb and gutter to insure proper drainage, when such improvements are required. 
    Street Trees: Trees will be permitted within street boundary lines with right-of-way width of at least sixty-four (64) feet. Street trees will not be permitted within seven (7) feet of the center line of any public storm or sanitary sewer. Trees of a type not exceeding fifty (50) feet in height and with a trunk diameter not in excess of thirty (30) inches at a point two (2) feet above the ground level at maturity will be permitted when planted at not less than fifty (50) feet intervals. 
    Lawn grasses will be permitted within the right-of-way boundary of an intersecting street. All planting strips shall be graded and sod or seeded with Bermuda, St. Augustine, Zoysia or similar grasses. Any planting other than lawn grasses within boulevard rights of way and/or median strips must be approved by the Plan Review Committee. 
    Street Sight Distance: No fence, wall, hedge or shrub planting which obstructs sight lines at elevations between two and one-half (2.5) feet and ten (10) feet above the roadways shall be placed or permitted to remain on any corner lot within the triangular area formed by the street property lines and a line connecting them at points twenty-five (25) feet from the intersection of the street lines, or in the case of a rounded property corner from the intersection of the street lines extended. The same sight line limitations shall apply on any lot within ten (10) feet from the intersection of a street property line with the edge of a driveway pavement of alley boundary. 
    Street right-of-way widths and pavement widths, unless otherwise determined by the Governing Body, shall be as follows: 
Street Type Minimum ROW Width* Min. Pavement Width* Curb and Gutter Arterial 120 or more Variable Open Ditch or curb and gutter Major 80 36-44 Yes Collector or business street 60 36 Yes Local or Minor, for row houses & apartments 60 36 Yes Local or Minor, for other residences 60 30 Yes Cul-de-sac 50** 30 Yes Cul-de-sac Circle or Turnaround 110 80 Yes *From face of curb to face of curb in feet.  
    All pavement or surfacing designs must be approved by the City Engineer before any construction is undertaken to insure adequate design for the existing soil conditions and proposed use to which it is subjected. 
    To attain purposes of the Future Transportation Plan as contained in the Comprehensive Plan, the City may require that certain streets serving a subdivision be constructed to higher standards than would be necessary to serve the particular subdivision. When higher standards are so imposed, the City may assume a proportionate share of the increased cost of construction. Such cost shall not exceed the difference between that required for construction of the minimum street capable of adequately serving the subdivision and the cost of street construction imposed by the City, as determined by the City Engineer. 
    Where off-site roadway or utility improvements are required as a result of the proposed development, those improvements shall be the responsibility of the applicant, and shall be constructed or installed prior to any final inspection. 
    Streets to be constructed for the development of a subdivision or extension of any road within the City of Cleveland shall conform to the following specifications. This includes all grubbing, grading, laying of sub-base, base, pavements, curbs and gutters, culverts, bridges, storm sewer mains and structures. Design and supervision of work shall be done by a Licensed Professional Engineer. 
    Sub-Bases. Where any excavation and stripping of soil for roadbed construction, the sub-base shall be compacted to ninety-five (95) percent of maximum density by standard proctor prior to any base material being placed for compaction. Adequate test shall be taken to cover the project area. All tests shall be performed by a certified testing lab and results shall be reported to the Project Engineer and City Engineer prior to any further construction. 
    Base. A layer of four (4) inch topping material shall be placed on the sub-base and compacted to ninety-five (95) percent of maximum density by standard proctor. Topping material may be a sandy-loam material or may be a SB-2 limestone base. Adequate test shall be taken to cover the project area. All tests shall be performed by a certified testing lab and results shall be reported to the Project Engineer and City Engineer prior to any further construction. 
    Reinforced Concrete Pavement. Pavement for all roads and streets shall consist of 6? reinforced concrete, unless otherwise approved by the Planning Commission and Board of Aldermen. Pavement shall conform to the Mississippi Standard Specifications for Road and Bridge Construction for concrete pavement. All pavement shall be constructed of Class PA concrete as specified. The mix design shall be submitted to the Project Engineer and City Engineer prior to the placement of concrete. Concrete shall be batched and supplied by a State Certified Batch Plant. Proof of certification shall be submitted to the Project Engineer and City Engineer prior to construction. Concrete being placed for pavement shall be tested by a certified testing lab to certify it meets minimum standards set forth in the specifications. Concrete cylinders shall be made so that a seven (7) day, fourteen (14) day and a twenty-eight (28) day break may be made. Reports shall be delivered to the Project Engineer and City Engineer in a timely manner. 
    Reinforcing Steel. Reinforcing steel shall be supplied and placed by the contractor as set forth in the attached Standard Details. All reinforcing steel shall meet the requirements of Section 711-Reinforcing Steel of the latest edition of the Mississippi Standard specifications for Road and Bridge Construction and Section 501-Reinforcing Steel (Placement). Notification shall be given to the Project Engineer and the City Engineer twenty-four (24) hours prior to placement of concrete for inspection purposes. 
    Construction. All plans and specifications shall be submitted to the Plan Review Committee for approval prior to any construction being performed. All construction work shall be performed by a contractor who is licensed by the State Board of Contractors for each particular area of the development. Any of the above listed specifications that are not adhered to shall cause the project to not be accepted by the City of Cleveland for maintenance and is considered to be a violation of this Ordinance. 
702.5. - Alleys. 
    Alleys shall be provided in commercial and industrial districts, except that the Governing Body, following consultation with the Planning commission, may elect to waive this requirement where other definite and assured provision is made for service access, such as off-street loading, unloading and parking consistent with and adequate for the uses proposed. 
    The right-of-way width of an alley in commercial and/or industrial sections shall be a minimum of twenty-five (25) feet. Where alleys are used in residential areas, the right-of-way width shall be a minimum of twenty (20) feet. Pavement width shall be approved by Plan Review Committee. Any new alley proposed as part of a new development shall be paved with concrete or asphalt meeting the minimum standards as defined by the City Engineer unless otherwise approved by the Planning Commission and Board of Aldermen. 
    Alley intersections and sharp changes in alignment shall be avoided, but where necessary, corners shall be cut off sufficiently to permit safe vehicular movement. 
    Dead-end alleys shall be avoided where possible, but if unavoidable, shall be provided with adequate turn-around facilities at the dead-end as determined by the Plan Review Committee. 
702.6. - Sidewalks. 
    Where constructed, sidewalks shall be five (5) feet wide and constructed of concrete and shall be located within the street right-of-way. Sidewalk materials should blend with the natural landscape, avoiding slick concrete. Examples of acceptable finishes are broom finished, colored, or exposed aggregate concrete. Asphalt sidewalks are prohibited. 
    ADA access ramps, complying with the requirements of Federal law, shall be provided for both sidewalks adjacent to public streets, as well as sidewalks provided internally within the development. 
    Pedestrian crosswalks shall be provided both internally and externally to the development where deemed essential to provide circulation or access to schools, playgrounds, shopping centers, transportation, and other community facilities. Public crosswalks, not less than ten (10) feet wide, shall be striped in conformance with the latest edition of the Manual on Uniform Traffic Devices. Crosswalks on private property, internal to the site, shall either be delineated by white, reflectorized pavement striping or may be delineated by materials of a different color and texture from the surrounding parking lot, otherwise conforming to the overall color scheme of the development with added signage denoting crosswalk areas. 
702.7. - Utility, Drainage, and Ingress/Egress Easements. 
    Easements across lots or centered on rear or side lot lines shall be provided for utilities where necessary and shall be at least twelve (12) feet wide at ground level with an additional six (6) feet wide over-hang on each side from twelve (12) feet above ground and up or a width designated by the Plan Review Committee. 
    Where easements intersect or short changes in alignment are necessary, corners shall be cut off sufficiently to permit equipment access. The minimum chord will be the chord of a segment having a minimum radius of ten (10) feet. 
    No structures, trees, shrubs, or buildings will be permitted in easements. 
    Any overhanging limbs, shrubbery, or vegetation of any kind may be removed from within the limits of easements at the sole discretion of the maintenance personnel of the utilities installed or to be installed in or above the easements. 
    Every easement shall terminate at both ends upon a street, alley, or other easement, except that dead-end easements will be permitted if not more than one hundred fifty (150) feet in length with no turns or bends. 
    Where a subdivision is traversed by a water course, drainage way, channel or stream, there shall be provided a storm water easement or drainage right of way conforming substantially with the lines of such water course or an accepted canal or drainage course, and such further width or construction, or both, as will be adequate for the drainage purposes as determined by the Plan Review Committee. Parallel streets or parkways may be required in connection therewith. 
    Where a sewer is not constructed in a dedicated public street, road, or alley, an easement not less than twenty (20) feet in width for the construction, operation and maintenance of the sewer shall be established in the name of the City of Cleveland. 
702.8. - Grading. 
    Grading and centerline gradients shall be in accordance with plans and profiles approved by the City Engineer. 
    Areas to be graded by cutting or filling shall be rough graded to within 0.2 of a foot of the accepted elevation after necessary allowance has been made for the thickness of topsoil, paved areas, and other installations. 
    Final cross sections and profiles of streets and other installations shall conform to grades approved by the City Engineer. The profiles shall be drawn to a standard scale; elevations shall be based on Mean Gulf Datum. Two (2) reproducible copies of all as-built construction drawings shall be furnished to the City Engineer and Director of Public Works upon completion of various improvements within the subdivision. 
    In all zoning districts, the lowest floor elevation in all new construction shall be a minimum of six (6) inches above the crown of the road that the lot has frontage on. 
    Grading shall be continued until the area conforms to the lines, grades, slopes and typical cross sections shown on the accepted plans. 
    Temporary soil erosion shall be minimized through the retention of natural vegetation and topography continuously until the completion of the project. The period of construction shall be of a duration reasonable to the size and complexity of the development. Topsoil shall be retained upon the site and placed over landscaped areas at a depth of not less than six (6) inches. The required development plan shall include an erosion control plan. The methods utilized and the minimum standards for care of the area during construction shall be in conformance with the requirements of the City of Cleveland. 
    All timber, logs, trees, brush, vegetable matter and other rubbish shall be removed so as to leave the areas that have been disturbed with a neat and finished appearance. All tree stumps, masonry and other obstructions shall be removed unless otherwise approved by the Plan Review Committee. 
    Buildings and improvements shall be located on the site to minimize changes to the existing topography and the loss of existing, mature landscaping. All existing trees eight (8) inches or larger in diameter shall be reflected on the Development Plan, and where they are proposed to be removed, justifications shall be provided. 
    Areas of natural vegetation shall be preserved along property lines where possible, including fence rows and drainage ways, and should be incorporated into the site's overall design concept. 
    Erosion control measures shall be in place before any major grading work is done. Installation of all improvements shall be done in such a manner as to provide for the most effective control of erosion and sediment. The construction plan shall be accompanied by an erosion and sediment control plan. Practical combination of the following technical principles shall be used: 
a.  The smallest practical area of land shall be exposed at any one time during development. 
b.  When land is exposed during development, the exposure shall be kept to the shortest practical period of time. 
c.  Temporary vegetation or mulching shall be used to protect critical areas exposed during development. 
d.  Sediment basins (debris basins, desilting basins, or silt traps) shall be installed and maintained to remove sediment from runoff waters of land undergoing development. 
e.  Provisions shall be made to effectively accommodate the runoff caused by changed soil conditions during and after development. 
f.  Permanent final vegetation and structures shall be installed as soon as practical in the development. 
g.  The development plan shall be fitted to the topography and soils so as to create the least possible erosion. 
h.  Whenever feasible, natural vegetation shall be retained and protected. 
702.9. - Drainage. 
    When the sub-divider submits the Final Plat of the subdivision to be dedicated, he shall also submit plans showing the proposed storm drainage system. 
    Drainage improvements constructed for new developments shall maintain any natural watercourse, shall not deter the natural drainage patterns, and shall prevent the collection of water in any low areas. Where the subject property is impacted by a surface drainage ditch, creek, river, or other waterway, the banks of the waterway will be stabilized as directed by the Plan Review Committee. 
    Wetlands, which are important to storm water retention, shall be maintained. The elimination of wetland areas upon the site, and the mitigation required for such elimination, shall be governed by the U. S. Army Corps of Engineers. 
    The drainage plan will show location and size of pipes and ditches, manholes and catch basins, culverts with headwalls and aprons for same, and bridges with plans for same approved by the Plan Review Committee, contours of the project, street layout and lot pattern with lot numbers. The drainage plan will also show the invert elevations, grade and the drainage area contributory to each drainage pipe or channel, including off-site areas. 
    Design and supervision of work shall be done by a qualified Licensed Professional Engineer in accordance with standard specifications of the City Engineer of the City of Cleveland. 
    The rate of Post-development drainage and storm water runoff shall not exceed pre-development levels. This shall be shown and attested to on the construction and drainage plans by the developer's engineer. Large developments shall provide on-site temporary and permanent storm water storage facilities. 
    Storm water entry and discharge points shall be protected to minimize erosion and to avoid relocating a problem to upstream or downstream properties. 
    In order to minimize storm water runoff, the amount of the site in impervious surface, such as roofs and pavement, should be minimized. The maximum impervious surface for any individual site shall not be greater than seventy-five (75) percent of the property. 
    No project shall cause downstream properties, water courses, channels, or conduits to receive storm water runoff from the proposed project at a higher peak flow rate than would result from the same storm event occurring over the site of the proposed project with the land in its natural, undeveloped condition. Where downstream conditions would be overtaxed by runoff from present or planned developments, and where runoff cannot be absorbed upon the site, detention areas shall be created to slow runoff. All storm water storage facilities shall be designed with sufficient capacity to accommodate all runoff caused by the project in excess of the runoff which would have resulted from the site left in its natural, undeveloped state. The storage capacity of all storage facilities shall be sufficient to store one hundred fifteen (115) percent of the excess flow, in each watershed, which would result from a twenty-five (25) year storm of twenty-four (24) hour duration. 
    All storm drainage systems shall be designed and constructed in accordance with the rainfall and runoff data in current use by the City Engineer and subject to the approval of the City Engineer. The Governing Body reserves the right to require that main sewers or canals be designed to handle storms occurring on an average frequency of twenty-five (25) years when engineering studies indicate such to be advisable. The Governing Body reserves the right to prohibit the filling of low-lying areas and to zone such areas for uses that would not be damaged by short duration flooding, where the estimated economic gains such areas might produce is not substantially greater than the cost of providing adequate storm drainage and other required improvements and services. 
    The cost of such work shall be borne by the sub-divider or developer. After these improvements have been constructed to the City's standards, and maintained for the specified period, all such improvements shall become the property of the City of Cleveland. 
    Whenever the Plan Review Committee deems it appropriate and necessary, in keeping with and in facilitating development of the Comprehensive Plan, the sub-divider may be required to install drainage structures in excess of those required to adequately serve the sub-division. In these cases, the City may reimburse the sub-divider for the difference in cost between the drainage facilities actually needed in the sub-division and the cost of the drainage facilities necessary to provide for planned future development. 
702.10. - Water Supply 
    Public water shall be supplied to the site by the City in accordance with their established policies concerning construction and financing. The on-site water supply system shall be constructed by the developer and shall be adequate to supply the requirements of the subdivision for domestic use and fire protection in accordance with the standards of the State Rating Bureau. The cost of pipe sizes in excess of those required to actually serve the Subdivision may be borne by the City of Cleveland. 
    Design and supervision of work shall be done by a qualified Licensed Professional Engineer in accordance with standard specifications of the City Engineer of the City of Cleveland. 
702.11. - Sanitary Sewers 
    The Sanitary Sewer system for the City of Cleveland is administered by the Director of Public Works and the City Engineer, or their authorized representative under the Sewer User ordinance of the City of Cleveland. All property inside the City of Cleveland is required to make use of the sanitary sewer and wastewater treatment system if it is available. 
    Sanitary sewers shall be constructed to provide a minimum of one (1) four (4) inch connection at the street boundary line for each lot or parcel of record and shall be so designed and constructed as to form an integral part of the sanitary disposal system of the City in conformity with the Comprehensive Plan and in accordance with current specifications of the City Engineer. 
    Minimum pipe size allowed shall be eight (8) inches in diameter, except where a line shall provide service for no more than four single family residences and shall not exceed one hundred fifty (150) feet in length. In such cases, a six (6) inch pipe may be used. A minimum service connection of four (4) inches for one (1) single family dwelling and a minimum service connection of six (6) inches for two-family dwellings or more shall be required. 
    Sanitary manholes shall be spaced at intervals not to exceed four hundred (400) feet and at each junction or change in alignment. 
    Design and supervision of the work shall be done be a Licensed Professional Engineer. 
    Prior to the assumption by the City of the maintenance of the sanitary sewer system, the sub-divider shall convey title of the system to the City. 
    When any of the sanitary sewers within a proposed subdivision or sewers necessary to connect the proposed subdivision with the City sewer system or an outlet acceptable to the City Engineer are so located that portions thereof may be a segment of a sanitary sewer main or fall out, the Plan Review Committee may require the sub-divider to install sewer pipe for that portion of the line which may become a main or outfall sewer of such size as may be necessary to facilitate future expansion of the sanitary sewer system. In these instances, the City may reimburse the sub-divider for the extra cost incurred for installing larger sewer mains. If a sewerage lift station is required to service the subdivision, the cost of said lift station shall be borne by the sub-divider. Should a lift station be required with a greater capacity than that needed to serve the proposed subdivision, the City Engineer may require the sub-divider to install a greater capacity lift station. In these instances, the City may reimburse the sub-divider for the extra cost incurred by installing a greater capacity lift station. 
702.12. - Storm and Sanitary Sewers Outside City. 
    City of Cleveland requirements and policy regarding the construction or extension of storm or sanitary sewers outside the corporate limits of the City which connect to City owned and operated sewers or which the City may, at some future time, be requested to accept for operation and maintenance, shall be as follows: 
a.  Any storm or sanitary sewer main, submain, lateral, or service connection or pumping station constructed outside the corporate limits of the City of Cleveland to connect with, and discharge into, a sewer maintained and operated by the City or any department of the City shall be constructed in accordance with these provisions. 
b.  Any storm or sanitary sewer main, submain, lateral, service connections or pumping stations constructed outside the corporate boundaries of the City of Cleveland which will not, at the time of construction, be connected to or discharge into the City sewer system, but which the owner or builder may expect the City to accept for operation and maintenance, at some future date, shall be constructed in accordance with these provisions. When, at some future time the City extends its area of responsibility for storm and sanitary sewers to include said sewer or any part thereof, the City may refuse to accept the entire sewer or any portion thereof that it determines to be unsatisfactory because of inadequate size, improper design, inaccessible location, or inferior materials or workmanship in construction. Further, the City may replace such sewer or part thereof that it considers unsatisfactory, and assess the cost of such replacement against the property benefited in accordance with the provisions of Chapter 495 of the Laws of Mississippi of 1950 as amended. 
c.  Design and construction-Improvements shall be designed by and constructed under the supervision of a Licensed Professional Engineer. 
d.  All design and construction shall be in accordance with the design criteria and specifications in use by the City Engineer at the time such design is accomplished. 
e.  All construction described above shall be properly designed and of sufficient size to adequately serve the potential requirements of the entire area not already similarly served. 
f.  All construction described above must be inspected during construction by the City Engineer or his authorized representative, and such construction will not conform to the requirements of this policy until the City Engineer or his authorized representative, shall have issued a certificate of acceptance certifying that it conforms to the requirements of the specifications then in current use by the City Engineer for such construction. 
g.  Location-Where a sewer is not constructed in a dedicated public street, road, or alley, an easement not less than twenty (20) feet in width for the construction, operation and maintenance of the sewer shall be taken in the name of the City of Cleveland. 
h.  Acceptance by the City-At such time as the corporate limits of the City of Cleveland may be extended to include a sewer extension or any part thereof, the portion that was designed and constructed in accordance with the requirements established herein and any other sewer construction within the newly established corporate boundaries shall be considered for adoption by the City. After inspection, all facilities that the City considers satisfactory shall become the property of the City of Cleveland with no cost to the City. The City shall assume responsibility for operation and maintenance of such sewers subject to all statutes, ordinances, rules, regulations, and policy decisions governing the operation of the municipal sewer system, storm or sanitary. 
i.  Responsibility for operation and maintenance-Operation, repair, or maintenance of any sewer extension, including all pipe lines, manholes, pumping stations or other appurtenances thereto shall be the responsibility of the party or parties constructing said sewers, and the City of Cleveland does not agree to assume responsibility for any of these functions until such time as the corporate boundaries may be extended to include said sewers.

ARTICLE 10. - DESIGN REVIEW GUIDELINES 
    The intent of the City's design standards is to promote a more pro-active growth and development strategy as well as good quality design, for the purpose of maintaining the long-term economic viability of the community, as well as its quality of life. Although this Ordinance does not require strict adherence to a particular design style, it does encourage respect for general design qualities and characteristics. Compliance with these standards is required in order to secure a building permit for multi-family developments, manufactured housing developments, and any non-residential projects including, but not limited to, individual commercial buildings or shopping centers and industrial developments. These guidelines control the design of uses in the Multi-family Residential (R-5), Neighborhood Commercial (B-1), Central Business (B-2), Highway Commercial (B-3), Light Industrial (M-1), Heavy Industrial (M-2), and Government (X-1) Zoning Districts within the City. Non-residential uses permitted as special exceptions within the Agricultural (A-1) and Single-family Residential (R 1-4) zoning districts shall also be required to follow the requirements of this Article. 
    The B-2H Historic Central Business District is regulated by the Crosstie Historic District Design Guidelines, the Historic Preservation Ordinance, and the Cleveland Heritage Commission. 
    Detached, single-family residences are exempt from these requirements. 
    This Article utilizes design element standards to evaluate a project's architectural design and site layout through the submission of a Development Plan. These design standards are itemized by design element: 
1.  Site preparation 
2.  Parking areas and traffic circulation 
3.  Lighting 
4.  Building form and materials 
5.  Landscaping, screening, and fencing 
6.  Signage 
    All standards for design and construction of infrastructure improvements on an individual site shall be conducted in accordance with those required for subdivisions. 
    A Development Plan must demonstrate the character and objectives of the proposed project to the Plan Review Committee in adequate detail for evaluation of the effects the proposed project would have upon the Zoning District and surrounding properties. The plan must provide sufficient and specific information to aid in the determination of what provisions, if any, should be included as part of the plan and be binding on the use and development of the subject property. The filing of a Development Plan for approval constitutes an agreement by the owner and applicant, their successors and assigns, that if the Development Plan is approved, any building or use and occupancy certificates issued for the improvement of the property shall be in conformance with the approved Development Plan. 

Sec. 1001. - Site preparation. 
1001.1. - General. 
    Where off-site roadway or utility improvements are required as a result of the proposed development, those improvements shall be the responsibility of the applicant and shall be constructed or installed prior to any final inspection or the issuance of an occupancy certificate. 
    All grading plans, storm water drainage plans, plans for the provision of storm water detention, and the engineering construction plans for parking areas, roadway and utility improvements shall be reviewed and approved by the Plan Review Committee. 
1001.2. - Grading. 
1.  Temporary soil erosion shall be minimized through the retention of natural vegetation and topography continuously until the completion of the project. The period of construction shall be of a duration reasonable to the size and complexity of the development. The required development plan shall include an erosion control plan for sites larger than one (1) acre. The methods utilized and the minimum standards for care of the area during construction shall be in conformance with the requirements of the City of Cleveland. 
2.  Buildings and improvements shall be located on the site to minimize changes to the existing landscape, landforms, and topography as well as the loss of existing, mature landscaping. All existing trees eight (8) inches or larger in diameter shall be reflected on the Landscape Plan, and where they are proposed to be removed, justifications shall be provided. 
3.  Areas of natural vegetation shall be preserved along property lines, fence rows, and drainage ways and should be incorporated into the site's overall design concept. 
1001.3. - Storm Water Drainage. 
1.  No project shall cause downstream properties, water courses, channels, or conduits to receive storm water runoff from the proposed project at a higher peak flow rate than would result from the same storm event occurring over the site of the proposed project with the land in its natural, undeveloped condition. Where downstream conditions would be overtaxed by runoff from present or planned developments, and where runoff cannot be absorbed upon the site, detention areas shall be created where possible to slow runoff. All storm water storage facilities shall be designed with sufficient capacity to accommodate all runoff caused by the project in excess of the runoff which would have resulted from the site left in its natural, undeveloped state. The storage capacity of all storage facilities shall be sufficient to store one hundred fifteen (115) percent of the excess flow, in each watershed, which would result from a twenty-five (25) year storm of twenty-four (24) hour duration. 
2.  Wetlands, which are important to storm water retention, shall be maintained. The elimination of wetland areas upon the site, and the mitigation required for such elimination, shall be governed by the U. S. Army Corps of Engineers. 
3.  Storm water entry and discharge points shall be protected to minimize erosion and to avoid relocating a problem to upstream or downstream properties. 
4.  In order to minimize storm water runoff, the amount of the site in impervious surface, such as roofs and pavement, should be minimized. The maximum impervious surface shall not be greater than seventy-five (75) percent of the property. 
5.  Where the subject property is impacted by a surface drainage ditch, creek, river, or other waterway, the banks of the waterway will be stabilized as directed by the Plan Review Committee. Proposed methods of stabilization should be as natural and vegetative as possible to retain the integrity of the existing waterway and to limit hard-surfaced engineered solutions. 
6.  No building or structure, or any portion thereof, shall be constructed within the limits of special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year flood, as identified in the applicable Flood Insurance Rate Map distributed by the Federal Emergency Management Agency, unless the lowest floor elevation of the building or structure is higher than, or is raised by filling to, an elevation higher than the Base Flood Elevation. The applicant shall conduct on-site topographic surveys to locate the precise floodplain line on the subject parcel. Any structure placed within the floodplain shall be anchored firmly to prevent floodwaters from carrying it downstream. 
Sec. 1002. - Parking and vehicular and pedestrian circulation. 
1002.1 - Parking and Vehicular Circulation Requirements: 
1.  All required parking spaces shall be provided on the subject site.

Additionally, the following vehicle storage parking areas shall also be paved: vehicle sales, mobile and/or manufactured homes, wrecker service/impound yard, boat sales, and tractor-trailer drop-off and/or service lots. 
6.  Loading areas shall be hard surfaced of either concrete or asphalt, and shall be scaled to the loading demand created by the use of the property and the size of the delivery vehicles used. 
7.  All parking areas and loading areas shall be provided with a permanent concrete curb. In addition, all landscaped areas that can be encroached upon by a motor vehicle, shall be protected by a wheel stop constructed of concrete, appropriately anchored to the pavement, and set a minimum of two (2) feet back from the curb to restrict the destruction of landscape materials by vehicles. 
8.  The driveways, private streets, parking areas, traffic aisles, fire lanes, loading areas, exterior lighting, signage, internal crosswalks, curb stops, pedestrian facilities, and such other transportation related improvements depicted upon the approved Development Plan, shall be considered as binding elements of the project in the same manner as the proposed buildings, landscaping, and other details. The applicant, his successors, assigns, and/or subsequent owners and their agents shall be responsible for the continued maintenance of all such private improvements in accordance with the approved Development Plan. The parking areas shall be maintained in a clean manner free of all litter and other debris. Grass shall be removed from all curbs and sidewalk areas. Potholes in the parking lot surface, cracks in the pavement or sidewalks, and all other signs of the physical deterioration of all approved improvements shall be repaired or replaced within thirty (30) days following notification by the City. 
1002.2. - Pedestrian circulation requirements: 
1.  Sidewalk materials should blend with the natural landscape, avoiding slick concrete. Examples of acceptable finishes are broom finished, colored, or exposed aggregate concrete.

4.  When, as a result of the proposed project, street signs, traffic signals, or traffic regulatory signs are required, the applicant shall be responsible for the installation of all such devices and signs. All such devices and signs installed on public right-of-way will be maintained by the City following completion of the project and inspection that such devices and signs were installed properly. 
5.  The driveways, private streets, parking areas, traffic aisles, fire lanes, loading areas, exterior lighting, signage, internal crosswalks, curb stops, pedestrian facilities, and such other transportation related improvements depicted upon the approved Development Plan, shall be considered as binding elements of the project in the same manner as the proposed buildings, landscaping, and other details. The applicant, his successors, assigns, and/or subsequent owners and their agents shall be responsible for the continued maintenance of all such private improvements in accordance with the approved Development Plan. The parking areas shall be maintained in a clean manner free of all litter and other debris. Grass shall be removed from all curbs and sidewalk areas. Potholes in the parking lot surface, cracks in the pavement or sidewalks, and all other signs of the physical deterioration of all approved improvements shall be repaired or replaced within thirty (30) days following notification by the City.

1004.1. - Exterior Building. 
1.  Multi-family structures shall be designed to be compatible with the character of single-family residential structures within the community. In all such cases, the compatibility of the multi-family, commercial, or industrial projects in the Multi-Family Residential (R-5), Manufactured Housing Residential (R-6) Neighborhood Commercial (B-1), Central Business (B-2), Highway Commercial (B-3), Light Industrial (M-1), Heavy Industrial (M-2), and Government (X-1) Zoning Districts, shall be determined by comparing the consistency of the design elements, colors, materials, and landscaping of the proposed buildings with the existing design elements, colors, materials, and landscaping of the adjoining residential structures. 
2.  Building facades of an individual structure on a single lot should generally be oriented parallel to the streets they face, such that their main entrances are visible as a means of creating continuous streetscapes. 
3.  The continuity of design goes beyond the primary elevation of the building. The materials and colors of the street face shall continue on the sides and rear of the building. 
4.  Building setbacks shall conform to the applicable zoning district requirements of the Zoning Ordinance for the City of Cleveland. 
5.  Building heights shall conform to the applicable zoning district requirements of the Zoning Ordinance for the City of Cleveland. 
6.  It is recommended that the wall of any such building be interrupted through the use of projections or recesses, portals, courtyards, plazas, or other appropriate architectural convention. 
7.  Building materials should suit the architectural style of the building and should be consistent or complementary throughout the structure or total project. The use of high quality construction materials is important for long-term durability and appearance. For the purposes of these standards, "predominate" means having the most publicly visible surface areas. The term "walls" shall be any exterior surface on a building that are either vertical or have a slope steeper than one half (1/2) foot of horizontal run for every twelve (12) feet of vertical rise. The preferred materials, in order of preference, are listed as follows: 
a.  Brick (100%). 
b.  Cementous Stucco (100%). 
c.  "Split-Face" Concrete Block. 
d.  Drivit, EIFS, or STOWE. 
8.  The use of flat-faced concrete block or metal veneer as the primary or predominate material is prohibited, except that metal veneer may be used in the M-1, M-2, and X-1 zoning districts as the primary or predominate façade material because of the nature of industrial zones. Metal veneer may be used as the primary or predominate façade material for additions to existing non-conforming metal structures when matching existing building materials in all commercial or industrial zoning districts. 
1004.2. - Doors and Windows. 
    An essential characteristic of architecture is a traditional appearance of buildings, walls, and openings. Walls define the overall form of buildings, while openings give them a human scale and the appearance of being occupied. Treatment of doors, windows, and glazed surfaces, with the exception of steel fire doors which are located under portals or canopies with a depth of six (6) inches or more, shall be as follows: 
1.  The treatment of doors and windows shall be uniform throughout the building design, with the exception of designated fire doors. 
2.  Openings shall be encased with trim. 
3.  All glazing shall be clear, tinted neutral gray, leaded, frosted, or decorative glass. The use of mirrored glass may be approved by the Plan Review Committee. 
4.  Consideration is granted for the appropriateness of each architectural feature, such as use of decorative trim around the roof perimeter, all doors and windows, and signs; decorative wrought iron used as gates, fencing, windows, and railings; decorative use of brick, stucco, or stone accents around walls, columns, rooflines, doors and windows, including crown molding. 
1004.3. - Roof Standards. 
1.  Roof design should be appropriate for the architectural style of the building. Material allowed on pitched roofs visible to the public, are enameled standing seam or ribbed metal, flat tiles of concrete or clay, architectural shingles, and copper. All surfaces concealed from public view by parapets (flat, built-up, or pitched roofs), may utilize wood textured composition shingles, architectural shingles, or other approved material. The use of plastic, fiberglass, other metal, or glass, shall be approved by the Plan Review Committee. The use of bright, high intensity colors is strictly prohibited. 
2.  Parapet facades may be used when of unified construction with the primary surface of the wall and of the same material and color. The parapet shall be designed such that the reverse side of all elements shall not be visible to public view. False mansards are prohibited. Canopies are permissible provided they are an integrated part of the overall building design, are not used to create the impression of a false mansard, and are not used as a location or support for wall-mounted signage. 
Sec. 1005. - Landscaping, screening, and fencing. 
1005.1. - General Landscaping Requirements. 
    Twenty (20) percent of all multi-family residential, commercial, industrial, or government zoned property shall be landscaped. Where side or rear yards are required as buffer strips, they may serve to meet the twenty percent requirement provided such area is in conjunction with or separately consist of twenty percent of the land area of the property. Grassy areas may be counted as a portion of the twenty percent requirement however the City of Cleveland recommends that neatly landscaped areas represent a majority of the required area. Such landscaped areas shall be planted and maintained so as to present a healthy, neat and orderly appearance. The required yard shall be kept free from refuse and debris. As part of the overall Development Plan, a Landscaping Plan shall be submitted for approval to the Plan Review Committee. 
1005.2. - Screening and Bufferyards. 
    Transitional screening is required where commercial, industrial, or multi-family uses adjoin single-family residential areas or uses and within Planned Unit Developments with similar use relationships as set forth in Article 6 of this Ordinance. 
1.  Bufferyards shall be located on the outer perimeter of a lot or parcel, extending to the lot or parcel boundary line, along the side and rear property lines. 
2.  Bufferyards shall not be located within any portion of a public or private street right-of-way. 
3.  Bufferyards shall remain in the ownership of the owner of the property upon which it is located except as noted. 
4.  The bufferyard requirements of a specific use, property, development, or project, shall be determined by referring to Article 6 of this Ordinance. 
5.  A use, property, development, or project may continue to comply with the bufferyard requirements in effect at the time of the issuance of its initial approval, regardless of whether an adjacent lot, site, or common development is rezoned to a less intense district, requiring additional bufferyard area or screening. 
6.  Bufferyard areas shall be treated with sod and/or other types of vegetative ground cover for areas under ten thousand (10,000) square feet. Areas greater than ten thousand (10,000) square feet may be seeded with an improved turf type grass seed and/or other types of vegetative ground cover. 
1005.3. - Fencing. 
1.  In addition to Bufferyards, service and utility functions shall be screened from public view in order to reinforce the natural environment and a consistent streetscape. Any materials such as milk crates, bread carts, shelving, pallets, cardboard collections, paper goods, etc., shall be stored on the interior of all commercial and multi-family structures unless stored in an approved area to prevent scattering and screened from any public view. 
a.  Garbage collection areas shall be located at the rear of buildings and shall be enclosed on all sides by a gated solid wall or approved gated opaque fencing. 
b.  Dumpster enclosures shall be located on a concrete pad, of such size as recommended by the Plan Review Committee. 
c.  The approach to the dumpster area shall be paved concrete, of a specification sufficient to support the weight and continual use of the garbage collection vehicle. 
d.  The screening on all enclosed dumpsters shall be a minimum of at least two (2) feet taller than the dumpster. 
e.  For compaction units, a floor drain shall be provided which ties to the sanitary sewer with an approved silt separator. 
f.  Either the dumpster enclosure must be constructed of sufficient size to accommodate all refuse materials to be recycled, such as grease barrels for restaurants and used oil barrels for automotive uses, or a separate enclosed pad of the same specification provided. 
g.  The use of chain-link fences as a screening device for garbage collection areas is strictly prohibited. 
h.  Fences shall not be located on any type of easement unless specifically approved by the Building Official. 
i.  Wall and fences shall not impede or divert the flow of storm water. 
j.  Walls and fences shall not block access to any above ground pad mounted transformer and shall provide a minimum clear access to the transformer doors, as required by the utility company. 
k.  Mechanical, communications, and service equipment, including satellite dishes and vent pipes, shall be totally screened from public view by parapets or walls. All building mounted equipment set forth above shall be either screened by parapets, walls, or painted to visually match adjacent surfaces. 
ARTICLE 11. - HISTORIC PRESERVATION DESIGN REVIEW GUIDELINES 
    The City of Cleveland has two historic districts, one nationally recognized and one nationally and locally recognized. The nationally (only) recognized district is the Founders Historic District, a residential area just west of downtown. Property owners are able to apply for tax credits based on their location in this district, but they are not regulated as a part of this Article for design review regarding construction and rehabilitation of historic structures. However, property owners in the Founders District shall comply with all other Articles of this Ordinance. The Crosstie Historic District is a nationally and locally recognized Historic District, meaning that the City has recognized the need for extra review and control to preserve this area as a historic preservation district. All property owners within the local Crosstie Historic District shall comply with all regulations as described within this Article in addition to any other applicable City standards and requirements. The Crosstie Historic District, any other previously designated local historic districts, landmarks, or historic sites in the City of Cleveland, Mississippi are hereby re-designated and re-confirmed. These designations shall continue with their previously identified boundaries. 
    The Crosstie Historic District is significant because it exemplifies Cleveland's early pattern of development, beginning with the first establishment of commercial and industrial enterprises and the construction of its civic and institutional buildings. The district's period of significance covers approximately sixty years, 1886-1948. The district encompasses an ample collection of historic architecture, particularly commercial types and styles, and retains its architectural integrity. The significance of the bayou and railroad corridor as an origin point, as an influence, and as a stimulant to downtown's development cannot be over emphasized. Overall, the district is significant for more than its development pattern, its developmental period, or its architecture; the district is valuable as both a determinant factor in and as a reflection of the development of the city and the surrounding region. 
    The Crosstie Historic District has a unique and distinctive appearance because of the manner in which it developed and because of the pattern formed by its construction or visual character. Visual character refers to the general appearance of an area created by its architecture, open spaces, streetscape features, landscaping, etc. As the commercial core of the city, Downtown Cleveland features a loose grid street pattern arranged around its early transportation corridor. In general, most buildings are turn-of-the-century, one-story, attached in a row, and line the sidewalk. Brick construction, awnings, and signs are characteristic of this commercial area. The early transportation corridor, running through the center of the district, forms a unique and historic open space. Parking rows and lots line the railroad and sidewalks, and there are a few empty properties. Streetscape features connecting the buildings and spaces include raised sidewalks, streetlights, and some planters. 
Crosstie Historic District Boundaries


Sec. 1101. - Visual character. 
1101.1. - Architecture. 
    Buildings are commonly identified and categorized by: age, use or function, building type, architectural style, method of construction, etc. Characteristics may be unique to a specific building or may be shared by a variety of buildings. 
Common Elements of a Downtown Building

  Within the historic district, buildings range in age reflecting the period of significance. Most buildings are late nineteenth and early twentieth century. Modern infill construction is easily distinguished because of the failure to use compatible openings, materials, and ornamentation. 
  In terms of use, buildings are constructed to shelter a variety of functions. The three most common uses found in the downtown area are: 1) commercial or retail establishments, 2) industrial or warehouse enterprises, and 3) public or civic institutions. The majority of buildings are commercial in character. 
As buildings are reused, new uses which may or may not be the same as the original use are often introduced into an existing building. For example, professional offices occupy renovated interiors of residential buildings and old warehouses may be modified to house apartments. Preservationists refer to this "recycling" of buildings as adaptive reuse . Changes in use do not have to impair the historic character of a building. 
  In general, type refers to a set of buildings which share distinctive architectural characteristics. A building type can indicate whether a building is rare or common in an area and in some cases, identify the historical period in which the structure was most likely built. The three most common commercial building types in the historic district are: the store-front, the double-front, and the business block. 
Common Commercial Building Types 
    Store front The simplest type of commercial building is the store-front, names for the traditional use of its first floor. On buildings more than one story high, the upper level often serves a different use and features the elements common for upper facades. One-story storefronts are common in the historic district and often appear in twos and threes. 
    Double-front The double-front was built for two enterprises. Buildings may be one or two stories high. The double-front differs from the business block, which may also have two storefronts, in that it does not have an emphasized central entrance or a high degree of ornamentation. One-story, double-front commercial buildings are common in the historic district. 
    Business Block The business block refers to a commercial building which usually covers a large or entire city lot. The building ranges from two to four stories high and has a high degree of architectural detailing. A prominent central entrance may be emphasized further by a roof pediment. If the ground level is divided in to a series of storefronts, such buildings may be referred to as continuous business blocks. Secondary entrances to upper levels are common. The historic district contains a few prominent business blocks. 

  Style is one of the most basic methods of classification. Essentially style refers to the external ornamentation or decoration of a building. When all the defining aspects of a particular style are present, a building may be labeled as a high style example. If only a few stylistic details are present, the building is referred to as having elements of a style or as influenced by a style. High style buildings are few in number and are often designed by an architect; whereas, buildings with elements of a style are quite common as local interpretations of an architectural style. Buildings with no stylistic details are termed vernacular and usually referred to by type. 
The majority of buildings in the Crosstie Historic District are vernacular or have elements of an architectural style. Only a few structures exhibit clear high style construction. High style examples include the Post Office (now the Police Station), the Coca Cola building, the Nehi building, and the Regent and Ellis theaters. 


    Other Aspects of Visual Character -An area's character is also defined by features other than buildings, such as open space (or lack thereof), site features, streetscape features, landscaping, parking, etc. 
    The bayou and railroad corridor through the center of the district is an important open space. Inappropriate modern plantings and excessive parking would diminish the integrity of this significant resource and of the district as a whole. The line-of-sight, such as the visibility of Sharpe Avenue from one end to the other, is also an important visual characteristic of the district which should be valued and preserved. Site features, such as fences, walls, satellite dishes, mechanical systems, etc. are generally utilitarian in character and unobtrusive in placement. Modern streetscape features, such as street lights, planters, and banners, provide additional recognition and cohesion for downtown enterprises. Parking should remain on-street, and no buildings or open space should be lost to additional parking areas. 
Sec. 1102. - Five main concepts for buildings within the historical districts. 
    The following principles and guidelines are established in order to ensure any new development of buildings or any alteration to existing buildings within the Historic Preservation Districts is conducted in a respectable manner that accentuates and takes advantage of the historical character of Cleveland. 
    Based on the construction of historic downtowns, there are five main concepts that should guide the new construction of buildings to complement the existing historical character. The building a) placement and orientation, b) form and scale, c) skin, d) openings, and e) attachments all work together to create the downtown atmosphere that the City of Cleveland is preserving through the creation of historic preservation districts and architectural design guidelines. 
1102.1. - Building Placement and Orientation. 
    Building placement is an important characteristic of site planning. Placement refers to where the building will be situated upon the lot. Building placement responds to elements such as setback and spacing. The building setback is how far the building is placed from the front, side, or rear property lines. The building spacing refers to the distance between buildings on adjoining lots. In the historic district, buildings share a similar setback and spacing. Most buildings in the historic district have a zero setback (located on the property line) and are attached (sharing side walls with flanking buildings.) 
    Principle 1: New buildings should follow the traditional placement pattern. Most buildings in the historic district have a zero setback (located on the property line) and are attached (sharing side walls with flanking buildings). A new building should not be placed forward or behind the established setback or façade line, which is the visual line created by the repetition of similar setbacks by historic buildings. New buildings should also be attached, having a zero setback, rather than freestanding. Institutional and civic buildings are exceptions to the rule; these buildings are generally freestanding and located centrally upon the property. Industrial architecture follows both patterns. When evaluating new construction, reference nearby buildings and the appropriate type of building (i.e. commercial, civic, industrial, etc. 

Inappropriate placement and orientation detracts from the visual character of the historic district. 
    Principle 2: New additions should be placed to the rear of existing buildings. Additions can have a tremendous negative impact upon building placement if added to the front of a building. The façade line would be disturbed. The most appropriate place for a new addition is on the rear of the existing structure. 
    Principle 3: New construction should maintain the setback established by neighboring historic buildings. 

The new building (top row) follows the traditional setback of its historic neighbors while the new building (bottom row) disrupts the pattern by recessing its façade wall from the sidewalk line. 
    Principle 4: New construction should be placed so that the side spacing approximates that of historic buildings on the same block. 

The new building (far left) shares its sidewall with the neighboring building unlike the new building (center), which disrupts this pattern by setting itself apart from the neighboring buildings. 
    Orientation is another significant site characteristic that simply refers to the direction that the primary entrance of a building "faces". In the historic district, the railroad had a tremendous influence on orientation where most buildings in the downtown area follow a clear pattern of being oriented towards the railroad. 
    Principle 5: New buildings should follow the traditional orientation pattern. Historically dependent on the railroad, most of the buildings in the downtown developed along the railroad corridor. Commercial establishments presented their "faces" to pedestrians in order to attract customers. Therefore, all buildings along a block tend to share a similar orientationtoward the street. Corner buildings usually face the more important of the two streets. Civic buildings may have multiple facades; thus, these structures may face more than one street. New buildings should repeat the orientation of the historic buildings on the same block. When evaluating new construction, reference the location, nearby historic structures, and the specific type of building (i.e. commercial, civic, industrial, etc.). 

The new building (center) disrupts the traditional orientation pattern by not facing its primary entrance to the street. 
    Principle 6: New additions should not alter the orientation of historic buildings. New additions can alter the orientation of a historic building by shifting the primary entrance or creating a new primary entrance. New entrances should be carefully evaluated to determine their impact upon orientation. 
1102.2. - Building Form and Scale. 

The repetition of similar form and scale creates unity in the historic district and distinguishes the area from other parts of the city. 
    Building form is the combination of the "silhouette" and the "footprint". It refers to the shape and appearance of a building. The "silhouette" of a building is defined by the outside lines of the building. Each building has four silhouettes or sides. On blueprints, each side is known as an "elevation." The front elevation is also known as the "façade." The shape, pitch, and complexity of the roof, also known as the parapet, influence the building form or the "silhouette". 

    The "footprint" of a building is formed by the lines of the exterior walls of the building on the ground. On blueprints, this is known as the "plan" or "floor plan." Buildings in downtown Cleveland are primarily one single block with rectangular silhouettes and footprints. Parapets provide the only relief, or change in shape, to this geometric pattern. 

    Principle 1: New construction should incorporate building forms that reflect the established form of the historic district. A dominant component of form is the roof and its shape, pitch, and complexity. Other ingredients are the height of the foundation, story heights, and whether a building is composed of a single block or several small blocks. Downtown buildings are primarily one single block with rectangular silhouettes and footprints. Parapets provide the only relief, or change in shape, to this geometric pattern. New buildings should feature parapets. 

Though this new building has the same rectilinear form and number of stories as its historic neighbors, it fails to match their height due to a lower roofline and the lack of a parapet. 
  
    Principle 2: New addition forms should repeat the proportions of existing forms and should not destroy or obscure the form of the existing buildings. The roof form and foundation height of an addition should closely match the original proportion of the building. Additions, which are secondary and discernible, should not alter the footprint of a building so drastically as to completely obscure the original form. 
a.  Building Form: Roofline 
Roofs are an important character and form defining feature. In the historic district, rooflines of commercial and warehouse buildings are distinguished primarily by the use of parapets, false walls which create a distinctive roofline and hide the low-pitched roof behind the parapet. A few examples, usually institutional or civic buildings, do not follow this general rule. 
    Principle a1: Roof design should be maintained and preserved. Important aspects of roof design include its pitch, shape, symmetry, and complexity. As most roofs in the historic district are simple parapet forms, changes which alter, cover, or detract from the parapet roofline are not appropriate. These rooflines are also important for their simplicity and should not be embellished. 

Parapets are a distinguishing feature of rooflines in the downtown area. Most are very geometric; however, a few possess curvilinear shapes. 
  
    Principle a2: During roof repair and replacement, new materials should match original materials. Architecturally distinctive roofing material should be carefully handled during repairs and reused when possible. As parapets are designed to hide a low-pitched roof plane, the actual roofing material is less significant for such buildings. Roof pitch and materials may be altered for improved drainage may be altered for improved drainage provided that the new roof does not rise above the parapet or lap over onto building elevations. 

The addition of a new gable roof form is not consistent with the traditional use of parapets and disrupts the distinctive roofline created by a row of historic commercial buildings. 
  
    Principle 3: Secondary features and distinctive materials which contribute to design should be retained. Chimneys, often used for both decorative and utilitarian purposes, should be kept in good repair and not removed even when no longer in use. Skylights should be maintained whenever possible. Flashing, gutters, and downspouts should be examined and repaired during roof improvements; whereas, defunct roof pipes and vents may be removed. 
    Scale is the combination of mass and volume of a structure; it refers to the height, width, and depth. The majority of buildings in the downtown area are one-story with the exception of a few two-story buildings and a historic multi-story hotel. Most buildings are also no more than three or four bays wide meaning one building may have three or four different façade details or storefronts. The uniform scale of historic buildings and new construction is essential to the visual character of the historic district. 
    Principle 4: New buildings should follow the established scale of the historic district. The majority of buildings in the downtown area are one-story with the exception of a few two-story buildings and a historic multi-story hotel. Most buildings are no more than three or four bays wide. New buildings should approximate the height, width of adjacent and nearby historic buildings. Building depth should be evaluated if lot coverage becomes an issue. If a building is to occupy several empty lots, it is essential that the façade be segmented with horizontal divisions to approximate the widths found upon historic examples. 

Width is a combination of actual linear footage as well as the number of vertical bays (horizontal divisions). 
Height is both the number of stories as well as the height of the building above grade. 
  
    Principle 5: New additions should be proportional to and discernable from the existing historic structure. New additions should not overwhelm the original structure. Additions should not alter nor obscure the original scale of historic buildings; additions should remain secondary to the principal building. An addition should also have a perceivable juncture where it adjoins the original building. This can be achieved by using a slightly lower roofline, recessing the wall back from (rather than flush with) the original wall, or the use of a separating element. 

Additions are easily discernable through a small recessed "juncture" and the use of openings which differ in shape while respecting placement and size. 
1102.3. - Building skin: Materials and ornamentation. 
    Materials and ornament have a significant impact upon visual character. Materials form the surface or walls of the building. The type of materials used defines a building in terms of both texture and color. In addition, ornamentation accentuates different portions of the building. The proper use of materials and ornamentation can allow a new building to become a contributing member of the historic district while introducing its own identity. 
    Principle 1: Exterior materials should be preserved and maintained. As the most common exterior material, brick is tremendously significant to the character of the historic district. Existing exteriors should not be covered by a modern replacement, including but not limited to: vinyl or aluminum siding, stucco or synthetic stucco (E.I.F.S.), western-motif plank siding, etc. Such materials rob a building of any historic integrity and its ability to contribute to the historic district. 
    Principle 2: New buildings should utilize traditional building materials. New buildings constructed with materials inconsistent with the district negatively impact the historic character of the area. Brick is the most common exterior material. Traditional materials uncommon to the area should not be used. Because of the permanence of masonry materials, the color of masonry materials for new construction should relate to existing historic buildings in the district to avoid inappropriate and uncharacteristic colors. Use of a primary color of brick for the façade and a secondary color for detail work will be considered; however, variegated brick is inappropriate. 
    Principle 3: New additions should utilize materials closely matching the original material of the building. Exterior materials for additions should relate in size, shape, and color to those of the original structure. 

The use of variegated brick or synthetic materials for pilasters is inappropriate in the historic district. 
    Principle 4: R epairs should be limited to affected areas, be sensitive to historic materials, and utilize matching materials. Repair of exterior materials should remove only the damaged material and replace it in kind. Mortar for reporting should be carefully selected because modern cement is rigid and will damage historic bricks which expand and contract. The gentlest means possible should be used for cleaning building exteriors. Never sandblast to clean or remove paint from buildings. Unpainted buildings should not be painted unless previous repair or damage has caused significant contrasts in the brick and mortar; however, painting non-historic buildings can camouflage over-sized or variegated brick and increase compatibility. Iridescent and florescent paint colors are inappropriate; neutral colors are preferred. Historic paint palettes are available at most paint suppliers. 
    Principle 5: Architectural elements should be retained, never covered or removed. A distinguishing feature of commercial buildings in the historic district is the alignment of decorative features along a block of buildings. Decorative elements along the roofline visually connect the buildings. Decorative brickwork and brick corbelling is often common at the roofline, along the cornice, and on the parapet wall. Industrial buildings are usually devoid of ornament; however, the two soda bottling plants have a high degree of ornamentation. Institutional and civic buildings frequently use classical ornamentation, such as pediments, columns, entablatures, and quoins. 

High style architectural elements are more common on institutional or civic buildings such as the old Post Office; however, some commercial facades are highly articulated like the Smith Block. 
  
    Principle 6: New buildings should use ornamentation reflecting the pattern established by existing construction. Ornamentation for new buildings should not exceed the degree of ornamentation found on existing buildings. Classical detailing should be reserved for banks and civic buildings; however, these details should be drawn from a period of development comparable to the district's architecture. Trim, brackets, braces, moldings, shingles and other such decorative features contribute ornamentation to buildings. 

    Principle 7: New additions should use the same or less ornamentation as found on the original structure. Less ornamentation for additions is encouraged. For additions to high style buildings, ornamentation which references the original structure's detailing may be considered; abstracted details are preferred. This change in ornamentation clearly denotes the addition as later construction. 
1102.4. - Building openings: Storefronts, entrances, and windows. 
    Entrances and display windows combine to form a street level storefront for commercial enterprises. Storefronts are a distinctive feature of the historic district. Historic storefront design includes the primary entrance, large display windows, panels known as bulkheads beneath the windows, a transom row above the windows, and ornamentation such as cast iron columns, a decorative cornice line, and other details. This arrangement of features provides an ideal opportunity to display goods for public viewing. Recessed entrances, tiled entryways, and double doors also contribute to storefront design. Additionally, secondary entrances to upper floors or for service purposes are also common. 
    Principle 1: New buildings should carefully reference the historic use of façade elements. Storefronts, entrances, and window openings pierce the walls and create voids upon a building's façade that creates a rhythm along the streetscape. These façade elements, with a few minor variances, generally align along a block. Most buildings also emphasize façade symmetry. Openings on the façade of new buildings should follow the example established by surrounding historic buildings. Quantity and placement of openings in new buildings is extremely important. New buildings should carefully balance solid and void. 

    Principle 2: New additions should follow the established pattern of elements found on the original building. As additions should be located on the rear of existing buildings, only corner properties will have exposed side elevations. For such properties, it is important to respect the pattern established by similar corner properties. 
    Principle 3: Original storefront configuration and materials should be preserved and maintained. Storefronts should not be covered or enclosed. Entrances should not be relocated or infilled. Display windows and transoms should not be enclosed, replaced with a different window type, or covered with a false front. 

    Principle 4: Replacement storefronts should follow the established traditional pattern. If the original storefront is too deteriorated to save, the replacement should accurately replicate the original. Where the original storefront no longer exists, the replacement should be based on historical research and physical evidence. Where no documentation exists, a new storefront should be designed which is compatible with original storefronts of adjacent and nearby historic buildings. 
    Principle 5: Existing entrances should be maintained and preserved. Entrances and their doors are evidence of the original use and design of a building. Original doors, their surrounds, and hardware should be retained. Entrance elementsthe location, the configuration (recessed or canted), the number and type of doors, and, tiled entryway floorsshould not be altered. Primary entrances should never be enclosed. Secondary entrances for upper floor access and service/delivery should be preserved even when no longer in use. 
    Principle 6: During repair and replacement of doors, care should be taken to match original materials and design. Deteriorated sections should be replaced rather than an entire door. If replacement of a door becomes necessary, the replacement should match the historic door in size, shape, materials, and panel patterns. Unfinished aluminum doors and residential type doors should not be installed. Adding decorative doors or surrounds to simple front entrances or utilitarian entrances diminishes the historic integrity of a building. Warehouse entrances are particularly simple and should not be embellished to create more formal entrances, such as those more characteristic of institutional and civic buildings or residential architecture. 

Original entrances should not be blocked-in, even if no longer in use. 
    Window and window features define the character of a building as well. Storefront windows of commercial buildings are used to create large expanses of glass and thus display space; however, on the upper facades and on institutional and civic buildings, the ratio of solid-to-void (wall to window) is very different. Typically, windows are regularly spaced with an emphasis on building symmetry. Upper windows are also trimmed with architectural detailing and window accessories, such as shutters, storm windows, and screens. 
    Principle 7: Historic windows should be preserved and maintained. Display windows and the transom row are essential to commercial storefront character. Smaller, sash windows and early metal frame windows are characteristic of industrial properties; these types of windows should remain simple and utilitarian. In contrast, institutional and civic buildings have prominent and regularly-spaced windows. 
    Principle 8: During repairs and renovation efforts, window configuration should be maintained. Display window and transoms should not be removed or covered. Damaged windows should be repaired by replacing affected sections with the same material and dimensions as the original. Replacement glass should be clear, not tinted. Additional or unfinished aluminum windows should not be installed. Installation of multi-divided pane windows is inappropriate and creates a false historic appearance. 

Non-historic decorative entrys and windows, referencing the Old West, Colonial New England, or New Orleans (depicted here) should not be added to falsify the storefront. 
    Principle 9: Storefront trim should be maintained and preserved. Bulkheads are the panels located beneath the display windows. Important bulkhead design elements include but are not limited to recessed panels, masonry ledges, and decorative trim. During repairs, it is important to replicate historic bulkheads. Wooden bulkheads should never be replaced with brick. Cast-iron columns and cornices should not be removed. Where the original ornamentation no longer exists, the replacement should be based on historical research and physical evidence. 
During rehabilitation, careful removal of non-historic material may reveal physical evidence of the original façade.

    Principle 10: Windows should be maintained and preserved. Historic windows are constructed of several components, such as rails, stiles, muntins, panes, sashes, and sills. Important aspects of window design include shape, dimension, grouping, spacing, type or operational category, pane arrangement, material, and ornamentation. Maintaining both window components and window arrangement is essential to building integrity. 
    Principle 11: During rehabilitation and renovation, the original window materials and design should be retained. Though in their original state historic windows do not equal today's standards of energy efficiency, they should not be replaced. Efforts to increase energy efficiency and the operation of windows should keep the historic components intact. Window openings should not be enclosed, covered, or partially infilled for the installation of different shape or size windows. Additional window openings should never be added to the front of a building. During renovation efforts, enclosed and covered window opening should be reversed and inappropriate replacement windows removed. 

    Principle 12: Windows should be repaired, rather than replaced. Damaged windows should be repaired by replacing the affected components and restoring the functional elements. Original window openings should be utilized if replacement is required by the severity of deterioration. Replacement windows should closely match the original window design. Fixed windows and simulated divided light windows ("snap-in" muntins) are inappropriate. Traditional framing materials such as wood are preferred for replacement windows; whereas, unfinished aluminum windows are inappropriate. New glazing should not be tinted or coated with a reflective material. 
    Principle 13: Visual impact of window accessories should be kept to a minimum. Storm windows and screens should not obscure the window's pane arrangement. Such features should be of wood or aluminum painted to match the original window frame, and the glazing should be clear. The use of interior storm windows rather than exterior storm windows is encouraged. Security grills with extensive metalwork should be avoided and are best installed on the interior of the building. 

Storm windows and screens should match the shape and design of the window. Interior storm windows are a better solution. 
1102.5. - Building attachments: Shutters, awnings, porches, and signs. 
    Principle 1: Historic shutters should be maintained. Shutters were used to provide shade, privacy, security, and decoration for buildings. Replacement shutters should be of the same material and design as the original. Where shutters have been lost or removed, historic photographs and hardware remnants may provide physical documentation of the original design. Windows which never had shutters should be left in this condition. Decorative shutters permanently affixed to the wall of a building are not considered appropriate replacements. Utilitarian type shutters on secondary elevations and on warehouse properties should not be replaced with decorative shutters. 

Shutter design should reflect the original use of the building and should fit the window opening. 
    Awnings, canopies, and porches frequently provide shade for building interiors, shelter for walkways, and ornament for exteriors. Awnings are common in this historic district. Canopies and porches are limited in number and are appropriate for only a few types of buildings. 
    Principle 2: Historic awnings, canopies, and porches should be preserved. Historic examples should be repaired using durable materials similar to the original. 
    Principle 3: The design of new awnings, canopies, and porches should be appropriate to the architectural character and historic documentation of the building and district. Inappropriate "theme" examples added during recent years are best removed or incorporated into a more appropriate design. Simple shed porches with wood posts reflect the earliest porches. For most buildings, awnings are the appropriate design; however, awnings would not be compatible for some early twentieth century buildings, which utilized flat, suspended metal canopies to reinforce their horizontal lines. 

False thematic attachments, such as porches for an "Old West" look or balconies for a "French Quarter" appearance are inappropriate. Documented attachments may be restored. 
    Principle 4: Attachments should reinforce the scale and design of the host building. The design of new attachments should be evaluated in terms of placement, shape, size, and material. Awnings, canopies, and porches should be located to complement the building without obscuring storefront details and exterior ornament. Attachments should reflect the shape of and fit neatly within the frame of existing openings. Convex and concave awnings are generally inappropriate. Awnings and canopies should not span several buildings. Historic porches, especially those located on primary elevations, should not be enclosed. 

Awnings should be in scale and proportion to the building and should not cover stylistic details. 
Awnings should not be shaped differently than the window or doorway. For example, rounded or "bubble" awnings are not appropriate attachments for squared entrances. 
    Principle 5: Materials and illumination for attachments should respect the historic character of the district. Fabric and metal are the most appropriate choices for awnings, and metal canopies may be considered. Internally lit awnings are not appropriate in the historic district. 
    Signs are the most common and most frequently altered features in the downtown area. Signs identify business establishments, building names, products sold, and services provided. Signs contribute significantly to the visual character of the area, and inappropriate and competitive signage can have a tremendous negative impact. 
    Principle 6: Historic signs should be preserved and maintained. Cornerstone inscriptions, inscribed surface lettering, "ghost" advertisements, and mosaic tile lettering on entrance flooring are common historic signs. 

"Ghost" signs, fading painted signs, contain historic business names and product logos and should be retained. Murals are inappropriate and painted signs should be limited to historic precedents, such as the use of business names, product logos, and product advertisements. 
    Principle 7: Contemporary signs should be placed in traditional sign locations. Traditional sign placement includes: located within the defined area above the storefront, hanging perpendicular to the façade, painted display windows, and stitched or painted upon awnings. Signs should not cover storefront details and exterior ornament. Where possible, signs should be aligned with conforming signs on adjacent buildings. 

New signs should respect the proportions and design of the host building. Do not cover architectural features of the building with signs. 
    Principle 8: The installation of new signs should not alter or destroy historic materials or ornamentation. Signs should be mounted in such a manner to minimize the impact upon the building's exterior. 
    Principle 9: Contemporary signs should be of compatible design. Contemporary signs should be evaluated in terms of placement size, material, shape and lighting. Size and lighting should be limited to that which is necessary for identification purposes. Painted wood or metal signs are most appropriate; whereas, vinyl sign cabinets are not permitted. New signs should be simple or modern in design and avoid a false historic appearance. Illumination should be external and lighting fixtures should be unobtrusive. 
Sec. 1103. - Maintenance requirements. 
    In order to insure the protective maintenance of historic resources, the exterior features of such properties shall be maintained to meet the requirements of the City's minimum housing code and building code. 
Sec. 1104. - Demolition by neglect. 
    Any resource which is a landmark and all other resources within a preservation district shall be preserved by the owner or other persons having legal custody or control against decay and deterioration and shall be free from unreasonable structural defects. The owner or other persons having legal custody and control shall make such repairs if the resource is found to have one of the defects as discussed below. Repairs shall be made where deterioration to the extent that it creates or permits a hazardous or unsafe condition as determined by the Department of Community Development. Deterioration may be characterized by the following: 
1.  Those buildings which have parts attached that may fall and injure persons or other property. 
2.  Deteriorated or inadequate foundations 
3.  Defective or deteriorated floor supports or floor supports insufficient to carry imposed loads with safety. 
4.  Members of walls or other vertical supports that split, lean, list, or buckle due to defective material, workmanship, or deterioration. 
5.  Members of walls or other vertical supports that are insufficient to carry imposed loads with safety. 
6.  Member of ceilings, roofs, ceiling and roof supports, or other horizontal members which sag, split, or buckle due to defective material, workmanship or deterioration. 
7.  Member of ceilings, roofs, ceiling and roof supports, or other horizontal members which are insufficient to carry imposed loads with safety. 
8.  Fireplaces or chimneys which list, bulge, or settle due to defective material, workmanship or deterioration. 
9.  Any fault, defect, or condition in the building which renders the same structurally unsafe or not properly watertight. 
    If the Heritage Commission makes a preliminary determination that a resource is being demolished by neglect, it shall direct the Department of Community Development to officially notify the owner stating the reasons for this preliminary determination and shall give the owner thirty (30) days to commence work to correct the specific defects as determined by the Heritage Commission. 
    This notice to the property owner shall be certified by mail, restricted delivery, and mailed to the last known address of the record owner as listed on the tax roll. If this mailing procedure is not successful, notice shall be posted in a conspicuous, protected place on the resource in question. 
    If the owners fail to commence work within the time allotted as specified by the building permit, the Heritage Commission shall notify the owners in the same manner as mentioned above. This notification shall also require the owners to appear at a public hearing before the Heritage Commission and shall state the date, time, and location and be mailed at least thirty (30) days before the hearing. For the purpose of insuring a lawful notice, a hearing may be continued to a new date and time. The Heritage Commission shall receive evidence on the issue of whether the subject resource should be repaired and the owners may present evidence in rebuttal. If after such hearing, the Heritage Commission shall determine that the resource is being demolished by neglect, it may direct the Department of Community Development to bring misdemeanor charges against the owners if the necessary repairs are not completed within ninety (90) days of the determination of neglect. 
Sec. 1105. - Public safety. 
    None of the provisions of this Article shall be construed to prevent any action of construction, alteration, or demolition necessary to correct abate the unsafe or dangerous condition of any resource, or part thereof, where such condition has been declared unsafe or dangerous by the Department of Community Development or the Fire Department and where the proposed actions have been declared necessary by such authorities to correct the said condition; provided, however, that only such work as is necessary to correct the unsafe or dangerous condition may be performed pursuant to this section. In the event any resource designated as a landmark or located within a preservation district, shall be damaged by fire or other calamity to such an extent that it cannot be repaired and restored, it may be removed in conformity with normal permit procedures and applicable laws, provided that: 
1.  The Department of Community Development concurs with the property owner that the resource cannot be repaired and restored and so notifies the Heritage Commission in writing. 
2.  The Heritage Commission, if in doubt after receiving such notification from the Department of Community Development, shall be allowed time to seek outside professional expertise from the State Historic Preservation Office and/or an independent structural engineer before issuing a certificate of appropriateness for demolition. The Heritage Commission may indicate in writing by letter to the Department of Community Development that it will expire a time period of up to thirty (30) days for this purpose, and upon such notification, this section shall be suspended until the expiration of such a delay period.
