PREFACE 
    This Code constitutes a republication of the general and permanent ordinances of the City of Dayton, Ohio. 
    The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this Code, the reader can locate any section of the Code, as supplemented, and any subsequent ordinance included herein. 
    The titles of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order, and the various sections within each title have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Notes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state law have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this Code. 
Chapter and Section Numbering System 
    The chapter and section numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and local government codes. Each section number consists of two parts separated by a decimal. The figure before the decimal refers to the chapter number, and the figure after the decimal refers to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the second section of chapter 1 is numbered 1.02, and the first section of chapter 11 is 11.02. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter, and at the same time new sections can be inserted in their proper place. For example, if new material consisting of one section that would logically come between sections 11.01 and 11.02 is desired to be added, such new section would be numbered 11.015. 
Page Numbering System 
    The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the volume. The number to the right of the colon represents the number of the page in that portion. In the case of a title of the Code, the number to the left of the colon indicates the number of the title. In the case of an appendix to the Code, the letter immediately to the left of the colon indicates the letter of the appendix. The following are typical parts of codes of ordinances, which may or may not appear in this Code at this time, and their corresponding prefixes:

CODE APPENDIX ..... CDA:1 
PARALLEL REFERENCE TABLES ..... PRT:1

Indexes 
    The indexes have been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the indexes themselves which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which the user is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
    A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up-to-date. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited, and the affected page or pages will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
    Keeping this publication up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. As revised pages are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
Acknowledgments 
    This publication was under the direct supervision A. Lawton Langford, President, and Bonnie Mitchell, Editor, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida.

The Clerk of the Commission, upon issuing any such petition papers to an elector, shall enter in a record, to be kept in his office, the name of the elector to whom issued, the date of such issuance, and the number of papers issued, and shall certify on such papers the name of the elector to who issued and the date issued.

Sec. 15. - [Same-Signatures.] 
    Each signer of a recall petition shall sign his name in ink or indelible pencil and shall place thereon after his name, his place of residence by street and number. To each such petition paper there shall be attached an affidavit of the circulator thereof, stating the number of signers to such part of the petition and that each signature appended to the paper was made in his presence and is the genuine signature of the person whose name it purports to be. 
Sec. 16. - [Same-Filing.] 
    All papers comprising a recall petition shall be assembled and filed with the Clerk of the Commission as one instrument within 30 days after the filing with the Clerk of the Commission of the affidavit stating the name and office of the officer sought to be removed. 
Sec. 17. - [Recall Election-Time Frame.] 
    The Clerk of the Commission shall at once submit the recall petition to the Commissioners and shall notify the officer sought to be recalled of such action. If the official whose removal is sought does not resign within five days after such notice, the Commission shall thereupon order and fix a day for holding a recall election.

(A)  By a percentage of the tax value of the property assessed. 
(B)  In proportion to the benefits which may result from the improvement. 
(C)  By the foot frontage of the property bounding or abutting upon the improvement. 
Sec. 110. - Preliminary Resolution. 
    When it is deemed necessary to make a public improvement to be paid for in whole or in part by special assessment, the Commission shall declare the necessity therefor by resolution, and such resolution shall state the method of assessment, and the mode of payment and the number of annual installments, together with the total estimated cost of the improvement. Such resolution shall be certified to the Director of Finance, who shall thereupon proceed to make an assessment report, in accordance with the method of assessment provided in the resolution, which report shall be filed with the Commission, and shall show the lots and lands assessed, and the amount of the assessment as to each, together with the amount of benefit or damage to each lot or parcel of land to be assessed, with an estimate of the life of the improvement. The number of annual installments in which the assessment shall be paid, shall be fixed, but in no case shall they be greater in number than the estimated years of the life of the improvement. 
Sec. 111. - Plans of Proposed Improvements. 
    At the time of the passage of the resolution hereinbefore provided, there shall be on file in the office of the Director of Public Service plans, specifications, estimates, and profiles of the proposed improvements, giving all information necessary; and such plans, specifications, estimates and profiles shall be open to the inspection of the public. 
Sec. 112. - Notices Served. 
    Upon the filing of such report the Director of Finance shall cause written notice to be served upon the owner of each lot or parcel of land to be assessed, or otherwise affected, or upon the persons in whose names the same may be assessed for taxation upon the tax duplicate. Said notice shall be served in the manner provided for service of summons in civil actions; and, as to all nonresidents and persons who cannot be found, publication of such notice shall be made at least once in a daily newspaper of general circulation in the city.

Sec. 113. - Board of Revision of Assessments. 
    The City Manager, the City Attorney, and the Director of Public Service shall constitute the Board of Revision of Assessments. It shall organize and meet at times and places to be provided by its rules, and shall hear all claims and objections as to the character of all improvements to be paid for in part or in whole by special assessments, the necessity therefor, and the equity of the assessments as provided in the assessment report. A majority of those constituting the Board of Revision of Assessments shall have power to determine all complaints and objections submitted to it; and, as to each improvement, the Board shall, after such hearing, approve, amend, equalize, or adjust the assessment report in every detail, and shall report its findings as to the necessity for the improvements and any amendment it directs in the assessments, the estimate of benefit and allowance of damages to the Commission. 
Sec. 114. - Claims. 
    An owner of a lot or of land bounding and abutting upon a proposed improvement, claiming that he will sustain damage by reason of the improvement, shall present such claim to the Board of Revisions of Assessments within two weeks after the service of notice or the completion of the publication hereinbefore provided. Such claim shall be in writing and shall set forth the amount of damages claimed, with a general description of the property with respect to which it is claimed the damage will accrue, and shall be filed with the Board of Revision of Assessments.

This provision shall apply to all damage which will obviously result from the improvement, but shall not deprive the owner of his right to recover damages arising, without his fault, from acts of the city or its agents. If, subsequent to the filing of such claim, the owner sells the property, or any part thereof, the right of damages, if any, shall follow the ownership of the land without other transference of the claim. The Board of Revision of Assessments shall report to the Commission all such claims for damages filed with it. 
Sec. 115. - Final Assessment. 
    Whenever the Board of Revision of Assessments shall have made its final report to the Commission as to any improvement, the Commission, if it determine that the improvement shall proceed, shall pass an ordinance levying the assessment as reported by the Board of Revision of Assessments and directing that the improvement proceed. In such ordinance it shall be sufficient to describe the lots and lands abutting upon the improvement and to be assessed therefor, as all the lots and lands bounding and abutting upon such improvement between and including the termini of the improvement; and in describing lands which do not abut, it shall be sufficient to describe the lots by their appropriate lot numbers, and the lands by metes and bounds; and this rule of description shall apply in all proceedings in which lots and lands are to be charged with special assessments. 
Sec. 116. - [Special Assessments.] 
    Special assessments shall be payable by the owners of the property assessed at the time stipulated in the ordinance, and shall be a lien from the date of the assessment upon the respective lots and parcels of land assessed, enforcible [enforceable] in the manner provided by the laws of the State of Ohio. 
Sec. 117. - Damages Assessed. 
    At the time of the passage of the ordinance determining to proceed with the improvement as hereinbefore provided, the Commission shall determine whether the claims for damages so filed shall be allowed and paid or judicially inquired into either before commencing or after the completion of the proposed improvement. If it decide that the damages shall be assessed before commencing the improvement, the City Attorney shall then make a written application to the Court of Common Pleas, or a judge thereof in vacation, or to the Probate Court, for the summoning of a jury to determine such damages, and the judge shall direct that a jury be summoned as is provided for the appropriation of property, and fix the time and place for inquiry into, and assessment of such damages, which inquiry and assessment shall be confined to such claims.

Sec. 119. - [Same-Time Frame.] 
    A person who claims damages arising from any cause shall not commence a suit therefor against the city until he shall have filed a claim for such damages with the Director of Finance and 60 days shall have elapsed thereafter. This provision shall not apply to an application for an injunction or other proceeding to which it may be necessary for such applicant to resort in case of urgent necessity. 
Sec. 120. - Implementation of Improvements. 
    When the Commission shall have passed an ordinance directing that an improvement be made, to be paid for in whole or in part by special assessments, the Director of Public Service shall, as provided by ordinance, either directly by the employment of labor or by entering into a contract therefor, cause the improvement to be made. 
Sec. 121. - Valuation of Lands Unallotted or not on Duplicate. 
    When special assessments are levied by the percentage of tax value of the property assessed or by the foot frontage of the property bounding and abutting upon the improvement, and there are lands subject to such assessment which are not assessed for taxation, the Director of Finance shall fix, for the purpose of such assessment, the value of such lots as they stand and of such lands at such depths as the Director of Finance considers a fair average of the depth of lots in the neighborhood, so that it will be a fair average of the assessed value of other lots in the neighborhood. Where lands are not subdivided into lots, but are assessed for taxation, the Director of Finance shall fix the value and the depth in the same manner; but the above rule shall not apply in making a special assessment according to benefits. 
Sec. 122. - Interest on Assessment Bonds.

Assessments levied for the construction of main sewers shall not exceed the sum that, in the opinion of the Commission, would be required to construct an ordinary street sewer or drain of sufficient capacity to drain or sewer the lots or lands to be assessed for such improvement, not shall lots or lands be assessed that do not need local drainage, or which are provided therewith. 
Sec. 124. - City's Portion of Cost. 
    The city shall pay part of the cost and expense of improvements for which special assessments are levied as the Commission deems just, which part shall not be less than one-fiftieth of all such cost and expenses; and in addition thereto the city shall pay the cost of intersections. The Commission may provide for the payment of the city's portion of all such improvements by the issuance of bonds or notes therefor, and may levy taxes, in addition to all other taxes authorized by law, to pay such bonds or notes and the interest thereon. 
Sec. 125. - Replacing Existing Improvements. 
    The Commission may provide in whole or in part the cost of replacing any improvement existing in a street at the time of the adoption of this Charter, by levying special assessments as hereinbefore provided; but any assessment for such replacement in less than 15 years from the date of a prior assessment for the improvement to be replaced shall be limited to a sum not in excess of 50 percent of the cost of such replacement. 
Sec. 126. - Subsequent Improvements. 
    Every ordinance passed subsequent to the adoption of this Charter, providing for an improvement to be paid for in whole or in part by special assessments, shall contain an estimate by the Director of Public Service of the life of the proposed improvement. Any assessment thereafter made for replacing such improvement within such estimated period of life shall be limited to a sum not in excess of 50 percent of the cost of such replacement. Assessments for replacements at or after the expiration of such estimated period of life shall be subject to no limitation except as provided for assessments for original improvements. 
Sec. 127. - Supplementary Assessments and Rebates. 
    Upon the completion of any improvement the Director of Finance shall rebate to the then owner of the property which shall have been assessed to pay for such improvement, any surplus or excess remaining unexpended for the purpose which such assessment was made, and in the event of there being a deficit in the fund provided for the making of any such improvement, the Director of Finance shall report to the Commission a supplementary assessment within the limitations hereinbefore provided, which supplementary assessment shall be made by ordinance of the Commission and certified for collection as is provided in the case of original assessments. 
Sec. 128. - Sewer, Water, Gas and Other Connections. 
    The Director of Public Service shall have authority to compel the making of sewer, water, gas and other connections whenever, in view of contemplated street improvements or as a sanitary regulation, sewer, water, gas and other connections should in his judgment be constructed. He shall cause written notice of his determination thereof to be given to the owner of each lot or parcel of land to which such connections are to be made, which notice shall state the number and character of connections required. Such notice shall be served by a person, designated by the Director of Public Service, in the manner provided for the service of summons in civil actions. Nonresidents of the city, or persons who cannot be found, may be served by one publication of such notice in a daily newspaper of general circulation in the city. The notice shall state the time within which such connections shall be constructed; and if they be not constructed within the said time, the work may be done by the city, and the costs thereof, together with a penalty of five percent assessed against the lots and lands for which such connections are made. Said assessments shall be certified and collected as other assessments for street improvements. 
Sec. 129. - Sidewalks. 
    The Commission may by resolution declare that certain specified sidewalks, curbings, or gutters shall be constructed or repaired. Upon the passage of such a resolution the City Manager shall cause written notice of the passage thereof to be served upon the owner, or agent of the owner, or each parcel of land abutting upon such sidewalk, who may be a resident of the city, in the manner provided by law for the service of summons in civil actions. He shall return a copy of the notice with the time and manner of service endorsed thereon, signed by the person serving it, to the Director of Public Service, who shall file and preserve such return. For the purpose of such service, if the owner of any such property be not a resident of the city, any person charged with the collection of rent, or the payment of taxes on such property, or having control thereof in any way, shall be regarded as the agent of the owner, and service upon such person shall have the like force and effect as though personal service were made upon the owner thereof. If it appear in any such return, however, that the owner is a nonresident, or that neither such owner or agent could be found, one publication of a copy of the resolution in a daily newspaper of general circulation in the city shall be deemed sufficient notice to such owner. 
Sec. 130. - [Same-Repairs.] 
    If sidewalks, curbings or gutters be not constructed or repaired within 15 days from the service of the notice provided for in the preceding section, or the completion of the publication thereof, the Director of Public Service may proceed by direct employment of labor, or by contract, to carry out the said construction or repair at the expense of the owner, as in the case of other improvements, and all such expense shall be reported by the Director of Public Service to the Commission. The Commission shall thereupon, by ordinance, assess the cost and expense thereof upon the owner or owners of all the property bounding and abutting thereon, and such assessments shall be collected in the same manner as other assessments, with a penalty of five percent and interest for failure to pay at the time fixed by the assessment resolution. 
Sec. 131. - Assessment Bonds. 
    The Commission may at any time borrow money and authorize the issuance of notes or bonds therefor in anticipation of the collection of assessments, levied for the purpose of paying the cost of construction or repairing sidewalks, curbings and gutters which are to be or have been constructed by the Director of Public Service, upon the failure of the owners of the property to construct or repair the same, pursuant to notice as hereinbefore provided. 
Sec. 132. - Public Improvements by Contract or Direct Labor. 
    Public improvements of all kinds may be made by the appropriate department, either by direct employment of the necessary labor and the purchase of the necessary supplies and materials, with separate accounting as to each improvement so made, or by contract duly let after competitive bidding, either for a gross price, or upon a unit basis for the improvement, or by contract containing a guaranteed maximum and stipulating that the city shall pay within such maximum the cost of labor and materials, plus a fixed percentage of profit to the contractor. The Commission, by ordinance, shall determine by which of the foregoing methods improvements shall be made. Contracts may provide a bonus per day for completion of the contract prior to a specified date, and liquidated damages to the city to be exacted in like sum for every day of delay beyond a specified date.

    When it becomes necessary in the prosecution of any work, or improvement under contract, to make alterations or modifications in such contract, such alterations or modifications shall be made only upon resolution of the Commission.

Sec. 135. - Fee Shall Vest in City. 
    The map or plat so recorded shall thereupon be a sufficient conveyance to vest in the city the fee of the parcel of land designated or intended for streets, alleys, ways, commons, or other public uses, to be held in the corporate name in trust to and for the uses and purposes in the instrument set forth, expressed, designated, or intended. 
Sec. 136. - Supervisor of Plats.

He shall provide regulations governing the platting of all lands so as to require all streets and alleys to be of proper width, and to be coterminous with adjoining streets and alleys, and otherwise to conform to regulations prescribed by him. Whenever he shall deem it expedient to plat any portion of territory within the city limits, in which the necessary or convenient streets or alleys have not already been accepted by the city so as to become public streets, or alleys, or when any person plats any land within the corporate limits or within 3 miles thereof, the Supervisor of Plats shall, if such plats are in accordance with the rules as prescribed by him, endorse his written approval thereon. No plat subdividing lands within the corporate limits, or within three miles thereof, shall be entitled to record in the Recorder's office of the county without such written approval so endorsed thereon.

    As used in this division: 
    Domestic partnership refers to the non-marital committed relationship of two adults of the same or different sex, who share a common residence and affirm that they share responsibility for each other's common welfare, and have signed and filed a declaration of domestic partnership with the city. 
    Share a common residence means that both domestic partners share the same residence. It is not necessary that both domestic partners have title to the property where they reside or the legal right to possess the common residence. Two people may share a common residence even if one or both have additional residences. Domestic partners do not cease to share a common residence if one leaves the common residence but intends to return. Shared common residence does not have the same meaning as bona fide residence. 
    Domestic partners will be deemed to have a "committed" relationship and to "share responsibility for one another's common welfare" if they execute a declaration of domestic partnership affirming that such facts are true. 
(Ord. 31167-12, § 1, passed 5-2-12) 
Sec. 30.31. - Domestic partnership criteria. 
    To establish a domestic partnership, both individuals must file a declaration of domestic partnership with the city affirming that they meet all of the following qualifications: 
(A)  Both individuals share a common residence; 
(B)  Both individuals affirm that they have a committed relationship and share responsibility for each other's common welfare; 
(C)  Neither individual is married to any other individual; 
(D)  Neither individual is part of an existing domestic partnership with any third party; 
(E)  Each individual is 18 years of age or older; and 
(F)  The individuals are not related to one another by blood in a way that would prevent them from being married to one another in this state. 
(Ord. 31167-12, § 1, passed 5-2-12) 
Sec. 30.32. - Filing. 
(A)  Filing location. Two individuals seeking to become domestic partners must complete and file a declaration of domestic partnership with the City Commission. 
(B)  Filing prohibition. No individual who has previously filed a declaration of domestic partnership in this city may file a new declaration of domestic partnership until a notice of termination of domestic partnership has been filed with the City Commission. However, this prohibition shall not apply if the previous domestic partnership ended because one of the domestic partners is deceased. 
(Ord. 31167-12, § 1, passed 5-2-12) 
Sec. 30.33. - Registration. 
(A)  Registration forms. The Executive Assistant to the City Commission shall develop "declaration of domestic partnership" and "notice of termination of domestic partnership" forms, and shall not add to or alter the requirements listed in § 30.31 of this division.

(3)  Sign the form under penalty of perjury; and 
(4)  Have a notary public acknowledge his or her signature.

(F)  Termination registration. The city shall register the notice of termination of domestic partnership pursuant to the requirements set forth in § 30.34 of this division. 
(Ord. 31167-12, § 1, passed 5-2-12) 
Sec. 30.34. - Termination. 
(A)  Termination. A domestic partnership ends when: 
(1)  One of the domestic partners dies; or 
(2)  A notice of termination of domestic partnership has been filed by one or both domestic partners with the city. 
(B)  Notice of termination. If the facts affirmed in the declaration of domestic partnership cease to be true, one or both parties to a domestic partnership shall file a notice of termination of domestic partnership with the City Commission. Upon receipt, the city shall return a copy of the notice marked "filed" to each of the partners, if jointly filed; or two copies to the filing partner. Unless the partners jointly file the notice, the partner filing the notice shall, within five days, send a copy of the filed notice to the other partner's last known address. However, this requirement shall not apply if the termination is due to the death of one of the domestic partners. 
(C)  Effective termination date. Termination of a domestic partnership shall be effective upon filing of the notice of termination of domestic partnership with the city by one or both partners, or on the date of the death of one of the domestic partners. 
(D)  Notice to third parties. Following the termination of a domestic partnership the burden of notification rests with, each former domestic partner who has received or qualified for any benefit or right based upon the existence of a domestic partnership and whose receipt of that benefit or enjoyment of that right has not otherwise terminated, to give prompt notification to any third party who provides such benefit or right that the domestic partnership has terminated. The city shall not be liable for any injury to any third-party by virtue of lack of notice of termination to the domestic partnership, including any third-party which has provided any benefits regarding the domestic partnership.

Sec. 30.35. - Legal effect. 
(A)  Registering as domestic partners by two individuals who are also married to one other, in this or in another state, shall under no circumstances, be considered as evidence, knowledge, awareness, or an admission that the partners are not lawfully married and it shall not be given any other legal effect, in this or any other state, with regard to whether the persons are lawfully married. 
(B)  Nothing in this division shall be interpreted to alter or contravene county, state or federal law. 
(C)  Nothing in this division shall be construed as recognizing or treating a declaration of domestic partnership as a marriage or a legal status that intends to approximate the design, qualities, significance or effect of marriage. 
(Ord. 31167-12, § 1, passed 5-2-12) 
Sec. 30.36. - Severability.

Sec. 32.20. - Complaint procedure. 
(A)  Whenever it is charged in writing and under oath, by a person, referred to as the "complainant", that any person, referred to as the "respondent", has engaged or is engaging in any unlawful discriminatory practices as defined in §§ 32.01 through 32.07, or upon its own initiative, in matters relating to such discriminatory practices, the Human Relations Council or a committee thereof designated pursuant to § 32.16, may initiate a preliminary investigation. The charge shall be filed with the Human Relations Council within six months after the alleged unlawful discriminatory practices are committed. If it determines after such investigation, that it is not probable that unlawful discriminatory practices have been or are being engaged in, the Human Relations Council or its committee shall notify the complainant that it has so determined, and that it will not issue a complaint in the matter. 
(B)  If the Human Relations Council or its committee determines, after such investigation, that it is probable that unlawful discriminatory practices have been or are being engaged in, it shall endeavor to eliminate such practices by informal methods of conference, conciliation, and persuasion. Nothing said or done during such endeavors shall be disclosed by any member of the Human Relations Council, or its staff, or be used as evidence in any subsequent proceeding. If after such investigation and conference, the Human Relations Council or its committee is satisfied that any unlawful discriminatory practice of the respondent will be eliminated, it may treat the complaint as conciliated. An entry of such disposition shall be made on the records of the Human Relations Council. 
(C)  If the Human Relations Council or its committee fails to effect the elimination of such unlawful discriminatory practices and to obtain voluntary compliance, or, if the circumstances warrant, in advance of any such preliminary investigation or endeavors, and if the Human Relations Council or its committee finds that the complainant acted with intention of fulfilling any contracts or agreements he was seeking, the Human Relations Council shall issue and cause to be served upon any person or respondent a complaint stating the charges in that respect and containing a notice of hearing before a hearing examiner appointed by the Human Relations Council, pursuant to § 32.16, at a place therein fixed to be held not less than ten days after the service of such complaint. The place of hearing shall be in the municipal building, or at such other place located within the city may be designated by the Human Relations Council. The City Attorney shall represent the Human Relations Council at such hearing, and if the complainant is not represented by counsel, shall present the evidence in support of the complaint. Any complaint issued pursuant to the provisions of this section must be so issued within one year after the charge of unlawful discriminatory practices is filed pursuant to § 32.20(A). 
(D)  Any such complaint may be amended by the Human Relations Council or its hearing examiner conducting the hearing, at any time prior to or during the hearing based thereon. The respondent shall have the right to file an answer or to amend an answer to the original or amended complaint, and to appear at such hearing in person, or by attorney, or otherwise to examine and cross-examine witnesses. 
(E)  The complainant shall be a party to the proceeding, and any person who is an indispensable party to a complete determination or settlement of the question involved in a proceeding shall be joined. Any person who has or claims an interest in the subject of the hearing and in obtaining or presenting relief against the acts or practices complained of, may be, in the discretion of the hearing examiner, permitted to appear for the presentation of oral or written arguments. 
(F)  In any proceeding, the Human Relations Council or its hearing examiner shall not be bound by the rules of evidence prevailing in the courts of law or equity, but shall, in ascertaining the practices followed by the respondent, take into account all reliable, probative, and substantial evidence, statistical, or otherwise, produced at the hearing, which may tend to prove the existence of a predetermined pattern of discriminatory practice; provided, that nothing contained in this section shall be construed to authorize or require any person to observe the proportion which persons of any race, color, religion, national origin, sex, ancestry, or place of birth bear to the total population or in accordance with any criterion other than the individual qualifications of the applicant. 
(G)  The testimony taken at the hearing shall be under oath and shall be reduced to writing, and filed with the Human Relations Council. Thereafter, in its discretion, the Human Relations Council, upon notice to the complainant and to the respondent with an opportunity to be present, may take further testimony or hear argument. 
(H)  No person shall be compelled to be a witness against himself in any hearing before the Human Relations Council or the hearing examiner. 
(I)  If upon all the reliable, probative, and substantial evidence the Human Relations Council determines that the respondent has engaged in, or is engaging in, any unlawful discriminatory practice, whether against the complainant or others, the Human Relations Council shall state its finding of fact and conclusions of law, and shall issue and cause to be served on such respondent an order requiring him to cease and desist from such unlawful discriminatory practice and to take such further affirmative or other action as will effectuate the purposes of this chapter including but not limited to hiring, reinstatement, or upgrading of employees with, or without back pay, admission or restoration to union membership, including a requirement for reports of the manner of compliance. If the Human Relations Council directs payment of back pay, it shall make allowance for interim earnings. Upon the submission of such reports of compliance, the Human Relations Council may issue a declaratory order stating that the respondent has ceased to engage in unlawful discriminatory practices. 
(J)  If the Human Relations Council finds that no probable cause exists for crediting the charges, or, if upon all the evidence, the Human Relations Council finds that a respondent has not engaged in any unlawful discriminatory practice against the complainant or others, it shall state its findings of fact, and shall issue and cause to be served on the complainant an order dismissing said complaint as to such respondent. 
(K)  Any party to the proceeding, claiming to be aggrieved by final order of the Human Relations Council, including a determination by it that a prima facie case was not established by the complainant, may obtain judicial review thereof by a resort to any court of competent jurisdiction in accordance with the provisions of R.C. Chapter 2506. 
(Ord. 22664, passed 9-20-67; Am. Ord. 23735, passed 6-30-70; Am. Ord. 30945-09, passed 12-16-09) 
Sec. 32.21. - Housing complaint procedures. 
(A)  An aggrieved person may file a written complaint with the Human Relations Council alleging a discriminatory housing practice in violation of this chapter. The written complaint with the Human Relations Council must be filed not later than one year after the alleged discriminatory practice has occurred or terminated. The Human Relations Council, on its own initiative, may also file such a complaint. The Human Relations Council, or a committee thereof designated pursuant to § 32.16, may investigate any housing practice to determine whether a complaint should be brought under this section. 
(B)  Upon the filing of such a complaint: 
(1)  The Human Relations Council shall serve notice upon the complainant within ten days after the filing of the complaint; acknowledging the filing and advising the complainant of the time limits and choice of forums provided under this section; and 
(2)  The Human Relations Council shall promptly serve notice upon the respondent or person charged with the commission of a discriminatory housing practice advising of his or her procedural rights and obligations under this section, together with a copy of the complaint. Each respondent may file an answer to such complaint no later than ten days after receipt of notice from the Human Relations Council. 
(C)  After the filing of such a complaint: 
(1)  The Human Relations Council shall commence proceedings with respect to the complaint before the end of the 30th day after the receipt of the complaint. 
(2)  The Human Relations Council shall investigate the allegations of the complaint and complete the investigation in no more than 100 days after receipt of the complaint, unless it is impracticable. If the Human Relations Council is unable to complete the investigation within 100 days after receipt of the complaint, it shall notify the complainant and respondent in writing of the reasons for not doing so. 
(a)  The Human Relations Council shall, within such 100-day period, determine based on the facts whether reasonable cause exists to believe that a discriminatory housing practice has occurred, or is about to occur, unless it is impracticable to do so, or unless the Human Relations Council has approved a conciliation agreement with respect to the complainant. 
(3)  The Human Relations Council shall make final administrative disposition of a complaint within one year of the date of receipt of the complaint, unless it is impracticable to do so. If the Human Relations Council is unable to make final administrative disposition of a complaint within one year of the date of receipt of the complaint, it shall notify the complainant and respondent in writing of the reasons for not doing so. If, after investigation, the Human Relations Council determines that no unlawful discriminatory practice has been or is being or is about to be engaged in by respondent, the Human Relations Council or its staff shall notify the complainant and respondent that it has so determined, and that it will not pursue the complaint further, and shall make public disclosure of each such dismissal. 
(D)  Investigation and conciliation. During the period beginning with the filing of such a complaint and ending with the filing of a charge or a dismissal by the Human Relations Council, Human Relations Council shall, to the extent feasible, engage in conciliation with respect to such complaint. 
(1)  Any conciliation agreement arising out of such conciliation shall be an agreement between the respondent and the complainant, and shall be subject to the approval of the Human Relations Council. 
(2)  A conciliation agreement may provide for binding arbitration of the dispute arising from the complaint. Such arbitration may award appropriate relief, including monetary relief. 
(3)  Each conciliation agreement shall be made public unless the complainant and the respondent otherwise agree and the Human Relations Council determines that disclosure is not required to further the purposes of this chapter. 
(4)  Whenever the Human Relations Council has reasonable cause to believe that a respondent has breached a conciliation agreement, the Human Relations Council shall refer the matter to the City Attorney for further action under an administrative hearing process or in a judicial proceeding, as provided in this chapter. 
(5)  At the conclusion of its investigation, the Human Relations Council or its staff shall prepare a final investigative report, to be kept on the records of the Human Relations Council and to be made available upon request to the complainant and respondent, which shall contain: 
1.  The names and dates of contacts with witnesses; 
2.  A summary and the dates of correspondence and other contacts with the aggrieved person and the respondent; 
3.  A summary description of other pertinent records; 
4.  A summary of witness statements; and 
5.  Answers to interrogatories. 
(E)  The Human Relations Council shall have comprehensive authority, including the power to: 
(1)  Issue subpoenas; 
(2)  Investigate the allegations of complaints; 
(3)  Conciliate complaint matters; 
(4)  Seek prompt judicial action, as provided in this chapter and under applicable state and federal law, for appropriate temporary or preliminary relief pending final disposition of a complaint if the Human Relations Council concludes that such action is necessary to carry out the purposes of this chapter; 
(5)  Grant actual damages, or arrange to have adjudicated in court at the expense of the Human Relations Council the award of actual damages to an aggrieved person, as provided in this chapter and under applicable state and federal law; 
(6)  Grant injunctive or other equitable relief, or arrange to seek such relief in court, as provided in this chapter and under applicable state and federal law; 
(7)  Assess a civil penalty against a respondent, or arrange to have adjudicated in court at the expense of the Human Relations Council the award of punitive damages against a respondent, as provided in this chapter and under applicable state and federal law. 
(F)  Administrative enforcement. If the Human Relations Council determines that reasonable cause exists to believe that a discriminatory housing practice has occurred or is about to occur, or that immediate administrative proceedings or adjudication are warranted by the circumstances, the Human Relations Council shall issue and cause to be served upon any person or respondent a complaint stating the charges in that respect and containing a notice of hearing before a hearing examiner appointed by the Human Relations Council pursuant to § 32.16 at a place therein fixed to be held not less than ten days after the service of such notice. The place of hearing shall be in the municipal building, or any other place located within the city may be designated by the Human Relations Council. 
(1)  Any such complaint may be amended by the Human Relations Council or its hearing examiner conducting the hearing, at any time prior to or during the hearing based thereon. The respondent shall have the right to file an answer or to amend an answer to the original or amended complaint, and to appear at such hearing in person, or by attorney, or otherwise to cross-examine witnesses. 
(2)  The complainant shall be a party to the proceeding, and any person who is an indispensable party to a complete determination or settlement of the question involved in a proceeding shall be joined. 
(3)  Any person who has or claims an interest in the subject of the hearing and in obtaining or presenting relief against the acts or practices complained of, may be, in the discretion of the hearing examiner, permitted to appear for the presentation of oral or written arguments. 
(4)  In any administrative hearing, the Human Relations Council or its hearing examiner shall ascertain the practices followed by the respondent, take into account all reliable, probative, and substantial evidence, statistical, or otherwise, produced at the hearing, which may tend to provide the existence of a predetermined pattern of discriminatory practice. The testimony taken at the hearing shall be under oath and shall be reduced to writing, and filed with the Human Relations Council. 
(5)  Thereafter, in its discretion, the Human Relations Council, upon notice to the complainant and to the respondent with an opportunity to be present, may take further testimony or hear argument. No person shall be compelled to be a witness against himself in any hearing before the Human Relations Council or the hearing examiner. If upon all the reliable, probative, and substantial evidence the Human Relations Council determines that the respondent has engaged in, or is engaging in, any unlawful discriminatory practice, whether against the complainant or others, the Human Relations Council shall state its findings of fact and conclusions of law, and shall issue a cease and desist order from such unlawful discriminatory practice, and to take such further action as will effectuate the purposes of this chapter. 
(6)  At the conclusion of the administrative hearing, should the Human Relations Council find that no probable cause exists for crediting the charges, or, if upon all the evidence, the Human Relations Council finds that a respondent has not engaged in any unlawful discriminatory practice against the complainant or others, it shall state its finding of fact, and shall issue and cause to be served on the complainant an order dismissing said complainant as to such respondent. 
(G)  Judicial review of the Human Relations Council. Any party to the proceeding, claiming to be aggrieved by a final order of the Human Relations Council including a determination by it that a prima facie case was not established by the complainant, may obtain a de novo review of the Council's findings by a resort to a court which is authorized to award the type of relief provided in this division. 
(H)  Civil enforcement. Any aggrieved person may commence a civil action in the Common Pleas Court, under this chapter or applicable state or federal law, whether or not an administrative complaint has been filed, and without regard to the status of any such complaint. However, if the Human Relations Council or a federal or state agency has obtained a conciliation agreement with the consent of that aggrieved person with respect to the alleged discriminatory housing practice which forms the basis for such complaint, that aggrieved person may not commence a civil action under this division with respect to any alleged discriminatory housing practice which forms the basis of a charge issued by the Human Relations Council if a hearing examiner has commenced a hearing on the record under this chapter with respect to such charge. 
(1)  Upon application by a person alleging a discriminatory housing practice or a person against whom such a practice is alleged, the court in which the action has been commenced may at its discretion: 
(a)  Appoint an attorney for such person; or 
(b)  Authorize the commencement or continuation of a civil action under this chapter, or applicable state or federal law at the trial judge's discretion, without the payment of fees, costs, or security, if in the opinion of the court such person is financially unable to bear the costs of such action. 
(2)  In a civil action under this section, if the court finds that a discriminatory housing practice has occurred or is about to occur, the court may award to the plaintiff such actual, compensatory, and/or punitive damages, that may include emotional distress and such relief as the court deems appropriate, any permanent or temporary injunction, temporary restraining order, or other order (including an order enjoining the defendant from engaging in such practice or ordering such action as may be appropriate). 
(3)  Such order may vindicate the public interest, by assessing a civil penalty against the respondent: 
(a)  In an amount not exceeding $10,000.00 if the respondent has not been adjudged to have committed any discriminatory housing practice; 
(b)  In an amount not exceeding $25,000.00 if the respondent has been adjudged to have committed one other discriminatory housing practice during the five-year period ending on the date of the filing of this charge; and 
(c)  In an amount not exceeding $50,000.00 if the respondent has been adjudged to have committed two or more discriminatory practices during the seven-year period ending of the date of filing of this charge; except that if the acts constituting the discriminatory housing practice that are the object of the charge are committed by the same natural person who has been previously adjudged to have committed acts constituting a discriminatory housing practice then the civil penalties set forth in subsections (H)(2) and (3) may be imposed without regard to the period of time within which any subsequent discriminatory housing practice has occurred. 
(4)  In a civil action under this section, the court, at its discretion, may allow the prevailing party, other than the United States, a reasonable attorney fee and costs. Relief granted under this section shall not affect any contract, sale, encumbrance, or lease consummated before the granting of such relief and involving a bona fide purchaser, encumbrancer, or tenant, without actual notice of the filing of a complaint with the Human Relations Council or civil action under this title. 
(5)  (a)  An aggrieved person may commence a civil action, in a court authorized to award compensatory and punitive damages as well as attorney's fees, not later than two years after the occurrence or the termination of an alleged discriminatory housing practice, or the breach of a conciliation agreement entered into under this title, whichever occurs last, to obtain appropriate relief with respect to such discriminatory housing practice or breach. 
(b)  The computation of such a two-year period shall not include any time during which an administrative proceeding under this title was pending with respect to a complaint or charge. Should the court find that a discriminatory housing practice has occurred or is about to occur, the court may award to the complainant or plaintiff, actual or punitive damages and any permanent or temporary injunctive relief or other order as the court deems appropriate. This division does not apply to actions arising from a breach of a conciliation agreement. 
(6)  Upon timely application, the City Attorney may intervene in any civil action in which housing discrimination under this chapter may be at issue, and the Human Relations Council certifies that the case is of general public importance. Upon such intervention the City Attorney may obtain such relief as would be available in a civil action. 
(I)  Enforcement by Human Relations Council. 
(1)  Election of judicial determination. When a charge is filed under this chapter, a complainant, a respondent, or an aggrieved person on whose behalf the complaint was filed, may elect to have the claims asserted in that charge decided in a civil action under subsection (I)(1)(a). The election must be made not later than 20 days after the receipt by the electing person of service, or, in the case of the Human Relations Council, not later than 20 days after such service. The person making such election shall give notice of doing so to the Human Relations Council and to all other complainants and respondents to whom the charge relates. 
(a)  If an election is made under this section, the Human Relations Council shall authorize, and not later than 30 days after the election is made, the City Attorney or special counsel retained by the Human Relations Council shall commence and maintain a civil action on behalf of the aggrieved person in a court authorized to award compensatory and punitive damages as well as injunctive relief under this division. The Human Relations Council shall be responsible for all complainant's expenses that are incurred as a result of this election. Any aggrieved person with respect to the issues to be determined in a civil action under this division may intervene as of right in that civil action. In a civil action under this division, if the court finds that a discriminatory housing practice has occurred or is about to occur, the court may grant as relief any relief which a court could grant with respect to such discriminatory housing practice in a civil action. Any relief so granted that would accrue to an aggrieved person in a civil action commenced by that aggrieved shall also accrue to that aggrieved person in a civil action under this division. 
(2)  In any administrative proceeding brought under this section, or any court proceeding arising therefrom, or any civil action under this chapter, the administrative law judge or the court, as the case may be, at its discretion, may allow the prevailing party or agency, a reasonable attorney's fee and costs; provided, however, that a prevailing respondent may be awarded costs and reasonable attorney's fees only upon showing that the case is frivolous, unreasonable, or without foundation. 
(J)  Any party aggrieved by a civil action under this chapter granting or denying in whole or in part the relief sought may obtain a review of such order by the appropriate appellate tribunal.

(A)  The contractor or vendor shall not discriminate against any employee or applicant for employment because of race, color, religion, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, ancestry, national origin, place of birth, age, marital status, or handicap. The contractor or vendor shall take affirmative action in accordance with the terms outlined in its proposal and the provisions of this contract to insure that applicants are employed, and that employees are treated during employment, without regard to their race, color, religion, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, ancestry, national origin, place of birth, age, marital status, or handicap. Such action shall include, but not be limited to, the following: employment, upgrading, demotion or transfer; recruitment or recruitment advertising; layoff or termination; rates of pay or other forms of compensation; and selection for training, including apprenticeship. The contractor or vendor agrees to post in conspicuous places, available to employees and applicants, notices to be provided by the city setting forth the provisions of the nondiscrimination clauses. 
(B)  The contractor or vendor shall in all solicitations or advertisements for employees placed by or on behalf of the contractor or vendor, state that all qualified applicants will receive consideration for employment without regard to race, color, religion, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, ancestry, national origin, place of birth, age, marital status, or handicap. 
(C)  The contractor or vendor shall send to each labor union or representative of workers with which he has a collective bargaining agreement or other contract or understanding, a notice to be provided by the city advising the labor union or workers' representative of the contractor's or vendor's commitments, and shall post copies of the notice in conspicuous places available to employees and applicants for employment. 
(D)  The contractor or vendor shall comply with all rules, regulations, and relevant orders promulgated by the Human Relations Council pursuant to its duties created by ordinance. 
(E)  The contractor or vendor shall file, and shall cause each of his subcontractors and material suppliers to file, compliance reports with the Human Relations Council as may be directed. Compliance reports shall be filed within such times and shall contain such information as to the practices, policies, programs, and employment policies, programs and employment statistics of the contractor, vendor, material supplier, or subcontractor and shall be in such form as the Human Relations Council may prescribe. 
(F)  The contractor or vendor shall furnish all information and reports required by this contract and by the rules, regulations, and orders of the Human Relations Council pursuant hereto, and shall permit reasonable access to his books, records, and accounts by the Human Relations Council or its representative, as necessary for purposes of investigation to ascertain compliance with this contract and rules, regulations and orders. 
(G)  In the event of the contractor's or vendor's failure to comply with the equal employment opportunity and affirmative action provisions of this contract, including the affirmative action undertaking outlined in its proposal, or with any of the rules, regulations, or orders herein referred to, it is agreed that the city, at its option, may do any or all of the following: 
(1)  Cancel, terminate, or suspend this contract, in whole or in part, except if this contract constitutes a lease of real estate for a period exceeding three years. Nothing herein contained shall prevent the city from enforcing the terms and conditions of any such lease by injunction or other appropriate relief.

(3)  Recover from the contractor or vendor by set-off against the unpaid portion of the contract price, or otherwise pursuant to this contract, the sum of $50.00 per day, as liquidated damages and not as a penalty, for each day that the contractor or vendor shall fail to comply with these provisions of the contract, as determined by the Human Relations Council in accordance with its rules and regulations, the said sum being fixed and agreed upon by and between the contractor and the city because of the impracticability and extreme difficulty of fixing and ascertaining the actual damages which the city would sustain in the event of such a breach of contract, and that amount is agreed to be the amount of damages which the city would sustain. 
(4)  Impose such other sanctions as may be imposed by the Human Relations Council pursuant to ordinances passed by the Commission, or seek such other remedies as may be provided by law. 
(H)  The contractor or vendor shall include the provisions of this contract in every subcontract, so that such provisions shall be binding upon each subcontractor. The contractor or vendor shall take such action with respect to any subcontractors as the Human Relations Council may direct as a means of enforcing such provisions, including sanctions for noncompliance. However, in the event the contractor or vendor becomes involved in, or is threatened with litigation with a subcontractor as a result of such direction by the Human Relations Council, the contractor or vendor may request the city to enter into such litigation to protect the interests of the city.

Acceptance and implementation of such an affirmative action program shall constitute compliance with the contract and with such ordinance. However, the Council may, as circumstances warrant, revise, and modify the affirmative action program from time to time in order to accomplish the purpose of insuring that fair employment practices are followed. 
(C)  The Council shall receive and investigate or cause to be investigated complaints by employees or prospective employees of any city contractor, vendor, material supplier, or subcontractor which allege actions contrary to the contractual undertakings of the contractor, vendor, material supplier, or subcontractor.

The Council shall, in appropriate cases, notify the United States Department of Justice, Ohio Fair Employment Practices Commission or other appropriate agencies, whenever it has reason to believe that the practices of any labor organization or agency violate Title VI or Title VIII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the Ohio Fair Employment Practices Act, R.C.

(1)  Publish, or cause to be published, the names of contractors or unions which it has concluded have failed to comply with the provisions of the contract. 
(2)  Recommend to the Department of Law that, in cases in which there is substantial or material violation or the threat of substantial or material violation of the contractual provisions, appropriate proceedings be brought to enforce those provisions, including the enjoining, within the limitations of applicable law, of organizations, individuals, or groups who prevent, directly or indirectly, compliance with those provisions. 
(3)  Recommend to the Department of Law that criminal proceedings be brought for the furnishing of false information under oath to any city department or the Council, as the case may be. 
(4)  Recommend that the appropriate department cancel, terminate, suspend, or cause to be cancelled, terminated, or suspended any contract, or any portion or portions thereof, for failure of the contractor, vendor, material supplier, or subcontractor to comply with the nondiscrimination provisions of the contract. The Council may recommend that a contract be cancelled, terminated, or suspended absolutely or that a continuance of a contract be conditioned upon implementation of a program for future compliance approved by the Contracting Department and the Council. 
(5)  Recommend that any Contracting Department refrain from entering into further contracts, or extensions or other modifications of existing contracts, with any noncomplying contractor, until the contractor has satisfied the Council that the contractor has established and will carry out personnel and employment policies in compliance with the provisions of its contract. 
(G)  Whenever it becomes necessary to cancel or terminate a contract, or whenever a contractor, vendor, material supplier, or subcontractor has been disqualified from further city contracts, because of noncompliance with the contract provisions with regard to affirmative action to provide equal employment opportunity, the Council or the Contracting Department shall promptly notify the Director of Finance. Any such disqualification may be rescinded.

Sec. 35.30. - Adoption of the findings and conclusions regarding minority and women-owned business enterprises. 
    The Commission adopts the findings and conclusions of the MGT of America, Inc. Final Report dated August 8, 2008 and entitled "A Second-Generation Disparity Study for the City of Dayton, Ohio" and by this reference incorporates herein the Second-Generation Disparity Study. 
(Ord. 31023-10, passed 9-29-10) 
Sec. 35.31. - Findings. 
    On the basis of the foregoing and upon full consideration of all relevant facts, the Commission finds that: 
(A)  Minorities and women continue to show disparities in entry into self employment, after controlling for age, wealth, and other variables. 
(B)  Minorities and women that were self employed earned significantly less than non-minority males, after controlling for other factors. 
(C)  Past discrimination in the private sector and in the city's overall contracting process has had the effect of significant underutilization of minority and women-owned business enterprises in contracts awarded by the city and has contributed to the underdevelopment of such businesses. 
(D)  The present effects of such past discrimination continue to impede the development of businesses owned by minorities and women. 
(E)  Certain issues, such as difficulties in the financing and bonding markets, and problems obtaining credit and insurance, impede the development of minority and women-owned businesses as well as certain nonminority small business enterprises. 
(F)  The city has long recognized he importance of small business enterprises to its economic vitality and has adopted several measures and programs in support thereof including, but not limited to, City Wide Development Corporation, the Office of Small Business Ombudsmen, the Small Business Advisory Council, the Minority Contractors Business Assistance Program, the Small business Retention Program and the Small Business Assistance Program. 
(G)  It is in the best interest of the city to continue to promote the equitable utilization of small business enterprises, minority business enterprises and women's businesses enterprises in city contracting in order to eradicate the lingering effects of past discrimination and improve the city's economic viability. 
(H)  The requirements of this division are necessary to overcome the present effects of past discrimination and are designed to achieve the goal of equitable utilization of small businesses and minority and women-owned businesses in contracting with the city. 
(Ord. 31023-10, passed 9-29-10) 
Sec. 35.32. - Declaration of policy. 
    It is the policy of the city to promote full and equal business opportunity to all persons doing business with the city. The city must ensure that businesses seeking to participate in contracting and procurement activities with the city are not prevented from doing so on the basis of the race or gender of their owners. The city is committed to ensuring that it is not engaged in passive participation in any form of discrimination. This policy will apply to all expenditures of city public funds, irrespective of source, with the exception of noted exclusions. This policy will also apply to all private sector economic development projects, where feasible, in which city public funds and/or tax incentives are utilized, in part or in total. In addition, where feasible, this policy will apply to contracts or agreements between the city and any other political subdivisions, governmental, or quasi-governmental agencies under which entities receive money from or through the city for the purposes of contracting with businesses to perform projects in the city. 
    This policy is enacted pursuant to the home rule powers of the city and supersedes any inconsistent provision of any law or regulation of the State of Ohio. This division shall not apply to any contract to the extent that it is inconsistent with procedures or standards required by any law or regulation of the United States or the State of Ohio, to the extent such inconsistency is not permitted under the home rule powers of the city. In connection with any contract funded in whole or part from state or federal sources which require the imposition of 49 C.F.R. Parts 23 and/or 26, and of goals or by the appropriate Local Participation Agreement (LPA) related to the participation of Disadvantaged Business Enterprises, this division shall not apply to the extent inconsistent with such state or federal requirements. It is not the intent of this program to include federally grant funded contracts subject to a federally promulgated affirmative action program.

Sec. 36.102. - Imposition of tax. 
(A)  Subject to Section 36.116, an annual tax authorized by this chapter shall be imposed at the rate specified in Section 36.103 upon the following: 
(1)  On all municipal taxable income earned or received by a resident, as set forth in Section 718.01(A)(1)(b)(i) of the Ohio Revised Code, from wherever derived. 
(2)  On all municipal taxable income earned or received by a nonresident, as set forth in Section 718.01(A)(1)(c) of the Ohio Revised Code, and derived from a source or sources within the city, subject in the case of qualifying wages to the limitations set forth in Ohio Revised Code Sections 718.01(C)(16) and (17) and 718.011. For purposes of this Section 36.102(A)(2), lottery, sweepstakes, gambling and sports winnings, winnings from games of chance, and prizes and awards are treated as derived from a source within the city if the nonresident was within the city when he or she purchased the ticket or otherwise entered into the game or event that entitled the nonresident to such winnings. Where a nonresident is employed at a place of business in the city, the qualifying wages of such nonresident for the performance of employee services will be treated as earned outside the city only for those services which of necessity, as distinguished from convenience, obligate such nonresident to duties outside the city in the service of the nonresident's employer. 
(3)  On the portion of the net profit of a person other than an individual derived from business conducted in the city, as set forth in Section 718.01(A)(1)(a) and (B)(3) of the Ohio Revised Code, whether or not such taxpayer has an office or place of business in the city. The tax imposed by this Section 36.102(A)(3) on the net profit of an electric company, combined company or telephone company shall be subject to, and shall accord with, Ohio Revised Code Chapter 5745. 
(B)  Businesses Both In and Outside the City. The portion of the net profit attributable to the city of a taxpayer conducting a business both within and without the boundaries of the city shall be determined as provided in Ohio Revised Code Section 718.02 and in accordance with rules and regulations adopted by the Tax Administrator pursuant to this chapter. 
(C)  Net Operating Loss (NOL) and Business Expenses. 
(1)  A deduction for a net operating loss shall be allowed as provided in Section 718.01(A) and (B) in determining a taxpayer's municipal taxable income. 
(2)  No taxpayer may combine a net operating loss or passive activity loss with qualifying wages to reduce qualifying wages. 
(3)  As provided in Section 718.01(A)(2), the only expenses that can be deducted against qualifying wages are those employee business expenses deductible for federal income tax purposes in determining adjusted gross income, unless otherwise allowed on a uniform and consistent basis by the Tax Administrator. The total of such expenses cannot exceed the employee's related W-2 wage income from the same employer. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 36.102(D)(3), if a taxpayer's taxable income for a taxable year includes income against which the taxpayer has taken a deduction for federal income tax purposes and reported on Form 2106 as attached to the taxpayer's federal income tax return filed for that taxable year, the taxpayer shall determine taxable income to the city by deducting the same amount deducted for federal income tax purposes and reported on the taxpayer's Form 2106 for that taxable year. This deduction shall be allowed for city income tax purposes only if the taxpayer attaches to the taxpayer's city income tax return a copy of Form 2106 and Schedule A as filed with the taxpayer's federal income tax return for that taxable year. 
(D)  Consolidated Returns. 
(1)  As provided in Section 718.06 of the Ohio Revised Code, a taxpayer that is a member of an affiliated group of corporations may elect, or may be required, to file a consolidated city income tax return for a taxable year if at least one member of the affiliated group of corporations is subject to city income tax in that taxable year and if the affiliated group of corporations filed a consolidated federal income tax return with respect to that taxable year. The election to file a consolidated city income tax return shall be binding for the period set forth in Section 718.06 of the Ohio Revised Code, and the municipal taxable income reported on the consolidated city income tax return and apportioned to the city shall be determined in compliance with Ohio Revised Code Section 718.06. 
(2)  In the case of a corporation that carried on transactions with its stockholders or with other corporations related by stock ownership, interlocking directorates or some other method, or in case any person operates a division, branch, factory, office, laboratory or activity within the city constituting only a portion of its total business, the Tax Administrator shall require such additional information as the Tax Administrator deems necessary to ascertain whether net profit is properly allocated to the city. If the Tax Administrator finds the net profit is not properly allocated to the city by reason of transactions with stockholders or with other corporations related by stock ownership, interlocking directorates or transactions with a division, branch, factory, office, laboratory or activity, or by some other method, the Tax Administrator shall make such adjustments to, and allocation of, net profit to fairly and reasonably reflect the proper allocation of net profit to the city.

Sec. 36.102.7. - Imposition of tax; rate. 
(A)  Pursuant to § 189 of the Charter of the City of Dayton, a tax is hereby imposed and levied for the period commencing January 1, 2017, and ending December 31, 2024. 
(B)  The tax is an annual tax levied on the income of every person residing in or earning or receiving income in the city and shall be measured by municipal taxable income as that term is defined in Section 718.01(A) of the Ohio Revised Code. 
(C)  The tax is levied in accordance with the limitations specified in Chapter 718 of the Ohio Revised Code, and this Ordinance incorporates the provisions of Chapter 718 of the Ohio Revised Code. 
(D)  The rate of the tax shall be one-quarter of one percent. 
(E)  A credit pursuant to Section 718.04(D) of the Ohio Revised Code will be allowed against the tax. In the case of a resident, the resident may claim a credit against the tax in an amount equal to the lesser of: (i) the amount of such tax paid to another taxing municipality or joint economic development district or (ii) the city income tax on such income taxable under this section. In no case shall the credit exceed the tax assessed under this section on the resident's taxable income that is also subject to tax in another taxing municipality or joint economic development district. In the case of a resident owner of a pass-through entity that does not conduct business in the city, the resident owner may claim a credit equal to the lesser of: (i) the resident owner's proportionate share of the amount, if any, of income tax paid by the pass-through entity to another taxing municipality in the state or (ii) the resident owner's proportionate share of the amount of city income tax that would be imposed on the pass-through entity if the pass-through entity conducted business in the city. In no case shall the credit exceed the city income tax assessed under this section on the taxable income that is also subject to tax in another taxing municipality. 
(F)  Generally, the purpose of the tax is to provide for essential municipal services and necessary capital improvements as set forth in Section 36.100 of the Revised Code of General Ordinances. To the extent available, however, revenue from the tax will be used to fund pre-kindergarten education for residents of the city. 
(Am. Ord. 31500-16, passed 7-13-16) 
Sec. 36.103. - Effective period and rate. 
    The city income tax shall be levied at the annual rate of 2.25 percent on taxable income as provided in Section 36.102. 
(Ord. 27107, passed 11-14-84; Am. Ord. 30317-03, passed 12-23-03; Am. Ord. 30414-04, passed 12-22-04; Am. Ord. 30767-08, passed 7-30-08; ; Am. Ord. 31458-15, passed 11-25-15) 
Sec. 36.104. - Return and payment of tax. 
(A)  This Section 36.104 and Sections 718.05, 718.051, and 718.052 of the Ohio Revised Code shall control the date by which the annual city income tax return for such taxable year must be filed, the form and content of that return, the date by which city income tax for that taxable year must be paid, and any extension of the date by which the annual City income tax must be filed. This Section 36.104 and Sections 718.12 and 718.41 of the Ohio Revised Code shall control for purposes of determining the circumstances under which a taxpayer must file an amended city income tax return. To the extent that the provisions of this Section 36.104 and the express provisions of the foregoing sections of the Ohio Revised Code are in conflict, the foregoing sections of the Ohio Revised Code shall control. 
(B)  Each taxpayer who earns or receives municipal taxable income subject to the tax imposed by this chapter shall, whether or not city income tax be due thereon, make and file a city income return on or before the fifteenth day of the fourth month following the end of the taxpayer's taxable year or by such other date specified by Section 718.05 of the Ohio Revised Code. A city income tax return shall be deemed filed when received by the Tax Administrator; provided, however, that where the city income tax return is delivered by the United States mail to the Tax Administrator after the due date for that return, the postmark stamped on the cover in which the city income tax return is mailed shall be deemed to be the date of delivery of the city income tax return. In the event there is more than one date on such cover, the date of postmark means the earliest date imprinted by the postal service on such cover. Notwithstanding anything in this chapter to the contrary, the return of an employer or employers, agent of an employer, or other payor that shows the amount of city income tax deducted by the employer or employers, agent of an employer, or other payor from the qualifying wages of an employee and paid by the employer or employers, agent of an employer, or other payor to the Tax Administrator shall be accepted as the city income tax return required of any employee whose sole income subject to city income tax consists of such qualifying wages. 
(C)  Married taxpayers may elect to file separate or joint city income tax returns; the filing of a joint federal income tax return does not bind married taxpayers to file a joint city income tax return for the same taxable year, and the filing of separate federal income tax returns does not bind married taxpayers to file separate city income tax returns for the same taxable year. If a joint city income tax return is made, the city income tax shall be computed on the aggregate taxable income of the husband and wife, and the liability with respect to the tax shall be joint and several. 
(D)  The city income tax return shall be filed with the Tax Administrator on a form or forms furnished by or obtainable upon request from the Tax Administrator or on generic form as prescribed by Ohio Revised Code Section 718.05. As provided in Ohio Revised Code Section 718.051 and in the rules and regulations, a business the net profit of which is subject to tax under this chapter may file its city income tax return by using the Ohio business gateway. 
(E)  The city income tax return shall set forth: 
(1)  The aggregate amounts of qualifying wages and other taxable income earned or received by the taxpayer, and gross income from any business less allowable expenses incurred in the acquisition of such gross income earned during the taxable year and subject to city income tax; 
(2)  The amount of the tax imposed by this chapter on such qualifying wages, net profit and taxable income; and 
(3)  Such other pertinent statements, information returns, copies of federal or state tax returns and/or schedules, copies of all 1099's issued and/or received, or other information as the Tax Administrator may require, including a statement that the figures used in the return are the figures used in the taxpayer's federal income tax return for that taxable year, adjusted to set forth only such income as is taxable under the provisions of this chapter. 
(F)  (1) Any taxpayer that has requested an extension for filing a federal income tax return shall automatically receive an extension for the filing of the city income tax return for the same taxable year by filing a copy of the taxpayer's federal extension request for such taxable year with the Tax Administrator. Any taxpayer not required to file a federal income tax return may make a written request for an extension to file a city income tax return. The request for extension must be filed on or before the original due date for the city income tax return, as set forth in Section 36.104(B). The extended due date of the city income tax return shall be the fifteenth day of the tenth month after the last day of the taxable year to which the return relates. An extension of time to file a city income tax return is not an extension of the time to pay any city income tax due unless the Tax Administrator grants an extension of the date by which city income tax must be paid in respect of a given taxable year. 
(2)  Where an automatic extension of the due date for filing the annual city income tax return is not available, the Tax Administrator may deny a taxpayer's request for an extension of such due date if the taxpayer: 
(a)  fails to timely file the request; 
(b)  fails to file a copy of the federal extension request, if applicable; 
(c)  owes the city any delinquent income tax, penalty, interest or other charge for the late payment or nonpayment of city income tax; or 
(d)  has failed to file any required city income tax return, report, or other related document for a prior taxable year. 
(3)  The granting of an extension of the due date for filing a city income tax return does not extend the due date as provided in this Section 36.104 for payment of the tax; hence, penalty and interest may apply to any unpaid tax during the period of extension at the rate set out by Section 36.109. No penalty shall be assessed in those cases in which the city income tax return is filed and the final tax paid within the extended period for filing such return provided all other filing and payment requirements of this chapter have been met. Where an automatic extension of the due date for filing the annual city income tax return is not available, the Tax Administrator shall grant any extension of the due date for filing the city income tax return upon the condition that city income tax declaration filing and payment requirements have been fulfilled; however, if, upon further examination it then becomes evident that such declaration filing and payment requirements have not been fulfilled, penalty and interest may be assessed in full and in the same manner as though no extension of the due date for filing the city income tax return had been granted. 
(G)  Payments with Returns. 
(1)  The taxpayer making a city income tax return shall, at the time of the filing thereof, pay to the Tax Administrator the amount of taxes shown as due thereon. However, credit shall be allowed for: 
(a)  Any portion of the city income tax so due that shall have been deducted at the source pursuant to the provisions of Section 36.105; 
(b)  Any portion of said tax that shall have been paid by the taxpayer pursuant to the provisions of Sections 36.104 and 36.106; and 
(c)  Credit to the extent allowed by Section 36.114 for tax paid to another taxing municipality or state (other than Ohio). 
(2)  Subject to the limitations contained in Section 36.110, any taxpayer who has overpaid the amount of tax to which the city is entitled under the provisions of this chapter may have such overpayment applied against any subsequent liability hereunder or, at his election indicated on the return, such overpayment (or part thereof) shall be refunded, provided that no additional taxes or refunds of a dollar value less than $10.00 shall be assessed, collected or refunded. 
(H)  Amended Returns. 
(1)  Where necessary, an amended return shall be filed in order to report additional income and pay any additional city income tax due, or claim a refund of city income tax overpaid, subject to the requirements and/or limitations contained in Section 36.110. The Tax Administrator shall provide by regulation the format in which such amended return shall be filed. A taxpayer may not, after the due date for filing the original city income tax return, file an amended city income tax return to (i) change its method of accounting, (ii) change its method of apportionment of net profit, or (iii) elect to file a consolidated city income tax return. 
(2)  Within 60 days after the final determination of any federal tax liability affecting the taxpayer's city tax liability, such taxpayer shall make and file an amended city return showing income subject to city income tax based upon such final determination of federal tax liability and pay any additional city income tax shown due thereon or make claim for refund of any overpayment. 
(I)  Information returns, schedules and statements required to support city income tax returns that would be incomplete without such information shall be filed within the time limits set forth in this Section 36.104 for the filing of the city income tax return. The failure to file such information returns, schedules and statements shall be a violation of this chapter; provided, however, that the taxpayer shall have ten days after notification by the Tax Administrator to file the items required by this Section 36.104(H).

Sec. 36.105. - Collection at source. 
(A)  Withholding by Employer, Agent of an Employer or Other Payor. Each employer, agent of an employer, or other payor located within, or doing business within, the city shall, unless excused by Sections 718.011 or 718.03(D) or (F) of the Ohio Revised Code, withhold from each employee an amount equal to the product of (i) the qualifying wages of the employee that are earned by the employee in the city and (ii) the city income tax rate set forth in Section 36.103. Each such employer, agent of an employer, or other payer shall deduct and withhold the city income tax from such qualifying wages on the date that the employer, agent, or other payer directly, indirectly, or constructively (i) pays the qualifying wages to such employee or (ii) credits the qualifying wages under Internal Revenue Code Section 3121, or any amendment or successor provision thereto in effect from time to time, to the benefit of such employee. For all periods beginning on or after January 1, 2016, this Section 36.105 and Section 718.03 of the Ohio Revised Code govern the obligation of an employer, agent of an employer, or other payer to withhold and remit to the city income tax owed on the qualifying wages of an employee that are earned by the employee in the city and to prepare and file with the city such returns and reports as required by this Section 36.105 or Section 718.03 of the Ohio Revised Code by the dates specified in this Section 36.105 or Section 718.03 of the Ohio Revised Code, as applicable. To the extent that the provisions of this Section 35.105 and the express provisions of Section 718.03 of the Ohio Revised Code are in conflict, Section 718.03 of the Ohio Revised Code shall control. Notwithstanding anything in this chapter to the contrary, no person shall be required to withhold and remit city income tax on the qualifying wages paid to an individual employed exclusively to perform domestic service at the employer's residence within the city; such employee shall, however, be subject to city income tax on the qualifying wages he or she receives from such employment. 
(B)  Each such employer, agent of an employer, or other payor shall, on or before the fifteenth day following the end of each calendar quarter, make a return and remit to the city the tax hereby required to be withheld. Such return shall be on a form or forms prescribed by or acceptable to the Administrator and shall be subject to the rules and regulations prescribed therefore by the Administrator. Any employer, agent of an employer, or other payor who withheld, or was required to withhold, more than $2,399.00 of city income tax during the immediately preceding calendar year or who withheld, or was required to withhold, more than $200.00 of city income tax during any month in the preceding calendar quarter shall, on or before the fifteenth day of each month, make a return and remit to the city the tax hereby required to be withheld for the immediately preceding month. Any employer, agent of an employer, or other payor who withheld, or was required to withhold, more than $11,999.00 of city income tax during the preceding calendar year or who withheld, or was required to withhold, more than $1,000.00 of city income tax during any month in the preceding calendar year shall, on or before the applicable date set forth in Ohio Revised Code Section 718.03(B)(2)(a)(ii), make a return and remit to the city the tax hereby required to be withheld for the immediately preceding semimonthly period. As provided in Ohio Revised Code Section 718.051 and in the rules and regulations, any employer, agent of employer, or other payor subject to this Section 36.105 may use the Ohio business gateway both to report the amount of city income tax withheld from qualifying wages and to remit such amounts. Any employer, agent of an employer, or other payor that is required to make payments electronically for the purpose of paying federal taxes withheld on payments to employees under Section 6302 of the Internal Revenue Code, 26 C.F.R. 31.6302-1, or any other federal statute or regulation, shall make payment by electronic funds transfer to the Tax Administrator of the city income tax hereby required to be deducted and withheld on payments of qualifying wages. Such payment of city income tax by electronic funds transfer does not affect an employer's, agent's, or other payor's obligation to file any return required by this Section 36.105 or Section 718.03 of the Ohio Revised Code. 
(C)  An employer, agent of an employer, or other payor is not required to make any withholding with respect to an individual's disqualifying disposition of an incentive stock option if, at the time of the disqualifying disposition, the individual is not an employee of either the corporation with respect to whose stock the option has been issued or of such corporation's successor entity. 
(D)  (1) An employee is not relieved from liability for city income tax by the failure of the employer, agent of an employer, or other payor to withhold the tax as required by this Section 36.105 or by the employer's, agent's, or other payor's exemption from the requirement to withhold City income tax. 
(2)  The failure of an employer, agent of an employer, or other payor to remit to the city the city income tax withheld relieves the employee from liability for that tax unless the employee colluded with the employer, agent, or other payor in connection with the failure to remit the tax withheld. No refund of city income tax withheld on the qualifying wages of an employee shall be paid to that employee unless the employer, agent, or other payor has remitted the city income tax to the city. 
(E)  Employer, Agent of an Employer, or Other Payor Considered as Trustee. Each employer, agent of an employer, or other payor, in collecting city income tax, shall be deemed to hold the same, until payment is made by such employer, agent, or other payor to the city, as a trustee for the benefit of the city, and any such tax collected by such employer, agent, or other payor from employees shall, until the same is paid to the city, be deemed a trust fund in the hands of such employer, agent, or other payor. Each employer, agent of an employer, or other payor shall be liable for the payment of city income tax required to be deducted and withheld whether or not such tax, in fact, has been withheld. 
(F)  Any person who is required to withhold city income tax from qualifying wages shall pay all such tax to the city in accordance with the provisions of this Section 36.105 and Ohio Revised Code Section 718.03. In the event city income taxes withheld from the qualifying wages of employees are not paid to the city in accordance with the provisions of this Section 36.105 and Ohio Revised Code Section 718.03, any and all officers or employees of an employer, agent of an employer, or other payor who have control or direct supervision of or who are charged with the responsibility for withholding city income tax or filing the return and making payment of such taxes as required by this Section 36.105 are jointly and severally personally liable for the tax not returned or paid to the city, as well as any related interest and penalties, and are also liable under the provisions of Section 36.111 hereof. The dissolution of an employer, agent of an employer, or other payor does not discharge such officer's or employee's liability for a failure of the employer, agent of an employer, or other payor to file returns in respect of city income tax withheld from qualifying wages or to pay such tax. 
(G)  Withholding Reconciliation Return; List of Employees. On before the last day of February each year, each employer, agent of an employer, or other payor shall file a withholding tax reconciliation return with the Tax Administrator showing (i) the sum total of all qualifying wages paid to all employees during the immediately preceding calendar, (ii) the portion of such qualifying wages, if any, that was not subject to city income tax withholding along with an explanation for same, (iii) the portion of such qualifying wages that was subject to city income tax withholding, and (iv) the amount of city income tax that was withheld in respect of such qualifying wages and remitted to the Tax Administrator. Such return shall also include information for the immediately preceding calendar year concerning each employee from whom city income tax was withheld, showing in respect of each such employee (i) the name, address, zip code and social security number of each such employee, (ii) the total amount of qualifying wages paid during the immediately preceding year to each such employee, and (iii) the amount of city income tax withheld in respect of such qualifying wages paid to each such employee. If the total tax withheld from any employee includes tax withheld and remitted to another taxing municipality, the amount of such withholding to the other taxing municipality shall be separately shown on the withholding tax reconciliation return to be filed with the city. An employer, agent of an employer, or other payor with more than 100 employees shall provide the information required by this Section 36.105(H) in the format and on the electronic media specified in the rules and regulations. 
(H)  In addition to the wage reporting requirements of this Section 36.105, any person required by the Internal Revenue Service to report on Form 1099-Misc payments to individuals not treated as employees for services performed shall also report such payments to the city when the services were performed in the city. The information shall be submitted on a listing, and shall include the name, address and social security number (or federal identification number) of the individual who performed such services, as well as the amount of the payments made to such individual. Federal form(s) 1099 may be submitted in lieu of such listing. The information required by this Section 36.105(1) shall be filed annually on or before February 28 (February 29 in the case of leap year) following the end of the calendar year in which the payments described in this Section 36.105(I) were made. 
(I)  (1) Any person who shall employ or contract for the services of any professional entertainer(s), public figure(s), or professional athlete(s) to be performed in the city or any person who, acting as a promoter, booking agent or employer, engages the services of or arranges the appearance of any professional entertainer(s), public figure(s), or professional athlete(s) in the city and who makes any payment arising from said appearance in the city shall be deemed to be an employer, agent of an employer, or other payor and shall, for purposes of the collection of city income tax, be required to withhold, report and remit as required under this Section 36.105 city income tax on the gross amount so paid to the professional entertainer(s), public figure(s), or professional athlete(s) for services performed in the city by the professional entertainer, public figure(s), or professional athlete(s). For purposes of this Section 36.105(J), the terms "professional athlete," "professional entertainer," and "public figure" have the same meanings ascribed to such terms by Ohio Revised Code Section 718.011. 
(2)  Any person who rents facilities located in the city that are made available to any professional entertainer(s), public figure(s), or professional athlete(s) for use in performing services in the city and who makes any payment arising from said use of facilities shall be deemed to be an employer, agent of an employer, or other payor and shall, for purposes of the collection of city income tax, be required to withhold, report and remit as required under this Section 36.105 city income tax on the gross amount so paid to the professional entertainer(s), public figure(s), or professional athlete(s) for services performed in the city by the professional entertainer, public figure(s), or professional athlete(s). 
(J)  Any return or form required to be filed under this Section 36.105, other than information required to be submitted on electronic media, is considered filed on the date received by the Tax Administrator; provided, however, that where such return, form, or other information is delivered by the United States mail to the Tax Administrator after the due date for that return, form, or other information, the postmark stamped on the cover in which the return, form, or other information is mailed shall be deemed to be the date of delivery of such return, form, or other information. In the event there is more than one date on such cover, the date of postmark means the earliest date imprinted by the postal service on such cover.

Sec. 36.106. - Declarations. 
(A)  Requirement for Filing. Every person who anticipates earning or receiving any taxable income that is not subject to Section 36.105 or who engages in any business subject to the tax imposed by Section 36.102 shall file a declaration setting forth such estimated income or the estimated net profit from such business activity together with the estimated city income tax due thereon, if any. Provided, however, if a person's income is wholly from qualifying wages from which city income tax will be withheld and remitted to the city in accordance with Section 36.105, such person need not file a declaration described in this Section 36.106. This Section 36.106 and Section 718.08 of the Ohio Revised Code govern the obligation of a taxpayer to declare its estimated city income tax liability for a given taxable year and to pay those estimated taxes. Section 718.08 of the Ohio Revised Code shall control to the extent there is any conflict between this Section 36.106 and the express provisions of Section 718.08 of the Ohio Revised Code. 
(B)  Dates for Filing. 
(1)  Such declaration of estimated city income tax for a taxable year that is a calendar year shall be filed on or before April 15 of each year during the life of this chapter, or on or before the fifteenth day of the fourth month following the date the taxpayer becomes subject to city income tax for the first time. 
(2)  Those taxpayers having a fiscal year or period differing from the calendar year shall file a declaration on or before the fifteenth day of the fourth month following the start of each fiscal year or period. 
(C)  Forms; Credit for Tax Withheld or Paid Another Community. 
(1)  Such declaration of estimated city income tax shall be filed upon a form furnished by or obtainable from the Tax Administrator or an acceptable generic form, and credit shall be taken for city income tax to be withheld from any portion of such income. In accordance with the provisions of Section 36.114 credit may be taken for tax to be withheld and remitted to another taxing municipality. As provided in Ohio Revised Code Section 718.051 and in the rules and regulations, declarations of estimated net profit from any business conducted within the city and payment of estimated city income tax thereon may be made by using the Ohio business gateway. 
(2)  The original declaration (or any subsequent amendment thereof) may be increased or decreased on or before any subsequent quarterly payment date as provided for herein. 
(3)  For all taxpayers, such declaration of estimated city income tax shall be accompanied by a payment of at least 22.5 percent of such taxpayer's estimated city income tax, and at least 22.5 percent of such estimated city income tax shall be paid on or before each of the fifteenth day of the sixth, ninth and twelfth months after the beginning of the taxable year. 
(4)  The mere submission of a declaration of estimated city income tax shall not constitute the filing of such declaration under this Section 36.106 unless the declaration is accompanied by the required payment of estimated city income tax. 
(5)  The declaration and accompanying required payment is considered filed on the date received by the Tax Administrator; provided, however, that where the city income tax return is delivered by the United States mail to the Tax Administrator after the due date for that declaration, the postmark stamped on the cover in which the declaration is mailed shall be deemed to be the date of delivery of the declaration. In the event there is more than one date on such cover, the date of postmark means the earliest date imprinted by the postal service on such cover. 
(D)  Amended Declaration. 
(1)  A declaration of estimated city income tax may be amended at any time. 
(2)  In the event that an amended declaration has been filed, the unpaid balance shown due thereon shall be paid in equal installments on or before the remaining payment dates set forth in Section 36.106(C). 
(3)  If upon filing the city income tax return required by Section 36.104 it appears that the taxpayer did not pay 90 percent of his city income tax liability, as shown on the return, on or before the fifteenth day of the twelfth month after the beginning of the taxable year, the difference between 90 percent of the taxpayer's city income tax liability and the amount of estimated city income tax actually paid on or before such date shall be subject to the interest and penalty provisions of Section 36.109. However, the interest and penalty provision of Section 36.109 shall not apply where either: (i) the taxpayer is a resident but was not domiciled in the city on January 1 of the taxable year for which estimated payments of city income tax have been made; or (ii) the taxpayer has remitted on a timely basis an amount of estimated city income tax at least equal to 100 percent of the taxpayer's city income tax liability for the preceding taxable year, provided that the return for the preceding taxable year reflected a 12-month period and the taxpayer filed a city income tax return for the preceding taxable year. 
(4)  The last quarterly payment of estimated city income tax need not be made if the taxpayer files his city income tax return and pays the balance of the tax due thereon within 45 days following the end of his taxable year. 
(E)  Annual Return Required. On or before the fifteenth day of the fourth month of the calendar or fiscal year, a taxpayer shall file a city income tax return and shall remit to the city any balance of city income tax that may be due in accordance with the provisions of Section 36.104.

Sec. 36.107. - Appointment and duties of Tax Administrator. 
(A)  (2)  It shall be the duty of the Tax Administrator to enforce payment of all income taxes owing the city, to keep accurate records for a minimum of six years, showing the amount due from each taxpayer required to file a declaration of estimated city income tax or make any return, including a return of taxes withheld, and to show the dates and amounts of payments thereof. 
(B)  The Tax Administrator is hereby charged with the enforcement of the provisions of this chapter, including the interpretation and enforcement of the rules and regulations promulgated hereunder, and is hereby empowered, subject to the approval of the Board of Tax Review, to adopt and promulgate and to enforce rules and regulations relating to any matter or thing pertaining to the collection of taxes and the administration and enforcement of the provisions of this chapter, including provisions for the re-examination and correction of city income tax returns. 
(C)  In any case where a taxpayer has failed to file a city income tax return, the Tax Administrator may determine the amount of city income tax appearing to be due the city from the taxpayer and may send to such taxpayer a written statement showing the amount of tax so determined, together with interest and penalties thereon, in the manner set forth in Ohio Revised Code Section 718.18. Within 60 days after receipt of service of the final assessment, the taxpayer may protest the ruling in that assessment by filing an appeal with the Board of Tax Review in the manner provided in Section 36.112. 
(D)  When any taxpayer has filed a city income tax return indicating the amount of tax due and has failed to pay such amount of city income tax, the Tax Administrator need not issue an assessment but may proceed under the provisions of Sections 36.109 and 36.110 to impose interest and penalties thereon and to enforce the collection of the outstanding city income tax, together with interest and penalties. 
(E)  If the Tax Administrator determines that an employer, agent of an employer, or other payor has failed to withhold city income tax on qualifying wages, to file a return for city income tax withheld or to pay to the Tax Administrator the full amount of city income tax subject to withholding, all as required by Section 36.105, the Tax Administrator may cause issuance of an assessment showing the amount of tax due, together with any penalties and interest that may have accrued thereon, and the provisions of Section 36.112 shall then apply to any appeal of such assessment. 
(F)  When an employer, agent of an employer, or other payor has filed a return indicating the amount of city income tax withheld and has failed to pay such amount of withheld city income tax, the Tax Administrator need not issue an assessment but may proceed under the provisions of Sections 36.109 and 36.110 to impose interest and penalties thereon and to enforce the collection the outstanding city income tax, together with interest and penalties. 
(G)  When a taxpayer files an application for deferred payment of city income tax due, the Tax Administrator may authorize partial payment of unpaid taxes when, in his judgment, the taxpayer is unable, due to hardship conditions, to pay the full amount of the tax when due. However, except as provided in Section 36.112(E), the Tax Administrator shall not authorize an extension of time for the payment of city income tax due for more than 24 months beyond the date the taxpayer files an application for deferred payment of such tax. 
(H)  Subject to the prior written consent of a majority of the Board of Tax Review, the Tax Administrator may be given the power to compromise any liability imposed by this chapter. 
(I)  Upon the demonstration and documentation of good cause, and consistent with this chapter and the rules and regulations, the Tax Administrator may be given authority by the Board of Tax Review to compromise penalty and interest liabilities imposed under this chapter in an amount not to exceed $1,000.00. 
(J)  The Tax Administrator shall submit to the Board of Tax Review on a regular basis outstanding city income tax balances that the Tax Administrator recommends for cancellation because such balances either cannot be collected or can be collected only at a cost in excess of the outstanding balance. 
(K)  The Tax Administrator may delegate any of the duties set forth in this chapter to employees of the Department of Finance as needed, with the approval of the Director of Finance.

Sec. 36.108. - Investigative powers of tax administrator; penalty for divulging confidential information. 
(A)  The Tax Administrator, or any of his authorized agents, is hereby authorized to examine the books, papers, records and federal income tax returns of any employer, agent of any employer, or other payor, a taxpayer, or any person subject to, or whom the Tax Administrator believes is subject to, the provisions of this chapter for the purpose of verifying the accuracy of any return made, or, if no return was made, to ascertain the tax or withholdings due under this chapter. Every such employer (or agent or other payor), supposed employer (or agent or other payor), taxpayer or supposed taxpayer is hereby directed and required to furnish within 15 days upon written request of the Tax Administrator, or his duly authorized agent or employee, the means, facilities and opportunities for making such examinations and investigations as are hereby authorized. 
(B)  The Tax Administrator is hereby authorized to order any person, presumed to have knowledge of the facts, to appear at the office of the Tax Administrator and to examine such person, under oath, concerning any income which was or should have been reported for city income tax purposes or withheld, or any transaction tending to affect such income, and for this purpose may compel the production of books, papers, records and federal income tax returns, and the attendance of all persons before him, whether as parties or witnesses, whenever he believes such persons have knowledge of such income or information pertinent to such inquiry. 
(C)  The refusal to produce books, papers, records or federal income tax returns, or the refusal to submit to such examination by any employer, agent of any employer, or other payor, or person subject, or presumed to be subject, to the tax or by any officer, agent or employee of a person subject to city income tax or required to withhold such tax, or the failure of any person to comply with the provisions of this Section 36.108 or with an order or subpoena of the Tax Administrator authorized hereby, shall be deemed a violation of this chapter punishable as provided in Section 36.111. 
(D)  Every taxpayer shall retain all records necessary to compute his city income tax liability for a period of six years from the date his city income tax return is filed or the city income taxes required to be withheld are paid. 
(E)  Any information gained as a result of returns, investigations, hearings, or verifications required or authorized by this chapter shall be confidential and no person shall disclose such information except in accordance with a proper judicial order or in connection with the performance of that person's official duties or the official business of the city as authorized by this chapter. The Tax Administrator may furnish copies of city income tax returns filed under this chapter and other related city income tax information to the Internal Revenue Service, the Ohio Tax Commissioner, and the tax administrators of other taxing municipalities. 
(F)  Any person divulging information described in Section 36.108(E) shall be guilty of a misdemeanor of the first degree punishable by a maximum fine of $1,000.00 or imprisonment for not more than six months, or both. Each disclosure of information described in Section 36.108(E) shall constitute a separate offense. 
(G)  In addition to the above penalty, any employee of the city who violates the provisions of this Section 36.108 relative to the disclosure of confidential information shall be guilty of an offense punishable by immediate dismissal. 
(H)  If, but for this Section 36.108, an individual would have been privileged to withhold any information given, and such individual complies with paragraph (B) of this Section 36.108 compelling him to give an answer or produce any information to the Tax Administrator, he shall not be prosecuted or subjected to any criminal penalty in the courts of this state for or on account of any transaction or matter concerning which, in compliance with the order, such individual gave an answer or produced any information to the Tax Administrator. 
(I)  An individual granted immunity from prosecution under Section 36.108(H) may be subjected to a criminal penalty for any violation of this chapter outside the scope of such immunity or for failing to answer or failing to produce information in compliance with an order of the Tax Administrator.

Sec. 36.109. - Interest and penalties. 
(A)  For taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 2016, this Section 36.109 and Section 718.27 of the Ohio Revised Code govern the imposition of interest and penalties for the failure of a taxpayer, employer, agent of an employer, or other payor to comply with the requirements of this chapter to file any return or report or to withhold or make payments of city income tax. Section 718.27 of the Ohio Revised Code shall control to the extent there is any conflict between this Section 36.109 and the express provisions of Section 718.27 of the Ohio Revised Code. 
(B)  Interest shall be imposed at the rate described in Section 718.27(A), per annum, on all city income tax, estimated city income tax, and withholding of city income tax that remains unpaid after the payment of such tax is due. 
(C)  In addition to interest as provided in Section 36.109(B), penalties are hereby imposed, as provided by Section 718.27(C) of the Ohio Revised Code, as follows based on the city income tax remaining unpaid after it becomes due: 
(1)  For failure to pay city income tax when due and for failure to make estimated payments of city income tax when due, 15 percent of the amount not timely paid. 
(2)  For failure to remit when due city income taxes withheld or required to be withheld from payments of qualifying wages to employees, 50 percent of the amount of such city income tax not timely paid. 
(3)  For failure by a taxpayer, employer, agent of an employer, or other payor to file a return required under this chapter, other than a return for estimated city income tax, by the due date or by the date resulting from extension of the original due date, $25.00 for each failure to timely file each such return for each month, or any fraction of a month, during which the return remains unfiled, regardless of the liability shown on each such return. The penalty imposed by this Section 36.109(C)(3) shall not exceed $150.00 for each failure to file a timely return required under this chapter, and the penalty provided by this Section 36.109(C) shall be imposed regardless of cause. 
(4)  Interest but no penalty shall be assessed where an extension of the due date for the city income tax return is automatically obtained or is otherwise granted, as set forth in Section 36.104(f), and the city income tax is paid within the period as extended. 
(C)  Exceptions.

(B)  The city income tax imposed by this chapter shall be collectible, together with any interest and penalties thereon and the post-judgment costs, including attorney's fees, incurred to collect such tax, interest and penalties, by suit as other debts of like amount are recoverable. Such suit shall, as provided by Section 718.12(A) of the Ohio Revised Code, be brought within the later of: (1) three years after the city income tax was due or the return was filed, whichever is later; or (2) one year after the conclusion of the qualifying deferral period set forth in Section 718.12(A) of the Ohio Revised Code. No additional assessment of city income tax, interest, or penalties shall be made after three years from the time the city income tax was due or the city income tax return was filed, whichever is later. As set forth in Section 718.12(B) of the Ohio Revised Code, prosecutions for an offense made punishable under this chapter shall be commenced within three years after the commission of the offense, provided that in the case of fraud, failure to file a return, or the omission of 25 percent or more of the income required to be reported, prosecutions may be commenced within six years after the commission of the offense. 
(C)  Taxes erroneously paid shall not be refunded unless a claim for refund is made within the period specified by Section 718.19(B) of the Ohio Revised Code, which period is three years from the date on which such erroneous payment was made or the return was due, or within 60 days after final determination of the federal tax liability, whichever is later. No refund of city income tax on qualifying wages paid to a taxpayer for personal services performed by the taxpayer outside the city on 20 or fewer days in a calendar year shall be granted unless the taxpayer can show that another municipality taxed such qualifying wages. No refund of city income tax on qualifying wages paid to a taxpayer for personal services performed by the taxpayer outside the city at the convenience, as distinguished from the necessity, of the taxpayer's employer shall be granted. 
(D)  No interest shall be allowed on any overpayment of city income tax that is refunded within 90 days after the due date, as extended, for filing the city income tax return or 90 days after the complete return is filed, whichever is later. For purposes of computing the payment of interest on overpayments of city income tax, no amount of city income tax for any taxable year shall be treated as having been paid before the date on which the city income tax return for that year was due, without regard to any extension of time for filing that return. Interest on any overpayment of city income tax shall be paid at the rate of interest prescribed by Ohio Revised Code Section 718.27(A)(5).

After such approval, such rules, regulations, amendments and changes shall be filed with the City Commission and shall be open to public inspection and shall be published and posted on the internet as described in Sections 718.07 and 718.30 of the Ohio Revised Code. The Board shall hear and pass on appeals from any assessment issued by the Tax Administrator, and, at the request of the taxpayer or Tax Administrator, is empowered to substitute alternate methods of apportionment.

The Board may allow the hearing to be continued as jointly agreed by the parties. In such a case, the hearing must be completed within 120 days after the first day of the hearing unless the parties agree otherwise.

(A)  Residents. When a resident, either directly or through an ownership interest in a pass-through entity, is subject to and has paid, or has acknowledged liability for, an income tax in another taxing jurisdiction on the same income taxable under this chapter, regardless of whether such other taxing jurisdiction allows credit to its nonresidents, such resident may claim a credit against the tax imposed by this chapter in an amount equal to the lesser of (i) the amount of such tax paid on such income to such other taxing jurisdiction or (ii) the city income tax on such income taxable under this chapter. In no case shall the credit exceed the tax assessed under this chapter on the resident's taxable income that is also subject to tax in another taxing jurisdiction. 
(B)  Where applicable, the credits provided in Ohio Revised Code Chapter 718, including but not limited to Ohio Revised Code Section 718.121, shall be available to residents. 
(C)  Nonresidents. Except as required by Ohio Revised Code Chapter 718, when a nonresident is subject to the tax imposed by this chapter and is also subject to tax on the same income in the municipal corporation in which the nonresident resides, such nonresident shall not be allowed any credit against or claim of refund for city income tax, and the city will not acknowledge or allow any claim for refund of any portion of the city income tax so levied. 
(D)  Claim for Credit. The credit provided for in Section 36.114(A) will not be allowed unless the same is claimed in a timely return or form acceptable to, and filed with, the Tax Administrator. In the event a taxpayer fails, neglects, or refuses to file such timely return or form, he shall not be entitled to such credit and shall be liable for the full amount of tax assessed by this chapter, together with such interest and penalties, both civil and criminal, as prescribed in this chapter. 
(E)  No credit shall be given to any taxpayer for any school district income tax.

This type of information is collected as a means of promoting a safe work environment for current and future employees. Background checks also help the city obtain additional applicant related information that helps determine the applicant's overall employability, ensuring the protection of the current people, property, and information of the organization. 
(1)  Types of background checks. 
All offers of employment at the city may be contingent upon passing all necessary background checks. Background checks will be conducted on all newly hired staff members and on all employees who are promoted, as deemed necessary.

(4)  Civil Service shall conduct necessary background checks, and the department may verify qualifications. 
(B)  Background check procedure. 
(1)  Except for police and fire positions, Civil Service will not conduct a background check until a contingent offer of employment is extended by the city. 
(2)  After a contingent employment offer is made, the chosen candidate must complete all necessary pre-employment paperwork and return these to Civil Service. Civil Service will notify the department upon receipt of the signed release and/or forms. The chosen candidate is not to begin work prior to the department receiving approval from Civil Service and the Department of Human Resources. 
(3)  Civil Service will order the necessary background checks upon receipt of the signed release and/or forms. A designated Civil Service representative will review all results of any and all background checks. 
(4)  Civil Service will notify the department regarding the results of the background checks. In instances where negative or incomplete information is obtained, Civil Service will assess the potential risks and liabilities related to the job's requirements and determine whether the individual should be hired. 
(5)  Background check information will be maintained by Civil Service in a file separate from an employee's personnel file. 
(C)  Criminal checks. 
(1)  A criminal history record check is required for all positions. All applicants must authorize in writing the background investigation using the appropriate release and/or forms. The city will inquire only about convictions and probation status, if any, and not about arrests unless required by applicable laws. 
(2)  The following factors may be considered by Civil Service for those applicants with a criminal history in determining whether to hire the external applicant or transfer or promote the internal applicant: 
(a)  The nature of the crime, and whether the conviction of a felony or misdemeanor adversely bears on the employee's suitability for employment. 
(b)  The time since the conviction. 
(c)  Evidence of rehabilitation by the applicant since the conviction. 
(d)  The number (if more than one) of convictions and whether hiring, transferring or promoting the applicant would pose an unreasonable risk to the City and/or its employees or citizens. 
(e)  The applicant for a classified position will be given an opportunity to contest his/her removal from an eligible list due to the outcome of a criminal records check. 
(f)  If any applicant is found to have falsified any information regarding conviction history, the applicant will not be considered for employment. If an employee seeking a transfer or promotion to a position requiring a criminal history record check is found to have falsified any information regarding conviction history, the employee will be immediately discharged. 
(D)  Current employees criminal conviction. 
(1)  Employees must notify their Department Director within one working day of any arrest and/or conviction for any crime. Failure to comply with this requirement will result in disciplinary action, up to, and including, termination. 
(2)  Determination of which crimes will affect continued employment will be evaluated by HR, the Law Department, and Civil Service. Each situation will be considered on an individual, case-by-case basis, with attention being given to the nature and seriousness of the crime, the time elapsed from the conviction date, circumstances, job description, and job location. 
(E)  Physical examinations. 
A pre-employment medical examination and drug screen is required. The selected candidate will be directed to Civil Service to be referred for a physical examination. No candidate will be put on the payroll until after he/she has completed and passed the physical exam and drug screen.

3.  An extra strength surcharge for wastewater discharges with pollutant concentrations in excess of those of normal domestic wastewater. 
4.  A special monitoring fee for Significant Industrial Users (SIU) as defined in 40 CFR 403. 
(C)  Method of Levying Charges. Wastewater service charges are levied as follows: 
(1)  For any lot, parcel of land, building, or premises situated within the corporate limits of the city having any connection with the city wastewater system or otherwise discharging wastewater, industrial wastes, water, or other liquids, either directly or indirectly, into the city wastewater system, a charge shall be based on the quantity of water used as measured by an approved water meter there in use or by other substantially equivalent means acceptable to the Director. The measurement of the strength of the wastewater for purposes of the extra strength surcharges shall be made by standard sampling and laboratory procedures in a manner acceptable to the Director. The charge will be made quarterly or monthly at the discretion of the Director. 
(2)  For any lot, parcel of land, building, or premises situated outside of the corporate limits of the city having any connection with the city wastewater system or otherwise discharging wastewater, industrial wastes, water, or other liquids, either directly or indirectly, into the city wastewater system, and which is defined as "retail", unless such usage of the city wastewater system is covered by specific agreement with a political subdivision specifying rates, terms, and conditions of usage, a charge shall be based upon the quantity of water used as measured by the water meter or by other substantially equivalent means acceptable to the Director. The water meter used shall be approved by the Director, and the charge shall be made quarterly or monthly at the discretion of the Director. The measurement of the strength of the wastewater for purposes of application of the extra strength surcharges shall be made by standard sampling and laboratory procedures in a manner acceptable to the Director. 
(3)  For any lot, parcel of land, building, or premises situated outside of the corporate limits of the city having any connection with the city wastewater system or otherwise discharging wastewater, industrial wastes, water, or other liquids either directly or indirectly, into the city wastewater system, where such usage of the city wastewater system is covered by specific agreement specifying rates, terms and conditions of usage measured on a bulk or large quantity basis, and is defined as "individually metered", a charge shall be based upon the quantity of water used as measured by a water meter or by other substantially equivalent means acceptable to the Director. The water meter used shall be approved by the Director and the charge shall be made monthly or quarterly at the discretion of the Director. The wastewater for purposes of application of the extra strength surcharges shall be made by standard sampling and laboratory procedures in a manner acceptable to the Director. 
(4)  For all areas situated outside of the corporate limits of the city having any connection with the city wastewater system or otherwise discharging wastewater, industrial wastes, water, or other liquids, either directly or indirectly, into the city wastewater system, where such usage of the city wastewater system is covered by specific agreement specifying rates, terms, and conditions of usage measured on a bulk or large quantity basis, and is defined as "master metered", a charge shall be based upon the quantity of water or wastewater discharged to the city sewers. The method of determining the quantity of water used or wastewater discharged shall be approved by the Director, and charges shall be made monthly or quarterly at the discretion of the Director. The measurement of the strength of the wastewater for purposes of application of the extra strength surcharges shall be made by standard sampling and laboratory procedures in a manner acceptable to the Director. 
(5)  Where a lot, parcel of land, building, or premises discharging waste, water, or other liquids into the city wastewater system, either directly or indirectly, is not a user of water supplied by the Department of Water of the city and water used is not measured by a city water meter, or by a meter acceptable to the Director, then, in each such case, the amount of water used shall be measured by a means approved by the Director in order to determine the sewer service charge. In the alternative, the owner or other interested party may install a meter at his expense which is acceptable to the Director for this purpose. The basic charge for a sewer service charge determined under this alternative shall be based on the 10-inch meter rate or the appropriate multiple thereof. 
(6)  Where a lot, parcel of land, building, or premises discharges industrial wastes, either directly or indirectly, into the city wastewater system, and the Director finds that it is not practical to attempt to measure such wastes by meter, the customer shall measure such wastes in such manner and by such method that the Director finds practicable. The measurement of the strength of the wastewater for purposes of application of the extra strength surcharges shall be made by standard sampling and laboratory procedures in a manner acceptable to the Director. The wastewater service charge or rental shall be determined according to the corresponding rates per 1,000 cubic feet provided in this section. The basic charge for a sewer service charge determined by this method shall be based on the ten-inch meter rate or appropriate multiple thereof. 
(7)  A discount of five percent shall be given on all bills which are paid on or before the date specified on the bills rendered. If the bill is not paid by the date specified for a payment of the net amount (gross less five percent discount), second notices will be sent. Should a bill remain unpaid for 21 days after the net payment date, the account will be considered delinquent. However, where bills are to be paid by the United States of America or any agency thereof, or the state, or any political subdivision or agency thereof, including the Board of Education or the City school district and the Dayton and Montgomery County Public Library, a discount of five percent shall be allowed if the bill is paid within 60 days of the date of rendition, except that the Director of Finance may grant an extension of time if just cause is shown. 
(8)  Except where covered by specific agreement, the charge provided in this section shall be payable quarterly or monthly at the Department of Finance at the same time as water bills are payable in the district in which the property is located. If a customer requests a special meter reading between regularly scheduled reading dates, the minimum charge will be determined in proportion to the time elapsed since the last regular reading compared to the normal time between regular reading dates. If, and when, any user fails to make payments after proper billing, enforcement will be subject to the Rule and Regulations of the Department of Water to cover any amounts due. 
(9)  If premises are found to be discharging wastewater or other wastes into the wastewater system without paying a wastewater service charge, the Director shall, by such method as he may find practicable, measure or estimate the quantity of such wastes for the purpose of establishing a proper charge in accordance with the schedule of charges set forth herein, and these premises shall be charged for the total term of the prior usage on the basis of the quantity so determined. The measurement of the strength of the wastewater for purposes of application of the extra strength surcharges shall be made by standard sampling and laboratory procedures in a manner acceptable to the Director. 
(10)  Any user which discharges toxic or other pollutants which cause an increase in operation, maintenance, and replacement costs shall pay for such increased costs in addition to any other charges which may accrue to the user under wastewater service charges outlined in the preceding divisions. 
(11)  The city shall notify its users annually in conjunction with a regular bill of the rates for the various components of the wastewater service charge.

Sec. 50.38. - Protection fee for privately financed water main improvements. 
(A)  Purpose and eligibility. The Director of the Department of Water, or his/her designee, may authorize the establishment of a protection fee to be collected from the owner(s) of any property(ies) that connect(s) to a privately-financed water main extension or improvement, where such owner(s) did not participate in the original cost of the water main extension or improvement. The purpose of this protection fee is to help offset the original cost of the extension or improvement to the original private developer, by requiring those who own properties to be connected at a later date from benefiting at the expense of the original developer. 
(B)  Establishment. Protection fees may be established by the Director of the Department of Water, or his/her designee by the following procedure. 
    Such fees may be based on front footage, square footage, or benefit unit. For the establishment of protection fees as outlined in this section only, "front footage" shall be the footage of water main installed or improved along or through a directly benefited property. "Square footage" shall be based on the total area of the directly benefited property. "Benefit unit" shall be some other predetermined unit of measuring the value of the water main extension or improvement to the benefited property, other than by front footage or square footage. 
(1)  Preliminary request. A preliminary request to establish protection fees shall be submitted in accordance with the following steps: 
(a)  A developer requesting the establishment of protection fees shall make his/her/its request in writing to the Director of Water or his/her designee, prior to the beginning of construction of the water main extension or improvement, and prior to the issuance of any building or other applicable construction permits required for the water main extension or improvement. 
(b)  Attached to the written request shall be a detailed unit price cost estimate prepared by the developer's design engineer, a property map(s) showing the property dimensions of all directly benefited properties, estimated engineering fees, appropriate inspection fees and other applicable fees; including but not limited to state and/or federal agency fees. 
(2)  Amount. The amount of protection fees to be established may include the following items: 
(a)  Construction cost of improvement. 
(b)  Easement costs for improvement; final easement payments must be justified as to reasonableness by submission of an appropriate appraisal. 
(c)  Engineering fees (design staking and as-builts). 
(d)  Inspection fees (by permit). 
(e)  OEPA fees (plan review, permit to install (PTI) application and fee). 
(f)  Such other fees and/or costs as may be determined by the Director of Water or his/her designee to be reasonably related and required for the water main extension or improvement and reasonably justified for inclusion in the protection fee. 
(3)  Upon review of the preliminary request and relevant factors, the Director of Water or his/her designee shall calculate the amount of protection fee(s) that he or she can recommend to the City Commission for adoption and shall furnish the developer with written notice of such fees so recommended, subject to final approval by the City Commission. 
(4)  The Director of Water or his/her designee will then prepare a resolution of recommendation to the City Commission for establishment of the protection fees for a given project. The resolution shall set forth the amount of the protection fees, the method by which collection of the protection fees will be allocated among subsequent connections, the term of collection (which in no event shall exceed ten years), and the name and address to whom reimbursement for the original extension or improvement shall be paid. The resolution may also contain such other terms and conditions as recommended by the Director of Water or his/her designee. The resolution shall provide for an administrative fee to be collected by the city in the amount of five percent of the protection fees so collected. The resolution shall not provide for the collection of interest on the cost of the original extension or improvement. The resolution shall not be considered as an emergency legislation. 
(C)  Collection. Once the resolution establishing the protection fees for a particular project becomes effective, the Director of water or his/her designee will collect these fees at the time of issuance of any permits for connection by those properties directly benefited by the water main extension or improvement as established by the resolution. 
(D)  Reimbursement. Any protection fees collected by the Director of Water or his/her designee will be reimbursed to the developer in accordance with the appropriate resolution of establishment. 
(E)  Term. The protection fees for any particular project shall be in effect for the time period as set forth in the resolution of establishment as passed by the City Commission, but in no event for longer than a ten-year period from the date the original extension or improvement was completed. 
(F)  Rights. Protection fee rights are nontransferable and shall apply to only the individual or firm with whom they are established. 
(G)  Disclaimer. The City of Dayton shall accept no liability for the collection of protection fees nor policing of the improvement due to error.

Sec. 52.02. - Sanitary sewer connections. 
I.  Sewer Main Extension. To have a sanitary sewer extended in the City of Dayton, the applicant shall contact the Division of Water Engineering for current costs and procedures. Submittal/approval of plans, securing permits, and payment of applicable fees are required prior to any service work being started. To have a connection made in an available sewer, contact a licensed plumber. The plumber shall then contact the Division of Sewer Maintenance for current costs and procedures. Certain portions of building sewer lateral installations are performed by the city and billed to the licensed plumber or excavator. 
II.  Connection to Sanitary Sewer Required. 
(A)  Except as provided in this chapter, no person shall construct or maintain any privy, privy vault, septic tank, cesspool, or other facility intended or used for the disposal of wastewater. 
(B)  The owner of any house, building, or property that is used for human occupancy, employment, recreation, or other purposes, and abutting on any street, alley, right-of-way, or easement in which there is or may be located a sanitary sewer connected to the treatment facility of the city, is required at the owner's expense to install suitable toilet facilities therein, and to connect such facilities by means of a building sewer (lateral) directly to the sanitary sewer in accordance with the provisions of this chapter, within 90 days after official notice to do so, provided that the proper sanitary sewer is within 200 feet of the property line. The owner is responsible for maintenance of the building sewer (lateral) to the point of connection with the publicly-owned sanitary sewer. This section shall not apply to any person served by a privately constructed, owned, operated, and maintained sanitary sewer and wastewater treatment facility that discharges directly to an outlet in accordance with the provisions of this chapter and applicable local, state, and federal laws. 
(C)  This section shall not apply to any private system that discharges to wastewater facilities of the city or that discharges directly to a natural outlet by authority of a separate NPDES permit and in compliance with applicable local, state, and federal laws. 
(D)  At such time as a sanitary sewer becomes available as defined above, to a property served by a private wastewater disposal system, a direct connection shall be made to the sanitary sewer within 90 days after official notice to do so, and any septic tanks, cesspools, and similar wastewater disposal facilities shall be emptied and filled with suitable material. 
III.  Connection Approvals. 
(A)  No person shall uncover, make any connections with or opening into, use, alter, or disturb any sanitary sewer or a storm sewer without first obtaining written approval from the Department of Building Services or Department of Water, as appropriate. 
(B)  There may be four types of connections to the city's wastewater facilities: Residential, Commercial, Governmental, and Industrial. The Industrial User shall file an Application for Industrial Wastewater Service on a special form furnished by the Director. The application shall include wastewater disclosure information as required by the provisions of this chapter. Exceptions to this provision may be made by the Director. 
IV.  Connection Costs. The costs and expenses incidental to the building sewer installation and connection to the city's wastewater facilities shall be borne by the owner. The owner shall indemnify the Director for any loss or damage incurred by the city that is directly or indirectly caused by the installation of the building sewer. Current rates for city connection are available at the Division of Sewer Maintenance, Division of Water Engineering, or the Department of Building Services ("One Stop Shop"). 
V.  Separate Connections Required. A separate and independent building sewer shall be provided for every building separately owned. Except where one building stands at the rear of another on an interior lot and no private sewer is available or can be constructed to the rear building through an adjoining alley, court yard, or driveway, the building sewer serving the front building may, upon the approval of the Director, be extended to the rear building and the whole considered as one building sewer. The Director assumes no obligation or responsibility for damage caused by or resulting from any single building sewer that serves two or more buildings. 
VI.  Existing Building Sewers. Existing building sewers may be used for connection of new building only on approval of the Director. Submit exemption requests to the Division of Water Engineering. Exemption requests shall contain at a minimum the name and address of the owner of the property, billing responsibilities, and the reason for the exception. 
VII.  Abandonment of Service. If a residential, commercial, governmental, or industrial structure is scheduled to be razed, then the service to the premises shall be cut and plugged at the property line as required by the Department of Water and the Department of Building Services. The actual cost will be incurred by the property owner. 
VIII.  Building Sewer Design. The size, slope, alignment, construction materials, trench excavation, and backfill methods, pipe placement, jointing and testing methods used in the construction and installation of a building sewer shall conform to the building and plumbing code or other applicable requirements of the city. In the absence of code provisions or in amplification thereof, the materials and procedures set forth in appropriate specifications of the ASTM and WEF shall apply. 
IX.  Building Sewer Elevation. Whenever practicable, the building sewer shall be brought to a building at an elevation below the basement floor. In buildings in which any building drain is too low to permit gravity flow to the city's sanitary sewer, wastewater carried by such building drain shall be lifted by an approved means and discharged to a building sewer draining to the city sewer. 
X.  Surface Runoff, Groundwater, and Non-Contact Cooling Water Drains. No person shall connect roof, foundation, areaway, parking lot, roadway, or other surface runoff or groundwater or non-contact cooling water drains to any sewer that is connected to the city's wastewater facility. The Director may approve the connection of such drains only when he has explicitly approved the waters intended for such drains for discharge to the wastewater facility, under the provision found in § 52.03 II(B)(12). 
XI.  Conformance to Applicable Codes. 
(A)  The connection of a building sewer into a sanitary sewer shall conform to the requirements of the building and plumbing code or other applicable requirements of the city, or the procedures set forth in appropriate specifications of the ASTM or the WEF. The connections shall be made gas-tight and watertight and verified by proper testing. Any deviation from the prescribed procedures and materials shall be approved in writing by the Director before installation. 
(B)  The connection of a surface runoff, groundwater, or non-contact cooling water drain to a storm sewer or outlet designed to transport surface runoff or groundwater drainage shall conform to the requirements of the applicable building code of the city and other applicable federal, state, and local requirements. 
XII.  Connection Inspection. The applicant for a building sewer or other drainage connection permit shall notify the Director when such sewer or drainage connection is ready for inspection prior to its connection to the city's facilities. Such connection and testing as deemed necessary by the Director shall be made under the supervision of the Director. 
XIII.  Excavation Guards and Property Restoration. Excavations for building sewer installation shall be adequately guarded with barricades and lights so as to protect the public from hazard. Streets, sidewalks, parkways, and other public property disturbed in the course of the work shall be restored in a manner satisfactory to the Director. 
XIV.  Allocation of Capacity. The Director shall not accept discharges of any wastewater to the city's sanitary sewers or wastewater treatment facilities unless there is sufficient capacity in the sanitary sewers and treatment facilities to convey and adequately treat the quantity of wastewater that the requested connection will add to the system. Where the Director determines that a discharge from a new source will utilize an unreasonable proportion of the reserve capacity of the sanitary sewers or wastewater treatment facilities, the Director shall not accept the discharge from the new source. 
(Ord. 30739-08, passed 4-23-08) 
Sec. 52.03. - General requirements. 
I.  Waste Disposal. No person shall place, deposit, or permit to be deposited in any non-sanitary manner on public or private property within the City of Dayton, or in any area under the jurisdiction of said city, any human or animal excrement, garbage, or other objectionable waste. No person shall discharge wastewater to any outlet except in compliance with federal and state NPDES permit requirements. 
II.  Prohibited Discharge Standards. 
(A)  General Prohibitions: No user shall introduce or cause to be introduced into the POTW any pollutant or wastewater that causes pass through or interference. These general prohibitions apply to all users of the POTW whether or not they are subject to categorical pretreatment standards or any other National, State, or local pretreatment standards or requirements. The Director may reject any wastewater that will create hazards or have deleterious effects on the POTW. 
(B)  Specific Prohibitions: No person shall discharge or cause to be discharged to the POTW any substances, materials, waters, or wastes in such quantities or concentrations that in whole or in part: 
(1)  Create a fire or explosion hazard including, but not limited to, gasoline, benzene, naphtha, fuel oil, wastestreams with a closed cup flashpoint of less than 60°C (140°F) using the test method specified in 40 CFR 261.21, or other flammable or explosive liquid, solid, or gas; 
(2)  Contain corrosive properties causing damage or hazard to structures, equipment, or personnel of the wastewater facilities; however, in no case shall discharges have a pH lower than 6.0 or greater than 12.0 unless the Director orders specific alternate limitations or conditions. pH shall be determined by analytical methods defined by 40 CFR Part 136 or alternate methods approved by the Director; 
(3)  Solid or viscous pollutants in amounts that will cause obstruction to the flow in the POTW resulting in Interference; but in no case solids greater than one-half inch in any dimension; 
(4)  Pollutants, including oxygen-demanding pollutants (BOD, COD, etc.), released in a discharge at a flow rate and/or pollutant concentration that, either singly or by interaction with other pollutants, will cause interference with the POTW; 
(5)  Contain heat in amounts that will accelerate the formation of excessive amounts of hydrogen sulfide in the sanitary sewer, inhibit sampling efforts, endanger wastewater treatment facility personnel, or inhibit biological activity in the wastewater treatment facilities. A discharge of wastewater in excess of 60°C (140°F) may be prohibited by the Director. In no case shall a discharge of wastewater cause the temperature of the influent to the wastewater treatment facility to exceed 40°C (104°F); 
(6)  Contain any type of oils, fat, or grease that may cause or contribute to the obstruction of the flow in sewers or that may cause or contribute to interference with the operation or performance of, or pass-through, the wastewater facilities; and, at the discretion of the Director, water or wastes containing fats, wax, grease, or oils regardless of origin, and whether emulsified or not, in excess of 100 mg/L, as determined using methods specified by 40 CFR 136; 
(7)  Contain materials that may result in the presence of toxic gases, vapors, or fumes within the wastewater facilities or that may cause acute worker health and safety problems or that may cause violations of applicable occupational health and safety regulations; 
(8)  Trucked or hauled pollutants, including septage and industrial waste, unless authorized by the Director, and at discharge points designated by the Director; 
(9)  Noxious or malodorous liquids, gases, solids, or other wastewater that, either singly or by interaction with other wastes, are sufficient to create a public nuisance or a hazard to life, or to prevent entry into the sewers for maintenance or repair; 
(10)  Contain any odor or color producing substances exceeding concentration limits or other applicable standards that are established by the Director for the purposes of meeting the city's NPDES permit; 
(11)  Contain radioactive wastes in quantities prohibited by applicable state and federal regulations, or that, in the determination of the Director, will interfere with operation of the wastewater facility, or the safety of the workers or public, or the marketability or safety of sewage sludge and biosolids; 
(12)  Any runoff from roof, foundation, areaway, parking lot, roadway, or other surface water or groundwater or non-contact cooling water. The Director may approve the discharge of such water only when he determines that the quantity and quality of the discharge will not unreasonably burden the capabilities of the wastewater facility and no alternate method of disposal or reuse is reasonably available, or to mitigate an environmental risk or health hazard. All such approved discharges shall be flow measured by the discharger, using a measuring device or other method approved by the Director, and shall be subject to the city's applicable schedules of sewer rates and charges; 
(13)  Any sludges, screenings, or other residues from the pretreatment of industrial or commercial wastes or from industrial or commercial processes, except as authorized by the Director; 
(14)  Wastewater causing, alone or in conjunction with other sources, the treatment plant's effluent to fail a toxicity test; 
(15)  Detergents, surface-active agents, or other substances in amounts that cause excessive foaming in the POTW, as determined by the Director; 
(16)  Any liquid, solids, or gases that by reason of their nature or quantity are, or may be, sufficient either alone or by interaction with other substances to cause fire or explosion or be injurious in any other way to the POTW or to the operation of the POTW. At no time shall two successive readings on an explosion meter, at the point of discharge into the system (or at any point in the system), be more than five percent nor any single reading over ten percent of the lower explosive limit (LEL) of the meter; 
(17)  Animal guts or tissues, paunch manure, bones, hair, hides or fleshings, entrails, whole blood, feathers, ashes, cinders, sand, stone or marble dusts, metal, glass, straw, shavings, grass clippings, rags, waste paper, wood, plastics, gas, tar asphalt residues, residues from refining or processing of fuel or lubricating oil, mud, or glass grinding or polishing wastes, or any garbage that has not been properly shredded, except as specifically authorized by the Director; 
(18)  Cause the city to violate any limits in the city's NPDES permit, or any requirement of the permit, or otherwise pass-through or interfere with the city's wastewater treatment facility, or significantly contribute to any such violation, pass-through, or interference; 
(19)  The contents of any tank or other vessel owned or used by any person in the business of collecting or pumping sewage, effluent, septage, or other wastewater unless said person has first obtained testing and approval as may be generally required by the City of Dayton and paid all fees assessed for the privilege of said discharge; 
(20)  Contain polychlorinated biphenyls, or isomers thereof, in any quantity or concentration above method detection limits delineated in 40 CFR Part 136 or that are detected by any other method; 
(21)  Any hazardous or dangerous wastes as defined in rules published by the State of Ohio (ORC 3734/3745) and/or in EPA rules 40 CFR Part 261; 
(22)  Persistent pesticides and/or pesticides regulated by the Federal Insecticide Fungicide Rodenticide Act (FIFRA); 
(23)  Any slug load; or 
(24)  Cause the city's effluent or residues, biosolids, sludges, grit, or scums, to be unsuitable for reclamation and reuse or interferes with the sludge, grit, and scum disposal practices. 
(C)  Pollutants, substances, or wastewater prohibited by this section shall not be processed or stored in such a manner that they are likely to be discharged to the POTW unless the user has in place a spill prevention control and containment (SPCC) plan/slug control plan that has been reviewed and approved by the Director. 
(D)  Any removal of manhole lids, or other access to the wastewater facilities for the purpose of discharging wastes at times and/or locations other than those designated by the Director, or without the expressed permission of the Director, shall be considered a violation and shall be subject to enforcement action including assessments and/or penalties. 
III.  Federal Categorical Pretreatment Standards. The National Categorical Pretreatment Standards found at 40 CFR Chapter I, Subchapter N, Parts 405-471 are incorporated herein by reference as if set forth in full in this chapter. 
(A)  Where a categorical pretreatment standard is expressed only in terms of either the mass or the concentration of a pollutant in wastewater, the Director may impose equivalent concentration or mass limits in accordance with 40 CFR 403.6(c)(5) for equivalent mass-based limits or 40 CFR 403.6(c)(6) for equivalent concentration-based limits. 
(B)  When wastewater subject to a categorical pretreatment standard is mixed with wastewater not regulated by the same standard, the Director shall impose an alternate limit using the combined wastestream formula in 40 CFR 403.6(e). 
(C)  A user may obtain a variance from a categorical pretreatment standard if the user can prove, pursuant to the procedural and substantive provisions in 40 CFR 403.13, that factors relating to its discharge are fundamentally different from the factors considered by EPA when developing the categorical pretreatment standard. 
(D)  A user may obtain a net gross adjustment to a categorical standard in accordance with 40 CFR 403.15. 
IV.  State Requirements. State requirements and limitations on discharges to the POTW shall be met by all users that are subject to such standards in any instance in which they are more stringent than federal requirements and limitations, or those in this chapter or other applicable laws. 
V.  Local Limits. 
(A)  The Director shall, from time to time, adopt, revise, or rescind local limits based upon the exercise of scientific and technical discretion as he or she deems appropriate to prevent pass-through; interference; accumulation of pollutants in the wastewater treatment sludge or biosolids; or detriment to worker health and safety. All persons discharging to wastewater facilities owned by or under the jurisdiction of the City of Dayton shall meet the applicable local limits as developed by the Director and set forth in the document "Local Limits for the Discharge of Wastewater under the Industrial Pretreatment Program, Division of Wastewater Treatment, City of Dayton," unless otherwise authorized under the provisions of this chapter. The Director shall give written notice of any new, revised, or rescinded local limits to each Significant Industrial User known to be affected by the limit and shall publish notice of the new or revised local limits in a newspaper of general circulation at least 30 days prior to the effective date of the new or revised local limits. Prior to the effective date of such new or revised local limits, the limits previously established by ordinance or the Director shall remain in effect. 
(B)  Users that are required to also meet a federal categorical pretreatment standard shall meet the stricter between the local limit and the federal categorical pretreatment standards referred to in subsection III of this section. 
(C)  BMPs may be developed as a local limit and must also be incorporated in the Industrial Wastewater Discharge Permit or applicable control document. 
VI.  City's Right of Revision. The Director reserves the right to establish, by ordinance or in wastewater discharge permits, more stringent standards or requirements on discharges to the POTW. Additionally, by the authority granted by CFR Part 403.7, the Director may apply for and obtain authorization from the EPA to revise discharge limitations for those substances listed in the federal categorical pretreatment standards for which consistent removal occurs in the wastewater treatment facilities. 
VII.  Special Agreement. The Director reserves the right to enter into special agreements with users setting out special terms under which they may discharge to the POTW. In no case will a special agreement waive compliance with a categorical pretreatment standard or federal pretreatment requirement. However, the user may request a net gross adjustment to a categorical standard in accordance with 40 CFR 403.15. They may also request a variance from the categorical pretreatment standard from the Approval Authority in accordance with 403.13. 
VIII.  Dilution. A user shall not increase the use of process water to avoid or reduce the assessment of an extra-strength surcharge, or in any way attempt to dilute a discharge, as a partial or complete substitute for adequate treatment to achieve compliance with an applicable pretreatment standard or requirement unless expressly authorized by an applicable pretreatment standard or requirement. The Director may impose mass limitations on users that he believes may be using dilution to meet applicable pretreatment standards or requirements, or in other cases when the imposition of mass limitations is appropriate. 
IX.  Pretreatment Facilities. 
(A)  General: Users shall provide all known, available, and reasonable methods of prevention, control, and treatment (AKART) as required to comply with this chapter and shall achieve compliance with all applicable pretreatment standards and requirements set out in this chapter within the time limitations specified by the EPA, the State, or the Director, whichever is more stringent. 
(B)  Any facilities required to pre-treat wastewater to a level acceptable to the Director shall be provided, operated, and maintained at the user's expense. 
(C)  In addition, the Director may establish Best Management Practices (BMPs) for particular groups of users. These BMPs may include, but are not limited to types or methods of pretreatment technology to be used, methods of source control, minimum maintenance requirements, dragout prevention practices, spill prevention practices, or other requirements as deemed necessary. BMPs may be developed as a local limit and if so, shall be incorporated in the Industrial Wastewater Discharge Permit or alternate control document. Industrial Users with applicable standards that require compliance with a BMP or a pollution prevention alternative shall submit documentation to determine compliance with the standard when submitting baseline or periodic compliance reports. 
(D)  Detailed plans describing such facilities and operating procedures shall be submitted to the Director for review, and shall be acceptable to the Director before such facilities are constructed. The review of such plans and operating procedures shall in no way relieve the user from the responsibility of modifying such facilities as necessary to produce a discharge acceptable to the Director under the provisions of this chapter. 
(E)  Within 90 days after the completion of the wastewater pretreatment facility, the discharger shall furnish as-built drawings and its operations and maintenance procedures. Any subsequent significant changes in the pretreatment facility or method of operation shall be reported to and approved by the Director prior to the initiation of the changes. 
(F)  New sources, and new users determined to be SIUs shall have pretreatment facilities installed and operating prior to discharge, if required. 
(G)  Dischargers who operate automatic and coin-operated laundries, car washes, filling stations, commercial garages or similar businesses having any type of washing facilities (including pressure washing and steam cleaning) or any other dischargers producing grit, sand, oils, lint, or other materials that have the potential of causing partial or complete obstruction of the building side sewer or other areas in the POTW shall, upon order of the Director, install approved interceptors, oil/water separators, or tanks in accordance with specifications adopted by the City of Dayton such that excessive amounts of oil, sand and inert solids are effectively prevented from entering the POTW. 
(H)  All pretreatment facilities, including grease interceptors, oil/water separators, settling tanks and grit traps shall be properly installed, maintained, and operated by the discharger at his or her own expense. The installation shall be kept in continuous operation at all times, and shall be maintained to provide efficient operation. Cleaning shall be performed by a service contractor qualified to perform such cleaning, or in a manner approved by the Director. All material removed shall be disposed of in accordance with all state and federal regulations. Records and certification of maintenance shall be made readily available to the Director for review and inspection, and shall be maintained for a minimum of three years. 
(I)  If a failure to maintain settling tanks, grease traps and/or interceptors, or oil/water separators results in partial or complete blockage of the building sewer, private sewer system discharging to the city Sewer System, or other parts of the city Sewer System, or adversely affects the treatment or transmission capabilities of the POTW, or requires excessive maintenance by the city, or poses a possible health hazard, the discharger responsible for the facilities shall be subject to the remedies herein, including cost recovery, enforcement, violation assessments, and penalties. 
X.  Additional Pretreatment Measures. 
(A)  Whenever deemed necessary, the Director may require users to restrict their discharge during peak flow periods, designate that certain wastewater be discharged only into specific sewers, relocate and/or consolidate points of discharge, separate sewage wastestreams from industrial wastestreams, and such other conditions as may be necessary to protect the POTW and determine the user's compliance with the requirements of this chapter. 
(B)  When determined necessary by the Director, each user discharging into the POTW, shall install and maintain, on his or her property and at his or her expense, a suitable storage and flow-control facility to insure equalization of flow. The Director may require the facility to be equipped with alarms and a rate of discharge controller, the regulation of which shall be determined by the Director. A wastewater discharge permit may be issued solely for flow equalization. 
(C)  Grease, oil, and sand interceptors shall be provided when, in the opinion of the Director, they are necessary for the proper handling of wastewater containing excessive amounts of fats, oils, and grease, or sand; except that such interceptors shall not be required for individual dwelling units or any private living quarters. All interception units shall be of type and capacity approved by the Director and shall be so located to be easily accessible for cleaning and inspection. Such interceptors shall be inspected, cleaned, and repaired regularly, as needed, by the user at his or her expense. 
(D)  Users with the potential to discharge flammable substances may be required to install and maintain an approved combustible gas detection meter. 
XI.  Deadline for Compliance with Applicable Pretreatment Requirements. 
(A)  Compliance by existing sources (categorical users) covered by Categorical Pretreatment Standards shall be within three years of the date the Standard is effective unless a shorter compliance time is specified in the appropriate Standard. The Director shall establish a final compliance deadline date for any categorical user when the local limits for said user are more restrictive than EPA's Categorical Pretreatment Standards. The Director may establish a final compliance deadline date for any existing user not covered by Categorical Pretreatment Standards. 
(B)  New source dischargers, and "new users" that are determined to be SIUs, are required to comply with applicable pretreatment standards within the shortest feasible time (not to exceed 90 days from the beginning of discharge). New Sources, and "new users" that are determined to be SIUs, shall install and have in operating condition, and shall "start-up" all pollution control equipment required to meet applicable pretreatment standards before beginning to discharge. 
(C)  Any wastewater discharge permit issued to a categorical user shall not contain a compliance date beyond any deadline date established in EPA's Categorical Pretreatment Standards. Any other existing user that is considered to be an SIU, or a categorical user that shall comply with a more stringent local limit, which is in non-compliance with any local limits shall be provided with a compliance schedule to insure compliance within the shortest time feasible. 
XII.  Accidental Discharge/Slug Control Plans. 
(A)  The Director shall evaluate whether each SIU needs an accidental discharge/slug control plan at least once during the term of each significant industrial user's Industrial Wastewater Discharge Permit or applicable control document or within one year of being identified a significant industrial user. The Director may require any user to develop and implement an accidental discharge/slug control plan. Where deemed necessary by the Director, facilities to prevent accidental discharge or slug discharges of pollutants shall be provided and maintained at the user's cost and expense. 
(B)  A SPCC plan/slug control plan showing facilities and operating procedures to provide this protection shall be submitted to the Director for review and approval before implementation. The Director shall determine which user is required to develop a plan and require said plan to be submitted within 90 days after notification by the Director. Each user shall implement its SPCC as submitted or as modified after such plan has been reviewed and approved by the Director. Review and approval of such plans and operating procedures by the Director shall not relieve the user from the responsibility to modify and operate its facility as necessary to meet the requirements of this section. Each industrial user required to implement a SPCC plan/slug control plan shall notify the city of any significant changes to the user's operations or systems that might alter the nature, quality, or volume of its wastewater at least 90 days prior to the change. 
(C)  Any user required to develop and implement an accidental discharge/slug control plan shall submit a plan that addresses, at a minimum, the following: 
(1)  Description of discharge practices, including non-routine batch discharges; 
(2)  Description of stored chemicals; 
(3)  Procedures for immediately notifying the POTW of any accidental or slug discharge. Such notification shall also be given for any discharge that would violate any of the standards in §§ 52.03 II through V; and 
(4)  Procedures to prevent adverse impact from any accidental or slug discharge. Such procedures include, but are not limited to, inspection and maintenance of storage areas, handling and transfer of materials, loading and unloading operations, control of plant site runoff, worker training, building of containment structures or equipment, measures for containing toxic organic pollutants (including solvents), and/or measures and equipment for emergency response. 
(D)  Users shall notify the Director immediately upon the occurrence of a "slug" or "accidental discharge" of substances regulated by this chapter. Users shall notify the Manager of the city's Division of Wastewater Treatment, or the supervisor on duty at the wastewater treatment facility by telephone immediately upon the occurrence of a slug load or accidental discharge, or bypass of substances prohibited or limited by this chapter. The notification shall include location of discharge, date and time thereof, type of waste, concentration and volume, and corrective actions. Any affected user shall be liable for any expense, loss, or damage to the POTW, in addition to the amount of any assessments or penalties imposed on the city on account thereof under state or federal law. 
(E)  Within five days following an accidental discharge, the user shall submit to the Director a detailed written report describing the cause of the discharge and the measures to be taken by the user to prevent similar future occurrences. The user shall document and maintain sufficient records so as to reflect fairly and accurately any such discharge, including, but not limited to, bypasses of pretreatment facilities. Such notification shall not relieve the user of any expense, loss, damage, or other liability that may be incurred as a result of damage to the POTW, fish kills, or any other damage to person or property; nor shall such notification relieve the user of any assessments, civil penalties, or other liability that may be imposed by this chapter or other applicable law. 
(F)  Signs shall be permanently posted in conspicuous places on the user's premises advising employees whom to call in the event of a slug or accidental discharge. Employers shall instruct all employees who may cause or discover such a discharge with respect to emergency notification procedures. 
XIII.  Hauled Wastewater. 
(A)  Industrial and/or commercial wastes, and by-products and other materials originating from industrial and/or commercial operations outside the City of Dayton and the City of Dayton contract service areas shall not be discharged in any form into the wastewater facilities or storm sewer. Written exceptions to this provision may be made by the Director. 
(B)  No person shall access the wastewater facilities for any activity including discharge of hauled septic, industrial, or other wastes except at locations and at times as designated by the Director. Any removal of manhole lids or other access to the wastewater facilities for the purpose of discharging wastes at times and/or locations other than those designated by the Director, or without the expressed permission of the Director, shall be considered a violation and shall be subject to enforcement action including assessments and/or penalties.

Sec. 52.04. - Wastewater discharge permit requirements. 
(A)  The Director may require any user to complete and submit to the city an Industrial User's Survey providing information needed by the Director to properly regulate the business, including, but not limited to, the nature of the business, water use, wastewater quantity and characteristics, and potential for pollutants to enter the city's wastewater facilities. 
(B)  No significant industrial user shall discharge wastewater into the POTW without first obtaining a wastewater discharge permit from the Director, except that a significant industrial user that has filed a timely application pursuant to § 52.04 I may continue to discharge for the time period specified therein. Any violation of the terms and conditions of a wastewater discharge permit shall be deemed a violation of this chapter and subjects the wastewater discharge permittee to the sanctions set out in this chapter. Obtaining a wastewater discharge permit does not relieve a permittee of its obligation to comply with all Federal and State pretreatment standards or requirements or with any other requirements of Federal, State, and local law. 
(C)  The Director may require other users to obtain wastewater discharge permits (as necessary) to carry out the purposes of this chapter. 
(E)  General Control Mechanisms may be issued for groups of users, including both significant and non-significant industrial users that have substantially similar types of operations; discharge the same types of wastes; require the same effluent limitations; and require the same or similar monitoring. 
(1)  General Control Mechanisms are not available to industrial users: 
(a)  Subject to production-based categorical pretreatment standards; 
(b)  Who have categorical pretreatment standards expressed as mass of pollutant discharged per day; or 
(c)  Whose limits are based on the combined wastestream formula or net/gross calculations. 
(2)  To be covered by a General Control Mechanism, the significant industrial user is required to file a written request to the POTW for coverage that identifies; contact information; production processes; types of wastes generated; location for monitoring all wastes to be covered by the General Control Mechanism; any requests for a monitoring waiver for any pollutants not present; and any other information the POTW deems appropriate. 
I.  Wastewater Discharge Permitting: Existing SIU. 
(A)  Any SIU that was discharging wastewater into the POTW prior to the effective date of this chapter and that wishes to continue such discharges in the future shall, within 60 days after notification by the Director submit a permit application to the city in accordance with § 52.04 V, and shall not cause or allow discharges to the POTW to continue after 90 days of the effective date of this chapter except in accordance with a wastewater discharge permit issued by the Director. 
(B)  The Director's notification to SIUs covered by categorical pretreatment standards will be in reasonable time to insure that the SIUs comply with the 180-day submittal deadline date established in 40 CFR § 403.12(b). 
II.  Wastewater Discharge Permitting: New Source and "New User." At least 90 days prior to the anticipated start-up, new sources, sources that become a user subsequent to the promulgation of an applicable categorical pretreatment standard, and "new users" that are determined to be SIUs, shall apply for a wastewater discharge permit and will be required to submit to the Director at least the information listed in paragraphs (A)-(E) of § 52.04 V. A new source, or "new user" that is determined to be a SIU, cannot discharge without first receiving a wastewater discharge permit from the Director. New sources, and "new users" that are determined to be SIUs, shall also be required to include in their application information on the method of pretreatment the user intends to use to meet applicable pretreatment standards. New Sources, and "new users" that are determined to be SIUs, shall give estimates of the information requested in paragraphs (D) and (E) of § 52.04 V. 
III.  Wastewater Discharge Permitting: Extra-jurisdictional Users. 
(A)  Any existing user located beyond the city limits required to obtain a wastewater discharge permit shall submit a wastewater discharge permit application as outlined in § 52.04 I. 
(B)  New Source, and "new users" that are determined to be SIUs, located beyond the city limits required to obtain a wastewater discharge permit shall comply with § 52.04 II. 
IV.  Wastewater Discharge Permitting: Zero Discharge Permits. Any SIU that operates its regulated processes so that no industrial waste is discharged to the POTW may request that a zero discharge permit (ZDP) be issued by the Director. To be eligible for a ZDP the user shall demonstrate to the Director's satisfaction that no Categorical or otherwise regulated industrial waste will be discharged and shall either permanently seal all accesses to the POTW other than those required for disposal of domestic sewage or install shutoff devices that will accept city-installed, tamper evident seals or locks. Breaking this seal or lock without prior authorization by the Director shall be a violation of the ZDP and this chapter. 
V.  Wastewater Discharge Permit Application Contents. All users required to obtain a wastewater discharge permit shall submit, at a minimum, the following information. The Director shall approve a form to be used as a permit application. Categorical users submitting the following information shall have complied with 40 CFR 403.12(b).

A user, required to have a wastewater discharge permit, shall apply for wastewater discharge permit re-issuance by submitting a complete wastewater discharge permit application, in accordance with § 52.04 V, a minimum of 90 days prior to the expiration of the user's existing wastewater discharge permit. A user, whose existing wastewater discharge permit has expired and has submitted its re-application in the time period specified herein, may continue to lawfully operate under the terms and conditions of the expired permit until the Director issues or denies the new wastewater discharge permit. A user, whose existing wastewater discharge permit has expired and who failed to submit its re-application in the time period specified herein, will be deemed to be discharging without a wastewater discharge permit. 
(Ord. 30739-08, passed 4-23-08) 
Sec. 52.05. - Reporting requirements. 
I.  Baseline Monitoring Report. 
(A)  Within either 180 days after the effective date of a categorical pretreatment standard, or the final administrative decision on a category determination under 40 CFR 403.6(a)(4) (whichever is later) existing categorical users currently discharging to or scheduled to discharge to the POTW, shall be required to submit to the Director a report that contains the information listed in § 52.04 V. 
(B)  At least 90 days prior to commencement of their discharge, new sources, and sources that become categorical users subsequent to the promulgation of an applicable categorical standard, shall be required to submit to the Director a report that contains the information listed in § 52.04 V. 
(C)  A new source shall report the method of pretreatment it intends to use to meet applicable categorical standards. A new source shall also give estimates of its anticipated flow and quantity of pollutants discharged. The sampling requirements for Initial Compliance Reports are equivalent to the sampling requirements for the Baseline Monitoring Report. 
II.  Reports on Compliance with Categorical Pretreatment Standard Deadline (90-Day Compliance Report). 
(A)  Within 90 days following the date for final compliance by the CIU with applicable pretreatment standards and requirements set forth in this chapter, in a wastewater discharge permit, the affected user shall submit to the Director a report containing the information outlined in paragraphs (D)-(F) of § 52.04 V. 
(B)  For users subject to equivalent mass or concentration limits established by the Director in accordance with procedures established in 40 CFR 403.6(c), this report shall contain a reasonable measure of the user's long term production rate. For all other users subject to categorical pretreatment standards expressed in terms of allowable pollutant discharge per unit of production (or other measure of operation), this report shall include the user's actual production during the appropriate sampling period. All compliance reports shall be signed and certified in accordance with § 52.04 VI. 
III.  Periodic Report on Continued Compliance (Discharge Monitoring Report). 
(A)  Any user that is required to have an industrial waste discharge permit and performs self-monitoring shall submit to the Director during the months of June and December, unless required on other dates or more frequently by the Director, a report indicating the nature of the effluent over the previous reporting period. The frequency of monitoring shall be as prescribed within the industrial waste discharge permit. All users, except for zero discharge users, shall sample their discharge at least twice per year. 
(B)  The report shall include a record of the concentrations (and mass if specified in the wastewater discharge permit) of the pollutants listed in the wastewater discharge permit that were measured and a record of all flow measurements (average and maximum) taken at the designated sampling locations, and shall also include any additional information required by this chapter or the wastewater discharge permit. Production data shall be reported if required by the wastewater discharge permit. Both daily maximum and average concentration (or mass, where required) shall be reported. All discharge monitoring reports shall be signed and certified in accordance with § 52.04 VI. 
(C)  If sampling and analyses are performed more frequently than required for any parameters required by the user's Industrial Wastewater Permit, using test procedures prescribed by 40 CFR Part 136 or amendments thereto, or otherwise approved by EPA or as specified in the user's Permit, at the designated sample location(s) - then the results shall be reported to the Director. 
(D)  Any user subject to equivalent mass or concentration limits established by the Director or by unit production limits specified in the applicable categorical standards, shall report production data as outlined in § 52.05 II(B). 
(E)  Zero discharge users shall submit periodic reports as required by the Director stating that no Categorical or otherwise regulated industrial waste has been discharged to the POTW. 
(F)  If the Director calculated limits to factor out dilution flows or non-regulated flows, the user will be responsible for providing flows from the regulated process flows, dilution flows and non-regulated flows. 
(G)  Flows shall be reported on the basis of actual measurement; provided, however, that the Director may accept reports of average and maximum flows estimated by verifiable techniques if the Director determines that an actual measurement is not feasible. 
(H)  Sampling shall be representative of the user's daily operations and shall be taken in accordance with the requirements specified in § 52.06. Wastewater monitoring and flow measurement facilities shall be properly operated, kept clean, and maintained in good working order at all times. The failure of a user to keep its monitoring facility in good working order shall not be grounds for the user to claim that sample results are unrepresentative of its discharge. 
(I)  The Director may require reporting by users that are not required to have an industrial wastewater discharge permit if information or data is needed to establish a sewer charge, determine the treatability of the effluent or determine any other factor that is related to the operation and maintenance of the sewer system. 
(J)  The Director may require self-monitoring by the user or, if requested by the user, may agree to perform the periodic compliance monitoring needed to prepare the periodic compliance report required under this section. If the Director agrees to perform such periodic compliance monitoring, it may charge the user for such monitoring, based upon the costs incurred by the city for the sampling and analyses. Any such charges shall be added to the normal sewer charge and shall be payable as part of the utility bills. The Director is under no obligation to perform periodic compliance monitoring for a user. 
(K)  The Director shall require reporting by users with applicable standards that require compliance with a BMP or a pollution prevention alternative to provide documentation to determine compliance with the standard when submitting their Periodic Report on Continued Compliance. 
IV.  Compliance Schedules for Meeting Pretreatment Standards. If additional pretreatment and/or O & M will be required to meet the Pretreatment Standards, the shortest schedule by which the Industrial User will provide such additional pretreatment and/or O & M shall be established. The completion date in this schedule shall not be later than the compliance date established for the applicable Pretreatment Standard. 
(A)  The schedule shall contain increments of progress in the form of dates for the commencement and completion of major events leading to the construction and operation of additional pretreatment required for the user to meet the applicable pretreatment standards (e.g., hiring an engineer, completing preliminary plans, completing final plans, executing contract for major components, commencing construction, completing construction, etc.). 
(B)  No increment referred to in paragraph (A) of this section shall exceed nine months. 
(C)  Not later than 14 days following each date in the schedule and the final date for compliance, the user shall submit a progress report to the Director including, at a minimum, whether or not it complied with the increment of progress to be met on such date and, if not, the date on which it expects to comply with this increment of progress, the reason for delay, and the steps being taken by the user to return the construction to the schedule established. In no event shall more than nine months elapse between such progress reports. 
V.  Notification of Significant Production Changes. Any user operating under a wastewater discharge permit incorporating mass or concentration limits based on production levels shall notify the Director within two business days after the user has a reasonable basis to know that the production level will significantly change within the next calendar month. Any user not providing a notice of such anticipated change will be required to comply with the existing limits contained in its wastewater discharge permit. 
VI.  Hazardous Waste Notification. 
(A)  Any user that is discharging 15 kilograms of hazardous wastes as defined in 40 CFR 261 (listed or characteristic wastes) in a calendar month or any facility discharging any amount of acutely hazardous wastes as specified in 40 CFR 261.30(d) and 261.33(e) is required to provide a one time notification in writing to the city, EPA, and OEPA. Any existing user exempt from this notification shall comply with the requirements contained herein within 30 days of becoming aware of a discharge of 15 kilograms of hazardous wastes in a calendar month or the discharge of acutely hazardous wastes to the city sewer system. 
(B)  Such notification shall include: 
(1)  The name of the hazardous waste as set forth in 40 CFR Part 261; 
(2)  The EPA Hazardous waste number; and 
(3)  The type of discharge (continuous, batch, or other). 
(C)  If an industrial user discharges more than 100 kilograms of such waste per calendar month to the sewer system, the notification shall also contain the following information to the extent it is known or readily available to the industrial user: 
(1)  An identification of the hazardous constituents contained in the wastes; 
(2)  An estimation of the mass and concentration of such constituents in the wastestreams discharged during that calendar month; and 
(3)  An estimation of the mass of constituents in the wastestreams expected to be discharged during the following 12 months. 
(D)  These notification requirements do not apply to pollutants already reported under the self-monitoring requirements. 
(E)  Whenever the EPA publishes final rules identifying additional hazardous wastes or new characteristics of hazardous waste, a user shall notify the Director of the discharge of such a substance within 90 days of the effective date of such regulations. 
(F)  In the case of any notification made under this paragraph, an industrial user shall certify that it has a program in place to reduce the volume and toxicity of hazardous wastes generated to the degree it has determined to be economically practical. Discharging of hazardous waste to the sewer system is prohibited as per § 52.03 II. 
VII.  Report of Potential Problems (including Accidental Spills, and/or Slug Loadings). 
(A)  In the case of any discharge, including, but not limited to, accidental discharges, discharges of a non-routine, episodic nature, a non-customary batch discharge, or a slug load, that may cause potential problems for the POTW, the user shall immediately telephone and notify the Director of the incident. This notification shall include the location of the discharge, type of waste, concentration, and volume, if known, and corrective actions taken by the user. 
(B)  Within five days following such discharge, the user shall, unless waived by the Director, submit a detailed written report describing the cause(s) of the discharge and the measures to be taken by the user to prevent similar future occurrences. Such notification shall not relieve the user of any expense, loss, damage, or other liability that may be incurred as a result of damage to the POTW, natural resources, or any other damage to person or property; nor shall such notification relieve the user of any assessments, penalties, or other liability that may be imposed pursuant to this chapter. 
(C)  A report shall be permanently posted on the user's bulletin board or other prominent place advising employees who to call in the event of a discharge described in paragraph A, above. Employers shall ensure that all employees, who may cause such a discharge to occur, are advised of the emergency notification procedure. 
VIII.  Non-Compliance Reporting. 
(A)  Industrial users shall submit such additional reports as the Director shall require. 
(B)  If sampling performed by a user indicates a violation, the user shall notify the Director within 24 hours of becoming aware of the violation. The user shall also repeat the sampling within five days and submit the results of the repeat analysis to the Director within 30 days after becoming aware of the violation, except the user is not required to resample if: 
(1)  The Director performs sampling at the user at a frequency of at least once per month; or, 
(2)  The Director performs sampling at the user between the time when the user performs its initial sampling and the time when the user receives the results of this sampling. 
IX.  Notification of Changed Discharge. 
(A)  Each user shall notify the Director of any planned significant changes to the user's operations or system that might alter the nature, quality, or volume of its wastewater at least 90 days before the change. 
(B)  The Director may require the user to submit such information as may be deemed necessary to evaluate the changed condition, including the submission of a wastewater discharge permit application under § 52.04 V. 
(C)  The Director may issue a wastewater discharge permit under § 52.04 VII or modify an existing wastewater discharge permit under § 52.04 XI in response to changed conditions or anticipated changed conditions. 
(D)  For purposes of this requirement, significant changes include, but are not limited to, flow changes of 20 percent or greater, and the discharge of any previously unreported pollutants. 
X.  Total Toxic Organics (TTO) Reporting. 
(A)  Categorical users that are required by EPA to eliminate and/or reduce the levels of total toxic organics (TTOs) discharged into the sewer system shall follow the Categorical Pretreatment Standards for that industry. Those users shall also meet the following requirements: 
(1)  Shall sample, as part of the initial application requirements, for the organics listed under the TTO limit reasonably expected to be present; 
(2)  May submit a statement that no TTOs are used at the facility and/or develop a toxic organic management plan (TOMP) in lieu of continuously monitoring for TTOs, if authorized by the Director: 
(B)  If allowed to submit a statement or develop a TOMP, the user shall routinely submit a certification statement as part of its self-monitoring report that there has been no dumping of concentrated toxic organics into the wastewater and that it is implementing a TOMP as approved by the Director. The Director may require the development and implementation of a TOMP in addition to monitoring for TTOs. 
XI.  Reports from Unpermitted Users. All users not required to obtain a wastewater discharge permit shall provide appropriate reports to the city as the Director may require. 
XII.  Record Keeping. Users subject to the reporting requirements of this chapter shall retain, and make available for inspection and copying, all records of information obtained pursuant to any monitoring activities required by this chapter and any additional records of information obtained pursuant to monitoring activities undertaken by the user independent of such requirements. Records shall include the date, exact place, method, and time of sampling and the name of the person(s) taking the samples; the dates analyses were performed; who performed the analyses; the analytical techniques or methods used; and the results of such analyses. These records shall remain available for a period of at least three years. This period shall be automatically extended for the duration of any litigation concerning the user or POTW, or where the user has been specifically notified of a longer retention period by the Director. 
XIII.  Timing. Written reports will be deemed to have been submitted on the date postmarked. For reports that are not mailed, postage prepaid, into a mail facility serviced by the United States Postal Service, the date of receipt of the report shall govern. Reports received via facsimile (fax) will be credited as having been received on the date that the fax was successfully received by the POTW. Proof of successful transmission is the responsibility of the sending party. The original document shall be submitted to the Director as soon as possible after the fax transmission. 
XIV.  Falsifying Information. No person shall knowingly make any false statement, representation or certification in any application, record, report, plan, or other document filed or required to be maintained pursuant to this chapter, or falsify, tamper with, or knowingly render inaccurate any monitoring device or method used to determine compliance or extra-strength surcharge. 
(Ord. 30739-08, passed 4-23-08) 
Sec. 52.06. - Sampling and analytical requirements. 
I.  Sampling Requirements for Users. 
(A)  For Baseline Monitoring and 90-Day Compliance Reporting purposes, a minimum of four grab samples shall be used for pH, cyanide, total phenols, oil and grease, sulfide, and/or volatile organics. For Periodic Report on Continued Compliance reporting purposes, single grab samples shall be used for pH, hexavalent chromium, cyanide, total phenols, oil and grease, sulfide, and/or volatile organics. Except for those pollutants that are required to be measured by grab samples (referenced above), all other pollutants will be measured by flow-proportional sampling unless justification for an alternate sampling type, representative of the discharge, is documented in the industrial user file. Multiple grab samples collected during a 24-hour period may be composited prior to the analysis as follows: for hexavalent chromium, cyanide, total phenols, and sulfides the samples may be composited in the laboratory or in the field; for volatile organics and oil & grease, the samples may be composited in the laboratory. Protocols (including appropriate preservation) specified in 40 CFR 136 and appropriate U.S. EPA guidance must be followed. For all other pollutants, 24-hour composite samples shall be obtained through flow-proportional composite sampling techniques. The city may require an industrial user to install flow monitoring facilities, instruments, and recording devices to enable accurate measurement of flows as determined to be necessary. The Director may waive flow-proportional composite sampling for any user that demonstrates that flow-proportional is not feasible. In such cases, samples may be obtained through time-proportional composite sampling techniques or through a minimum of four grab samples where the user demonstrates that this will provide a representative sample of the effluent being discharged. Industrial Users with applicable standards that require compliance with a BMP or a pollution prevention alternative shall submit documentation to determine compliance with the standard when submitting baseline or periodic compliance reports. 
(B)  Samples should be taken immediately downstream from pretreatment facilities if such exist or immediately downstream from the regulated or manufacturing process if no pretreatment exists or as determined by the Director and/or contained in the user's wastewater discharge permit. For categorical users, if other wastewaters are mixed with the regulated wastewater prior to pretreatment the user shall measure the flows and concentrations necessary to allow use of the combined wastestream formula of 40 CFR 403.6(e) in order to evaluate compliance with the Applicable Categorical Pretreatment Standards. For other SIUs, for which the city has adjusted its local limits to factor out dilution flows, the user shall measure the flows and concentrations necessary to evaluate compliance with the adjusted pretreatment standard(s). 
(C)  All sample results shall indicate the time, date and place of sampling, and methods of analysis, and shall certify that such sampling and analysis is representative of normal work cycles and expected pollutant discharges from the user. If sampling and analyses are performed more frequently than required for any parameters required by the user's Industrial Waste Permit, using test procedures prescribed by 40 CFR Part 136 or amendments thereto, or otherwise approved by EPA or as specified in the user's Permit, at the designated sample location(s) - then the results shall be reported to the Director. 
(D)  If a violation is detected through sampling and analysis conducted by the city in lieu of the industrial user, the city shall perform the repeat sampling and analysis within 30 days of becoming aware of the violation. The city may notify the industrial user of the violation and may require the industrial user to perform the repeat sampling and analysis. 
II.  Analytical Requirements. 
(A)  All pollutant analyses, including sampling techniques, shall be performed in accordance with the techniques prescribed in 40 CFR Part 136, unless otherwise specified in an applicable categorical pretreatment standard. If 40 CFR Part 136 does not contain sampling or analytical techniques for the pollutant in question, sampling and analyses shall be performed in accordance with procedures approved by the Director. Sampling methods, locations, times, duration, and frequencies are to be determined on an individual basis subject to approval by the Director. Users cannot use samples taken by the city to fulfill self-monitoring requirements. 
(B)  When self-monitoring analyses are required of a user, the user may, upon approval of the Director, make arrangements with a laboratory, including that of the user, to perform such analyses. The measurements, tests, and analyses of the characteristics of wastewater required by this chapter shall be performed by a laboratory acceptable to the Director. 
III.  City Monitoring of User's Wastewater. The Director will follow the same procedures as outlined in §§ 52.06 I and II. 
(A)  The owner or occupant of any property serviced by a building sewer carrying industrial user wastewater discharges shall provide suitable access to the Director, and where deemed necessary by the Director, such meters, equipment and appurtenances in the building sewer to facilitate observation, sampling, and measurement of the wastewater. Such access shall be in a secure, readily and safely accessible location and shall be provided in accordance with plans approved by the Director. The access shall be provided and maintained at the owner's expense so as to be safe and accessible at reasonable times. 
(B)  The Director shall consider such factors as the volume and strength of discharge, rate of discharge, quantities of toxic materials in the discharge, wastewater treatment facility removal capabilities, and cost effectiveness in determining whether or not access and equipment for monitoring industrial user wastewater discharges shall be required. The Director may dispense with discharge monitoring done for the sole purpose of determining wastewater surcharges when, in his or her sole discretion, he determines that such monitoring will not be cost effective. 
(Ord. 30739-08, passed 4-23-08) 
Sec. 52.07. - Compliance monitoring. 
I.  Inspection and Sampling. Continued connection and use of the City of Dayton sewer system shall be contingent upon the right of the Director to inspect and sample all discharges into the system. The Director, bearing proper identification, shall have the right to enter the facilities of any user for the purpose of the enforcement of this chapter, and to determine that any wastewater discharge permit or order issued hereunder, is being met and whether the user is complying with all requirements thereof. Users shall allow the Director ready access to all parts of the premises, including easements, for the purposes of inspection, sampling, records examination and copying, and the performance of any additional duties. 
(A)  Where a user has security measures in force that require proper identification and clearance before entry into its premises, the user shall make necessary arrangements with its security guards so that, upon presentation of suitable identification, the Director will be permitted to enter without delay for the purposes of performing specific responsibilities. 
(B)  The Director shall have the right to set up on the user's property, or require installation of such devices as are necessary to conduct sampling and/or metering of the user's operations. 
(C)  Any temporary or permanent obstruction to safe and easy access to the facility to be inspected and/or sampled shall be promptly removed by the user at the written or verbal request of the Director and shall not be replaced. The costs of clearing such access shall be borne by the user. 
(D)  Unreasonable delays in allowing the Director access to the user's premises shall be a violation of this chapter. 
(E)  While performing the necessary work on private properties referred to in this section, the Director shall observe all safety rules established by the owner or occupant of the property and applicable to the premises. 
(F)  During the performance on private properties of inspections, wastewater sampling; or other similar operations referred to in this section, the owner or occupant shall be indemnified against loss of or damage to property of the owner or occupant by the Director, except as such may be caused by negligence or failure of the owner or occupant to maintain safe conditions as required by § 52.07 II. 
(G)  No person shall assault, abuse, harass, or otherwise interfere with the Director's performance of any activity authorized by this chapter. 
II.  Monitoring Facilities/Control Manholes. 
(A)  Each user shall provide and operate at its own expense a secure, readily and safely accessible monitoring facility or control manhole to allow inspection, sampling, and flow measurements of each sewer discharge to the city. Each monitoring facility or control manhole shall be situated on the user's premises, except where such a location would be impractical or cause undue hardship on the user, the Director may concur with the facility or manhole being constructed in the public street or sidewalk area, providing that the facility is located so that it will not be obstructed by landscaping or parked vehicles. The Director, whenever applicable, may require the construction and maintenance of monitoring facilities or control manholes at other locations (for example, at the end of a manufacturing line, wastewater treatment system). 
(B)  There shall be ample room in or near such monitoring facility or control manhole to allow accurate sampling, flow measurement and preparation of samples for analysis. The facility, sampling, and measuring equipment shall be maintained at all times in a safe and proper operating condition at the expense of the user. All monitoring facilities or control manholes shall be constructed and maintained in accordance with all applicable local construction standards and specifications. 
(C)  The Director may require the user to install monitoring equipment as necessary. All devices used to measure wastewater flow and quality shall be calibrated to ensure their accuracy. 
(D)  Monitoring of wastewater characteristics for any purpose shall be conducted at a frequency deemed necessary by the Director. 
III.  Search Warrants. If the Director has been refused access to a building, structure or property, or any part thereof, and is able to demonstrate probable cause to believe that there may be a violation of this chapter, or that there is a need to inspect as part of a routine inspection program of the city designed to verify compliance with this chapter or any wastewater discharge permit or order issued hereunder, or to protect the overall public health, safety and welfare of the community, then the Director shall seek issuance of a search and/or seizure warrant from the City of Dayton Municipal Court, the Montgomery County Common Pleas Court, or the U.S. Federal District Court. Such warrant shall be served at reasonable hours by the Director and may be accomplished in the company of a uniformed police officer that has jurisdiction. 
IV.  Vandalism. No person shall willfully or negligently break, damage, destroy, uncover, deface, tamper with, or prevent access to any structure, appurtenance or equipment, or other part of the POTW. Any person found in violation of this requirement shall be subject to the sanctions set out in this chapter. 
(Ord. 30739-08, passed 4-23-08) 
Sec. 52.08. - Confidential information. 
    Information and data on a user obtained from reports, surveys, wastewater discharge permit applications, wastewater discharge permits, and monitoring programs, and from city inspection and sampling activities, shall be available to the public without restriction, unless the user specifically requests, and is able to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Director, that the release of such information would divulge information, processes or methods of production entitled to protection as trade secrets under applicable State law. 
    When requested and demonstrated by the user furnishing a report that such information should be held confidential, the Director shall make reasonable efforts as permitted by law to protect the portions of a report that might disclose trade secrets or secret processes from inspection by the public, but shall be made available immediately upon request to governmental agencies for uses related to the NPDES program or pretreatment program, and in enforcement proceedings involving the person furnishing the report. 
    Wastewater constituents and characteristics and other "effluent data" as defined by 40 CFR 2.302 will not be recognized as confidential information and will be available to the public without restriction. 
(Ord. 30739-08, passed 4-23-08) 
Sec. 52.09. - Publication of users in significant non-compliance. 
    The Director shall publish annually, in the largest daily newspaper published in the municipality where the POTW is located, a list of the users that, during the previous 12 months, were in significant non-compliance with applicable pretreatment standards and requirements. The term significant non-compliance shall mean: 
(A)  Chronic violations of wastewater discharge limits by Significant Industrial Users at each permitted monitoring point, defined here as those in which 66 percent or more of wastewater measurements, including violations to instantaneous limits, taken during a six-month period exceed the daily maximum limit or average limit for the same pollutant parameter by any amount; 
(B)  Technical Review Criteria (TRC) violations by Significant Industrial Users at each permitted monitoring point, defined here as those in which 33 percent or more of wastewater measurements, including violations to instantaneous limits, taken for each pollutant parameter during a six-month period equals or exceeds the product of the daily maximum limit or the average limit multiplied by the applicable criteria [1.4 for BOD, TSS, fats, oils and grease, and 1.2 for all other pollutants except pH]; 
(C)  Any other discharge violation, including violations to instantaneous limits or narrative standards, that the Director believes has caused, alone or in combination with other discharges, interference or pass through (including endangering the health of city personnel or the general public); 
(D)  Any discharge of pollutants that has caused imminent endangerment to the public or to the environment, or has resulted in the city's exercise of its emergency authority to halt or prevent such a discharge; 
(E)  Failure to meet, within 90 days of the scheduled date, a compliance schedule milestone contained in a wastewater discharge permit or enforcement order for starting construction, completing construction, or attaining final compliance; 
(F)  Failure to provide within 45 days after the due date, any required reports, including baseline monitoring reports, reports on compliance with categorical pretreatment standard deadlines, periodic self-monitoring reports, and reports on compliance with compliance schedules; 
(G)  Failure to accurately report non-compliance; or 
(H)  Any other violation(s), including any violations of Best Management Practices or pollution prevention alternative, which the Director determines will adversely affect the operation or implementation of the city's pretreatment program. 
(Ord. 30739-08, passed 4-23-08) 
Sec. 52.10. - Administrative enforcement remedies. 
I.  Enforcement Response Plan (ERP). The Director developed an updated Enforcement Response Plan (ERP) with public participation, which was approved by the Ohio E.P.A. on December 31, 1998, and became effective January 1, 1999. The ERP is used as guidance when implementing enforcement actions to assure that users of the city's wastewater facilities comply with the provisions of this chapter. As a separate document, the ERP may be updated periodically as necessary, without necessitating a modification to this chapter. Copies of the ERP are available in the Pretreatment office, located at the Wastewater Treatment Facility. 
II.  Notice of Violation (NOV). 
(A)  When the Director finds that a user has violated (or continues to violate) any provision of this chapter, a wastewater discharge permit or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, the Director may serve upon that user a written Notice of Violation. The Director may select any means of service that is reasonable under the circumstances. 
(B)  Unless a report due date is specified, an explanation of the violation and a plan for the satisfactory correction and prevention thereof, to include specific required actions, shall be submitted by the user to the Director within 21 days of the receipt of this notice. Submission of this plan in no way relieves the user of liability for any violations occurring before or after receipt of the Notice of Violation. Nothing in this section shall limit the authority of the Director to take any action, including emergency actions or any other enforcement action, without first issuing a Notice of Violation. 
III.  Consent Orders. The Director may enter into Consent Orders, assurances of voluntary compliance, or other similar documents establishing an agreement with any user responsible for non-compliance. Such documents will include specific action to be taken by the user to correct the non-compliance within a time period specified by the document. Such documents shall have the same force and effect as the administrative orders issued pursuant to §§ 52.10 V and VI and shall be judicially enforceable. Use of a Consent Order shall not be a bar against, or prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user. 
IV.  Show Cause Hearing. The Director may order a user that has violated or continues to violate, any provision of this chapter, a wastewater discharge permit or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, to appear before the Director and show cause why a proposed enforcement action should not be taken. Notice shall be served on the user specifying the time and place for the meeting, the proposed enforcement action, the reasons for such action, and a request that the user show cause why the proposed enforcement action should not be taken. The notice of the meeting shall be served personally or by registered or certified mail (return receipt requested) at least ten days prior to the hearing. Such notice may be served on any authorized representative of the user. A show cause hearing shall not be a bar against, or prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user. 
V.  Compliance Orders. When the Director finds that a user has violated or continues to violate any provision of this chapter, a wastewater discharge permit or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, the Director may issue an order to the user responsible for the discharge directing that the user come into compliance within a time specified in the order. Compliance Orders may require users to refrain from certain activities, install additional pretreatment equipment, increase self-monitoring, use best management practices designed to minimize the amount of pollutants discharged to the sewer. If the user does not come into compliance within the time specified in the order, sewer service may be discontinued. Issuance of a compliance order shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user. 
VI.  Cease and Desist Orders. 
(A)  When the Director finds that a user has violated (or continues to violate) any provision of this chapter, a wastewater discharge permit or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, or that the user's past violations are likely to recur, the Director may issue an order to the user directing it to cease and desist all such violations and directing the user to: 
(1)  Immediately comply with all requirements; and 
(2)  Take such appropriate remedial or preventive action as may be needed to properly address a continuing or threatened violation, including halting operations and/or terminating the discharge. 
(B)  Issuance of a cease and desist order shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user. 
VII.  Administrative Assessments. 
(A)  When the Director finds that a user has violated or continues to violate any provision of this chapter, a wastewater discharge permit or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, the Director may impose a penalty assessment in an amount not less than $250.00 and not to exceed $10,000.00. Such assessments shall be levied on a per violation, per day basis. In the case of monthly or other long-term average discharge limits, assessments may be levied for each day during the period of violation. Said Administrative assessments shall constitute a sewer service surcharge, and shall be subject to collection in the same manner as all other sewer utility rates, charges, and penalties. 
(B)  Unless other arrangements have been made with, and authorized by the Director, unpaid charges, assessments, and penalties shall accrue thereafter at a rate of one percent per month. After 90 days, if charges, assessments, and penalties have not been paid, the Director may revoke the user's discharge permit. A lien against the user's property shall be sought for unpaid charges, fines, and penalties. 
(C)  Users desiring to appeal and dispute such assessments shall file a written request for the Director to reconsider the assessment along with full payment of the assessment amount within ten days of being notified of the assessment. Upon receipt of a timely appeal, the Director shall set a date and time for an appeal hearing, but in no case shall the hearing be set more than 30 days from the receipt of the timely notice of appeal. The appellant shall be notified in writing of the date, time, and place for the appeal hearing. The Director or his/her designee shall serve as the Hearing Examiner. In the event the user's appeal is successful, any payments made shall be returned to the user. Affirmation or modification of an administrative assessment by the Director shall relate back to the original date of assessment. 
(D)  The Director shall recover the costs of preparing administrative enforcement actions, such as notices and orders, including the cost of additional inspections, sampling and analysis, and may add them to the assessment. 
(E)  Issuance of an administrative assessment shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user. 
(F)  Users seeking judicial review of administrative assessments shall do so by filing a Petition for Review in the Montgomery County Common Pleas Court within 30 days of the decision of the Director. 
VIII.  Emergency Suspensions. 
(A)  The Director may immediately suspend a user's discharge (after informal notice to the user) whenever such suspension is necessary to stop an actual or threatened discharge that reasonably appears to present or cause an imminent or substantial endangerment to the health or welfare of persons. 
(B)  The Director may also immediately suspend a user's discharge (after informal notice and opportunity to respond) that threatens to interfere with the operation of the POTW, or that presents or may present an endangerment to the environment. 
(C)  Any user notified of a suspension of its discharge shall immediately stop or eliminate its contribution. In the event of a user's failure to immediately comply voluntarily with the suspension order, the Director shall take such steps as deemed necessary, including immediate severance of the sewer connection, to prevent or minimize damage to the POTW, its receiving stream, or endangerment to any individuals. 
(D)  The Director shall allow the user to recommence its discharge when the user has demonstrated to the satisfaction of the Director that the period of endangerment has passed, unless the termination proceedings in § 52.10 IX are initiated against the user. 
(E)  A user that is responsible, in whole or in part, for any discharge presenting imminent endangerment shall submit a detailed written statement, describing the causes of the harmful contribution and the measures taken to prevent any future occurrence, to the Director prior to the date of any show cause or termination hearing under §§ 52.10 IV and IX. 
(F)  Nothing in this section shall be interpreted as requiring a hearing prior to any emergency suspension under this section. 
IX.  Termination of Discharge (Non-Emergency). 
(A)  In addition to the provisions in § 52.04 XIII, any user that violates the following conditions is subject to discharge termination: 
(1)  Violation of wastewater discharge permit conditions; 
(2)  Failure to accurately report the wastewater constituents and characteristics of its discharge; 
(3)  Failure to report significant changes in operations or wastewater volume, constituents and characteristics prior to discharge; 
(4)  Refusal of reasonable access to the user's premises for the purpose of inspection, monitoring or sampling; or 
(5)  Violation of the pretreatment standards in § 52.03. 
(B)  Such user will be notified of the proposed termination of its discharge and be offered an opportunity to show cause under § 52.10 IV why the proposed action should not be taken. Exercise of this option by the Director shall not be a bar to, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user. 
X.  Cost Recovery. Any user violating any of the provisions of this chapter, or who causes a discharge that results in or contributes to pass-through, interference, accumulation in sludge or biosolids, violation of any federal, state or local requirement, a deposit or obstruction, or causes damages to or impairs the city sanitary sewers or wastewater treatment facility shall be liable to the city for any expense, loss, fine or damage caused by such discharge including the costs incurred in investigating, monitoring, and prosecuting such violation or discharge. The Director shall bill the user for costs incurred as a result of the violation or discharge. Refusal to pay the assessed costs shall constitute a violation of this chapter. The Director may disconnect from the city's wastewater facilities any user who refuses or fails to pay the assessed costs. 
XI.  Appeal Procedures. 
(A)  Appeals. 
(1)  Any user seeking to dispute a Notice of Violation, order, assessment, or other action of the Director, other than issuance of a Wastewater Discharge Permit, may file an appeal. 
(2)  The appeal shall be filed in writing and received by the Director, in writing, within ten days of the receipt of the disputed action, along with full payment of any assessment. If the notice of appeal is not received by the Director and the assessment is not paid to the Director within the ten-day period, the right to an appeal is waived. The notice of appeal shall state with particularity the basis upon which the appellant is disputing the action taken. 
(3)  Upon receipt of a timely appeal, the Director shall set a date and time for an appeal hearing, no more than 30 days from the receipt of the timely notice of appeal. The Director may postpone or continue any hearing sua sponte or upon motion of the appellant or the Director. In setting the hearing date, the Director shall consider: (1) the number and complexity of the issues to be resolved; (2) the number of witnesses and their availability; (3) the amount of civil discovery reasonably necessary to prepare for the hearing; and (4) the availability of the Hearing Examiner. The appellant shall be notified in writing of the date, time, and place for the appeal hearing. The Director or his/her designee shall serve as the Hearing Examiner. The Hearing Examiner shall confer with the parties or their legal counsel to establish a case management schedule to govern the appeal and the hearing, including an appropriate time for civil discovery, to be governed by the Ohio Rules of Civil Procedure. 
(B)  Appeal Hearing. 
(1)  The hearing examiner may admit and give probative effect to evidence that possesses probative value commonly accepted by reasonably prudent persons in the conduct of their affairs. The hearing examiner shall give effect to the rules of privilege recognized by law. The hearing examiner may exclude incompetent, irrelevant, immaterial, and unduly repetitious evidence. Factual issues shall be resolved by a preponderance of evidence. 
(2)  Documentary evidence may be received in the form of copies or excerpts or by incorporation by reference. 
(3)  Every party, or its legal counsel, shall have the right to cross examine witnesses who testify and shall have the right to submit rebuttal evidence; provided that the hearing examiner may control the manner and extent of the cross examinations and rebuttal. The hearing shall be recorded or otherwise transcribed to create a record. 
(4)  The hearing examiner may take notice of judicially cognizable facts. 
(5)  The burden of proof and proceeding shall reside with the appellant. 
(C)  Appeal Conclusion. Within ten days of the conclusion of the hearing, the hearing examiner shall determine if the disputed action was proper, and shall approve, modify, or rescind the disputed action. The Hearing Examiner may postpone or continue the ten-day period sua sponte or upon motion of the appellant or the Director to allow for: (1) transcription of the record, or (2) filing of post-hearing proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law by the parties. 
The final determination of the hearing examiner shall be in writing, and all parties shall be provided a copy of the final determination. 
(D)  Judicial Review of Appeal. Any party, including the city, the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency, the United States Environmental Protection Agency, or the user/appellant, is entitled to a review of the final determination of the hearing examiner in the Montgomery County Common Pleas Court. Appeal cases shall be filed and proceed according to the Montgomery County Rules of Civil Procedure.

However, the Director reserves the right to take other action against any user when the circumstances warrant. Further, the Director is empowered to take more than one enforcement action against any non-compliant user. These actions may be taken concurrently. 
(Ord. 30739-08, passed 4-23-08) 
Sec. 52.12. - Supplemental enforcement action. 
I.  Performance Bonds. The Director may decline to issue or reissue a wastewater discharge permit to any user that has failed to comply with any provision of this chapter, a previous wastewater discharge permit or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement unless such user first files a satisfactory bond, payable to the city, in a sum not to exceed a value determined by the Director to be necessary to achieve consistent compliance. 
II.  Financial Assurances. The Director may decline to issue or reissue a wastewater discharge permit to any user that has failed to comply with any provision of this chapter, a previous wastewater discharge permit or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, unless the user first submits proof that it has obtained financial assurance sufficient to meet pretreatment requirements, and/or restore or repair damage to the POTW caused by its discharge. 
III.  Water Supply Severance. Whenever a user has violated or continues to violate any provision of this chapter, a wastewater discharge permit or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, water service to the user may be severed. Service will only recommence, at the user's expense, after it has satisfactorily demonstrated its ability to comply.

The cost of such publications will be recovered from the user. 
(Ord. 30739-08, passed 4-23-08) 
Sec. 52.13. - Affirmative defenses to discharge violations. 
I.  Bypass. 
(A)  For the purposes of this section, 
(1)  "Bypass" means the intentional diversion of wastestreams from any portion of a user's treatment facility. 
(2)  "Severe property damage" means substantial physical damage to property, damage to the treatment facilities that causes them to become inoperable, or substantial and permanent loss of natural resources that can reasonably be expected to occur in the absence of a bypass. Severe property damage does not mean economic loss caused by delays in production. 
(B)  A user may allow any bypass to occur that does not cause applicable pretreatment standards or requirements to be violated, but only if it also is for essential maintenance to assure efficient operation. These bypasses are not subject to the provision of subsections (D) and (E) of this section. 
(C)  Sampling of the bypass wastestream is required whether the bypass was anticipated or unanticipated. The pollutants to be analyzed shall be all pollutants listed in the user's Permit. If the user is not permitted, then the pollutants to be analyzed shall be the pollutants listed in the latest approved Local Limits for the Discharge of Wastewater under the Industrial Pretreatment Program, Division of Wastewater Treatment, City of Dayton. 
(D)  Notice. 
(1)  If a user knows in advance of the need for a bypass, it shall submit prior notice to the POTW, at least ten days before the date of the bypass, if possible. 
(2)  A user shall submit oral notice to the Director of an unanticipated bypass that exceeds applicable pretreatment standards within 24 hours from the time it becomes aware of the bypass. A written submission shall also be provided within five days of the time the user becomes aware of the bypass. The written submission shall contain a description of the bypass and its cause; the duration of the bypass, including exact dates and times, and, if the bypass has not been corrected, the anticipated time it is expected to continue; and steps taken or planned to reduce, eliminate, and prevent reoccurrence of the bypass. The POTW may waive the written report on a case-by-case basis if the oral report has been received within 24 hours. 
(E)  Prohibition of Bypass. 
(1)  Bypass is prohibited, and the POTW may take an enforcement action against a user for a bypass, unless 
(a)  Bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life, personal injury, or severe property damage; 
(b)  There were no feasible alternatives to the bypass, such as the use of auxiliary treatment facilities, retention of untreated wastes, or maintenance during normal periods of equipment downtime. This condition is not satisfied if adequate back-up equipment should have been installed in the exercise of reasonable engineering judgment to prevent a bypass that occurred during normal periods of equipment downtime or preventive maintenance; and 
(c)  The user submitted notices as required under paragraph (C) of this section. 
(2)  The POTW may approve an anticipated bypass, after considering its adverse effects, if the POTW determines that it will meet the three conditions listed in paragraph (D)(1) of this section. 
(Ord. 30739-08, passed 4-23-08) 
Sec. 52.14. - Sewer billing. 
I.  Fees and Charges. 
(A)  All fees, assessments, and charges payable under the provisions of this chapter shall be paid into the City of Dayton Sanitary Sewer Fund. Such fees, assessments, and charges shall be as set forth herein or established in the latest edition of the city's wastewater service charge ordinance, § 50.03 of the Revised Code of General Ordinances: Assessment Rates and User Charge System. 
(B)  All fees, assessments, and charges payable under the provisions of this chapter are due and payable upon the receipt of notice of charges, or as otherwise specified by the Director. Unpaid charges shall be deemed delinquent and shall be subject to penalty and interest charges as provided for in the latest edition of the city's Wastewater Service Charge ordinance and may be assessed against the property served on the County tax duplicate. 
II.  Delinquent Accounts. 
(A)  After reading the meter or estimating consumption, a statement of charges due shall be sent to the user on file with the Division of Revenue and Taxation. If the bill is not paid by the day specified for payment of the gross amount, past due notices may be mailed. 
(B)  Should a bill remain unpaid for 28 days after the net payment date the account shall be considered delinquent and processed as follows: 
(1)  A seven-day shut off notice shall be mailed to the property where the water was consumed and a duplicate copy thereof shall be mailed to the billing address and to the Customer. 
(2)  The water service may be shut off as soon as practical and not turned on against until all bills and further charges are paid, except as otherwise provided herein. 
The Director of Finance may set a minimum value for shut-off. In a manifold metered situation, the city may shut off all units for the delinquency of one or more units within this limited shut-off situation. 
(3)  If all charges are not paid within 14 days from the date the water is scheduled for shut off, the meter may be removed at the discretion of the city. One attempt may be made to remove the meter during the next 14-day period. If the meter has not been removed at the end of the second 14-day period, the account may be considered abandoned. 
All abandoned accounts that are not resumed within 60 days from the gross payment date may be considered as "lost meter accounts" and charged to the Customer or user for all amounts due. In the event a Customer transfers or abandons a service, all charges become due and payable immediately. The Customer may be held accountable for any consumption registered on an "abandoned account" water meter and back-billed accordingly. 
(C)  Any owner of real estate premises installing or maintaining water service connections agrees to comply with all rules and regulations of the Department of Water and as agreeing, in particular, to be liable for all water, sewer, and stormwater charges for such premises, whether the accounts for such premises are carried in the name of such owner or in the name of tenants or other persons. The Division of Revenue and Taxation may transfer delinquent charges on an account to another active service location owned by the same Customer who incurred charges and failed to pay. 
(D)  Delinquent accounts shall be assessed a Delinquent Shutoff Charge as established by a separate ordinance on the scheduled shut off date. Should the account remain unpaid, city personnel will continue to check service after every billing cycle and a Delinquent Shutoff Charge will be assessed for each trip made to verify service being off. Once Water service has been turned off and is turned on again by anyone other than authorized city personnel, a Fee for Unauthorized Use as established by a separate ordinance shall be assessed. Unauthorized operation of the shut off may result in severing the service and the Customer shall be charged the Service Termination Fee as established in a separate ordinance. 
(E)  Water and Sewer charges will continue to accrue as long as the meter remains in service at the property. If the meter is missing, charges shall continue to accrue until the Division of Revenue and Taxation determines that the account is abandoned. Stormwater charges continue as long as the impervious surfaces remain on a property. 
(F)  Services may be shut off if declared delinquent or otherwise requested by the Customer or occupant of the premises. Services shall not be shut off upon the request of a landlord as a means to evict a tenant. Service may be shut off to a tenant whose account is declared delinquent. Service may be shut off to a tenant whose account is declared delinquent, including those accounts with assessments levied under § 52.10 VII. 
(G)  The Manager of Revenue and Taxation may grant an extension of up to 12 months for payments, including assessments levied under § 52.10 VII. Each case will be considered on an individual basis upon the request of the customer or user. 
(H)  If a dispute should exist on payment arrangements between an owner and the tenant, the owner has the final approval. 
(I)  In cases where industrial, commercial, or governmental accounts become delinquent, the Director of Finance shall determine the course of action, except for assessments levied under § 52.10 VII, which shall be determined by the Director of Water. 
(J)  Customer's checks that are not honored by the bank shall result in a Bad Check Fee as established by a separate ordinance. 
(K)  The addresses of occupied premises that are shut off for delinquency shall be forwarded to the Manager of Inspectional Services, except those assessments levied under § 52.10 VII. 
(L)  The public records of the Division of Revenue and Taxation are available for inspections and copying at reasonable times during regular business hours. The Division of Revenue and Taxation may charge the costs it incurs in such inspection and copying to the person requesting the public record. 
(M)  Delinquent administrative assessments that have been levied by the Director of Water to applicable Industrial Users may be applied to the sewer charge portion of that Industrial User's account to facilitate collection. 
III.  Abandoned Accounts. All Abandoned accounts that are not resumed within 60 days from the gross payment date may be considered as "lost meter accounts" and charged to the customer or user for all amounts due. In the event a customer transfers or abandons a service, all charges become due and payable immediately. The customer may be held accountable for any consumption registered on an "abandoned account" water meter and back billed accordingly. 
IV.  Wastewater Rates-General Information. 
(A)  For any lot, parcel of land, building, or premises situated within the corporate limits of the city having any connection with the city wastewater system or otherwise discharging wastewater, industrial wastes, water or other liquids, either directly or indirectly, into the city wastewater system, a charge or rental shall be based upon the quantity of water used as measured by the city water meter there in use or by other means acceptable to the Director of the Department of Water. 
(B)  If a person is found to be discharging wastewater or other wastes into the city's wastewater system without paying a wastewater service charge or rental, the Director shall, by any such method as is practicable, measure or estimate the quantity of such wastes for the purpose of establishing a proper charge in accordance with the schedule of charges set forth herein, and the customer shall be charged for the total term of the prior usage on the basis of the quantity so determined. 
(C)  When a secondary water supply serves a one family dwelling connected to the wastewater collection system, charges shall be computed on an estimated usage of 3,000 cubic feet per quarter (for a 5/8 -inch meter). The billing for larger customers served by a secondary water supply shall be reviewed on a case-by-case basis. 
(D)  The procedure for applying minimum wastewater treatment charges for private sewer meter installations shall be based on the actual size of the sewer meter; provided however, exceptions such as, but not limited to multiple sewer meter installations, parshall flumes and weirs, shall be billed at a ten-inch sewer meter size for the minimum wastewater service charges. 
(E)  Charges will be payable quarterly or monthly as due in accordance with applicable rates. 
(F)  When special readings are requested by the customer or user or needed by the Departments of Water or Finance between regular reading dates, charges will be determined in proportion to the time elapsed since normal time between regular reading dates. 
(G)  The Manager of Revenue and Taxation may render bills at regular rates for extended periods beyond three months. Bills may be issued to Customers or users for periods shorter than three months provided the total number of billings are no more than the total number of revenue billings normally issued in a one-year period. 
Monthly billing may be implemented for an account when deemed appropriate by the Manager of Revenue and Taxation. 
(H)  All bills shall contain gross and net amounts. Net amounts are gross less a five percent discount on water and wastewater billings payable within 14 days. The five percent discount is offered as an incentive for prompt payment. However, governmental agencies under separate agreements shall make payments to the city as per the terms and conditions of said agreements. When the Director of Finance determines that an account delinquent in amount not more than $2,500.00 is uncollectible, the Director may order the bill to be cancelled. 
V.  Extra-Strength Surcharge. 
(A)  The measurement of the strength of the wastewater for purposes of application of the extra strength surcharges shall be made by standard sampling and laboratory procedures in a manner acceptable to the Director. The surcharges shall be made quarterly or monthly at the discretion of the Director. 
(B)  For the purpose of applying the surcharge for discharges of higher than normal strength wastewater, the Department of Water, Division of Wastewater Treatment, shall attempt to sample the effluent of the customer's building lateral a minimum of six times per billing cycle. However, if the Director determines that monitoring the user's effluent is not practical, reliable, or cost effective, the Director may specify alternative methods and frequency of determining the characteristics of the wastewaters discharge that will, in the Director's judgment, provide an equitable measurement of such characteristics; provided however, this action is in compliance with federal and state law. 
(C)  The Director will append an extra-strength surcharge to the appropriate monthly or quarterly sewer billing account for any user whose average Biochemical Oxygen Demand (BOD) and/or Total Suspended Solids (TSS) exceeds the background level of 350 mg/L. In lieu of analyzing for BOD, the Director may opt to establish a Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD)-to-BOD ratio for a user to facilitate analysis "turn around" time for billing purposes. 
VI.  Wastewater Service Rate Schedule. The rates as adjusted from time to time by City of Dayton ordinance pertaining to wastewater services shall apply. 
VII.  Customers Outside the City of Dayton. 
(A)  Except as modified by agreement. "Individually metered" customers outside the City of Dayton corporation limits connected to and served by the City of Dayton wastewater treatment facilities shall pay 15 percent above the city rates for wastewater treatment service. "Retail" customers outside the city under direct contract with the city shall pay 25 percent above the city rates for wastewater service. For those accounts outside the city designated as "Master Metered," the total charges are 50 percent greater than the comparable city rates. 
(B)  Any rates, charges, or fees are applicable for any lot, parcel of land, building, or premises situated outside of the corporate limits of the city having any connection with city wastewater system or otherwise discharging wastewater, industrial wastes, water, or other liquids, either directly or indirectly, into the city wastewater system, where such usage of the city wastewater system is covered by specific agreements specifying rates, terms, and conditions of usage. The measurement of the strength of the wastewater for purposes of application of the extra strength surcharges shall be made by standard sampling and laboratory procedures in a manner acceptable to the Director. 
VIII.  Complaints and Appeals. 
(A)  Customers or users with water, stormwater, and/or sewer billing complaints and who are billed directly by the Division of Revenue and Taxation, may contact the Call Center of the Division of Revenue and Taxation in regards to these complaints. The Director shall apply this chapter, and other applicable Department of Water ordinances to facilitate a satisfactory resolution of the complaint. 
Customers or users with billing disputes, who are not billed directly by the Division of Revenue and Taxation, shall contact the governmental agency that has jurisdiction of their respective billing area. 
(B)  Customers or users residing within City of Dayton limits, who are not satisfied with the above resolutions to billing complaints, may appeal in writing to the Board of Water and Sewer Charges Review. A written complaint shall be received by the Manager of Revenue and Taxation within two billing quarters of the date of the disputed bill, otherwise the bill cannot be disputed. 
(C)  To be considered by the Board appeals shall include at a minimum the name, service address, daytime phone number of the complainant, the name of the Call Center Representative contacted, any related documentation and the basis for the bill adjustment requested. 
(D)  For appeals filed before the due date for the gross billing amount, a 25 percent deposit (of the amount in dispute) is required to forward the billing complaint to the Board of Water and Sewer Charge Review. After a shut off notice has been generated on said account, a 50 percent deposit will be required. After the service has been shut off, a 100 percent deposit must be submitted. The Manager of Revenue and Taxation has the right to waive any deposit. 
(E)  Any person, feeling aggrieved by a decision of the Board of Water and Sewer Charge Review may appeal such decision to the Board of Water and Sewer Charge appeals by notifying the Manager of Revenue and Taxation in writing within 14 days after receiving notice of the decision of the Board of Water and Sewer Charge Review. Such notice shall contain the grounds for appeal. Maximum adjustment by the Board of Appeals will be 50 percent of the disputed amount. The decision of the Board of Water and Sewer Charge Appeals is final. 
(F)  Governmental agencies covered under separate agreements may appeal, on behalf of their customer, to the Director of Water for any adjustments and the Director's decision will be final. Any appeal to the Director shall include those items listed in subsection (C) of this section. Decisions of the Director do not preclude additional customer services or adjustments on the part of other political subdivisions independent of the City of Dayton. 
IX.  Private Sewer Meters (for billing or regulatory purposes). 
(A)  Customers or users may use a private sanitary meter for billing purposes only if approved by the Director of the Department of Water. Special billing request shall be submitted to the Director's office for consideration. A fee as specified in a separate City of Dayton rate schedule shall be charged for each private meter read. 
(B)  In the case where the customer or user uses a private meter for billing and/or regulatory reporting purposes, the meter will be maintained by the customer or user at the customer's or user's expense. If the meter malfunctions or fails to register, the measurement of consumption/discharge shall be based on the old water meter registration and/or estimated by considering past usage. The private meter shall be required to be serviced and/or calibrated at the customer's or user's expense upon the Department of Water's direction. 
(C)  Private meters used for billing purposes shall be calibrated by an independent third party once a year at a minimum, or more frequently if deemed necessary by the Department of Water.

Secs. 53.08-53.20. - Reserved. 
DIVISION 2. - REPORTING AND PROTECTION REQUIREMENTS 

Sec. 53.21. - Determination of the Total Maximum Daily Inventory and Facility Hazard Potential Rating. 
(A)  Total Maximum Daily Inventory (TMDI). 
(1)  Purpose. The purpose of the TMDI is to quantify and memorialize the non-conformity of a zoning lot for the handling of regulated substances. The city first adopted the Well Head Operation District and the Well Field Protection Overlay District restricting the use of regulated substances on August 3, 1988. The Zoning Administrator, upon the recommendation of the Director, determined the TMDI of zoning lots within the Well Head Operation District and the Well Field Protection Overlay District based upon the uses of the zoning lots at the time that the districts were adopted, analysis of the RSAIRs, and inspection of the property. Now, with the passage of the amendments to this chapter and the Zoning Code, the boundaries and the name of the districts are changed. This change will require the Director to analyze and make a recommendation as to the TMDI of properties that are now in the Source Water Protection Area, but that were not in the Well Field Protection Districts. All of the zoning lots located in the Well Field Protection Districts that were nonconforming with respect to the amount of regulated substances have been assigned a TMDI. The remaining lots were deemed conforming, and have a TMDI of 160 pounds. 
(2)  Determination of TMDI for zoning lots that were a part of the Well Field Protection Districts. The zoning lots that were a part of the Well Field Protection Districts and continue to be a part of the Source Water Protection Area shall have the same TMDI as they last had in the Well Field Protection Districts, subject to further reduction based upon discontinuance of use or risk point buy downs by the Source Water Protection Fund Board. 
(3)  Determination of TMDI of zoning lots that are in the Source Water Protection Area and were not a part of the Well Field Protection Districts. For those zoning lots that are now in the Source Water Protection Area and that were not in the Well Field Protection Districts, the Zoning Administrator, upon the recommendation of the Director, shall determine the TMDI of the zoning lot based upon the uses of the zoning lot at the time it became part of the Source Water Protection Area, analysis of the RSAIRs, and inspection of the zoning lot. 
(4)  Prior determinations. The TMDI established for properties located in the Well Field Protection Districts and that are also located in the Source Water Protection Area shall remain in effect, subject to further reduction based upon discontinuance of use or Risk Point Buy Downs by the Source Water Protection Fund Board. 
(5)  Once the TMDI is established for a Zoning Lot, it shall not be exceeded, except as provided for in Section 150.120 of the Zoning Code. 
(6)  Zoning lots with dwellings, single-family (attached, detached, or clustered) and dwellings, two-family, shall have a TMDI of 160 pounds. 
(B)  Facility Hazard Potential Rating (FHPR). 
(1)  Purpose. The purpose of the FHPR is to quantify the risk for potential groundwater contamination for the regulated substances that comprise the TMDI for a zoning lot. While the TMDI limits the amount of regulated substances that can be handled on a zoning lot at one time, the FHPR limits the type of regulated substances that a zoning lot can handle. The Zoning Administrator, upon the recommendation of the Director, determined the FHPR for a zoning lot by deciding the appropriate chemical class and range of hazard potential ratings for each regulated substance stored on the zoning lot. Then, a weighted average of all of the hazard potential ratings was performed to determine the FHPR for each zoning lot. The FHPR was only assigned to a zoning lot that exceeded the 160 pound conforming use. Conforming use properties were not assigned an FHPR. Now, with the passage of the amendments to this chapter and the Zoning Code, the boundaries and the name of the districts are changed. This change will require the Director to analyze and make a recommendation as to the FHPR of properties that are now in the Source Water Protection Area, but that were not in the Well Field Protection Districts. 
(2)  Determination of FHPR for zoning lots that were a part of the previous zoning districts. The zoning lots that were a part of the Well Field Protection Districts and continue to be a part of the Source Water Protection Area shall have the same FHPR as they last had in the Well Field Protection Districts, subject to further reduction based upon discontinuance of use or risk point buy downs by the Source Water Protection Fund Board. 
(3)  Determination of TMDI of zoning lots that are in the Source Water Protection Area and were not a part of the Well Field Protection Districts. For those zoning lots that are now in the Source Water Protection Area and that were not in the Well Field Protection Districts, the Zoning Administrator, upon the recommendation of the Director, shall determine the FHPR of the zoning lot based upon the type and quantity of regulated substances lawfully handled on the zoning lot at the time it became part of the Source Water Protection Area, analysis of the RSAIRs, and inspection of the zoning lot. The Director, subject to approval from the City Commission, shall adopt rules and regulations for the determination of the FHPR of these properties. 
(4)  Once the FHPR is established for a zoning lot, it shall not be exceeded. 
(C)  This section shall not apply to zoning lots owned by the city and engaged in municipal water department activities.

Sec. 70.13. - Traffic control by officer or signal. 
(A)  When a police officer is on duty directing the traffic at a street intersection, he shall, where feasible, direct the movement of traffic by the position of his body according to the following rule: When the officer takes the position facing in the general direction in which one of the intersecting streets runs, such position shall mean that no vehicles, or trackless trolleys, or pedestrians on such street, whether approaching the intersection from the direction which the officer is facing or from the opposite direction, shall enter into or cross over the intersection, but shall stop (pedestrians on the sidewalk, and vehicles or trackless trolleys before entering the nearest crosswalk, or at such other point as may be indicated clearly by painted line or a line or metal buttons set in the pavement) and shall remain stationary until the officer turns and takes a position so as to face in the general direction in which the other or intersecting street runs. Nothing herein shall prevent any police officer, directing traffic, or enforcing the provisions of this chapter, from giving other clearly intelligible signals, signs, or orders, and no person shall fail to obey promptly any such other signal, sign, or order. 
(B)  Whenever traffic is controlled by traffic-control signals exhibiting different colored lights, or colored lighted arrows, successively one at a time or in combination, only the colors green, red, and yellow shall be used, except for special pedestrian signals carrying a word legend, and said lights shall indicate and apply to drivers of vehicles, trackless trolleys, and pedestrians as follows: 
(1)  Green indication. 
(a)  Vehicular traffic, and trackless trolleys facing a circular green signal may proceed straight through or turn right or left unless a sign at such place prohibits either such turn. But vehicular traffic, and trackless trolleys, turning right or left, shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles, trackless trolleys, and pedestrians lawfully within the intersection or an adjacent crosswalk at the time such signal is exhibited. 
(b)  Vehicular traffic, and trackless trolleys facing a green arrow signal, shown alone or in combination with another indication, may cautiously enter the intersection only to make the movement indicated by such arrow, or such other movement as is permitted by other indications shown at the same time. Such vehicular traffic, and trackless trolleys shall yield the right-of-way to pedestrians lawfully within an adjacent crosswalk and to other traffic lawfully using the intersection. 
(c)  Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian-control signal, pedestrians facing any green signal, except when the sole green signal is a turn arrow, may proceed across the roadway within any marked or unmarked crosswalk. 
(2)  Steady yellow indication. 
(a)  Vehicular traffic, and trackless trolleys facing a steady circular yellow or yellow arrow signal is thereby warned that the related green movement is being terminated or that a red indication will be exhibited immediately thereafter when vehicular traffic, and trackless trolleys shall not enter the intersection. 
(b)  Pedestrians facing a steady circular yellow or yellow arrow signal, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian-control signal, are thereby advised that there is insufficient time to cross the roadway before a red indication is shown and no pedestrian shall then start to cross the roadway. 
(3)  Steady red indication. 
(a)  Vehicular traffic, and trackless trolleys facing a steady red signal alone shall stop at a clearly marked stop line, but if none, before entering the crosswalk on the near side of the intersection, or if none, then before entering the intersection and shall remain standing until an indication to proceed is shown except as provided in subsection (3)(b) or (d) of this section. 
(b)  Unless a sign is in place prohibiting a right turn, vehicular traffic, and trackless trolleys facing a steady red signal may cautiously enter the intersection to make a right turn after stopping as required by subsection (3) (a) of this section. Such vehicular traffic, and trackless trolleys shall yield the right-of-way to pedestrians lawfully within an adjacent crosswalk and to other traffic lawfully using the intersection. 
(c)  Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian-control signal, pedestrians facing a steady red signal alone shall not enter the roadway. 
(d)  Unless a sign is in place prohibiting a left turn vehicular traffic and trackless trolleys on a one-way street intersecting another one-way street and facing a steady red signal may cautiously enter the intersection to make a left turn after stopping as required by subsection (3)(a) of this section. Such vehicular traffic and trackless trolleys shall yield the right-of-way to pedestrians lawfully within adjacent crosswalks and to other traffic lawfully using the intersection. 
(4)  In the event an official traffic-control signal is erected and maintained at a place other than an intersection, the provisions of this section shall be applicable except as to those provisions which by their nature can have no application. Any stop required shall be made at a sign or marking on the pavement indicating where the stop shall be made, but in the absence of any such sign or marking the stop shall be made at the signal. 
(C)  Any traffic lawfully on the roadway within an intersection at the time a traffic-control signal changes may continue cautiously through the intersection with due regard for the safety and rights of all persons using the roadway. 
(D)  At any intersection where traffic signals are erected and are inoperative but not covered, all vehicle operators facing such signals shall treat the intersection approach as a stop street unless otherwise provided by the Director of Public Works in accord with § 71.55(E). (R.C. § 4511.13)

Operators of vehicles and trackless trolleys shall stop at a clearly marked stop line, but if none, before entering the crosswalk on the near side of the intersection, or if none, then at the point nearest the intersecting roadway where the driver has a view of approaching traffic on the intersecting roadway before entering it, and the right to proceed shall be subject to the rules applicable after making a stop at a stop sign. 
(2)  Flashing yellow caution signal. Operators of vehicles and trackless trolleys may proceed through the intersection or past such signal only with caution.

If the person was under arrest as described in division (A)(5) of section 4511.191 of the Revised Code, the arresting officer shall advise the person at the time of the arrest that the person may have an independent chemical test taken at the person's own expense. If the person was under arrest other than described in division (A)(5) of section 4511.191 of the Revised Code, the form to be read to the person to be tested, as required under section 4511.192 of the Revised Code, shall state that the person may have an independent test performed at the person's expense. The failure or inability to obtain an additional chemical test by a person shall not preclude the admission of evidence relating to the chemical test or tests taken at the request of a law enforcement officer. 
(G)  Any physician, registered nurse, emergency medical technician-intermediate, emergency medical technician-paramedic, or qualified technician, chemist, or phlebotomist who withdraws blood from a person pursuant to this section or section 4511.191 or 4511.192 of the Revised Code, and any hospital, first-aid station, or clinic at which blood is withdrawn from a person pursuant to this section or section 4511.191 or 4511.192 of the Revised Code, is immune from criminal liability and civil liability based upon a claim of assault and battery or any other claim that is not a claim of malpractice, for any act performed in withdrawing blood from the person. The immunity provided in this division also extends to an emergency medical service organization that employs an emergency medical technician-intermediate or emergency medical technician-paramedic who withdraws blood under this section. The immunity provided in this division is not available to a person who withdraws blood if the person engages in willful or wanton misconduct. 
(H)  Subject to division (J) of this section, in any criminal prosecution for a violation of division (B), (C), (D), (E), or (F) of § 71.12, a laboratory report from any laboratory personnel issued a permit by the Department of Health authorizing an analysis as described in this division that contains an analysis of the whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, urine, or other bodily substance tested and that contains all of the information specified in this division shall be admitted as prima-facie evidence of the information and statements that the report contains. The laboratory report shall contain all of the following: 
(1)  The signature, under oath, of any person who performed the analysis; 
(2)  Any findings as to the identity and quantity of alcohol, a drug of abuse, a controlled substance, a metabolite of a controlled substance, or a combination of them that was found;

An individual desiring a hearing must post this $50.00 bond before a hearing will be scheduled.

(b)  If the Hearing Officer, after consideration of the evidence, finds that the tow, impoundment, or immobilization was proper and in accordance with the law, the Hearing Officer shall uphold the tow, impoundment, and/or immobilization and condition the release of the vehicle upon payment of all fines and fees accruing thereto. If bond has been posted, said bond shall be forfeited to the City of Dayton. Any fines or fees shall be ordered to be paid by the owner of the vehicle to the City of Dayton. Where the Hearing Officer finds that the tow, impoundment, or immobilization was not proper and in accordance with the law, an order releasing the vehicle shall be entered, the bond shall be returned to the owner, and the owner shall not be liable for the tow or storage fees. The City of Dayton or its designee shall mail the owner a copy of the Hearing Officer's order within ten days from the date of the hearing. 
(c)  All hearings are open to the public. 
(d)  Storage fees for towed, impounded, or immobilized vehicles shall continue to accrue during the pendency of the appeal. 
(e)  All decisions of the Hearing Officer, shall be final except as subject to court review. Unless prohibited by law, the City of Dayton may seek judicial review of decisions by the Hearing Officer.

Sec. 80.06. - Rules of the road. 
    The following rules for preventing collisions shall be followed in the navigation of all public and private watercraft operating upon the waters of Dayton: 
(A)  Every watercraft which is under way propelled by sail alone shall be considered a sailboat. Every watercraft which is under way propelled by sail and machinery shall be considered a powercraft. Every watercraft shall be considered under way when she is not at anchor or made fast to the shore or aground. In addition to any other situation, "risk of collision", shall be determined to exist whenever the compass bearing of the approaching watercraft remains substantially the same. 
(B)  When two sailboats are approaching one another so as to involve the risk of collision one of them shall yield the right-of-way to the other, as follows, namely: 
(1)  A sailboat which is running free shall yield the right-of-way to the sailboat which is close-hauled. 
(2)  A sailboat which is close-hauled on the port tack shall yield the right-of-way to a sailboat which is close-hauled on the starboard tack. 
(3)  When both sailboats are running free, with the wind on different sides, the sailboat which has the wind on the port side shall yield the right-of-way to the other. 
(4)  When both sailboats are running free, with the wind on the same side, the sailboat which is to the windward shall yield the right-of-way to the sailboat which is to the leeward. 
(C)  When two powercrafts are meeting end on, or nearly end on, so as to involve the risk of collision, each shall alter her course to starboard, so that each shall pass the other on the port side of the other. 
(D)  When two powercraft are crossing at right angles or obliquely, so as to involve the risk of collision, the powercraft which has the other on her own starboard side shall yield the right-of-way to the other. 
(E)  When a powercraft and a sailboat are proceeding in such directions as to involve the risk of collision, the powercraft shall yield the right-of-way to the sailboat, except when the sailboat is overtaking the powercraft. 
(F)  Every watercraft which is directed by these rules to yield the right-of-way to another watercraft shall, on approaching such other watercraft, if necessary, slacken her speed, stop, reverse, or alter course. Where, by any of the rules prescribed by R.C. Chapter 1547, one of two watercraft shall yield the right-of-way, the other shall keep her course and speed. 
(G)  Notwithstanding anything contained in these rules, every watercraft overtaking another shall yield the right-of-way to the overtaken watercraft. Every watercraft coming up with another watercraft from any direction more than 221/2° abaft the other's beam, that is, at such a position with reference to the watercraft which she is overtaking that at night she would be unable to see either of the other's side or combination bow lights is an overtaking watercraft; and no subsequent alteration of bearing between the two watercraft shall make the overtaking watercraft a crossing watercraft within the meaning of these rules, or relieve her of the duty of keeping clear of the overtaken watercraft until she is finally passed and clear. If the overtaking watercraft is in doubt as to whether she is forward of or abaft this direction from the other watercraft, she should assume that she is an overtaking watercraft and yield the right-of-way. 
(H)  In rivers and streams or other areas in which there is a water current, the descending watercraft shall have the right-of-way over a watercraft which is ascending. 
(I)  When a powercraft and a rowboat are proceeding in such direction as to involve the risk of collision such powercraft shall yield the right-of-way to such rowboat. 
(J)  Watercraft leaving a dock, boat slip, or tie-up space shall yield the right-of-way to all watercraft approaching such dock, boat slip, or tie-up space. 
(K)  At all times the operator of a watercraft shall maintain a proper lookout required by the ordinary practice of seamen and by the special circumstances of the case. 
(L)  In obeying and construing these rules, due regard shall be had to all dangers of navigation and collision and to any special circumstances which may render a departure from the above rules necessary in order to avoid immediate danger. (R.C. § 1547.05)

If the court determines that probable cause exists, the court shall determine the amount of a bond or cash deposit that is needed to provide for the dog's care and keeping for not less than 30 days beginning on the date on which the dog was impounded. 
(2)  If the court determines that probable cause does not exist, the court immediately shall order the impounding agency to return the dog to its owner if possible. If the dog cannot be returned because it has died as a result of neglect or other misconduct by the impounding agency or if the dog is injured as a result of neglect or other misconduct by the impounding agency, the court shall order the impounding agency to pay the owner an amount determined by the court to be equal to the reasonable market value of the dog at the time that it was impounded plus statutory interest as defined in section 1343.03 of the Ohio Revised Code from the date of the impoundment or an amount determined by the court to be equal to the reasonable cost of treatment of the injury to the dog, as applicable. The requirement established in division (E)(2) of this section regarding the payment of the reasonable market value of the dog shall not apply in the case of a dog that, in violation of section 955.01 of the Ohio Revised Code, was not registered at the time it was seized and impounded. 
(3)  If the court determines that probable cause exists and determines the amount of a bond or cash deposit, the case shall continue and the owner shall post a bond or cash deposit to provide for the dog's care and keeping for not less than 30 days beginning on the date on which the dog was impounded. The owner may renew a bond or cash deposit by posting, not later than ten days following the expiration of the period for which a previous bond or cash deposit was posted, a new bond or cash deposit in an amount that the court, in consultation with the impounding agency, determines is sufficient to provide for the dog's care and keeping for not less than 30 days beginning on the date on which the previous period expired. If no bond or cash deposit is posted or if a bond or cash deposit expires and is not renewed, the impounding agency may determine the disposition of the dog unless the court issues an order that specifies otherwise. 
(F)  If a person is convicted of committing an offense, the court may impose the following additional penalties against the person: 
(1)  A requirement that the person pay for the costs incurred by the impounding agency in caring for a dog involved in the applicable offense, provided that the costs were incurred during the dog's impoundment. A bond or cash deposit posted under this section may be applied to the costs. 
(2)  An order permanently terminating the person's right to possession, title, custody, or care of the dog that was involved in the offense. If the court issues such an order, the court shall order the disposition of the dog. 
(G)  If a person is found not guilty of committing an offense, the court immediately shall order the impounding agency to return the dog to its owner if possible and to return the entire amount of any bond or cash deposit posted under division (E) of this section. If the dog cannot be returned because it has died as a result of neglect or other misconduct by the impounding agency or if the dog is injured as a result of neglect or other misconduct by the impounding agency, the court shall order the impounding agency to pay the owner an amount determined by the court to be equal to the reasonable market value of the dog at the time that it was impounded plus statutory interest as defined in section 1343.03 of the Ohio Revised Code from the date of the impoundment or an amount determined by the court to be equal to the reasonable cost of treatment of the injury to the dog, as applicable. The requirements established in this division regarding the return of a bond or cash deposit and the payment of the reasonable market value of the dog shall not apply in the case of a dog that, in violation of section 955.01 of the Ohio Revised Code, was not registered at the time it was seized and impounded. 
(H)  If charges are filed under Section 91.62 of the Revised Code of General Ordinances against the custodian or caretaker of a dog, but the dog that is the subject of the charges is not impounded, the court in which the charges are pending may order the owner or person having custody of the dog to provide to the dog the necessities described in division (B) or (C) of Section 91.62 of the Revised Code of General Ordinances until the final disposition of the charges. If the court issues an order of that nature, the court also may authorize an officer or another person to visit the place where the dog is being kept, at the times and under the conditions that the court may set, to determine whether the dog is receiving those necessities and to remove and impound the dog if the dog is not receiving those necessities.

Application will consist of providing the information set forth in § 95.53 and as reasonably required by the City Manager. 
(C)  No Construction Without a Certificate of Registration. Following the effective date of §§ 95.51 through 95.71, no person shall construct or perform any work on or in, or use any system or any part thereof located on or in any rights-of-way without first obtaining a certificate of registration.

In addition, cable operators shall be exempt from any requirement of the certificate of registration process that is in direct conflict with the requirements of, and/or specifically exempted by, a valid cable franchise with the city. 
(E)  Systems in Place Without a Certificate of Registration. Any system or part of a system found in a rights-of-way for which a certificate of registration has not been obtained shall be deemed to be a nuisance and an unauthorized use of the rights-of-way. The city may exercise any remedies or rights it has at law or in equity, including, but not limited to abating the nuisance; taking possession of the facilities and/or noncomplying portion of such system; and/or prosecuting the violator. 
(F)  Future Uses. In allowing providers and permittees to place facilities in the rights-of-way, the city shall not be liable for any damages caused thereby to any provider's facilities that are already in place or that shall be placed in the rights-of-way unless those damages arise out of the sole negligence, gross negligence, willful misconduct, or fraud of the city. No provider is entitled to rely on the provisions of §§ 95.51 through 95.71 as creating a special duty to any provider. 
(G)  Discontinuance of Operations, Abandoned and Unused Facilities. 
(1)  A provider who has discontinued or is discontinuing its operations of any system in the city shall: 
(a)  Provide information satisfactory to the city that the provider's obligations for its system in the rights-of-way under this section and any other sections in this Code have been lawfully assumed by another applicant and/or provider; or 
(b)  Submit a written proposal to re-use its facilities in a manner that promotes the city's goals of providing innovative and economic solutions to efficiently and economically utilize limited rights-of-way capacity. Such proposal must be approved by the Director of Public Works; or 
(c)  Submit a written proposal for abandonment of facilities in place indicating why good engineering practice would support this type of solution. The director of public works must approve said proposal; or 
(d)  Completely remove all specifically identified portion(s) of its system in a manner acceptable to the city within a reasonable amount of time if the city believes that there exists a reasonable justification for such removal; or 
(e)  Submit to the city within a reasonable amount of time and in accordance with O.R.C. § 4905.20 and 4905.21, a proposal for transferring ownership of its facilities to the city. If a provider proceeds under this clause, the city may, at its option where lawful: 
(i)  Purchase the facilities; or 
(ii)  Unless a valid removal bond has already been posted pursuant to § 95.69(B), require the provider to post a bond in an amount sufficient to reimburse the city for reasonably anticipated costs to be incurred in removing the facilities. 
(2)  Facilities of a provider who fail to comply with this section and which remain unused facilities shall be deemed to be abandoned. Abandoned facilities are deemed to be a nuisance. The city may exercise any remedies or rights it has at law or in equity, including, but not limited to: 
(a)  Abating the nuisance; 
(b)  Taking possession of the facilities and restoring them to a useable condition subject to a finding of the PUCO pursuant to the requirements of O.R.C. § 4905.20 and 4905.21; or 
(c)  Requiring removal of the facilities by the provider or by the provider's surety.

If the city abates the nuisance it may take all action necessary to recover its costs and to abate said nuisance, including but not limited to, those methods set forth in O.R.C. § 715.261. 
(H)  Nature of Issuance. A certificate of registration shall not convey equitable or legal title in the rights-of-way. A certificate of registration is only the nonexclusive, limited right to occupy rights-of-way in the city, for the limited purposes and for the limited period stated in the certificate of registration and in accordance with Chapter 95 of this Code. The rights to occupy the right-of-way may not be subdivided or subleased; provided, however, that two or more providers may collocate facilities in the same area of the rights-of-way so long as each such provider complies with the provisions of §§ 95.51 through 95.71. Collocating providers may file a joint application for a construction permit. A certificate of registration does not excuse a provider from obtaining appropriate access or pole attachment agreements before collocating its facilities on facilities of others, including the city's facilities. A certificate of registration does not prevent a provider from leasing space in or on the provider's system, so long as the sharing of facilities does not cause a violation of law, including the provisions of §§ 95.51 through 95.71. A certificate of registration does not excuse a provider from complying with any provisions of §§ 95.51 through 95.71 or other applicable law. 
(I)  Other Approvals, Permits, and Agreements. In addition to a certificate of registration, providers shall obtain any and all regulatory approvals, permits, authorizations, or licenses necessary for the offering or provision of such services from the appropriate federal, state and local authorities and upon the city's reasonable request, shall provide copies of such documents to the city. Further, a certificate of registration issued pursuant to §§ 95.51 through 95.71 shall not entitle a provider to use, alter, convert to, or interfere with, the facilities, easements, poles, conduits, lines, pipelines, wires, fiber, cable or any other real or personal property of any kind whatsoever under the management or control of the city.

Sec. 95.54. - Reporting requirements. 
(A)  Construction and Major Maintenance Plan. Each provider shall, at the time of initial application and using its best efforts by January 1 of each following year, file a construction and major maintenance plan with the Department of Public Works. Such construction and major maintenance plan shall be provided for all geographical areas requested by the Director of Public Works, up to and including the entire geographical area of the city. It shall be submitted using a format(s) mutually agreeable to the provider and the city and shall contain the information determined by the Director of Public Works to be necessary to facilitate the coordination and reduction in the frequency of construction in the rights-of-way. The construction and major maintenance plan shall include, but not be limited to, all currently scheduled and/or anticipated construction projects for the next calendar year, if none are scheduled or anticipated then the plan shall so state. In an effort to assist providers with the completion of their annual construction and major maintenance plan, the Department of Public Works, on or before November 1 of each year, will send each provider's system representative a descriptive narrative (and any mapping information reasonably available) for all the planned right-of-way improvements and/or scheduled maintenance that the city then currently intends to undertake during the next calendar year. 
(B)  Mapping Data. With the filing of its application for a certificate of registration, a provider shall be required to accurately inform the city of the number of miles (rounded up to the nearest mile) of right-of-way the provider's system then currently occupies and begin submitting to the city all information that currently exists and which can be provided regarding the location of its facilities in the right-of-way in hard copy or in the most advanced format (including, but not limited to, electronic and/or digital format) then currently being used by the provider that is then currently capable of technologically being read (or readily converted to a readable form) by the city. Unless otherwise required by § 95.65(B), a provider shall have up to one year from the date of the provider's initial filing of an application for a certificate of registration to completely submit all the mapping data for a provider's system in the entire geographical area of the city which it owns or over which it has control that are located in any rights-of-way of the city in the most advanced format (including, but not be limited to electronic and/or digital format) then currently being used by the provider that is then currently capable of technologically being read (or readily converted to a readable form) by the city. Anytime after the issuance of a certificate of registration, and upon the reasonable request of the Director of Public Works, a provider shall be required to provide to the city any additional location information for any facilities which it owns or over which it has control that are located in any rights-of-way of the city required by the city. Any and all actual direct, incidental and indirect costs incurred by the city during the process of reviewing, inputting and/or converting a provider's mapping information to comport with the city's then current standard format (whether electronic or otherwise) shall be directly billed to, and must be timely remitted by, the provider. Failure to pay such mapping costs within 60 days of receipt of an invoice shall subject an applicant or provider to revocation of its certificate of registration and the penalties of § 95.99. Further, each provider that has been issued a certificate of registration shall accurately inform the city on or before each subsequent January 1 of the number of miles (rounded up to the nearest mile) of right-of-way the provider's system then occupied as of the immediately previous December 1. The director of public works may, in the future, adopt additional specifications and further define or modify the mapping data requirements under this section for reasons including, but not limited to, changes in technology or the law regarding public disclosure of a provider's mapping information. When the city modifies and/or amends the mapping data requirements, the city shall use best efforts to avoid unreasonably increasing the burden to the providers that may be associated with satisfying the amended mapping requirements. When the mapping requirements of § 95.54(b) are amended, each provider shall be served with a copy of the new specifications or modifications by regular U.S. Mail to the system representative identified in each certificate of registration and in accordance with § 95.71(D); provided, however, that any failure of any provider to actually receive such notice shall not in any way affect the validity or enforceability of said specifications or modifications.

The registration maintenance fee shall be determined and assessed to providers and other persons operating a system or otherwise using and occupying the rights-of-way in accordance with the following process and formula: 
(1)  The city by January 31 of each year shall calculate all actual and incurred costs associated with rights-of-way management, administration and control for the previous calendar year that the city was not able to reasonably recover through construction permit fees or other recovery mechanisms provided for in §§ 95.51 through 95.71. 
(2)  Providers and applicants, as required in § 95.54(b), shall accurately inform the city upon application for a certificate of registration and on or before each subsequent January 1 of the number of miles (rounded up to the nearest mile) of right-of-way the provider's system then occupied as of the immediately previous December 1. 
(3)  The city shall total the entire number of miles of right-of-way reported as being used or occupied by all providers. 
(4)  The city shall divide the calculated costs referenced in § 95.55(A)(1) by the total number of miles of right-of-way reported as being used or occupied by all providers as referenced in § 95.55(A)(3) to arrive at a per-mile cost number. 
(5)  The city shall then multiply each provider's mileage calculation as referenced in § 95.55(A)(2) by the per-mile cost calculation referenced in § 95.55(A)(4). The product shall be a provider's then current annual registration maintenance fee. 
(6)  The city shall perform its annual calculation of registration maintenance fees following receipt of the providers required January 1 mileage report. Registration maintenance fees shall be invoiced to providers on or about February 1 of each calendar year and shall be due 30 days following receipt. 
(7)  Cable companies operating under non-exclusive cable franchises for the purposes of providing cable service, providers of open video system services, which compensate the city under other mechanisms, and GDRTA shall have the mileage of the right-of-way they use and/or occupy included in the calculations described in §§ 95.55, but shall not be required to contribute to the recovery of rights-of-way costs as defined by §§ 95.51 through 95.71 with the exception of permit costs. 
(B)  Timing. Registration maintenance fees shall be paid in advance by January 1 of each calendar year. Registration maintenance fees shall be paid in full for the first year of the registration as a condition of the certificate of registration becoming effective. Fees may be prorated from the effective date of the certificate of registration to the end of the calendar year if less than one full year. 
(C)  Taxes and Assessments. To the extent taxes or other assessments are imposed by taxing authorities on the use of city property as a result of a provider's use or occupation of the rights-of-way, the provider shall be responsible for payment of such taxes. Such payments shall be in addition to any other fees payable pursuant to §§ 95.51 through 95.71 and shall not be considered an offset to, or in lieu of, the fees and charges listed in §§ 95.51 through 95.71. The registration maintenance fee is not in lieu of any tax, fee, or other assessment except as specifically provided in §§ 95.51 through 95.71, or as required by applicable law. 
(D)  Interest on Late Payments. In the event that any registration maintenance fee is not paid to the city by January 31, the provider shall pay a monthly late charge of one percent of the unpaid balance for each month or any portion thereof for which payment is not made. 
(E)  No Accord and Satisfaction. No acceptance by the city of any registration maintenance fee shall be construed as an accord that the amount paid is in fact the correct amount, nor shall such acceptance of such registration maintenance fee payment be construed as a release of any claim the city may have for additional sums payable.

In making such decisions, the city shall strive to the extent possible to accommodate all existing and potential users of the rights-of-way, but shall be guided primarily by considerations of the public health, safety and welfare, the condition of the rights-of-way, the time of year with respect to essential utilities, the protection of existing facilities in the rights-of-way, future city and county plans for public improvements, development projects which have been determined to be in the public interest and nondiscriminatory and competitively neutral treatment among providers. 
(G)  Least Disruptive Technology. All construction or maintenance of facilities shall be accomplished in the manner resulting in the least amount of damage and disruption of the rights-of-way. Specifically, every permittee when performing underground construction, if technically and/or technologically feasible, shall utilize trenchless technology, including, but not limited to, horizontal drilling, directional boring, and microtunneling. In addition, all cable, wire or fiber optic cable installed in the subsurface rights-of-way pursuant to §§ 95.51 through 95.71 may be required to be installed in conduit, and if so required, no cable, wire or fiber optic cable may be installed pursuant to §§ 95.51 through 95.71 using "direct bury" techniques. 
(H)  Special Exceptions. 
(1)  The city may grant a special exception to the requirements of § 95.66(F) and (G) if a permittee, upon application, demonstrates with written evidence that: 
(a)  The exception will not create any threat to the public health, safety or welfare. 
(b)  Permittee demonstrates that the increased economic burden and the potential adverse impact on the permittee's construction schedule resulting from the strict enforcement of the requirement actually or effectively inhibits the ability of the permittee to provide services in the city. 
(c)  The permittee demonstrates that the requirement unreasonably discriminates against the permittee in favor of another person. 
(d)  The requirements requested by the city herein create an unreasonable economic burden for the permittee that outweights any potential benefit to the city. 
(I)  Relocation of Facilities. 
(1)  A provider shall as promptly as reasonably possible and at its own expense, permanently remove and relocate its facilities in the rights-of-way whenever the city finds it necessary to request such removal and relocation. In instances where the city requests removal and/or relocation, the city shall waive all applicable construction permit fees. Upon removal and/or relocation, the provider shall restore the rights-of-way to the same or better condition it was in prior to said removal or relocation. If existing poles are required to be removed and/or relocated, then the existing poles will be replaced with poles of the same or similar size. The Director of Public Works may request relocation and/or removal in order to prevent unreasonable interference by the provider's facilities with: 
(a)  A public improvement undertaken or approved by the city. 
(b)  When the public health, safety, and welfare requires it, or when necessary to prevent interference with the safety and convenience of ordinary travel over the rights-of-way. 
(2)  Notwithstanding the foregoing, a provider who has facilities in the rights-of-way subject to a vacation or narrowing that is not required for the purposes of the city, shall have a permanent easement in such vacated portion or excess portion in conformity with O.R.C. § 723.04.1. 
(3)  If, in the reasonable judgment of the city, a provider fails to commence removal and/or relocation of its facilities as designated by the city, within 30 days after the city's removal order, or if a provider fails to substantially complete such removal, including all associated repair of the rights-of-way of the city, within 12 months thereafter, then, to the extent not inconsistent with applicable law, the city shall have the right to: 
(a)  Declare that all rights, title and interest to the facilities belong to the city with all rights of ownership, including, but not limited to, the right to connect and use the facilities or to effect a transfer of all right, title and interest in the facilities to another person for operation; or 
(b)  Authorize removal of the facilities installed by the provider in, on, over or under the rights-of-way of the city at provider's cost and expense, by another person; however, the city shall have no liability for any damage caused by such action and the provider shall be liable to the city for all reasonable costs incurred by the city in such action; and 
(c)  To the extent consistent with applicable law, any portion of the provider's facilities in, on, over or under the rights-of-way of the city designated by the city for removal and not timely removed by the provider shall belong to and become the property of the city without payment to the provider, and the provider shall execute and deliver such documents, as the city shall request, in form and substance acceptable to the city, to evidence such ownership by the city. 
(J)  Pre-Excavation Facilities Location. 
(1)  Before the start date of any rights-of-way excavation, each provider who has facilities located in the area to be excavated shall be responsible to mark the horizontal and approximate vertical placement of all its facilities. 
(2)  All providers shall notify and work closely with the excavation contractor in an effort to establish the exact location of its facilities and the best procedure for excavation. 
(K)  Rights-of-Way Restoration. 
(1)  The work to be done under the permit, and the restoration of the rights-of-way as required herein, weather permitting, must be completed within the dates specified in the permit. In addition to its own work, the permittee must restore the general area of the work, and the surrounding areas, including trench backfill, paving and its foundations in accordance with the Rules and Regulations for Making Openings in a Public Way, and must inspect the area of the work and use reasonable care to maintain the same condition for 12 months thereafter. If a permittee is unable to timely complete the restoration of rights-of-way due to unreasonable inclement weather conditions, the permittee shall complete the restoration of the rights-of-way as soon as weather conditions make it possible to do so and upon said completion notify the city. 
(2)  In approving an application for a construction permit, the city may choose either to have the permittee restore the rights-of-way or alternatively to restore the rights-of-way itself if the permittee has in the past not abided by requirements of §§ 95.51 through 95.71. 
(3)  If the city chooses to allow permittee to restore the rights-of-way, the permittee shall at the time of application for a construction permit post a construction bond in an amount determined by the city to be sufficient to cover the cost of restoring the rights-of-way to its approximate pre-excavation condition. If, 12 months after completion of the restoration of the rights-of-way, the city determines that the rights-of-way have been properly restored, the surety on the construction bond shall be released. 
(4)  The permittee shall perform the work according to the standards and with the materials specified by the city. The city shall have the authority to prescribe the manner and extent of the restoration, and may do so in written procedures of general application or on a case-by-case basis. The city in exercising this authority shall be guided by the following standards and considerations: the number, size, depth and duration of the excavations, disruptions or damage to the rights-of-way; the traffic volume carried by the rights-of-way; the character of the neighborhood surrounding the rights-of-way; the pre-excavation condition of the rights-of-way; the remaining life-expectancy of the rights-of-way affected by the excavation; whether the relative cost of the method of restoration to the permittee is in reasonable balance with the prevention of an accelerated depreciation of the rights-of-way that would otherwise result from the excavation, disturbance or damage to the rights-of-way; and the likelihood that the particular method of restoration would be effective in slowing the depreciation of the rights-of-way that would otherwise take place. Methods of restoration may include, but are not limited to, patching the affected area, replacement of the rights-of-way base at the affected area, and in the most severe cases; milling, overlay and/or street reconstruction of the entire area of the rights-of-way affected by the work. 
(5)  By restoring the rights-of-way itself, the permittee guarantees its work and shall maintain it for 12 months following its completion. During this 12-month period, it shall, upon notification from the Department of Public Works, correct all restoration work to the extent necessary using the method required by the Department of Public Works. Weather permitting, said work shall be completed within five calendar days of the receipt of the notice from the Department of Public Works. 
(6)  If the permittee fails to restore the rights-of-way in the manner and to the condition required by the city, or fails to satisfactorily and timely complete all repairs required by the city, the city, at its option, may do such work. In that event, the permittee shall pay to the city, within 30 days of billing, the restoration cost of restoring the rights-of-way and any other costs incurred by the city. Upon failure to pay, the city may call upon any bond or letter of credit posted by permittee and/or pursue any and all legal and equitable remedies. 
(L)  Damage to Other Facilities. 
(1)  In the case of an emergency, and if possible after reasonable efforts to contact the provider seeking a timely response, when the city performs work in the rights-of-way and finds it necessary to maintain, support, or move a provider's facilities to protect those facilities, the costs associated therewith will be billed to that provider and shall be paid within 30 days from the date of billing. Upon failure to pay, the city may pursue all legal and equitable remedies in the event a provider does not pay or the city may call upon any bond or letter of credit posted by the permittee and pursue any and all legal or equitable remedies. 
(2)  Each provider shall be responsible for the cost of repairing any facilities in the rights-of-way which it or its facilities damage. Each provider shall be responsible for the cost of repairing any damage to the facilities of another provider caused during the city's response to an emergency occasioned by that provider's facilities. 
(M)  Rights-of-Way Vacation. 
(1)  If the city vacates a rights-of-way which contains the facilities of a provider, such vacation shall be subject to the provisions of O.R.C. § 723.04.1. 
(2)  If the vacation requires the relocation of the provider's facilities; and 
(a)  If the vacation proceedings are initiated by the provider, the provider must pay the relocation costs; or 
(b)  If the vacation proceedings are initiated by the city or other person or persons, for a public purpose of the city, the provider or permittee must pay the relocation costs unless otherwise agreed to by the city, the provider or permittee. 
(N)  Installation Requirements. The excavation, backfilling, restoration, and all other work performed in the rights-of-way shall be performed in conformance with specifications as promulgated by the city and in accordance with the minimum standards set forth in the Rules and Regulations for Making Openings in a Public Way. 
(O)  Inspection. When the construction under any permit hereunder is completed, the permittee shall notify the Department of Public Works. 
(1)  The permittee shall make the construction site available to the inspector and to all others as authorized by law for inspection at all reasonable times during the execution and upon completion of the construction. 
(2)  At the time of inspection, the inspector may order the immediate cessation of any work which poses a serious threat to the life, health, safety or well-being of the public, violates any law or which violates the term and conditions of the permit and/or Chapter 95 of this Code. 
(3)  The inspector may issue an order to the permittee for any work which does not conform to the permit and/or applicable standards, conditions or codes. The order shall state that failure to correct the violation will be cause for revocation of the permit. The order may be served on the permittee as provided in § 95.71(D). An order may be appealed to the Director of Public Works. The decision of the Director of Public Works may be appealed to the City Manager whose decision shall be final. If not appealed, within ten days after issuance of the order, the provider shall present proof to the Director of Public Works that the violation has been corrected. If such proof has not been presented within the required time, the Director of Public Works may revoke the permit pursuant to § 95.68(E). 
(P)  Other Obligations. 
(1)  Obtaining a construction permit does not relieve permittee of its duty to obtain all other necessary permits, licenses, and authority and to pay all fees required by any other city, county, state or federal laws. 
(2)  Permittee shall comply with all requirements of all laws, including the Ohio Utility Protection Service. 
(3)  Permittee shall perform all work in conformance with all applicable laws and standards, and is responsible for all work done in the rights-of-way pursuant to its permit, regardless of who performs the work. 
(4)  No rights-of-way obstruction or excavation may be performed when seasonally prohibited or when conditions are unreasonable for such work, except in the case of an emergency as outlined in § 95.68(D)(1). 
(5)  Permittee shall not obstruct a rights-of-way so that the natural free and clear passage of water through the gutters or other waterways shall be interfered with. 
(6)  Private vehicles other than necessary construction vehicles may not be parked within or adjacent to a permit area. The loading or unloading of trucks adjacent to a permit area is prohibited unless specifically authorized by the permit. 
(Q)  Undergrounding Required. Any owner of property abutting upon a street or alley where service facilities are now located underground and where the service connection is at the property line, shall install or cause others to install underground any service delivery infrastructure from the property line to the buildings or other structures on such property to which such service is supplied.

(a)  The routine repair or replacement of facilities with like facilities not involving construction and not requiring traffic control for more than 30 minutes at any one location; or 
(b)  Construction on thoroughfares and arterials between the hours of 9:00 a.m. and 3:00 p.m. that does not impede traffic and does not involve a street, pavement, curb, or sidewalk cut without first obtaining the approval of the Director of Public Works; or 
(c)  Construction other than on thoroughfares and arterials that takes less than eight contiguous hours to complete, does not impede traffic and does not involve a street, pavement, curb, or sidewalk cut without first obtaining the approval of the Director of Public Works; or 
(d)  Any other construction or work done in the rights-of-way that the Director of Public Works determines to be minor maintenance. 
(2)  A minor maintenance permit allows the minor maintenance permittee to perform all minor maintenance in any part of the rights-of-way as required. 
(3)  A minor maintenance permit is valid from the date of issuance until December 31 of the year in which the minor maintenance permit was issued, at which time the minor maintenance permit shall expire. 
(4)  Upon the city's request, a minor maintenance permit must be produced within 12 hours or the first earliest business hour, whichever is later. For purposes of this chapter, business hour shall mean the hours between 8:00 a.m. and 5:00 p.m. during a business day. 
(5)  A minor maintenance permit by itself shall under no circumstances provide a permittee with the ability to cut the street, pavement, curb, or sidewalk without first obtaining the approval of the Director of Public Works. 
(B)  Minor Maintenance Permit Applications. Application for a minor maintenance permit shall be made to the Director of the Department of Public Works. In addition to any information required by the Director of Public Works, all minor maintenance permit applications shall contain, and will only be considered complete upon compliance with the following provisions:

(2)  The city may impose reasonable conditions upon the issuance of the minor maintenance permit and the performance of the minor maintenance permittee thereunder in order to protect the public health, safety and welfare, to insure the structural integrity of the rights-of-way, to protect the property and safety of other users of the rights-of-way, and to minimize the disruption and inconvenience to the traveling public. 
(D)  Minor Maintenance Permit Fees. The Director of Public Works shall not charge a fee for the issuance of the minor maintenance permit but may revoke the minor maintenance permit as any other permit may be revoked under this chapter. 
(Ord. 30188-02, passed 12-4-02) 
Sec. 95.68. - Enforcement of permit obligation. 
(A)  Mandatory Denial of Permit. Except in the case of an emergency, no permit will be granted: 
(1)  To any person who has not yet made an application; or 
(2)  To any person who has outstanding debt owed to the city; or 
(3)  To any person as to whom there exists grounds for the revocation of a permit; or 
(4)  If, in the discretion of the Director of Public Works, the issuance of a permit for the particular date and/or time would cause a conflict or interfere with an exhibition, celebration, festival, or any other event. The Director of Public Works, in exercising this discretion, shall be guided by the safety and convenience of ordinary travel of the public over the rights-of-way, and by considerations relating to the public health, safety and welfare. 
(B)  Permissive Denial of Permit. The Director of Public Works may deny a permit in order to protect the public health, safety and welfare, to prevent interference with the safety and convenience of ordinary travel over the rights-of-way, or when necessary to protect the rights-of-way and its users. 
(1)  The Director of Public Works, in its discretion, may consider one or more of the following factors: 
(a)  The extent to which rights-of-way space where the permit is sought is available; and/or 
(b)  The competing demands for the particular space in the rights-of-way; and/or 
(c)  The availability of other locations in the rights-of-way or in other rights-of-way for the proposed facilities; and/or 
(d)  The applicability of §§ 95.51 through 95.71 or other regulations of the rights-of-way that affect location of facilities in the rights-of-way; and/or 
(e)  The degree of compliance of the provider with the terms and conditions of its certificate of registration, §§ 95.51 through 95.71, and other applicable ordinances and regulations; and/or 
(f)  The degree of disruption to surrounding communities and businesses that will result from the use of that part of the rights-of-way; and/or 
(g)  The condition and age of the rights-of-way, and whether and when it is scheduled for total or partial re-construction; and/or 
(h)  The balancing of the costs of disruption to the public and damage to the rights-of-way, against the benefits to that part of the public served by the expansion into additional parts of the rights-of-way; and/or 
(i)  Whether such applicant or its agent has failed within the past three years to comply, or is presently not in full compliance with, the requirements of §§ 95.51 through 95.71. or, if applicable, any other law. 
(C)  Discretionary Issuance of Permit. 
(1)  Notwithstanding the provisions of §§ 95.68(A)(1) and 95.68(A)(2), the Director of Public Works may issue a permit in any case where the permit is necessary:

(b)  To allow such customer to materially improve its service; or 
(c)  To allow a new economic development project to be granted a permit under this section. 
(2)  To be granted a permit under this section, the permit applicant must not have had knowledge of the hardship, the plans for improvement of service, or the development project when it was required to submit its list of next year projects. 
(D)  Work Done Without A Permit in Emergency Situations. 
(1)  Each provider shall, as soon as is practicable, immediately notify the Director of Public Works of any event regarding its facilities which it considers to be an emergency. The provider may proceed to take whatever actions are necessary in order to respond to the emergency. Within five business days, unless otherwise extended by the Director of Public Works, after the occurrence or discovery of the emergency (whichever is later), the provider shall apply for the necessary permits, pay the fees associated therewith and fulfill the rest of the requirements necessary to bring itself into compliance with §§ 95.51 through 95.71 for any and all actions taken in response to the emergency. In the event that the city becomes aware of an emergency regarding a provider's facilities, the city shall use best efforts to contact the provider or the system representative of each provider affected, or potentially affected, by the emergency. In any event, the city may take whatever action it deems necessary in order to respond to the emergency, the cost of which shall be borne by the provider whose facilities caused the emergency. 
(2)  Except in the case of an emergency, any provider who constructs in, on, above, within, over, below or through a rights-of-way without a valid permit must subsequently obtain a permit, pay double the normal fee for said permit, pay double all the other fees required by the R.C.G.O., deposit with the city the fees necessary to correct any damage to the rights-of-way and comply with all of the requirements of §§ 95.51 through 95.71. 
(E)  Revocation of Permits. 
(1)  Permittees hold permits issued pursuant to this Code as a privilege and not as a right.

(d)  The failure to maintain the required construction or removal bonds and/or insurance; or 
(e)  The failure to obtain and/or maintain, when required, a certificate of Registration; or 
(f)  The failure to complete the construction in a timely manner; or 
(g)  The failure to correct a condition of an order issued pursuant to § 95.66 (O)(3). 
(2)  If the Director of Public Works determines that the permittee has committed a substantial breach of a term or condition of any law or any condition of the permit, the Director of Public Works shall serve a written demand upon the permittee to remedy such violation. The demand shall state that continued violations may be cause for revocation of the permit. Upon a substantial breach, as stated above, the Director of Public Works may place additional or revised conditions on the permit. 
(3)  By the close of the next business day following receipt of notification of the breach, permittee shall contact the Director of Public Works with a plan, acceptable to the Director of Public Works, for its correction. Permittee's failure to so contact the Director of Public Works, or the permittee's failure to submit an acceptable plan, or permittee's failure to reasonably implement the approved plan, shall be cause for immediate revocation of the permit. 
(4)  If a permittee commits a second substantial default as outlined above, permittee's permit will automatically be revoked and the permittee will not be allowed further permits for up to and including one full year, except for emergency repairs. 
(5)  If a permit is revoked, the permittee shall also reimburse the city for the city's reasonable costs, including restoration costs and the costs of collection and reasonable attorneys' fees incurred in connection with such revocation. 
(Ord. 30188-02, passed 12-4-02) 
Sec. 95.69. - Construction and removal bonds. 
(A)  Construction Bond. Prior to the commencement of any construction, a construction permittee, excluding the city and the county, shall deposit with the Director of Public Works an irrevocable, unconditional letter of credit and/or surety bond in an amount determined by the Director of Public Works to be appropriate based upon fair and reasonable criteria. Unless a construction default, problem or deficiency involves an emergency or endangers the safety of the general public, the Director of Public Works shall serve written notice to the construction permittee detailing the construction default, problem or deficiency. If the Director of Public Works determines that correction or repair of the construction default, problem or deficiency has not occurred or has not been substantially initiated within ten calendar days after the date following service and notification and detailing the construction default, problem or deficiency, then the city may attach the letter of credit or surety bond. Upon attachment, written notice shall be served on the construction permittee by the Director of Public Works. 
(B)  Removal Bond. Upon issuance of a certificate of registration and continuously thereafter, and until 120 days after a provider's facilities have been removed from the rights-of-way, (unless the Director of Public Works notifies the provider that a reasonably longer period shall apply), a provider shall deposit with the Director of Public Works and maintain an irrevocable, unconditional letter of credit or surety bond in an amount equal to or greater than $50,000.00, the Director of Public Works shall make all reasonable efforts to allow provider a period of five calendar days after serving notification in writing to correct or repair any default, problem or deficiency prior to the Director of Public Works attachment of the letter of credit or surety bond regarding the removal of facilities. Upon attachment, written notice shall be provided to the provider by the Director of Public Works. 
(C)  Blanket Bond. In lieu of the construction bond required by § 95.69(A) and the removal bond required by § 95.69(b), provider may deposit with the Director of Public Works an irrevocable, unconditional letter of credit and/or surety bond in the amount of $5,000,000.00. Unless a construction default, problem or deficiency involves an emergency or endangers the safety of the general public, the Director of Public Works shall make all reasonable effort to allow permittee a period of five calendar days after sending notification in writing to correct or repair any default, problem or deficiency prior to Director of Public Works' attachment of the letter of credit or surety bond. 
(D)  Self Bonding. In lieu of the construction bond required by § 95.69(A), the removal bond required by § 95.69(b) and the blanket bond required by § 95.69(C), those providers maintaining a book value in excess of $20,000,000.00 may submit a statement to the Director of Public Works requesting to self-bond. If approval to self-bond is granted, a provider shall assure the city that such self-bonding shall provide the city with no less protection and security than would have been afforded to the city by a third party surety providing provider with the types and amounts of bonds detailed in the above named sections. This statement shall include: 
(1)  Audited financial statements for the previous year; and 
(2)  A description of the applicant's self-bonding program; and 
(3)  Other applicable and pertinent information as reasonably requested by the Director of Public Works. 
(E)  Purposes. 
(1)  The bonds required by this section, and any self bonding to the extent it has been permitted, shall serve as security for: 
(a)  The faithful performance by the permittee or provider of all terms, conditions and obligations of §§ 95.51 through 95.71; and 
(b)  Any expenditure, damage, or loss incurred by the city occasioned by the permittee or provider's violation of §§ 95.51 through 95.71 of this Code or its failure to comply with all rules, regulations, orders, permits and other directives of the city issued pursuant to §§ 95.51 through 95.71; and 
(c)  The payment of all compensation due to the city, including permit fees; and 
(d)  The payment of premiums (if any) for the liability insurance required pursuant to §§ 95.51 through 95.71; and 
(e)  The removal of facilities from the rights-of-way pursuant to §§ 95.51 through 95.71; and 
(f)  The payment to the city of any amounts for which the permittee or provider is liable that are not paid by it's insurance or other surety; and 
(g)  The payment of any other amounts which become due to the city pursuant to §§ 95.51 through 95.71 or the law. 
(F)  Form. The bond documents required by this section and any replacement bond documents shall contain the following endorsement: 
"It is hereby understood and agreed that this bond may not be canceled or not renewed by the surety nor the intention to cancel or not to renew be stated by the surety until 90 days after completion of construction of the facilities and, notwithstanding the foregoing, shall in no case be canceled or not renewed by the surety until at least 90 days' written notice to city of surety's intention to cancel or not renew this bond." 
(Ord. 30188-02, passed 12-4-02) 
Sec. 95.70. - Indemnification and liability. 
(A)  City Does Not Accept Liability. By reason of the acceptance of an application, the grant of a permit or the issuance of a certificate of registration, the city does not assume any liability: 
(a)  For injuries to persons, damage to property, or loss of service claims; or 
(b)  For claims or penalties of any sort resulting from the installation, presence, maintenance or operation of facilities. 
(B)  Indemnification. 
(1)  By applying for and being issued a certificate of registration with the city a provider is required, or by accepting a permit a permittee is required to defend, indemnify, and hold harmless the city's agents, elected officials, officers, employees, volunteers and subcontractors from all costs, liabilities, claims, and suits for damages of any kind arising out of the construction, presence, installation, maintenance, repair or operation of its facilities, or out of any activity undertaken in or near a rights-of-way, whether any act or omission complained of is authorized, allowed, or prohibited by a permit. A provider or permittee shall not bring, nor cause to be brought, any action, suit or other proceeding claiming damages, or seeking any other relief against the city's agents, elected officials, officers, employees, volunteers, and subcontractors for any claim nor for any award arising out of the presence, installation, maintenance or operation of its facilities, or any activity undertaken in or near a rights-of-way, whether the act or omission complained of is authorized, allowed or prohibited by a permit. This section is not, as to third parties, a waiver of any defense or immunity otherwise available to the provider, permittee or to the city; and the provider or permittee, in defending any action on behalf of the city, shall be entitled to assert in any action every defense or immunity that the city could assert in its own behalf. Any and all exercise of the above shall be consistent with, but not limited to, the following: 
(a)  To the fullest extent permitted by law, all providers and permittees shall, at their sole cost and expense, fully indemnify, defend and hold harmless the city, its elected officials, agents, officers, employees, volunteers and subcontractors from and against any and all lawsuits, claims (including without limitation worker's compensation claims against the city or others), causes of actions, actions, liability, and judgments for injury or damages (including, but not limited to, expenses for reasonable legal fees and disbursements assumed by the city in connection therewith); and 
(i)  Persons or property, in any way arising out of or through the acts or omissions of provider or permittee, its subcontractors, agents or employees attributable to the occupation by the provider or permittee of the rights-of-way, to which provider's or permittee's negligence shall in any way contribute, and regardless of whether the city's negligence or the negligence of any other party shall have contributed to such claim, cause of action, judgment, injury or damage; and 
(ii)  Arising out of any claim for invasion of the right of privacy, for defamation of person, firm or corporation, or the violation or infringement of any copyright, trademark, trade name, service mark or patent or any other right of any person, firm and corporation by the provider, but excluding claims arising out of or related to city programming; and 
(iii)  Arising out of provider or permittee's failure to comply with the provisions of law applicable to provider or permittee in its business hereunder.

(c)  A lender may not charge a fee and/or costs for a loan transaction as a whole, or for any service performed in connection with the loan transaction, where the fees and/or costs exceed the fees and/or costs available in similar transactions by like consumers in the city by more than 20 percent;

"WARNING-BALLOON PAYMENT LOAN: This loan will not be fully paid off by the regular periodic payments.

Sec. 112.41. - Predatory lending practices prohibited. 
(A)  Prohibited Conduct. 
(1)  Issuing Predatory Loans. No lender shall make, issue, or arrange a predatory loan or assist others in doing so. A lender who, when acting in good faith, fails to comply with this section will not be deemed to have violated this section if the person establishes that either: 
(a)  Within 30 days of the loan closing and prior to institution of any action under § 112.43 the borrower is notified of the compliance failure, appropriate restitution is made, and whatever adjustments are necessary are made to the loan to either, at the choice of the borrower: 
(1)  Make the predatory loan satisfy the requirements of § 112.40; or, 
(2)  Change the terms of the loan in a manner beneficial to the borrower so that the loan will not longer be considered a predatory loan subject to the provisions of § 112.40; or, 
(b)  The compliance failure was not intentional and resulted from a bona fide error notwithstanding the maintenance of procedures reasonably adapted to avoid such errors, and within 60 days after the discovery of the compliance failure and prior to the institution of any action under § 112.43, the borrower is notified of the compliance failure, appropriate restitution is made, and whatever adjustments are necessary are made to the loan to either, at the choice of the borrower: 
(1)  Make the predatory loan satisfy the requirements of § 112.40; or, 
(2)  Change the terms of the loan in a manner beneficial to the borrower so that the loan will no longer be considered a predatory loan subject to the provisions of § 112.40. Examples of a bona fide error include clerical, calculation, computer malfunction and programming, and printing errors. An error of legal judgment with respect to a lender's obligations under § 112.40 are not bona fide errors. 
(2)  Lending Without Due Regard to Repayment. No lender shall make, issue or originate any high cost loan if the lender does not reasonably believe at the time the loan is consummated that the borrower or borrowers will be able to make the scheduled payments to repay the obligation based upon a consideration of their current and expected income, current obligations, employment status, and other financial resources (other than the borrower's equity in the dwelling which secures repayment of the loan). A borrower shall be presumed to be able to make the scheduled payments to repay the obligation if, at the time the loan is consummated, or at the time of the first rate adjustment in the case of a lower introductory interest rate, the borrower's scheduled monthly payments on the loan (including principal, interest, taxes, insurance and assessments), combined with the scheduled payments for all other debt, do not exceed 50 percent of the borrower's documented and verified monthly gross income, and the borrower has sufficient "residual income" as defined in the guidelines established in 38 C.F.R. §36.4337(e) and VA form 26-2393 to pay essential monthly expenses after paying the scheduled payments and any additional debt. 
(3)  Payments to Home Improvement Contractors. A lender shall not pay proceeds of a high cost loan to any home improvement contractor, and a home improvement contractor may not receive the proceeds of a high cost loan, other than: 
(a)  By an instrument payable solely to the borrower or jointly to the borrower and the contractor; or, 
(b)  At the election of the borrower, by a third party escrow agent in accordance with terms established in a written agreement signed by the borrower, the lender, and the home improvement contractor before the disbursement date.

(2)  Each day in which a borrower is assessed with interest on the principal loan amount of a high cost or predatory loan shall constitute a separate violation of § 112.41. 
(B)  Loss of City Contracts. No person or business entity shall be awarded a contract with the city or a city agency, if the person, business entity, or any of its affiliates is a predatory lender. 
(C)  Unfair or Deceptive Lending Practice. 
(1)  The making, issuing, or arranging of a high cost or predatory loan transaction in violation of any provision of § 112.41 is hereby declared an unfair or deceptive lending act or practice under the Ohio Revised Code, and is unlawful. 
(2)  The provisions of § 112.41 shall apply to any lender who in bad faith attempts to avoid the application of these sections by: 
(a)  Dividing any high cost or predatory loan into separate parts for the purpose and with the intent of evading any provision of § 112.40; or, 
(b)  Any other such subterfuge. 
(D)  Private Right of Action. 
(1)  Notwithstanding the provisions of §§ 112.43(A) through 112.43(C), any individual who becomes obligated on a high cost or predatory loan may bring an action for damages and/or equitable relief in a court of competent jurisdiction against any lender who violates § 112.41. Judgment shall be entered for actual damages, but in no case less than the amount of home equity the individual has lost as a result of the high cost or predatory loan, as determined by the court, rescission of the high cost or predatory loan, in accordance with the rescission provisions of the federal Truth in Lending Act, reasonable attorneys fees and court costs. 
(2)  Nothing in § 112.43 limits the rights of the injured person to recover damages or seek equitable relief under any other applicable laws or legal theory. 
(Ord. 29990-01, passed 7-11-01) 
Sec. 112.44. - Severability. 
    The provisions of §§ 112.40 to 112.43 are severable, and if any phrase, clause, sentence, or provision is declared to be invalid or is preempted by federal or state law or regulation, the validity of the remaining provisions of §§ 112.40 to 112.43 shall not be affected thereby. If any provision of §§ 112.40 to 112.43 is declared inapplicable to any specific category, type, or kind of loan transaction, the provision shall nonetheless continue to apply with respect to all other loan transactions.

(3)  Whether the System has the ability to accommodate, both in channel capacity and in technological performance, the current service developments in the market; 
(4)  Whether the rebuild/upgrade and the provision of such service would present a clear and convincingly unreasonable financial burden to either the Grantee and/or to the Subscribers and any other matters relevant to the financial feasibility and practicality of rebuild/upgrade. 
(D)  As a part of the review process for a requested delay the city may require the services of independent consultants to evaluate the condition of the System and any financial and other date pertinent to the rebuild/upgrade. Such consultants shall be mutually chosen by the city and Grantee, with the cost to be equally borne by the city and the Grantee.

DIVISION 2. - BASIC CABLE SERVICE AND EQUIPMENT RATES 

Sec. 116.100. - Scope; application. 
    This [division] governs the regulation of rates for basic cable service and equipment within the city for any Franchisee which has been notified that the city has been certified to regulate its basic service and equipment rates; and the city has adopted regulations governing regulation of basic service and equipment rates. The provisions set forth below constitute those regulations and are intended to be consistent with all Federal Communications Commission (FCC) regulations governing the regulation of basic service rates and equipment, and the city will interpret the provisions so that they are consistent with FCC regulations, as if those regulations were set forth in full herein. The Franchisee is prohibited under this chapter from engaging in any activity which is prohibited under FCC rules, as if those rules were set forth in full herein. For purposes of these provisions, the terms "basic service" or basic cable service" has the same meaning as the term "basic service" at 47 C.F.R. § 76.901, and the term "equipment" refers to all equipment and services subject to regulation under 47 C.F.R. § 76.923. 
(Ord. 28716-93, passed 9-1-93) 
Sec. 116.101. - Initial filings by Franchisees. 
(A)  Filings; when made. Upon receiving notification from the city that its basic service and equipment rates are subject to regulation, the Franchisee must make a rate filing within 30 days of the notification, (but is not required to make a filing earlier than November 15, 1993) explaining its then-existing basic service and equipment rates for all rates in all customer classifications. Once a Franchisee has been so notified, it may not thereafter increase its rates for basic service and equipment without the prior approval of the city. This requirement applies in all cases, including rate increases which are announced, but not implemented, prior to the date the Franchisee was notified that its rates were subject to regulation. An "increase" occurs when there is an increase in rates or a decrease in programming or customer services. Rate filings proposing rate increases must be filed for review at least 30 days in advance of the proposed effective date of the increase. A rate filing shall be considered filed for review on the date the rate filing and all required copies are received by the cable administrator. Seven copies of each rate filing (including all supporting materials) must be submitted. This filing requirement does not alter or eliminate any other notice requirement. 
(B)  Filing; where made. Every rate filing must be submitted to the Cable Administrator. 
(C)  Filing; contents. Subject to any FCC regulations governing the burden of proof, a rate filing submitted by a Franchisee must show that the rates the Franchisee proposes to charge for basic service and equipment are reasonable. Except as inconsistent with FCC rules: 
(1)  The rate filing must contain all applicable FCC forms and these forms must be correctly completed. The pages of each rate filing must be numbered sequentially. 
(2)  Every rate filing must be accompanied by a cover letter which states whether the filing explains existing rates or proposes a rate increase. The cover letter must also identify any rate that is based, in whole or in part, upon cost of service as set forth in subsection (C)(4) of this section, and identify any pages of the rate filing that contain information that the Franchisee claims is proprietary. If an increase is sought, the cover letter must state whether any part of the proposed increase is based on an inflation adjustment or an increase in external costs. The cover letter should also contain a brief, narrative description of any proposed changes in rates or services. 
(3)  If different rates for basic service or equipment are proposed for different classes of customers, the filing must show that the classifications and the differences in the rate charged are reasonable and consistent with federal law. 
(4)  In addition to other information the city requires the Franchisee to provide, and unless the city grants a waiver of this provision, a Franchisee that seeks to explain all or any part of its rates based upon its cost of service must to the extent the requirement is consistent with FCC regulations: 
(a)  Submit a complete cost of service analysis that shows all expenses it incurs, and all revenues derived from operating the System, directly or indirectly, by the Franchisee or any person that constitutes a cable operator of the System within the meaning of 47 U.S.C. § 522(4). The cost of service must identify the accounting level (as that term is used in 47 C.F.R. § 76.924(d)) at which each expense or revenue item identified was aggregated and also must clearly show how the expense or revenue was allocated. The Franchisee may not include costs at an accounting level unless it also includes all revenues from that same level attributable to the System or to a group of Systems of which the System serving the city is a part. 
(b)  Identify the name and address of any entity with which it has a contract, other than a programmer, which derives revenues from the System, and must state whether and how the revenues of that entity were included in the cost of service. In addition, the cost of service shall clearly show the derivation of a proposed charge per channel and the application of that charge to yield a basic service rate. 
(c)  Show and support the derivation and allocation of any amounts included in the rate for: 
1.  Operation and maintenance expenses; 
2.  Administrative and general expenses; 
3.  Programming expenses (identifying retransmission consent costs and copyright fees separately); 
4.  Costs for PEG access and any institutional network; 
5.  Franchise fee expenses; 
6.  Investment in the System and associated depreciation; 
7.  Other expenses, including federal, state and local taxes, itemized; and 
8.  The proposed return on equity and actual interest expense paid by the Franchisee. 
(d)  The replacement cost of a comparable System must be identified and supported. 
(e)  Notwithstanding the foregoing, a Franchisee is not required to include equipment rates in the cost of service analysis specified in subsection (C)(4) of this section, and instead shall initially complete, submit and support the costs of equipment using applicable FCC forms. Any cost of service analysis submitted to explain basic service rates must show that the cost of service does not include equipment costs. 
(D)  Initial city review. 
(1)  After receiving a rate filing, the Cable Administrator shall promptly publish a notice that a filing has been received and that, except for those parts which may be withheld as proprietary in accordance with § 116.108, it is available for public review. The notice shall state that interested parties may comment on the filing, and shall provide interested parties seven days to submit written comments on the filing to the Cable Administrator. The Cable Administrator shall submit the comments received and its recommendations for action to the City Commission and shall make those recommendations available for public inspection. The Franchisee may submit a response to public comments or staff recommendations, but must do so no later than three business days after the staff recommendations are submitted to the City Commission. The response shall be filed with the Cable Administrator, and if submitted in a timely fashion, the Cable Administrator shall forward a copy to the City Commission. 
(2)  Within 30 days of the date of the filing, the City Commission shall issue a written order ("rate order"), which may be in any lawful form, approving the proposed rate in whole or in part; denying the proposed rate in whole or in part; or tolling the proposed rate in whole or in part. If the City Commission tolls the rate in whole or in part, its rate order shall explain that it requires additional time to review the rate filing, identify generally any then-known deficiencies in the Franchisee's filing, and state that the Franchisee may cure any deficiency in its filing by submitting a supplementary filing as provided in § 116.102. With respect to existing rates, tolling means the rates may remain in effect, subject to refund; with respect to proposed rate changes, tolling means the portion of the proposed rate change that is tolled may not go into effect. 
(Ord. 28716-93, passed 9-1-93) 
Sec. 116.102. - Supplementary filings. 
(A)  If a proposed rate is tolled in whole or in part, the Franchisee shall submit a supplementary filing to the Cable Administrator within 20 days from the date the tolling order issues. A supplementary filing must contain corrections, if any, to its filing (including any required supplement to its cost of service filing); any responses to information filed by interested parties; a response to the recommendations of the staff; or any additional information necessary to support the proposed rate. A supplementary filing also must contain such information as the city directs the Franchisee to provide. 
(B)  Unless the city grants a waiver of this provision, a Franchisee who claims that it is entitled to a rate increase based in whole or in part upon the adjustments for inflation and external costs contemplated by 47 C.F.R. § 76.922(d)(1)-(2) must submit the following: 
(1)  A calculation showing how each part of the inflation adjustment was derived. 
(2)  A statement itemizing: 
(a)  Each external cost element (as defined by FCC regulations); 
(b)  The dollar amount of those external cost elements for the two calendar years prior to the date of the filing and the year in which the filing is made; and 
(c)  The projected dollar amount of the external cost elements for the remainder of the year in which the filing is made, and for the following calendar year; and 
(d)  Any increases in revenues, in whatever form, from programming services. 
(3)  If the increase is attributable to any increases in programming service cost: 
(a)  The contract for each programming service whose cost has increased; 
(b)  A sworn statement identifying each programming service whose costs increased, if the programmer is an affiliate of the Franchisee (as defined by FCC regulations); and 
(c)  For any contract that has been in effect less than 12 months, the prior contract for the service. 
(4)  A sworn statement by the Franchisee's chief financial officer or an independent, certified public accountant affirming that: 
(a)  He or she has examined all external costs (including all programming costs) and has offset against any increase claimed, the amount of any decreases in external costs, and the amount by which any increase in external costs was below the GNP-P1, as required by 47 C.F.R. § 76.922(d)(2); 
(b)  The Franchisee has sought to recover only any external cost to the extent that it exceeded the GNP-P1; and 
(c)  The Franchisee has not attempted to recover any increase in the cost of programming purchased by an affiliate except as provided in 47 C.F.R. 576.922(d)(2)(vi). 
(C)  Upon receiving the supplementary filing, the Cable Administrator shall promptly publish a notice that a filing has been received and that it is available for public review (except those parts which may be withheld as proprietary as defined in § 116.108). The notice shall state that interested parties may comment on the filing, and shall provide interested parties 20 days to submit written comments on the filing to the Cable Administrator. The Cable Administrator shall submit the comments received and its recommendations for action to the City Commission. The recommendations shall be made available for public inspection. The Franchisee may submit a response to public comments or staff recommendations, but must do so no later than ten days after the staff recommendations are submitted to the City Commission. The response shall be filed with the Cable Administrator, and if submitted in a timely fashion, the Cable Administrator shall forward a copy to the City Commission. 
(D)  The city shall issue a written order ("rate order"), which may be in any lawful form, approving the proposed rate in whole or in part; denying the proposed rate in whole or in part; or allowing the rate to go into effect in whole or in part, subject to refund. If the City Commission issues an order allowing the rates to go into effect subject to refund, it shall also direct the Franchisee to maintain an accounting in accordance with 47 C.F.R. § 76.933. A rate order shall be issued 90 days after the tolling order for any rate the Franchisee justifies based on the FCC benchmark. The rate order shall be issued within 150 days of the tolling order for any rate the Franchisee justifies with a cost of service showing. 
(Ord. 28716-93, passed 9-1-93) 
Sec. 116.103. - Provisions generally applicable to rate orders. 
(A)  Any rate order of the City Commission shall be effective upon adoption. Each rate order shall be released to the public and the Franchisee. In any case where the City Commission approves, denies, or tolls a rate, orders that a rate may go into effect subject to refund, orders refunds, or establishes rates, a public notice shall be published stating that the rate order has been issued and is available for review. Any such rate order shall be in writing. 
(B)  The City Commission may take any action as part of any rate order or by any other means that it is not prohibited by federal law from taking to protect the public interest. Such action may include prescribing rates, requiring and/or enforcing refunds, imposing forfeitures and penalties directly or through the city's delegated representatives, or any other such action to protect the public interest. If the Franchisee seeks to support a rate based upon cost of service, the city will establish a rate that provides the Franchisee an opportunity to recover the reasonable costs associated with providing basic cable service, including a reasonable profit. An expense or investment is not presumed reasonable merely because the Franchisee has incurred or made it. A Franchisee is not entitled to recover monopoly rents in any form. Any order prescribing a rate must explain why the Franchisee's proposed rate was unreasonable, and why the prescribed rate is reasonable. However, before prescribing a rate or ordering a refund to Subscribers, the City Commission shall ensure that the Franchisee has had notice and opportunity to comment on the proposed rate or refunds. If the recommendations of the Cable Administrator propose a refund or a rate, then mailing a copy of the recommendation to the Franchisee at the time it is submitted to the City Commission shall be deemed to provide the Franchisee this notice, and the Franchisee must comment on the refund or rate in its response to the recommendations. 
(C)  No order approving or setting a rate using the FCC benchmarks shall be interpreted to establish a just and reasonable rate to Subscribers. Every such rate approved or established shall be subject to further reduction and refund to the extent permitted under applicable laws and regulations, as the same may be amended from time to time. By way of illustration and not limitation, should the FCC reduce the benchmarks, the city shall have the right to reduce a Franchisee's rates and to require the Franchisee to refund any amounts collected above the benchmark, except to the extent prohibited by federal law. 
(Ord. 28716-93, passed 9-1-93) 
Sec. 116.104. - Franchisees' duties. 
(A)  A Franchisee must implement remedial requirements, including, but not limited to, implementing prospective rate reductions and refunds within 60 days of the date the City Commission issues an order mandating a remedy. 
(B)  Within 90 days of the date an order mandating a remedy is issued, a Franchisee must file a certification, signed by an authorized representative of the cable company stating: 
(1)  Whether the Franchisee has complied fully with all provisions of the City Commission's order; 
(2)  Describing in detail the precise measures taken to implement the City Commission's order; and 
(3)  Showing how refunds (including interest) were calculated and distributed. 
(C)  A Franchisee must keep books and records of account so that it is able to refund any amounts owed to Subscribers. 
(D)  It shall be a violation of this division for a Franchisee to knowingly withhold information or make an incomplete filing under applicable law. 
(Ord. 28716-93, passed 9-1-93) 
Sec. 116.105. - Information requests. 
(A)  A Franchisee and any other entity that has records of revenues or expenses that are allocated to the Franchisee's System must respond to requests for information from the city within the deadlines established by the city. A Franchisee is responsible for ensuring that such other entity responds to the city's request. 
(B)  Because federal law limits the time available for an initial response to a filing by a Franchisee, the Franchisee must be prepared to respond to requests for information regarding its filing within five days of the date an information request is mailed to it. The information may include the information the Franchisee would be required to provide as part of any supplementary filing. 
(Ord. 28716-93, passed 9-1-93) 
Sec. 116.106. - Duties of cable administrator. 
(A)  The City Manager may designate a person or department to serve as a Cable Administrator who shall be responsible for administrating the provisions herein. Without limitation and by way of illustration: 
(1)  The Cable Administrator shall ensure that notices are given to the public and each Franchisee, as required herein and by FCC regulations. 
(2)  The Cable Administrator may submit requests for information to the Franchisee and establish deadlines for response to them, as provided in §§ 116.104 and 116.105. 
(3)  The Cable Administrator may, for good cause, waive any provision herein, or extend any deadline for filings or responses, except as to such matters that are mandatory under FCC regulations. 
(4)  The Cable Administrator shall rule whether information so claimed is proprietary. 
(B)  The Cable Administrator shall prepare the recommendations to the City Commission contemplated by §§ 116.101(D) and 116.102(C). If the Cable Administrator recommends that any increase be denied in whole or in part, it shall: 
(1)  Propose a new rate, or propose that rates remain at existing levels, and explain the basis for its recommendation; 
(2)  Recommend whether, and on what basis, refunds should be issued; and 
(3)  Notify the Franchisee of its recommendation at the time it is submitted to the City Commission. 
(Ord. 28716-93, passed 9-1-93) 
Sec. 116.107. - Penalties and forfeitures. 
    Except as prohibited by federal law, a Franchisee shall be subject to penalties and forfeitures under applicable contracts, statutes or ordinances, and a Franchisee's request for approval of a rate may be denied if it: 
(A)  Knowingly submits false or fraudulent information to the city in connection with any rate proceeding; 
(B)  Fails to comply with any lawful order or request of the city including, but not limited to a request for information or an order setting rates; or 
(C)  Evades, or attempts to evade, federal or local rate regulation, provided that, filing for approval of a rate that is later determined to be unreasonable is not in and of itself an evasion of federal or local rate regulation. 
(Ord. 28716-93, passed 9-1-93) 
Sec. 116.108. - Proprietary information. 
(A)  If these provisions, or any request for information requires the production of proprietary information, the Franchisee must produce the information. However, at the time the information is submitted, a Franchisee may request that specific, identified portions of its response be treated as confidential and withheld from public disclosure. The request must state the reason why the information should be treated as proprietary and the facts that support those reasons. 
(B)  The request for confidentiality will be granted if the city determines that a preponderance of the evidence shows that nondisclosure is consistent with the provisions of the Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. § 552. The city shall place any decision it issues which results in information being withheld in a public file for inspection. 
(C)  If the Cable Administrator determines that information submitted is not proprietary, the Franchisee may withdraw the proposal if the proposal sought a rate increase, in which case the alleged proprietary information will be returned to Franchisee. Alternatively, the Franchisee may seek review in the appropriate forum within five working days of the denial. Release of the information will be stayed pending review. 
(D)  Any interested party may file a request to inspect material withheld as proprietary with the Cable Administrator. The Cable Administrator shall weigh the policy considerations favoring nondisclosure against the reasons cited for permitting inspection in light of the facts of the particular case. It will then promptly notify the requesting entity and the cable Franchisee that submitted the information as to the disposition of the request. It may grant, deny or condition a request. The requesting party or the Franchisee may seek review of the decision by filing an appeal with any appropriate forum. Release of the information will be stayed pending review. 
(Ord. 28716-93, passed 9-1-93) 
Sec. 116.109. - Petition for change in status. 
    Any Franchisee may petition for a change in status in accordance with 47 C.F.R. § 79.15, and the city shall consider that petition in accordance with 47 C.F.R. § 79.15. The petition and seven copies must be filed with the Cable Administrator.

1.  The consumer's bills shall be decreased or increased by an amount per CCF equivalent to the amount of change in the company's average cost per CCF of purchased gas.

The company will apply this refund per CCF to decrease the consumers' bills on a monthly basis until the amount to be refunded has been refunded by the company. 
3.  The company shall submit to the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio a report setting forth the computations upon which any decrease or increase is determined under this cost adjustment clause.

(1)  For a misdemeanor other than a minor misdemeanor, two years.

(R.C. § 2901.13) 
(Ord. 24636, passed 1-16-74) 
Sec. 130.07. - Requirements for criminal liability. 
(A)  Except as provided in subsection (B) of this section, a person is not guilty of an offense unless both of the following apply: 
(1)  His liability is based on conduct which includes either a voluntary act, or an omission to perform an act or duty which he is capable of performing; 
(2)  He has the requisite degree of culpability for each element as to which a culpable mental state is specified by the section defining the offense. 
(B)  When the section defining an offense does not specify any degree of culpability, and plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict criminal liability for the conduct described in the section, culpability is not required for a person to be guilty of the offense. When the section neither specifies culpability nor plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict liability, recklessness is sufficient culpability to commit the offense. 
(C)  As used in this section: 
(1)  Possession is a voluntary act if the possessor knowingly procured or received the thing possessed, or was aware of his control thereof for a sufficient time to have ended his possession. 
(2)  Reflexes, convulsions, body movements during unconsciousness or sleep, and body movements that are not otherwise a product of the actor's volition, are involuntary acts. 
(3)  "Culpability" means purpose, knowledge, recklessness, or negligence, as defined in § 130.08 or any other specific mental state required by any section of this title. (R.C. § 2901.21) 
(Ord. 24636, passed 1-16-74) 
Sec. 130.08. - Culpable mental states. 
(A)  A person acts purposely when it is his specific intention to cause a certain result, or, when the gist of the offense is a prohibition against conduct of a certain nature, regardless of what the offender intends to accomplish thereby, it is his specific intention to engage in conduct of that nature. 
(B)  A person acts knowingly, regardless of his purpose, when he is aware that his conduct will probably cause a certain result or will probably be of a certain nature. A person has knowledge of circumstances when he is aware that such circumstances probably exist. 
(C)  A person acts recklessly when, with heedless indifference to the consequences, he perversely disregards a known risk that his conduct is likely to cause a certain result or is likely to be of a certain nature. A person is reckless with respect to circumstances when, with heedless indifference to the consequences, he perversely disregards a known risk that such circumstances are likely to exist. 
(D)  A person acts negligently when, because of a substantial lapse from due care, he fails to perceive or avoid a risk that his conduct may cause a certain result or may be of a certain nature. A person is negligent with respect to circumstances when, because of a substantial lapse from due care, he fails to perceive or avoid a risk that such circumstances may exist. 
(E)  When the section defining an offense provides that negligence suffices to establish an element thereof then recklessness, knowledge, or purpose is also sufficient culpability for such element. When recklessness suffices to establish an element of an offense, then knowledge or purpose is also sufficient culpability for such element. When knowledge suffices to establish an element of an offense, then purpose is also sufficient culpability for such element. (R.C. § 2901.22) 
(Ord. 24636, passed 1-16-74) 
Sec. 130.09. - Offenses; organizations. 
(A)  An organization may be convicted of an offense under any of the following circumstances: 
(1)  The offense is a minor misdemeanor committed by an officer, agent, or employee of the organization acting in its behalf and within the scope of his office or employment, except that if the section defining the offense designates the officers, agents, or employees for whose conduct the organization is accountable or the circumstances under which it is accountable, such provisions shall apply; 
(2)  A purpose to impose organizational liability plainly appears in the section defining the offense, and the offense is committed by an officer, agent, or employee of the organization acting in its behalf and within the scope of his office or employment, except that if the section defining the offense designates the officers, agents, or employees for whose conduct the organization is accountable or the circumstances under which it is accountable, such provisions shall apply; 
(3)  The offense consists of an omission to discharge a specific duty imposed by law on the organization; 
(4)  If, acting with the kind of culpability otherwise required for the commission of the offense, its commission was authorized, requested, commanded, tolerated, or performed by the board of directors, trustees, partners, or by a high managerial officer, agent, or employee acting in behalf of the organization and within the scope of his office or employment. 
(B)  When strict liability is imposed for the commission of an offense, a purpose to impose organizational liability shall be presumed, unless the contrary plainly appears. 
(C)  In a prosecution of an organization for an offense other than one for which strict liability is imposed, it is a defense that the high managerial officer, agent, or employee having supervisory responsibility over the subject matter of the offense exercised due diligence to prevent its commission. This defense is not available if it plainly appears inconsistent with the purpose of the section defining the offense. 
(D)  As used in this section, "organization" means a corporation for profit or not for profit, partnership, limited partnership, joint venture, unincorporated association, estate, trust, or other commercial or legal entity. "Organization" does not include an entity organized as or by a governmental agency for the execution of governmental program. (R.C. § 2901.23) 
(Ord. 24636, passed 1-16-74) 
Sec. 130.10. - Organizations; officers, agents, employees. 
(A)  An officer, agent, or employee of an organization as defined in § 130.09 may be prosecuted for an offense committed by such organization, if he acts with the kind of culpability required for the commission of the offense, and any of the following apply:

(1)  The value of an heirloom, memento, collector's item, antique, museum piece, manuscript, document, record, or other thing which has intrinsic worth to its owner and which is either irreplaceable or is replaceable only on the expenditure of substantial time, effort, or money, is the amount which would compensate the owner for its loss; 
(2)  The value of personal effects and household goods, and of materials, supplies, equipment, and fixtures used in the profession, business, trade, occupation, or avocation of its owner, which property is not covered under subsection (D)(1) of this section and which retains substantial utility for its purpose regardless of its age or condition, is the cost of replacing such property with new property of like kind and quality; 
(3)  The value of any property, real or personal, not covered under subsection (D)(1) or (2) of this section, and the value of services, is the fair market value of such property or services. As used in this section, "fair market value" is the money consideration which a buyer would give and a seller would accept for property or services, assuming that the buyer is willing to buy and the seller is willing to sell, that both are fully informed as to all facts material to the transaction, and that neither is under any compulsion to act. 
(E)  Without limitation on the evidence which may be used to establish the value of property or services involved in a theft offense: 
(1)  When the property involved is personal property held for sale at wholesale or retail, the price at which such property was held for sale is prima facie evidence of its value; 
(2)  When the property involved is a security or commodity traded on an exchange, the closing price or, if there is no closing price, the asked price, given in the latest market quotation prior to the offense, is prima facie evidence of the value of such security or commodity; 
(3)  When the property involved is livestock, poultry, or raw agricultural products for which a local market price is available, the latest local market price prior to the offense is prima facie evidence of the value of such livestock, poultry, or products; 
(4)  When the property involved is a negotiable instrument the face value is prima facie evidence of the value of such instrument; 
(5)  When the property involved is a warehouse receipt, bill of lading, pawn ticket, claim check, or other instrument entitling the holder or bearer to receive property, the face value or, if there is no face value, the value of the property covered by the instrument less any payment necessary to receive the property, is prima facie evidence of the value of the instrument; 
(6)  When the property involved is a ticket of admission, ticket for transportation, coupon, token, or other instrument entitling the holder or bearer to receive property or services, the face value or, if there is no face value, the value of the property or services which may be received thereby, is prima facie evidence of the value of such instrument; 
(7)  When the services involved are gas, electricity, water, telephone, transportation, shipping, or other services for which the rate is established by law, the duly established rate is prima facie evidence of the value of such services; 
(8)  When the services involved are services for which the rate is not established by law, and the offender has been notified prior to the offense of the rate for such services, either in writing, or orally, or by posting in a manner reasonably calculated to come to the attention of potential offenders, the rate contained in such notice is prima facie evidence of the value of such services.

    The following regulations shall govern the design and layout of lots: 
(A)  The lot arrangement and design shall be such that all lots will provide satisfactory building sites, properly related to topography and the character of surrounding development. 
(B)  All lots shall conform to or exceed the requirements of these regulations and the zoning district requirements for the district in which they are located and the use for which they are intended. 
(C)  Each lot shall front on a dedicated street. The minimum lot sizes and frontage shall be as specified in the following table: 
Type of 
Development Without Public 
Sewer or Water With Sewer 
and Water Single-family 125' Frontage 
20,000 sq. ft. 50' Frontage 
5,000 sq. ft. Two-family Not permitted 50' Frontage 
5,000 sq. ft. Multiple-family Not permitted 50' Frontage 
5,000 sq. ft.  
Where soil conditions are of such nature that proper operation of wells and septic tanks may be impaired, the Plan Board may increase the size of any or all lots in the subdivision. 
(D)  All side lot lines shall be at right angles to street lines and radial to curved street lines, except where the board determines that a variation to this rule would provide a better layout. 
(E)  Lots with double frontage shall be avoided except where the board determines that it is essential to provide separation of residential development from arterial streets. 
(F)  No corner lot shall have a width at the building line of less than 65 feet. Property lines at intersections for corner lots shall be curved and conform generally to the curb line. 
(G)  The maximum depth of a lot shall not be greater than three times the width of the lot, except lots which contain an area of five acres or more. Lots containing over five acres shall not be less than 300 feet in width at any location; they should be of such shape and dimensions as to render the possible resubdivision of any such parcels at some later date into lots and streets which meet the requirements of these regulations. 
(H)  Fifty feet of additional lot depth may be required where a residential lot in a subdivision backs up to a railroad right-of-way, a high pressure gasoline or gas line, open drainage ditch, an arterial street, an industrial area or other existing land use which may have a detrimental effect on the residential use of the property, and where no street is provided at the rear of such lot. Where a residential lot has its side lot line adjacent to any of the aforementioned, an appropriate additional width may also be required.

Where deemed necessary by the Plan Board an additional easement width shall be provided. 
(B)  Watercourses. The subdivider shall dedicate rights-of-way or provide easements for storm drainage purposes which conform substantially with the lines of any natural watercourses, channels, streams, or creeks which traverse the subdivision or for any new channel which is established to substitute for a natural watercourse, channel, stream or creek. The rights-of-way or easements shall be of a width which will provide for the maintenance needs of the channel and incidental structures as determined by the Plan Board. 
(Ord. 24655, passed 2-20-74) 
Sec. 151.48. - Physical considerations. 
    Natural land uses. Subdivisions should be planned to take advantage of the topography of the land, to economize in the construction of drainage facilities, to reduce the amount of danger, to minimize destruction of trees and topsoil and to preserve such natural features as watercourses, unusual rock formations, large trees, sites for historical significance and other assets which, if preserved, will add attractiveness and value to the subdivision and the community. 
(Ord. 24655, passed 2-20-74) 
Sec. 151.49. - Flood plain. 
(A)  Areas of special flood hazard have been identified by the Federal Emergency Management Agency in a scientific and engineering report entitled "Flood Insurance Study for the City of Dayton." 
    This study, with accompanying flood boundary and floodway maps and flood insurance maps dated December 4, 1979 and any revisions thereto are adopted and made a part of the subdivision regulations. Subdivisions, under the jurisdiction of the city and located in areas subject to flooding as defined in this report or other studies completed by the federal emergency management agency or the Miami Conservancy District shall meet the following standards. 
(1)  All subdivision proposals shall be consistent with the need to minimize flood damage.

(3)  All subdivisions shall have adequate drainage provided to reduce exposure to flood damage. 
(4)  Base flood elevation data shall be provided for subdivision proposals and other proposed development which contain at least 50 lots or five acres (whichever is less). 
(5)  Streets must be located at elevations which will make them flood-free in order that no portion of the subdivision would become isolated by floods. 
(B)  Prior to acting on a proposed subdivision within a flood hazard area, as defined in § 151.49(A), the Plan Board shall secure technical assistance from the Miami Conservancy District, to determine the adverse impacts of developing in the flood hazard area and those measures needed to reduce potential hazards. 
(C)  For those streams and drainage areas not identified by the Federal Emergency Management Agency as referenced in § 151.49(A), but where there is an experience of flood hazard, the following shall apply: 
(1)  The subdivider shall perform such improvements which will render the area substantially safe for residential, commercial, or industrial uses. 
(2)  If a stream flows through, or adjacent to, the proposed subdivision, the plat shall provide for a storm water easement or drainage right-of-way along the stream for a floodway of at least ten feet. For smaller streams, the plat shall provide for channel improvements which would enable it to carry all reasonable floods within its banks. Floodway easements shall be provided which are wide enough to provide for future enlargement of the stream channels as adjacent areas become more highly developed and run off rates are increased.

The Superintendent shall cause a written notice to be served on the owner stating the findings with respect to the existence of a public nuisance and stating that unless the owner or owners thereof shall cause the abatement of the public nuisance by rehabilitation or by removal of the building, structure or nuisance, the same will be abated by the city at the expense of the owner. The Superintendent of Neighborhood Development may also order the owner to take such measures as are reasonably necessary to lessen the severity of the public nuisance in a manner prescribed by the Superintendent. If the owner fails or refuses to comply with such order, the city may cause either the abatement or the lessening of the severity of the public nuisance, at the expense of the owner, by rehabilitation or repair, or by removal of the building, structure, or nuisance. Abatement by the owner shall, on the issuance of a special building permit or a special wrecking permit, start within 15 days after service of the notice and shall be complete within the time prescribed in § 152.06(C) and (D) or such additional time as the Superintendent may deem necessary to complete the abatement. 
(B)  Whenever the Superintendent of Neighborhood Development determines the existence of a public nuisance as defined in § 152.01(E)(2), he/she may cause a written notice to be served on the owner and/or other responsible person, stating the findings with respect to the existence of a public nuisance and ordering the owner and/or other responsible person, to abate the public nuisance within 15 days. Whenever the issues raised by the written notice and order have been finally determined, the Superintendent may request the assistance of the Department of Law in abating the public nuisance in the manner provided in R.C. Chapter 3767. If the owner and/or other responsible person fails or refuses to comply with the order to abate the public nuisance, the Superintendent may, in addition to proceeding as provided hereinabove, proceed against the owner for any violations of this chapter. 
(C)  The city may, at its option, elect to not utilize the procedure provided in § 152.04(B), and proceed instead with the filing of an action in common pleas court in accordance with R.C. Chapter 3767.

    Base flood. The flood having a one percent chance of being equaled or exceeded in any given year. The base flood may also be referred to as the one percent chance annual flood or 100-year flood. 
    Base (100-Year) flood elevation (BFE). The water surface elevation of the base flood in relation to a specified datum, usually the National Geodetic Vertical Datum of 1929 or the North American Vertical Datum of 1988, and usually expressed in Feet Mean Sea Level (MSL). In Zone AO areas, the base flood elevation is the natural grade elevation plus the depth number (from one to three feet). 
    Basement. Any area of the building having its floor subgrade (below ground level) on all sides. 
    Development. Any manmade change to improved or unimproved real estate, including but not limited to buildings or other structures, mining, dredging, filling, grading, paving, excavation or drilling operations or storage of equipment or materials. 
    Enclosure below the lowest floor. See "lowest floor." 
    Executive Order 11988 (Floodplain Management). Issued by President Carter in 1977, this order requires that no federally assisted activities be conducted in or have the potential to affect identified special flood hazard areas, unless there is no practicable alternative. 
    Federal emergency management agency (FEMA). The agency with the overall responsibility for administering the National Flood Insurance Program. 
    Fill. A deposit of earth material placed by artificial means. 
    Flood or flooding. A general and temporary condition of partial or complete inundation of normally dry land areas from: 
(A)  The overflow of inland or tidal waters, and/or 
(B)  The unusual and rapid accumulation or runoff of surface waters from any source. 
    Flood hazard boundary map (FHBM). Usually the initial map, produced by the Federal Emergency Management Agency, or U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, for a community depicting approximate special flood hazard areas. 
    Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM). An official map on which the Federal Emergency Management Agency or the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development has delineated the areas of special flood hazard. 
    Flood insurance risk zones. Zone designations on FHBMs and firms that indicate the magnitude of the flood hazard in specific areas of a community. Following are the zone definitions: 
Zone A: 
Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year flood; base flood elevations are not determined. 
Zones A1-30 and Zone AE: 
Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year flood; base flood elevations are determined. 
Zone AO: 
Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year flood; with flood depths of one to threefeet (usually sheet flow on sloping terrain); average depths are determined. 
Zone AH: 
Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year flood; flood depths of one to three feet (usually areas of ponding); base flood elevations are determined. 
Zone A99: 
Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year flood to be protected from the 100-year flood by a Federal flood protection system under construction; no base flood elevations are determined. 
Zone B and Zone X (shaded): 
Areas of 500-year flood; areas subject to the 100-year flood with average depths of less than one foot or with contributing drainage area less than one square mile; and areas protected by levees from the base flood.

    Flood Protection Elevation. The Flood Protection Elevation, or FPE, is the base flood elevation plus 1.5 feet of freeboard. In areas where no base flood elevations exist from any authoritative source, the flood protection elevation can be historical flood elevations, or base flood elevations determined and/or approved by the Floodplain Administrator. 
    Floodway. A floodway is the channel of a river or other watercourse and the adjacent land areas that have been reserved in order to pass the base flood discharge. A floodway is typically determined through a hydraulic and hydrologic engineering analysis such that the cumulative increase in the water surface elevation of the base flood discharge is no more than a designated height. In no case shall the designated height be more than one foot at any point within the community. 
    The floodway is an extremely hazardous area, and is usually characterized by any of the following: moderate to high velocity flood waters, high potential for debris and projectile impacts, and moderate to high erosion forces. 
    Freeboard. A factor of safety usually expressed in feet above a flood level for the purposes of floodplain management. Freeboard tends to compensate for the many unknown factors that could contribute to flood heights greater than the height calculated for a selected size flood and floodway conditions, such as wave action, obstructed bridge openings, debris and ice jams, and the hydrologic effect of urbanization in a watershed. 
    Historic structure. Any structure that is: 
(A)  Listed individually in the National Register of Historic Places (a listing maintained by the U.S. Department of Interior) or preliminarily determined by the Secretary of the Interior as meeting the requirements for individual listings on the National Register; 
(B)  Certified or preliminarily determined by the Secretary of the Interior as contributing to the historical significance of a registered historic district or a district preliminarily determined by the Secretary to qualify as a registered historic district; or 
(C)  Individually listed on the State of Ohio's inventory of historic places maintained by the Ohio Historic Preservation Office. 
    Hydrologic and Hydraulic Engineering Analysis. An analysis performed by a professional engineer, registered in the State of Ohio, in accordance with standard engineering practices as accepted by FEMA, used to determine flood elevations and/or floodway boundaries. 
    Letter of Map Change (LOMC). A Letter of Map Change is an official FEMA determination, by letter, to amend or revise effective Flood Insurance Rate Maps, Flood Boundary and Floodway Maps, and Flood Insurance Studies. LOMC's are broken down into the following categories: 
Letter of Map Amendment (LOMA) 
A revision based on technical data showing that a property was incorrectly included in a designated special flood hazard area. A LOMA amends the current effective Flood Insurance Rate Map and establishes that a specific property is not located in a special flood hazard area. 
Letter of Map Revision (LOMR) 
A revision based on technical data that, usually due to manmade changes, shows changes to flood zones, flood elevations, floodplain and floodway delineations, and planimetric features. One common type of LOMR, a LOMRF, is a determination concerning whether a structure or parcel has been elevated by fill above the base flood elevation and is, therefore, excluded from the special flood hazard area. 
Conditional Letter of Map Revision (CLOMR) 
A formal review and comment by FEMA as to whether a proposed project complies with the minimum National Flood Insurance Program floodplain management criteria. A CLOMR does not amend or revise effective Flood Insurance Rate Maps, Flood Boundary and Floodway Maps, or Flood Insurance Studies. 
    Lowest floor. The lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area (including basement) of a structure. This definition excludes an "enclosure below the lowest floor" which is an unfinished or flood resistant enclosure usable solely for parking of vehicles, building access or storage, in an area other than a basement area, provided that such enclosure is built in accordance with the applicable design requirements specified in §§ 152.55 through 152.99 for enclosures below the lowest floor. 
    Manufactured home. A structure, transportable in one or more sections, which is built on a permanent chassis and is designed for use with or without a permanent foundation when connected to the required utilities. The term "manufactured home" does not include a "recreational vehicle." For the purposes of these regulations, a manufactured home includes manufactured homes and mobile homes as defined in R.C. Chapter 3781.06. 
    Manufactured home park. As specified in the Ohio Administrative Code 3701-27-01, a manufactured home park means any tract of land upon which three or more manufactured homes, used for habitation are parked, either free of charge or for revenue purposes, and includes any roadway, building, structure, vehicle, or enclosure used or intended for use as part of the facilities of the park. A tract of land that is subdivided and the individual lots are not for rent or rented, but are for sale or sold for the purpose of installation of manufactured homes on the lots, is not a manufactured home park, even though three or more manufactured homes are parked thereon, if the roadways are dedicated to the local government authority. 
    National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP). The NFIP is a federal program enabling property owners in participating communities to purchase insurance protection against losses from flooding. This insurance is designed to provide an insurance alternative to disaster assistance to meet the escalating costs of repairing damage to buildings and their contents caused by floods. Participation in the NFIP is based on an agreement between local communities and the federal government that states if a community will adopt and enforce floodplain management regulations to reduce future flood risks to all development in special flood hazard areas, the federal government will make flood insurance available within the community as a financial protection against flood loss. 
    New construction. Structures for which the "start of construction" commenced on or after the initial effective date of the City of Dayton Flood Insurance Rate Map, December 4, 1979, and includes any subsequent improvements to such structures. 
    Person. Includes any individual or group of individuals, corporation, partnership, association, or any other entity, including state and local governments and agencies. An agency is further defined in the R.C. § 111.15 as any governmental entity of the state and includes, but is not limited to, any board, department, division, commission, bureau, society, council, institution, state college or university, community college district, technical college district, or state community college. "Agency" does not include the general assembly, the controlling board, the adjutant general's department, or any court. 
    Recreational vehicle. A vehicle which is (1) built on a single chassis, (2) 400 square feet or less when measured at the largest horizontal projection, (3) designed to be self-propelled or permanently towable by a light duty truck, and (4) designed primarily not for use as a permanent dwelling but as temporary living quarters for recreational, camping, travel, or seasonal use. 
    Registered Professional Architect. A person registered to engage in the practice of architecture under the provisions of R.C. §§ 4703.01 to 4703.19. 
    Registered Professional Engineer. A person registered as a professional engineer under R.C. Chapter 4733. 
    Registered Professional Surveyor. A person registered as a professional surveyor under R.C. Chapter 4733. 
    Special Flood Hazard Area. Also known as "Areas of Special Flood Hazard", it is the land in the floodplain subject to a one percent or greater chance of flooding in any given year. Special flood hazard areas are designated by the Federal Emergency Management Agency on Flood Insurance Rate Maps, Flood Insurance Studies, Flood Boundary and Floodway Maps and Flood Hazard Boundary Maps as Zones A, AE, AH, AO, A1-30, and A99. Special flood hazard areas may also refer to areas that are flood prone and designated from other federal state or local sources of data including but not limited to historical flood information reflecting high water marks, previous flood inundation areas, and flood prone soils associated with a watercourse. 
    Start of construction. The date the building permit was issued, provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, placement, or other improvement was within 180 days of the permit date. The actual start means either the first placement of permanent construction of a structure on a site, such as the pouring of slab or footings, the installation of piles, the construction of columns, or any work beyond the stage of excavation; or the placement of a manufactured home on a foundation. Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as clearing, grading and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings, piers, or foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main structure. For a substantial improvement, the actual start of construction means the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of a building. 
    Structure. A walled and roofed building, manufactured home, or gas or liquid storage tank that is principally above ground. 
    Substantial damage. Damage of any origin sustained by a structure whereby the cost of restoring the structure to its before damaged condition would equal or exceed 50 percent of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred. 
    Substantial improvement. Any reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, or other improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds 50 percent of the market value of the structure before the "start of construction" of the improvement. This term includes structures which have incurred "substantial damage", regardless of the actual repair work performed. The term does not, however, include: 
(A)  Any improvement to a structure which is considered "new construction"; 
(B)  Any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing violations of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications which have been identified prior to the application for a development permit by the local code enforcement official and which are the minimum necessary to assure safe living conditions; or 
(C)  Any alteration of a "historic structure," provided that the alteration will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a "historic structure". 
    Variance. A grant of relief from the standards of these regulations consistent with the variance conditions herein. 
    Violation. The failure of a structure or other development to be fully compliant with these regulations.

(B)  Base flood elevations and floodway boundaries produced on FEMA flood maps and studies shall take precedence over base flood elevations and floodway boundaries by any other source that reflect a reduced floodway width and/or lower base flood elevations. Other sources of data, showing increased base flood elevations and/or larger floodway areas than are shown on FEMA flood maps and studies, shall be reasonably used by the Floodplain Administrator. 
(C)  When Preliminary Flood Insurance Rate Maps and/or Flood Insurance Study have been provided by FEMA: 
(1)  Upon the issuance of a Letter of Final Determination by the FEMA, the preliminary flood hazard data shall be used and replace all previously existing flood hazard data provided from FEMA for the purposes of administering §§ 152.55 through 152.99. 
(2)  Prior to the issuance of a Letter of Final Determination by FEMA, the use of preliminary flood hazard data shall only be required where no base flood elevations and/or floodway areas exist or where the preliminary base flood elevations or floodway area exceed the base flood elevations and/or floodway widths in existing flood hazard data provided from FEMA. Such preliminary data may be subject to change and/or appeal to FEMA. 
(D)  The Floodplain Administrator shall make interpretations, where needed, as to the exact location of the flood boundaries and areas of special flood hazard. A person contesting the determination of the location of the boundary shall be given a reasonable opportunity to appeal the interpretation as provided in § 152.88. 
(E)  Where a map boundary showing an area of special flood hazard and field elevations disagree, the base flood elevations or flood protection elevations (as found on an elevation profile, floodway data table, established high water marks, or similar source) shall prevail.

Sec. 152.85. - Assurance of flood carrying capacity. 
    Pursuant to the purpose and methods of reducing flood damage stated in §§ 152.55 through 152.99, the following additional standards are adopted to assure that the reduction of the flood carrying capacity of watercourses is minimized: 
(A)  Development in Floodways. 
(1)  In floodway areas, development shall cause no increase in flood levels during the occurrence of the base flood discharge. Prior to issuance of a floodplain development permit, the applicant must submit a hydrologic and hydraulic analysis, conducted by a registered professional engineer, demonstrating that the proposed development would not result in any increase in the base flood elevation; or 
(2)  Development in floodway areas causing increases in the base flood elevation may be permitted provided all of the following are completed by the applicant: 
(a)  Meet the requirements to submit technical data in § 152.73(A); 
(b)  An evaluation of alternatives which would not result in increased base flood elevations and an explanation why these alternatives are not feasible; 
(c)  Certification that no structures are located in areas which would be impacted by the increased base flood elevation; 
(d)  Documentation of individual legal notices to all impacted property owners within and outside the community, explaining the impact of the proposed action on their property; and 
(e)  Concurrence of the City Manager of the City of Dayton and the Chief Executive Officer of any other communities impacted by the proposed actions. 
(B)  Development in Riverine Areas with Base Flood Elevations but No Floodways. 
(1)  In riverine special flood hazard areas identified by FEMA where base flood elevation data are provided but no floodways have been designated, the cumulative effect of any proposed development, when combined with all other existing and anticipated development, shall not increase the base flood elevation more than one foot at any point. Prior to issuance of a floodplain development permit, the applicant must submit a hydrologic and hydraulic analysis, conducted by a registered professional engineer, demonstrating that this standard has been met; or, 
(2)  Development in riverine special flood hazard areas identified by FEMA where base flood elevation data are provided but no floodways have been designated causing more than one foot increase in the base flood elevation may be permitted provided all of the following are completed by the applicant: 
(a)  An evaluation of alternatives which would result in an increase of one foot or less of the base flood elevation and an explanation why these alternatives are not feasible; 
(b)  Section 152.85(A)(2), items (a) and (c) through (e). 
(C)  Alterations of a Watercourse. For the purpose of these regulations, a watercourse is altered when any change occurs within its banks. The extent of the banks shall be established by a field determination of the "bankfull stage." The field determination of "bankfull stage" shall be based on methods presented in Chapter 7 of the USDA Forest Service General Technical Report RM-245, Stream Channel Reference Sites: An Illustrated Guide to Field Technique or other applicable publication available from a Federal, State, or other authoritative source. For all proposed developments that alter a watercourse, the following standards apply: 
(1)  The bankfull flood carrying capacity of the altered or relocated portion of the watercourse shall not be diminished. Prior to the issuance of a floodplain development permit, the applicant must submit a description of the extent to which any watercourse will be altered or relocated as a result of the proposed development, and certification by a registered professional engineer that the bankfull flood carrying capacity of the watercourse will not be diminished. 
(2)  Adjacent communities, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, and the Ohio Department of Natural Resources, Division of Water, must be notified prior to any alteration or relocation of a watercourse. Evidence of such notification must be submitted to the Federal Emergency Management Agency. 
(3)  The applicant shall be responsible for providing the necessary maintenance for the altered or relocated portion of said watercourse so that the flood carrying capacity will not be diminished. The Floodplain Administrator may require the permit holder to enter into an agreement with the City of Dayton specifying the maintenance responsibilities. If an agreement is required, it shall be made a condition of the floodplain development permit. 
(4)  The applicant shall meet the requirements to submit technical data in § 152.73(A)(1)(c) when an alteration of a watercourse results in the relocation or elimination of the special flood hazard area, including the placement of culverts.

    Any person affected by any notice and order, or other official action of the Floodplain Administrator may request and shall be granted a hearing on the matter before the Dayton Board of Building Appeals provided that such person shall file, within 30 days of the date of such notice and order, or other official action, a brief statement of the grounds for such hearing or for the mitigation of any item appearing on any order of the Floodplain Administrator's decision. Such appeal shall be in writing, signed by the applicant, and be filed with the Floodplain Administrator. Upon receipt of the appeal, the Floodplain Administrator shall transmit said notice and all pertinent information on which the Floodplain Administrator's decision was made to the Dayton Board of Building Appeals. Upon receipt of the notice of appeal, the Dayton Board of Building Appeals shall fix a reasonable time for the appeal, give notice in writing to parties in interest, and decide the appeal within a reasonable time after it is submitted. 
(Ord. 30418-04, passed 12-29-04) 
Sec. 152.88. - Variances. 
    Any person believing that the use and development standards of §§ 152.55 through 152.99 would result in unnecessary hardship may file an application for a variance. The Dayton Board of Building Appeals shall have the power to authorize, in specific cases, such variances from the standards of these regulations, not inconsistent with federal regulations, as will not be contrary to the public interest where, owing to special conditions of the lot or parcel, a literal enforcement of the provisions of these regulations would result in unnecessary hardship. 
(A)  Application for a Variance. 
(1)  Any owner, or agent thereof, of property for which a variance is sought shall make an application for a variance by filing it with the Floodplain Administrator, who upon receipt of the variance shall transmit it to the Dayton Board of Building Appeals. 
(2)  Such application at a minimum shall contain the following information: Name, address, and telephone number of the applicant; legal description of the property; parcel map; description of the existing use; description of the proposed use; location of the floodplain; description of the variance sought; and reason for the variance request. 
(B)  Public Hearing. At a hearing for a variance, the applicant shall present such statements and evidence as the Dayton Board of Building Appeals requires. In considering such variance applications, the Dayton Board of Building Appeals shall consider and make findings of fact on all evaluations, all relevant factors, standards specified in other sections of these regulations and the following factors: 
(1)  The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the injury of others. 
(2)  The danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion damage. 
(3)  The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner. 
(4)  The importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to the community. 
(5)  The availability of alternative locations for the proposed use which are not subject to flooding or erosion damage. 
(6)  The necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where applicable. 
(7)  The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated development. 
(8)  The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan and floodplain management program for that area. 
(9)  The safety of access to the property in times of flood for ordinary and emergency vehicles. 
(10)  The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise, and sediment transport of the flood waters and the effects of wave action, if applicable, expected at the site. 
(11)  The costs of providing governmental services during and after flood conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water systems, and streets and bridges. 
(C)  Variances shall only be issued upon: 
(1)  A showing of good and sufficient cause. 
(2)  A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship due to the physical characteristics of the property. Increased cost or inconvenience of meeting the requirements of these regulations does not constitute an exceptional hardship to the applicant. 
(3)  A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights beyond that which is allowed in these regulations; additional threats to public safety; extraordinary public expense, nuisances, fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local laws. 
(4)  A determination that the structure or other development is protected by methods to minimize flood damages. 
(5)  A determination that the variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief. 
    Upon consideration of the above factors and the purposes of these regulations, the Dayton Board of Building Appeals may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes of these regulations. 
(D)  Other Conditions for Variances. 
(1)  Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result. 
(2)  Generally, variances may be issued for new construction and substantial improvements to be erected on a lot of one-half acre or less in size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed below the base flood level, providing items in § 152.88(B)(1) through (11) have been fully considered. As the lot size increases beyond one-half acre, the technical justification required for issuing the variance increases. 
(3)  Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice that the structure will be permitted to be built with a lowest floor elevation below the base flood elevation and the cost of flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the reduced lowest floor elevation. 
(Ord. 30418-04, passed 12-29-04) 
Sec. 152.89. - Procedure at hearings. 
    Hearings before the Dayton Board of Building Appeals pursuant to § 152.87 or § 152.88 shall be conducted in accordance with the following:

Sec. 152.91. - Compliance required. 
(A)  No structure or land shall hereafter be located, erected, constructed, reconstructed, repaired, extended, converted, enlarged or altered without full compliance with the terms of these regulations and all other applicable regulations which apply to uses within the jurisdiction of §§ 152.55 through 152.99, unless specifically exempted from filing for a development permit as stated in § 152.72. 
(B)  Failure to obtain a floodplain development permit shall be a violation of these regulations and shall be punishable in accordance with § 152.99. 
(C)  Floodplain development permits issued on the basis of plans and applications approved by the Floodplain Administrator authorize only the use, and arrangement, set forth in such approved plans and applications or amendments thereto. Use, arrangement, or construction contrary to that authorized shall be deemed a violation of these regulations and punishable in accordance with § 152.99. 
(Ord. 30418-04, passed 12-29-04) 
Sec. 152.92. - Notice of violation.

Such notice shall be given within a reasonable time in advance of the time when such inspection is desired to take place, but shall in no event be less than 24 hours. Notice given on a Friday or on a day prior to a legal holiday shall not constitute notice for inspection on a Saturday, Sunday, or holiday unless arrangements have been made under approved rules for inspection on such days. Before giving such notice the holder of the permit shall first test the work and satisfy himself that it conforms to the approved plans and specifications and the requirements of this code. 
(D)  Action on Notice. On receipt of notice that work is ready for inspection, the building official shall inspect or cause it to be inspected as soon as practicable. However, failure of the building official to make a prompt inspection shall not be deemed to be justification for covering work without inspection when such work is required under the terms of the permit to be inspected before being covered. 
(E)  Covering Work. It shall be a violation of this Code to cover, prior to inspection, any work required to be inspected under the provisions of a permit, the approved rules, or this Code, irrespective of any penalties for such violation.

(F)  Plant Inspection. The building official shall inspect or cause to be inspected at the point of their manufacture or fabrication all materials and assemblies which the code, or rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, requires to be inspected at such points. The cost of all such inspections shall be borne by the applicant therefor. 
(G)  Inspection Reports. All inspection reports shall be in writing and shall be certified by the licensed authority, or responsible officer of the service, or the individual when expert inspection services are accepted.

150.115.10 Site Design Plan Review Criteria
(A) Purpose. Design criteria and performance standards are established to guide the decision making of the Plan Board, Board of Zoning Appeals, or Zoning Administrator when evaluating the appropriateness of development in the City. Specifically these provisions are intended to achieve, among others, the following purposes:
(1) Ensure that development reflects and is sensitive to the history, climate, topography, vegetation, natural features and building traditions of the City of Dayton;
(2) Ensure that new development and redevelopment are integrated into the surrounding environment in an orderly manner and are compatible and harmonious with the existing overall character of the City;
(3) Provide interest along the streetscape and a pedestrian friendly environment;
(4) Foster and encourage creative application of design principles; and,
(5) Promote efficient pedestrian and vehicular circulation and access.
(B) Site Design Plan Review Criteria. In reviewing a site design plan, the Plan Board, Board of Zoning Appeals, or the Zoning Administrator shall consider the location of buildings, parking areas and other features with respect to the topography of the lot and existing natural features such as streams and large trees; the efficiency, adequacy and safety of the proposed layout of internal streets and driveways; the location of the green areas provided, considering the possible effects of irregularly shaped lots; the adequacy of the location, landscaping and screening of the parking lots; and such other matters as the Plan Board, Board of Zoning Appeals, or the Zoning Administrator may find to have a material bearing upon the stated standards and objectives of the various district regulations. In approving a site design plan, the Plan Board, Board of Zoning Appeals, or the Zoning Administrator shall also determine that the site design plan complies with the following Site Design Plan Review Criteria:
(1) The proposed plan is consistent with the goals and objectives of the Citys Comprehensive Plan;
(2) The proposed plan is consistent with any other plan or policy statement for the orderly development of the City;
(3) The proposed use is allowed in the zoning district in which it is located; 25
Dayton, Ohio Zoning Code Amended September 4, 2019
Section 150.115, Site Design Review Procedures
(4) The proposed plan is consistent with the goals of this Zoning Code which include creating a built environment that reflects and complements Daytons existing built form;
(5) The appropriate use and value of property within and adjacent to the area will be safeguarded;
(6) The site design plan demonstrates that the proposed development will result in a harmonious grouping of buildings within the proposed development and in relationship to existing and proposed uses on adjacent property;
(7) The development, when completed, will have adequate public service, parking and open spaces;
(8) The plan, to the extent practical, will preserve and be sensitive to the natural characteristics of the site;
(9) Vehicular ingress and egress as well as circulation within the site shall provide for safe, efficient, and convenient movement of traffic not only within the site, but on adjacent roadways, as well;
(10) The site design plan provides for the safe, efficient, and convenient movement of pedestrians on the subject site and adjacent to the subject site;
(11) Adequate provision is made for emergency vehicle access and circulation;
(12) Adequate provision is made for storm drainage within and through the site so as to maintain, as far as practicable, usual and normal swales, water courses and drainage areas, and shall comply with any applicable regulation or design criteria established by the City;
(13) Site lighting is designed to minimize direct light, glare, and excessive glow, which unreasonably interferes with the use and enjoyment of adjacent property. If it is determined that, once the project is completed, the lighting does have unreasonable adverse impact on adjacent property, the Zoning Administrator may order reasonable alterations to the site lighting (such as reduced illumination, shielding, landscaping, etc.) to mitigate such unreasonable impacts; and,
(14) The plan complies with all standards of the R.C.G.O., this Zoning Code, including but not limited to the applicable zoning districts Contextual Standards, Contextual Regulations, and/or Design Elements and Standards, and other adopted City policies. (Ord. 30515-05, passed 12-28-05; amend Ord. 30762-08, passed 7-16-08; amend Ord. 30893-09, passed 7-15-09; amend Ord. 31142-11, passed 12-21-11; amend Ord. 31283-13, passed 12-18-13); amend Ord. 31738-19, passed 5-29-19)

(A) For Minor or Major Site Design Plan applications, the Plan Board, Board of Zoning Appeals, or the Zoning Administrator, whichever is applicable according to Section 150.115, may find that the site design plan either adheres or is equivalent to the requirements of this Code. The Plan Board, Board of Zoning Appeals, or the Zoning Administrator may consider a site design plan equivalent if: 26
Dayton, Ohio Zoning Code Amended September 4, 2019
Section 150.115, Site Design Review Procedures
(1) The proposed site design plan substantially complies with all specific requirements and with the purposes, intent and basic objectives of the zoning district; and,

(3) The development, as proposed, will have no adverse impact upon the surrounding properties or upon the health, safety or general welfare of the community.
(B) It shall be the responsibility of the applicant to demonstrate to the Plan Board, Board of Zoning Appeals, or the Zoning Administrator that the provisions of this Section have been satisfied. When evaluating the application with respect to this Section, the Plan Board, Board of Zoning Appeals, or the Zoning Administrator shall make any finding of equivalency in writing that explains how and why the proposal has satisfied on the above criteria. When making such a finding, the Plan Board, Board of Zoning Appeals, or the Zoning Administrator may approve the proposed application as if the application were in strict compliance with the standards and requirements in this Zoning Code.

A request for such a transfer or change of ownership shall be presented to the Zoning Administrator and granted only if the new ownership entity satisfies the administrative, financial, legal and all other performance guarantees approved with the original development plan.
(B) All construction and development under any building permit shall be in accordance with the approved site design plan. Any departure from such plan shall be cause for revocation of the Zoning Certificate and/or Building Permit, and the property owner or other responsible parties are subject to penalties as prescribed by this Zoning Code and the R.C.G.O.
(C) Changes in an approved site design plan shall be resubmitted for approval in accordance with this Section. (Ord. 30515-05, passed 12-28-05; amend Ord. 31142-11, passed 12-21-11)

150.115.15 Approval of Site Design Plan Requiring Variances

Dayton, Ohio Zoning Code Amended September 4, 2019
Section 150.120, Appeals and Variances
(1) Variances Based on Practical Difficulty. The BZA shall consider and weigh the following factors in determining practical difficulty:
(a) Whether special conditions and circumstances exist which are peculiar to the land or structure involved and which are not applicable generally to other lands or structures in the same Zoning District; examples of such special conditions or circumstances are: exceptional irregularity, narrowness, shallowness or steepness of the lot, or adjacency to nonconforming and inharmonious uses, structures or conditions;
(b) Whether the property in question will yield a reasonable return or whether there can be any beneficial use of the property without the variance;
(c) Whether the variance is substantial and is the minimum necessary to make possible the reasonable use of the land or structures;
(d) Whether the essential character of the neighborhood would be substantially altered or whether adjoining properties would suffer substantial detriment as a result of the variance;

(G) Supplemental Conditions and Safeguards. The BZA may further prescribe any conditions and safeguards that it deems necessary to insure that the objectives of the regulations or provisions to which the variance applies will be met. Any violation of such conditions and safeguards, when they have been made a part of the terms under which the variance has been granted, shall be deemed a punishable violation of this Zoning Code.
(H) Action by the BZA. The BZA shall approve, approve with supplementary conditions as specified in sub-section 150.120.10(G) above, or disapprove the request for a variance according to the procedures established for appeals in sub-sections 150.120.1 through 150.120.9 within 30 days from the close of the hearing.

There shall be no modification of variances except by further action of the BZA. Once the time limit pursuant to this sub-section has expired, a request for a variance shall be considered to be a new application for a variance and shall meet all requirements for application and review pursuant to this Section.
(1) Variances to Increase Established TMDI. Any increase in TMDI shall not be effective until an occupancy certificate has been issued by the Zoning Administrator.

If an occupancy certificate is not issued within 12 months of the decision by the Board of Zoning Appeals, the variance to increase TMDI shall expire unless an extension of time has been granted by the BZA. There shall be no modification of variances to increase TMDI except by further action of the BZA.

150.140.1 Purpose
The purpose of this Section is to recognize the existence of uses, buildings, lots, structures and conditions that lawfully existed at the time of this Zoning Codes enactment, or amendment thereto, but which now do not conform with one or more of the regulations contained in this Zoning Code. Non-conforming status is considered to be incompatible with permitted uses in the zoning district in which it exists. Therefore, non-conforming uses, buildings, lots, and structures are subject to regulations limiting their use, restoration, reconstruction, extension, and substitution. Such non-conforming status shall be continued only in conformance with this Section. (Ord. 30515-05, passed 12-28-05)
150.140.2 Variances
A non-conforming lot, use, building or structure does not constitute nonconformity with regulations pursuant to a legally granted variance from a zoning regulation. (Ord. 30515-05, passed 12-28-05)

A lot of record that does not comply, on the effective date of this Zoning Code or any amendment thereto, with the lot area or lot width regulations of the district in which the lot is located may be used as follows:
(A) Existing Dwelling on a Residential Lot. If the lot is occupied by a dwelling, such dwelling shall be maintained and may be repaired, modernized or altered, provided that the building shall not be enlarged in floor area unless the enlarged portion(s) complies with all regulations of this Zoning Code, except the lot area, lot width, and setback regulations of the district in which the lot is located. The number of dwelling units shall not be increased unless all regulations, including lot area, are complied with.
(B) Vacant Single Non-conforming Lot of Record.
(1) Vacant Non-conforming Lot in a Residential District. A vacant non-conforming lot in a residential district that is in separate ownership and not of continuous frontage with other lots in the same ownership shall be permitted to be developed as a site for a single-family dwelling provided that the dwelling and its accessory uses comply with all regulations of this Zoning Ordinance, except the lot area and lot width regulations of the district in which the lot is located, except as follows: 65

Section 150. 140, Non-Conforming Uses, Buildings, Structures, and Lots
(a) The sum of the widths of the two (2) side setbacks shall not be less than 25% of the width of the lot; nor shall the width of either required side setback be less than 10% of the width of the lot; and,
(b) The width of any side setback that adjoins a public street shall not be less than ten (10) feet.
(2) Vacant Non-conforming Lot in a Non-residential District. A vacant non-conforming lot in a non-residential district may be used for any use permitted in the district in which it is located if, but only if, the development of such lot meets all requirements of the district in which it is located, including the setback requirements, except lot area and width requirements. However, no use that requires a greater lot size than the established minimum lot size for a particular district is permissible on a non-conforming lot.
(C) Vacant Lots in Combination. If a vacant non-conforming lot adjoins one or more lots in common ownership on the effective date of this Zoning Code or applicable amendment thereto, such lot shall be replatted to create conforming lots as a prerequisite for development.

Moreover, no non-conforming use of land shall be moved, in whole or in part, to any other location on the same or any other lot unless such use shall thereafter conform to the regulations of the district in which it is located after being moved.
(F) Change or Substitution of Use.
(1) A non-conforming use of a building, structure or land shall not be changed or substituted to another non-conforming use unless the Zoning Administrator finds that the use proposed is equally or more in conformity with the stated purpose of the district than the existing non-conforming use; that the use proposed is in less conflict with the
67
Dayton, Ohio Zoning Code Amended May 4, 2016
Section 150. 140, Non-Conforming Uses, Buildings, Structures, and Lots
character of uses permitted in the applicable zoning district than the existing non-conforming use; and that the proposed substitution is of no greater intensity than the previous use, pursuant to the criteria in sub-section 150.140.4 (D); and the Zoning Administrator finds based upon the particular evidence submitted, that support conclusions that:
(a) Adequate utility, drainage, and other such necessary facilities have been or will be provided.
(b) Adequate access roads or entrance and exit drives will be provided and will be designed so as to prevent traffic hazards and to minimize traffic conflicts and congestion in public streets and alleys.
(c) All necessary permits and licenses for the use and operation of the substitution have been obtained, or evidence has been submitted that such permits are obtainable for the proposed substitution on the subject property.
(d) All exterior lighting fixtures are shaded wherever necessary to avoid casting direct light upon any property located in a residential district.
(e) The proposed substitution will not cause substantial injury to the value of other property in the neighborhood in which it is located and will contribute to and promote the convenience and welfare of the public.
(f) In granting a substitution, the Zoning Administrator may impose such reasonable conditions, safeguards, and restrictions upon the premises benefited by the substitution as may be necessary to comply with the above standards and to reduce or minimize any potentially injurious effect of such substitution upon other property in the neighborhood and to carry out the general purpose and intent of this Zoning Code.
(2) If the Zoning Administrator is unable to make the findings in sub-section 150.140.4 (F), the Zoning Administrator may, at his discretion, refer the application to the Board of Zoning Appeals. At which time, the BZA shall hear and decide the application for a change or substitution of a non-conforming use. Such application for a substitution of a non-conforming use shall be noticed and heard in the manner prescribed for appeals in Section 150.120, Appeals and Variances.
(3) Whenever a non-conforming use is changed to a less intensive use, such use shall not thereafter be changed to a more intensive non-conforming use.
(4) If the applicant intends to alter non-conforming site conditions as part of the substitution, the provisions in sub-section 150.140.6 (C), Existing 68

(K) Existing Use Deemed Conditional Use; Permit Required For Change. Any lawfully existing use that, at the time of its establishment, was not classified as a conditional use, but which now, because of the passage of this Zoning Code, or amendment thereto, is listed as a conditional use in the zoning district in which it is located, shall be deemed without further action to be a conditional use.

change, modification, enlargement or alteration of such use, site development conditions or signs, shall only be permitted upon review and approval by the Board of Zoning Appeals according to the procedures for conditional uses set forth in Section 150.500, Conditional Use and Specific Use Regulations.
(L) Exclusion for Certain Non-conforming Uses in the WO or WP Districts.

(A) Enlargement, repair, and alterations. A non-conforming building or structure may be enlarged, maintained, repaired, or structurally altered. However, no such enlargement, maintenance, repair, or structural alteration shall either create any additional nonconformity or increase the degree of the existing nonconformity of all or any part of such building or structure with respect to Zoning Code Requirements.

Existing site conditions include, but are not limited to, the existing lot configuration and patterns of surrounding development; inability of the applicant to acquire additional property; location of the existing structures on the site in question; the location of parking and access on the site in question, and the location of utilities both on and off-site. In such cases, the Plan Board shall approve a site design plan that reduces the existing non-conforming site condition(s) to the maximum extent practicable.
(2) Minor Site Design Plan Review. If a non-conforming site condition(s) exists when a revised minor site design plan is required, then such site condition(s), which are affected by the proposed alteration, shall be brought into compliance with applicable regulations. If the applicant objects to full compliance, the applicant may request that the Plan Board review the proposed site design plan under the provisions in 150.140.6 (C) (1).

A use listed in a Permitted Uses Schedule with a P* is also permitted by right as a principal use, if the use complies with the regulations in Section 150.500, Conditional Use and Specific Use Regulations. However, the characteristics of these uses require development standards that are unique to the specific use, and these standards are not common to the uses generally permitted in the District. Therefore, in addition to the applicable regulations found in each Section, these uses must also comply with the regulations in Section 150.500, all other requirements of this Zoning Ordinance and other applicable City ordinances. If the use cannot comply with the regulations in Section 150.500, then the use and any deviation from the required standards shall be considered as a conditional use that

(4) Accessory Uses. A use listed in a Permitted Use Schedule shall be permitted as an accessory use when denoted by the letter A. Such use shall be permitted as a subordinate building or use when it is clearly incidental to and located on the same zoning lot as the principal building or use. A use not listed in a Permitted Use Schedule may also be a permitted accessory use provided that is clearly incidental and subordinate to a use listed in a Permitted Use Schedule, as determined by the Zoning Administrator, provided that the requirements of all other City Ordinances and this Zoning Code have been met.
(B) Use Not Listed in Schedule. With the exception of prohibited uses, any use not specifically listed as a permitted principal, or conditional use shall not be a permitted use in these zoning districts and shall only be permitted:
(1) Upon amendment of this Ordinance and/or the Zoning Map as provided in Section 150.125, Amendments;
(2) Upon a finding by the Zoning Administrator, that a use is substantially similar to a principally permitted or conditionally permitted use in the district.

(3) By action of the BZA in accordance with Section 150.120.10(D)(2).

150.305.1 Purposes
Single-family residential districts (SR-1, SR-2, ER-3, ER-4, and MR-5) and their regulations are established in order to achieve the following purposes:
(A) To provide for orderly growth and development in the City of Dayton.
(B) To reflect and reinforce desired development patterns in existing neighborhoods while accommodating the need for future growth.
(C) To preserve the character of unique neighborhoods by creating separate districts with different densities and development standards.
(D) To regulate the bulk and location of dwellings to maintain privacy, safety and open spaces for each unit appropriate for the various districts.
(E) To provide for proper location of institutions and other community facilities for the general convenience, safety and amenity of residents.
(F) To provide assurances to property owners, developers and neighbors about the limits of what is allowed in a residentially zoned area.
(G) To protect and enhance property values.
To carry out the above purposes and to effectuate the goals and objectives in the Citys Comprehensive Plan, it has been determined that the following types of districts are necessary. The specific purposes for these Districts are:
(A) Suburban Single-Family Residential Districts. To promote, preserve and protect residential neighborhoods that are suburban in character. Suburban areas are typically located at the outer periphery of the city, and were generally developed after 1960. Curvilinear streets, cul-de-sacs and attached garages are common. As set forth in the Citys Comprehensive Plan, Suburban residential development will adhere to contemporary standards. 123
Dayton, Ohio Zoning Code Amended May 29, 2019
Section 150.305, Single-Family Residential Districts
(B) Eclectic Single-Family Residential Districts. To promote, preserve and protect residential neighborhoods that have characteristics of both the Suburban and Mature districts. Eclectic areas are generally found between the Suburban and Mature areas, with neighborhoods of varying density. As set forth in the Citys Comprehensive Plan, Eclectic residential development will match existing predominant development patterns.
(C) Mature Single-Family Residential Districts. To promote, preserve and protect neighborhoods with traditional urban character. Mature areas are the oldest, close-to-downtown residential areas in the city. Small, dense lots were generally developed before 1920 in a regular grid street pattern. As set forth in the Citys Comprehensive Plan, Mature residential development will encourage historic preservation, development similar in character to existing development and well-designed, adaptive reuse of commercial and industrial buildings.

150.305.3 Lot and Setback Requirements
(A) One Dwelling per Lot. There shall not be more than one (1) dwelling unit constructed on a zoning lot, except as otherwise permitted as part of a planned development, a single-family attached development, a multi-family development or a two-family dwelling.
(B) Lot Requirements. Lots created and used in a single family residential district shall comply with the minimum lot area, width, and the maximum lot coverage requirements specified in Schedule 150.305.3 for the district in which the lot is located, except as otherwise regulated in Section 150.350 for planned developments and as otherwise regulated in Section 150.500 for conditional uses and those uses denoted as a P*.
(C) Setbacks Requirements. Principal buildings shall be located on a zoning lot in a manner that maintains the required front, side, and rear setbacks set forth in Schedule 150.305.3 for the district in which the lot is located, except as provided for in Section 150.350 for planned developments and as otherwise regulated in Section 150.500 for conditional uses and those uses denoted as a P*. Each setback shall remain unobstructed by structures except as otherwise permitted in this Code.
(1) Minimum Front Setback. In the ER-3, ER-4, and MR-5 Districts, the minimum front setback shall be the average setback of adjacent principal buildings. Such minimum front setback shall be the average distance, or within three (3) feet of such
127
Dayton, Ohio Zoning Code Amended May 29, 2019
Section 150.305, Single-Family Residential Districts
average, of the front setbacks of the four lots, two on either side, of the zoning lot under review as shown in Figure 1, Context 4-A. If vacant lots surround the zoning lot, the average shall be determined by calculating the average front setback of the four properties most directly across the street (See Figure 1, Context 4-B), or if all four of the properties across the street are also vacant, the average shall be derived using the front setbacks of those lots on the nearest similar street, as determined by the Zoning Administrator.
In a case where portions of an existing structure are closer to the front street lot line than the four lots used to determine the average, a new addition or alteration may come up to the portion of the structure closest to the front lot line.
When determining the minimum front setback, the Zoning Administrator shall exclude any adjacent building with a setback that exceeds, by more than twenty-five (25) percent, the average setback of the other lots used to determine the average.
When determining the minimum front setback, the Zoning Administrator shall exclude any adjacent building with a setback that is at least twenty-five (25) percent less than the average setback of the other lots used to determine the average, if the permit applicant requests such exclusion.
(2) Maximum Front Setback. In the ER-3, ER-4, and the MR-5 Districts, the maximum front setback shall be the largest setback of the four adjacent front setbacks, two on either side of the zoning lot under review, except when an adjacent setback is excluded as described in sub-section 150.305.3 (C) (1) above. A registered architect, engineer, or surveyor shall calculate this average.
(3) Front Setback on Through Lots. On a through lot, a front setback shall be provided on each frontage equal to the minimum required front setback as set forth in Schedule 150.305.3. There shall be no required rear setback on a through lot.

150.310.1 Purposes.
Multi-family residential districts (SMF, EMF, MMF) and their regulations are established in order to achieve the following purposes:
(A) To provide for orderly growth and development in the City of Dayton.
(B) To reflect and reinforce desired development patterns in existing neighborhoods while accommodating the need for future growth.
(C) To preserve the character of differing neighborhoods by providing different districts with different densities and development standards.
(D) To regulate the bulk and location of dwellings to maintain privacy, safety and open spaces for each unit appropriate for the various districts.
(E) To provide for proper location of institutions and other community facilities for the general convenience, safety and amenity of residents.
(F) To provide assurance to property owners, developers and neighbors about the limits of what is allowed in a residentially zoned area.
(G) To carry out the following specific purposes:
(1) Suburban Multi-Family Residential Districts. The purpose of the Suburban Multi-Family Residential Districts is to promote, preserve and protect neighborhoods intended primarily for multi-family dwellings that are suburban in character. As set forth in the Citys Comprehensive Plan, Suburban multi-family residential development will be in scale with existing development patterns.
(2) Eclectic Multi-Family Residential Districts. The purpose of the Eclectic Multi-Family Residential Districts is to promote, preserve and protect neighborhoods 143
Dayton, Ohio Zoning Code Amended May 29, 2019
Section 150.310, Multi-Family Residential Districts
intended primarily for multi-family dwellings that are more urban in character. Eclectic areas include neighborhoods of varying density. As set forth in the Citys Comprehensive Plan, Eclectic multi-family residential development will be in scale with existing development patterns.
The EMF District is designed to accommodate primarily medium-density multi-family dwellings. The maximum density permitted in this district is established by the bulk regulations that require new development or redevelopment to be similar in character to existing development. Single-family and two-family dwellings are also permitted.
(3) Mature Multi-Family Residential Districts. The purpose of the Mature Multi-Family Residential Districts is to promote, preserve and protect neighborhoods with traditional urban character. Mature areas are generally the oldest, close-to-downtown residential areas in the City. Small, dense lots were generally developed before 1920 in a regular grid street pattern. As set forth in the Citys Comprehensive Plan, Mature multi-family residential development will encourage historic preservation, development similar in character to existing development and well-designed, adaptive reuse of commercial and industrial buildings.
The MMF District is designed to accommodate primarily high-density multi-family dwellings. The maximum density permitted in this district is established by the bulk regulations that require new development and redevelopment to be similar in character to existing development. Single-family and two-family dwellings are also permitted. (Ord. 30515-05, passed 12-28-05)

Section 150.310, Multi-Family Residential Districts
(E) Minimum Front Yard Setback. The minimum front setback shall be the average setback of adjacent principal buildings. Such minimum front setback shall be the average distance of the front yard setbacks of the four lots, two on either side, of the zoning lot under review or within three (3) feet of such average. See Figure 1 in Section 150.305 for further clarification on calculating this average. A registered architect or engineer shall calculate this contextual average. If vacant lots surround the zoning lot, the average shall be determined by calculating the average of the four properties most directly across the street, or if the properties across the street are also vacant, the average shall be derived using the front setbacks of those lots on the nearest similar street, as determined by the Zoning Administrator.
In a case where portions of an existing structure are closer to the front street lot line than the four lots used to determine the average, a new addition or alteration may come up to the portion of the structure closest to the front lot line.
When determining the minimum front setback, the Zoning Administrator, the Board of Zoning Appeals, or the Plan Board, whichever is applicable according to the procedures in Section 150.115, shall exclude any adjacent building with a setback that exceeds the average setback of the other lots used to determine the average by more than twenty-five (25) percent.
When determining the minimum front setback, the Zoning Administrator, Board of Zoning Appeals, or the Plan Board, whichever is applicable according to the procedures in Section 150.115 shall exclude any adjacent building with a setback that is at least twenty-five (25) percent less than the average setback of the other lots used to determine the average, if the permit applicant requests such exclusion.
(F) Maximum Front Yard Setback. The maximum front yard setback shall be the greater of the four adjacent front setbacks, except when an adjacent setback is excluded as described above in sub-section 150.310.4 (E).
(G) Front Setback on Through Lots. On a through lot, a front setback shall be provided on each frontage equal to the minimum required front yard setback as set forth in Schedule 150.310.4(D). (Ord. 30515-05, passed 12-28-05; amend Ord. 30762-08, passed 7-16-08)
150.310.5 Height Regulations
Buildings and structures shall comply with the height regulations set forth below except as otherwise regulated in Section 150.500 for conditional uses and those uses denoted with a P*.
(A) Minimum Building Height for Single and Two-Family Uses and Multi-family Uses. The minimum height of a principal building shall be the height of the lowest building on the four lots, two on either side, of the zoning lot under review. A registered architect or engineer shall determine this height. If vacant lots surround the lot under review, the minimum height shall be determined by determining the lowest height of the four properties most directly across the public street. If any of the four lots used to determine the lowest height are vacant, any of the remaining lots shall be used to determine the lowest permitted height.
(B) Maximum Building Height for Single and Two-family Uses. The height of principal buildings shall not exceed 40 feet. 150

150.320.1 Purposes.
The Downtown districts (CBD, UBD) and their regulations are established in order to achieve the following purposes:
(A) To provide for orderly growth and development in the City of Dayton.
(B) To accommodate a mix of uses in an area well served by an existing transportation network of interstate highways and principal arterials.
(C) To reflect and reinforce the existing and desired high-density, pedestrian-scaled development pattern while accommodating the need for future growth.
(D) To provide assurance to property owners, developers and neighbors about the limits of what is allowed in a Downtown district.
To carry out the above principles and to effectuate the goals and objectives in the Citys Comprehensive Plan, it has been determined that two types of districts are necessary. The specific purposes for these Districts are:
(A) The Central Business (CBD) District. This District is designed to maintain and reinforce the highly active, high-intensity, and concentrated mix of uses that makes up the traditional downtown/central business district. The office, service, entertainment and retail uses within this district serve the needs of consumer populations well beyond the corporate boundaries of the city. Residential development is also encouraged. Because the CBD District is characterized by zero or very small building setbacks and pedestrian-oriented storefront architecture, this District is crafted to maintain and enhance this pattern of development. In addition, the uniqueness that is Daytons CBD is derived from its architectural resources and how these resources create and define Daytons public spaces, including its public rights-of-way. Since strengthening and continuing Daytons tradition of vibrant public spaces is one purpose for this District, this Section includes design standards. 167
Dayton, Ohio Zoning Code Amended May 29, 2019
Section 150.320, Downtown Districts
(B) The Urban Business (UBD) District. This District permits a wide range of residential, retail, service, office, light manufacturing and warehouse uses at a slightly lower intensity than the CBD. This district is also intended to provide for the conversion of older office, industrial and warehousing areas with multi-story buildings to residential, commercial, office or other uses for which the buildings, at the present time, may be better suited. To create an Urban Business District as envisioned and to reinforce existing character of zero or very small building setbacks and pedestrian-oriented storefront architecture, the design standards are applicable in this District as well. The bulk and height of buildings in the UBD are less intense than buildings in the CBD. (Ord. 30515-05, passed 12-28-05; amend Ord. 31738-19, passed 5-29-19)

150.325.1 Purposes.
The Commercial districts (MNC, ENC, SNC, MGC, EGC, SGC) and their regulations are established in order to achieve the following purposes:
(A) To provide for orderly growth and development in the City of Dayton.
(B) To provide sufficient areas, in appropriate and convenient locations, for business activities and the exchange of goods and services.
(C) To reflect and reinforce the existing density and pattern of development while accommodating the need for future growth.
(D) To provide certainty to property owners, developers and neighbors about the limits of what is allowed in a Commercial district.
To carry out the above principles and to effectuate the goals and objectives in the Citys Comprehensive Plan, it has been determined that the following Districts are necessary. The specific purposes for these Districts are:
(A) Neighborhood Commercial Districts. To accommodate retail and service uses that typically serve a limited neighborhood area, or other retail uses that serve a more general market area but can successfully operate within a neighborhood district. Such commercial uses are necessary to satisfy basic shopping and service needs that occur frequently and must, therefore, be located close to residential areas. The character of these districts is intended to be compatible with that of surrounding residential neighborhoods, and hours of operation are limited. Buildings in these districts are typically smaller in scale than those found in the general commercial districts.
(1) Development in the Mature Neighborhood Commercial (MNC) District should have an urban form and be pedestrian-oriented. Preservation of historic buildings is strongly encouraged.
(2) The Eclectic Neighborhood Commercial (ENC) District is not quite as urban as the MNC District, but pedestrian-oriented development and preservation of historic buildings is expected.
(3) The Suburban Neighborhood Commercial (SNC) District is characterized by a suburban development pattern. Although a pedestrian orientation is encouraged, 185
Dayton, Ohio Zoning Code Amended May 29, 2019
Section 150.325, Commercial Districts
development may be more auto-oriented than the MNC or ENC commercial districts.
(B) General Commercial Districts. To provide a wide range of goods and services to a large consumer population coming from an extensive area.
(1) Development in the Mature General Commercial (MGC) District must have an urban development pattern. The buildings are to be at or close to the sidewalk. The land uses may be more intense, than typically found in other neighborhood commercial districts.
(2) Development in the Eclectic General Commercial (EGC) District may be more suburban in form, but pedestrian orientation is still a priority.
(3) The Suburban General Commercial (SGC) District will have a suburban development pattern, with the largest lots and the deepest building setbacks of all the commercial districts. (Ord. 30515-05, passed 12-28-05)

150.330.1 Purposes.
The Mixed-Use and Transitional districts (MX, T) and their regulations are established in order to achieve the following purposes:
(A) To provide for orderly growth and development in the City of Dayton.
(B) To reflect and reinforce the existing density and pattern of development while accommodating the need for future growth.
(C) To provide for and encourage a balanced, compatible mix of uses, rather than a separation of uses, in a pedestrian-friendly environment.
(D) To provide assurances to property owners, developers and neighbors about the limits of what is allowed in a Mixed-Use or Transitional district.
(E) To carry out the following specific purposes:
(1) Transitional (T) District. The purpose of this district is to support the rehabilitation and/or redevelopment of underutilized commercially zoned areas in the City where traditional business district zoning is inappropriate or unsuccessful. The Transitional District allows a mixture of uses appropriate for creating a mixed live-work environment at a scale and character compatible with the surrounding residential neighborhoods. Such uses include a limited range of transitional commercial services such as office and light industrial uses, residential development and live-work units. Retail and manufacturing uses are not permitted in this district.
(2) Mixed-Use Hub (MX) District. The purpose of this district is to concentrate high-density, mixed-use residential and commercial development at select major transit nodes or key thoroughfare intersections, encourage higher site and building design standards, and create a more attractive pedestrian environment. Uses incompatible with this purpose, such as most auto-related uses, industrial uses and single-family dwellings, are not permitted. All uses, buildings and structures will be sited and designed to be compatible with one another. 205
Dayton, Ohio Zoning Code Amended May 29, 2019
Section 150.330, Mixed-Use and Transitional Districts
The MX District provides areas where regional or citywide shopping, employment or high-density residential uses may occur, and allows large-scale and tall buildings. This district allows a much greater intensity of development than the Mature, Eclectic or Suburban commercial districts, but less than the Downtown districts. A broad range of uses is permitted to encourage the development of diverse, interesting neighborhoods. Access to public transportation plays a key role in the development of the MX District.

The Campus-Institutional District (CI) and its regulations are established in order to accommodate institutional facilities and their associated uses in a manner that recognizes the unique development and location characteristics of large-scale institutional uses while respecting the needs of adjacent property owners and residents. As a result, this District sets out to both integrate institutional uses with adjacent non-residential neighborhoods and to adequately buffer institutional uses from adjacent low-density residential uses.
Therefore, the Campus-Institutional District and its regulations are established in order to accommodate civic buildings and other institutional facilities and their associated uses in a manner that:
(A) Provides for proper location of such facilities so as to increase the general convenience and safety of the Citys residents;
(B) Provides for orderly growth and development in the City of Dayton;
(C) Reflects and reinforces the existing density and pattern of development while accommodating the need for future growth;
(D) Provides for and encourages a balanced, compatible mix of uses, rather than a separation of uses, in a pedestrian-friendly environment; and,
(E) Ensures that such facilities are compatible with adjacent land uses by requiring development plan review for any proposed development near the periphery of the District. (Ord. 30515-05, passed 12-28-05)

The following development and design guidelines are established to ensure that all proposed development in the Campus-Institutional District complies with the purpose and objectives of this Section. The Plan Board and the Board of Zoning Appeals shall review plans for a proposed development giving particular consideration to the following:
(A) Principles for Reviewing Conditional Uses
Large-scale institutional uses can be located in close proximity to adjacent land uses in a manner that integrates them with non-residential uses and protects low-density residential uses. Given these goals, the Board of Zoning Appeals shall consider the following principles when reviewing applications for conditional use permits.
(1) Standards when a proposed conditional use is adjacent to, adjoins, or is across a public street from any Single Family Residential District or a Mature or Eclectic Multi-family District. When reviewing a conditional use of this nature, the Board of Zoning Appeals shall attempt to insure that residential properties are not negatively impacted by intrusions from the institutional uses. Therefore, the following standards shall be considered:
(a) Adequate screening, buffering, and landscaping shall be provided to limit the view of the proposed use, reduce the noise between incompatible land uses, and ease the transition from one zoning district to another.
(b) Natural features, especially mature trees, shall be preserved and supplemented with landscaping to buffer and screen adjacent residential districts. The Board of Zoning Appeals shall consider the setbacks, 230
Dayton, Ohio Zoning Code Amended May 29, 2019
Section 150.335, Campus-Institutional District
building mass and type of use when determining the extent of landscaping required.
(c) At a minimum, a thirty (30) foot buffer and landscaping area shall be provided that contains no structures, with the exception of decorative fencing.
(d) Pedestrian connections from the campus-institution development shall be designed to minimize impacts on adjacent residential neighborhoods.
(e) The layout of parking areas, service area, entrances, exits, signs, lighting, noise sources or other potentially adverse influences shall be designed and located to protect the character of residential areas adjacent to the development.
(2) Standards when a proposed conditional use is adjacent to, adjoins, or is across a public street from any Commercial, Downtown, Mixed Use and/or Transitional Use Zoning District. When reviewing a conditional use of this nature, the Board of Zoning Appeals shall insure that institutional uses are integrated into the fabric of the surrounding development; thereby becoming a part of the neighborhood in which they reside. Therefore, the following standards shall be considered:
(a) Development proposals by institutional uses shall respect the existing built environment or the framework being created in an area through zoning and other applicable regulations.
(b) The building placement, scale, and massing as well as the location of off-street parking facilities shall reflect and reinforce the surrounding development. If the adjacent areas are vacant, the building placement, scale, and massing as well as the location of off-street parking facilities shall reflect the development standards in the abutting zoning district.
(B) General Criteria for Permitted and Conditional Uses.
(1) Buildings, structures and landscaping should be designed and located on the site and be of a scale and massing to:
(a) Enhance and protect the character of the surrounding area; and,
(b) Minimize any adverse influences.
(2) To provide connectivity, sidewalks shall be provided from facilities, which are meant for use by the general public like parks and playgrounds, to the sidewalks in the public rights-of-way.
(3) Buildings, which have any facade facing a public street, shall have at least one entrance facing the public street or its tangent, if the street is curved. Any facade or building wall facing a public street or its tangent, if the street is curved, shall have a harmonious building fenestration, and in no case shall a wall devoid of openings be visible from a public street. 231
Dayton, Ohio Zoning Code Amended May 29, 2019
Section 150.335, Campus-Institutional District
(4) Delivery areas, loading zones, and mechanical equipment shall not face a public street and shall be screened from view of residentially zoned property by the use of walls, berms, and landscaping.
(5) Ambulance and emergency areas shall not abut a single-family residential district. If an ambulance or emergency area is visible from a public street, it shall have a buffer yard of twenty (20) feet. This buffer yard shall include a six (6) foot high masonry wall along the interior side of the landscaped area. One major tree is required per 30 lineal feet of wall or as appropriate to provide a tree canopy over the landscaped area. In addition, four feet high shrubs are required per 30 lineal feet of wall. Ground cover plants must fully cover the remainder of the landscaped area.
(6) All power plants, storage or maintenance buildings, which are visible from a public street, shall have buffer yard of twenty (20) feet. This buffer yard shall contain one major tree for every thirty (30) lineal feet of frontage or as appropriate to provide a tree canopy over the landscaped area. In addition, four (4) feet high shrubs are required per thirty (30) lineal feet of frontage. Ground cover plants must fully cover the remainder of the landscaped area.
(7) Site design plans shall include drawings, renderings, or perspectives of a professional quality that illustrate the scale; massing; roof shape; window size shape and spacing; and exterior materials of the structure. Site design plans shall also include samples of building materials.
(C) Design of Parking Areas for Permitted and Conditional Uses.
(1) Access to public streets from parking areas, service areas, and loading area within the development shall be designed to minimize traffic hazards or congestion and conflicts with pedestrians.
(2) Surface parking areas shall be located behind the front building line provided the Plan Board, at the time of general development plan review, may grant an exception from this requirement on the basis of the depth of the lot, the proximity of residentially zoned property, the unusual size or shape of the parcel, the location of mature trees, the location of principal buildings, or other similar factors. (Ord. 30515-05, passed 12-28-05)
150.335.10 Outdoor Display and Outdoor Storage Regulations

150.340.1 Purposes.
The Industrial districts (I-1, I-2, and BP) and their regulations are established in order to achieve the following purposes:
(A) To provide for orderly growth and development in the City of Dayton.
(B) To provide sufficient areas, in appropriate locations, for industrial activities and the production, distribution and exchange of goods and services.
(C) To reflect and reinforce the existing density and pattern of development while accommodating the need for future growth.
(D) To protect residential neighborhoods adjacent to industrial districts by establishing performance standards and restricting the types of establishments that might create noise, odors or other objectionable influences beyond the district boundaries.
(E) To provide certainty to property owners, developers and neighbors about the limits of what is allowed in an Industrial district.
(F) To carry out the following specific purposes:
(1) The Light Industrial (I-1) District is intended to provide urban sites for light industrial uses that conduct nearly all operations within an enclosed building, and do not have extensive outdoor storage areas or operations. While most buildings contain clean, light industrial uses, some commercial and office uses may also be included. As set forth in the Citys Comprehensive Plan, all new industrial development will be consistent with the existing pattern of development.
(2) The General Industrial (I-2) District accommodates heavy industrial activities that may include very large structures, extensive exterior storage, exterior 239
Dayton, Ohio Zoning Code Amended May 29, 2019
Section 150.340, Industrial Districts
mechanical operations, or heavy truck or equipment operations. As set forth in the Citys Comprehensive Plan, all new industrial development will be constructed in a manner that is consistent with the existing pattern of development in the vicinity of the proposal.
(3) The Business Park (BP) District provides sites in more suburban areas of the city for modern, clean industry and supporting nonresidential land uses that complement industrial uses or require an industrial environment. Development is encouraged in the form of office-industrial parks or business parks with campus-style layouts and designs. Heavy industrial uses and outdoor storage are conditionally permitted in selected locations within the BP District. (Ord. 30515-05, passed 12-28-05)

150.345.1 Purposes.
The public interest calls for the preservation and protection of significant historical, architectural and archeological resources from Dayton's and America's histories that lie within our city. Buildings and places that tell us of the presence of our forebears add meaning and livability to our city as do handsome residential areas and orderly business districts. To accomplish this, it is necessary to provide a method whereby, with careful consideration for the rights of private property and only after thorough analysis of the objectives to be achieved, certain public controls are required for changes made to meaningful buildings or neighborhoods.
Therefore, historic overlay districts (HD-1, HD-2, HD-3) and their regulations are established in order to achieve these purposes:
(A) To promote and protect the health, safety, and general welfare of the public through the enhancement of property values, economic development, neighborhood stability, and the protection of property rights of all citizens. 263
Dayton, Ohio Zoning Code Amended September 4, 2019
Section 150.345, Historic Overlay Districts
(B) To preserve and enhance the varied architectural styles reflecting the distinct phases of the City of Daytons history.
(C) To preserve, restore, reconstruct, renovate and/or rehabilitate historically or architecturally significant or contributing historic buildings, structures, sites and objects (hereafter referred to as property or properties) in districts that possess integrity of location, design, setting, materials, workmanship, feeling, and association.
(D) To develop and maintain appropriate settings and environments for the properties and districts described in Section 150.345, Historic Overlay Districts.
(E) To this end, this Section authorizes the adoption of overlay historic districts and creates a Secretary to the Landmark Commission and a Preservation Officer to review and approve architectural modifications that affect the historic quality of such properties and districts. (Ord. 30515-05, passed 12-28-05; amend Ord 31490-16, passed 5-04-16)
150.345.2 Designation of Historic District.
The Landmark Commission shall recommend to the City Plan Board the adoption or modification of a historic district overlay on all eligible areas in accordance with Section 150.125, Amendments. Historic Overlay Districts may consist of an individual property or an area of two or more properties. The boundaries of each such district shall be indicated on the official zoning map.
(A) The HD-1 Historic District Overlay (HD-1) is an overlay district designed to preserve and protect single parcels or groups of historic properties, including properties eligible for or listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The district may include a number of non-contributing properties, undeveloped parcels, or contributing properties that have not undergone rehabilitation. This district only governs major modifications in accordance with Section 150.345.7(A).

150.350.1 Purposes
(A) Purpose. The Planned Development District (PD) is an overlay district with regulations based on the premise that the ultimate quality of a built environment or development proposal is determined not only by the type, character and allocation of land uses, but also by the way in which such land uses are executed. In many cases, the subdivision regulations and standard zoning district regulations and procedures do not adequately regulate the design of buildings or enable the range of uses in a single zoning district that may be appropriate in the City of Dayton.
(1) The purposes of the Planned Development District regulations are to:
(a) Provide an opportunity for a mix of land uses otherwise not permitted within the standard municipal zoning district classifications.
(b) Allow the creation of development standards that respect the unique characteristics, natural quality and beauty of the site and the immediate vicinity and protect the communitys natural resources by avoiding development on, and destruction of, sensitive environmental areas.
(c) Enable greater review of design characteristics to ensure that the development project is properly integrated into its surroundings and is compatible with adjacent development.
(d) Assure compatibility between proposed land uses within and around the Planned Development District through appropriate development controls. 281
Dayton, Ohio Zoning Code Amended September 4, 2019
Section 150.350, Planned Developments
(e) Promote economical and efficient use of land and reduce infrastructure costs through unified development.
(f) Provide for supporting community facilities.
(g) Establish objective criteria for review that ensure conformity to community and district standards and allow for consistent treatment throughout.
(h) Create a mechanism to allow for the construction of Planned Developments in phases to accommodate the incremental development of a project.
(2) The Planned Development District is designed to encourage:
(a) Unified development projects that exhibit creative planning and design in ways that cannot be achieved through a standard zoning district or subdivision regulation, yet are consistent with all applicable plans, including but not limited to, the Citys Comprehensive Plan, Thoroughfare Plan, and the intent of the Zoning and Subdivision Code.
(b) Imaginative architectural design.
(c) Flexibility in building styles and types.
(d) Proper relationships between buildings, between developments and between structures and the land.
(e) The development of the land in an orderly, coordinated and comprehensive manner consistent with accepted land planning, landscape architecture practices and engineering principles according to approved plans. (amend Ord. 31752-19, passed 9-4-19)
150.350.2 Applications and Procedures
The process for an approval of a Planned Development and Final Plan includes:
(A) A property owner or owners may request to rezone a parcel or parcels to a Planned Development that establishes the vision, conceptual layout, land uses, and development standards for the project. The application for a Planned Development shall be reviewed by Plan Board and approved by City Commission. The application for rezoning to Planned Development shall be processed, noticed, and heard in the manner prescribed in this Zoning Code for Zoning Map amendments in Section 150.125. Any required subdivisions or plats may be considered concurrently with the Planned Development application.
(B) Following the approval of the Planned Development, the applicant shall submit a Final Plan to be reviewed and approved by Plan Board. The Final Plan shall include a detailed plan for development for either all or a portion of the approved Planned Development area. An application for a Final Plan shall be processed, noticed, and heard in the manner prescribed in this Zoning Code for Major Site Design Review in Section 150.115.7, Site Design Plan Review Procedures.

Dayton, Ohio Zoning Code Amended September 4, 2019
Section 150.350, Planned Developments
requirements of the Section where the characteristics or layout of abutting properties would make development of a unified or shared access and circulation system impractical.
(B) A system of joint use driveways and cross access easements shall be established along all streets designated as a collector or greater on the Citys Official Thoroughfare Plan and the building site shall incorporate one or more of the following:
(1) Service drive connections or cross access corridors preferably visible from the street between sites that have a design speed of 10 mph and sufficient width to accommodate two-way travel aisles designed to accommodate automobiles, service vehicles, and loading vehicles.
(2) Stub-outs and other design features to show that the abutting properties may be tied in to provide cross-access via a service drive or other connection;
(3) A unified access and circulation system plan that includes coordinated or shared parking areas, where feasible.
(C) Applicants for a building permit and/or Final Plan shall:
(1) Record an easement allowing cross access to and from other properties served by the joint use driveways and cross access or service drive; and
(2) Surrender any remaining access rights, such as abandoned curb cuts and pre-existing driveways along the public road, which will be closed and eliminated after the completion of the joint-use driveway; and,
(3) Record a joint maintenance agreement defining maintenance responsibility of adjoining property owners. (amend Ord. 31752-19, passed 9-4-19)
150.350.17 Site Layout
When lots with business or industrial buildings or structures in a Planned Development abut a residence district, or when lots with business buildings or structures abut residential buildings in the same development, appropriate screening and buffer yards shall be provided, as required in Section 150.800, Landscaping & Screening Regulations. Any part of a Planned Development not proposed to be used for buildings, structures, parking and loading areas, or accessways, shall be landscaped and planted. (amend Ord. 31752-19, passed 9-4-19)
150.350.18 Site Design Requirements
Any required design standards, residential contextual standards, or pedestrian oriented design standards for the zoning district in which the tract or parcel is located shall be applicable to the Planned Development. The Plan Board may modify the applicable regulations if it is demonstrated by the applicant that due to unusual circumstances, such as the form of the surrounding built environment or the shape of the parcels that comprise the Planned Development, that compliance would not further the Purposes of this Section or the Purposes of the otherwise applicable zoning district. Site design requirements for a Planned Development shall be established per Section 150.350.4, Planned Development Application Requirements. (amend Ord. 31752-19, passed 9-4-19) 289

150.350.20 Conditions and Guarantees
Prior to the granting of any Planned Development, the Plan Board may recommend, and the Commission shall adopt, such conditions and restrictions upon the establishment, location, construction, maintenance, and operation of the Planned Development as the Commission deems necessary for the protection of the public interest and to secure compliance with the Planned Development. (amend Ord. 31752-19, passed 9-4-19)
150.350.21 Amendments to Planned Developments
(A) The Plan Board has jurisdiction to approve minor amendments to an approved Planned Development provided that the amendments remain in harmony with the general purposes and intents of the development. Minor amendments shall include, but are not limited to, the minor shifting of the location of permitted land uses within the development, a reorganization of the street, open space, or pedestrian network, or other amendments that may result in a necessary change in the Planned Development due to the location or availability of infrastructure, or other field conditions.
(B) If the Director of Planning and Community Development determines that the proposed changes constitute a major amendment to an approved Planned Development, such major amendment shall be considered a new Planned Development that shall be processed, noticed, and heard in the manner prescribed in this Zoning Code for Zoning Map amendments in Section 150.125.

Within a UP District
150.355.1 Purpose.
(A) The conservation of the unique urban character of many of Dayton's residential and commercial areas recognizes that the preservation and protection of the elements that make these areas attractive is consistent with the goal of residential and business district vitality. These areas provide an alternative to new outlying homogeneous residential and commercial areas. As such, the conservation objective is to retain the overall physical ambience of these areas through appropriately scaled and sited new construction as well as sensitive rehabilitation of those structures that continue to retain functional usefulness. In a word, the overall goal is compatibility with the existing built environment.
(B) The purposes of the Urban Preservation regulations are to assist the development of land and structures to be compatible with, and to protect, the quality of the urban environment in those locations where the characteristics of the environment are of significant public value and where development permitted under conventional zoning and building regulations may negatively affect that value. It is the intent of this Section to promote and protect the health, safety, and general welfare of the public through:
(1) The enhancement of property values, the protection of property rights of all citizens, and the stabilization and revitalization of distinctive areas of the city, as defined in this Section.
(2) The protection, enhancement, perpetuation, and use of structures, sites, and neighborhoods that have an urban character unique in the City.
(3) The recognition of the need to conserve certain unique City areas focusing on how each structure and element of the area blends and fits with all other features of the area.
(C) To this end, these sub-sections authorize the adoption of Urban Preservation Overlay districts that will control certain aspects of physical development, redevelopment, and rehabilitation in the district. (Ord. 30515-05, passed 12-28-05) 295

(8) No sign shall be permitted other than those permitted by the applicable regulations in Section 150.900, Sign Regulations.
(9) The home occupation shall be conducted by appointment only.
(10) No home occupation shall require the daily services of a commercial freight carrier, nor shall the use produce traffic in greater frequency than normally found in the adjacent residential area.

When the City of Dayton receives requests to vacate rights-of-way, those requests will be reviewed pursuant to the procedures and standards in Sections 95.80 - 95.84 of the R.C.G.O. In addition, the Plan Board will consider the request based on the following:

(3) Function. Is the existing street and/or alley grid, in the surrounding area, intact or already broken? How well does the existing street or alley system perform in the surrounding area? What are the potential impacts to the long-term flexibility of the transportation network? Will approval of the vacation create, reduce, or eliminate a dead-end alley or street?
(4) Consequence. What might be the 50-100 year consequence of the vacation for the City?
(5) Options. Are there other options to a full vacation that might be feasible and preserve the use of the street or alley?
(6) Services. Is the right-of-way needed for utilities, loading, or other services? Might it be in the future? How would these needs be alternatively served? 342
Dayton, Ohio Zoning Code Amended May 29, 2019
Section 150.400, Supplemental District Regulations
(7) Access. Does the right-of-way provide primary or secondary access to abutting properties for either vehicular or pedestrian access? Does vacation of the right-of-way impact off-street parking?
(8) Light, View, and Air. What is the potential impact on view sheds, light, and air?
(9) Height, Bulk, and Scale. What could be the resultant changes in height and bulk on the block? What could be the impact on the form and orientation of buildings on the block relative to surrounding blocks?
(10) Pedestrian Connections. Does the right-of-way function as a mid-block or through block connection or provide other linkages to existing sidewalks or pedestrian ways.
(11) Use of Right of Way. Is the right-of-way adjacent or leading to any park, open space, natural area, or any other natural or man-made attraction?
(12) Comprehensive Plan. Is the vacation request consistent with the goals and objectives of the Comprehensive Plan?
(13) Other Plans/Policies. Is the right-of-way included in or identified by any City improvement project or adopted plan?
(14) Zoning District. Is the vacation request consistent with the purposes of the zoning district in which it is located, the uses permitted in the zoning district, and the districts contextual standards/regulations and/or design elements/standards?
(B) Criteria for Establishing Conditions. The Plan Board shall only establish conditions for a requested vacation if all of the following three (3) criteria are met:
(1) The right-of-way is judged as not important to the Citys neighborhoods in terms of providing access for residents, and/or property owners, space for utilities, and a means to provide City services; and,
(2) The right-of-way is not important to the Citys present or future transportation network in terms of automobile, bicycle, or pedestrian traffic; and,
(3) The right-of-way does not serve as the primary access to parcels.

Section 150.700, Off-Street Parking and Loading Regulations
150.700.2 Parking and Loading Facilities Required
Accessory off-street parking facilities, including access driveways, shall be provided on the same site as, and prior to the occupancy of, an approved or permitted building or use. Parking spaces reserved for any fleet vehicles shall not be used to meet the minimum space requirement for off-street parking and shall not interfere with the free circulation of vehicles within the off-street parking area. Further parking facilities shall be provided for the entire building or use, or shared among buildings or uses, in accordance with the regulations contained in this Section whenever:
(A) New Development. The parking and loading standards of this Section apply to all new buildings constructed and all new uses established in all zoning districts.
(B) Expansions and Substantial Modifications. The parking standards of this Section require the provision of additional parking spaces when an existing building or use is expanded or enlarged, whether through the addition of dwelling units, floor area, seating capacity, employees or other units of measurements used for establishing off-street parking such that:
(1) Additional off-street parking spaces to meet minimum ratios are required only to serve the enlarged or expanded area, not the entire structure or use; and
(2) If the number of parking spaces on a site at the time of expansion or substantial modification exceeds the maximum ratios of this Section, no additional spaces will be allowed.
(C) Change of Occupancy. Whenever a structure or parcel of land is occupied by a use that requires 150 percent, or more, parking spaces than the previous use, the owner of the new use shall provide at least eighty (80) percent of the parking spaces required for the new use on the site.
(D) Damage or Destruction of Existing Use. When a conforming or non-conforming structure or use that does not comply with current off-street parking and/or loading regulations is damaged and the cost of reconstruction does not exceed seventy-five (75) percent of the assessed value at the time such damage occurred, the building may be reconstructed with the same number of parking and loading spaces that existed at the time of damage or destruction. However, when the cost of reconstruction exceeds seventy-five (75) percent of the assessed value at the time such damage occurred, off-street parking and loading spaces shall be provided in the amount required for new construction.
(E) All off-street parking facilities, or those required as accessory to a use of a proposed or altered building, shall continue unobstructed in operation and shall not be reduced below the required size as long as the principal use remains, unless an equivalent number of spaces are provided for said use in another approved location or approved sharing arrangement.
(F) Adequate off-street parking facilities shall be provided to accommodate all motor vehicles of residents or employees, visitors, and customers, and the vehicles used in the conduct of any business enterprise, and no such required off-street parking shall be leased or rented to another property owner or tenant. Notwithstanding the above provision, in no 422
Dayton, Ohio Zoning Code Amended September 4, 2019
Section 150.700, Off-Street Parking and Loading Regulations
case shall the number of off-street parking spaces provided be less than the minimum prescribed in this Section.
(G) Bicycle parking may be substituted for up to 10 percent of required off-street vehicle parking spaces. For every five (5) non-required bicycle parking spaces that meet the bicycle parking requirements found in Section 150.700.13, the off-street vehicle parking requirement is reduced by one (1) space. Existing off-street parking spaces may be converted to take advantage of this provision.
(H) A bike sharing station may be substituted for required off-street vehicle parking spaces if all of the following requirements are met:
(1) The bike sharing station shall have a minimum of eleven (11) docks. A station of this size shall reduce the off-street vehicle parking space requirement by three (3) spaces. The provision of each additional four (4) docks and two (2) shared bicycles shall reduce the off-street vehicle parking space requirement by one (1) additional space. A maximum of 25 percent of required off-street vehicle parking spaces may be reduced through the provision of a bike sharing station.
(2) The bike sharing station shall be visible and accessible to the public.
(3) The bike sharing station shall be within a distance of another bike sharing station that is part of the same bike sharing system that is approved by the bike share operator.
(4) The bike sharing station shall be located on the site or adjacent sidewalk of the use for which the off-street vehicle parking spaces are required or on the site of a restricted parking lot that serves the use.
(5) The bike sharing station shall be shown on the site design plans submitted to the Zoning Administrator for the use.
(6) The property owner shall have an agreement for its bike sharing station with a bike sharing organization which serves the City of Dayton geography. The bike sharing station shall be part of the bike sharing system controlled by the bike sharing organization.
The property owner shall maintain the agreement with the bike sharing organization for as long as it wishes to substitute a bike sharing station for required off-street vehicle parking spaces. Should the bike sharing organization no longer wish to include the bike sharing station in its system or the bike sharing system is no longer in operation, the Zoning Administrator may require the property owner to meet the off-street vehicle parking space requirement.
Should the property owner no longer wish to include the bike sharing station in the bike sharing system, the Zoning Administrator may require the property owner to meet the off-street vehicle parking space requirement. (Ord. 30515-05, passed 12-28-05; amend Ord. 31574-17, passed 7-05-17) 423

In computing the number of parking spaces required by this Code, the following rules shall apply. Some parking requirement reductions are permissible pursuant to sub-section 150.700.11:
(A) Floor Area. Where floor area is designated as the standard for determining parking space requirements, floor area shall mean gross floor area, or the total area of all floors measured from the exterior faces of the building, unless otherwise specified. Any floor or part thereof used for storage or packaging of merchandise as well as any kitchen areas, not to exceed twenty (20) percent of the total floor area, may be excluded.
(B) Design Capacity. Where seating capacity is the standard for determining parking space requirements, design capacity shall mean the number of persons that can be legally accommodated according to the City of Daytons Building Code in the primary assembly room.
(C) Employees. Where number of employees is the standard for determining parking space requirements, employees shall mean the maximum number of employees on any one shift plus one half of the maximum number of employees on a subsequent shift.
(D) Fractional Numbers. Where the computation of parking spaces results in a fractional number, the number shall be rounded to the next higher whole number.
(E) Parking Requirements for Uses Not Specified. When the off-street parking requirements for a use are not specifically defined herein, the parking facilities for such use shall be determined by the Zoning Administrator so as to be sufficient to meet all the parking needs of the proposed use, based on the parking standards for a specific use listed in Schedules 150.700.4  150.700.10 that the Zoning Administrator determines to be the most similar to the proposed use. (Ord. 30515-05, passed 12-28-05; amend Ord. 31490-16, passed 5-04-16)
150.700.4 Parking in Residential Districts
(A) The number of off-street parking spaces for each facility or use in residential districts shall be determined by application of the standards set forth in Schedule 150.700.4.

Section 150.700, Off-Street Parking and Loading Regulations
150.700.11 Parking Requirement Reductions and Off-Site Parking
(A) Shared Parking. Because various uses have different hours of peak parking needs, two or more uses may share parking facilities without providing the minimum number of on-site required spaces for each use when all of the following conditions are met.
(1) The minimum required number of parking spaces for the combined uses may be reduced by twenty (20) percent for shared parking when the hours of operation overlap. Residential uses shall not be allowed to share parking facilities.
(2) When the hours of operation do not overlap, the parking facility to be shared shall contain at least the number of spaces required for the use necessitating the greatest minimum quantity of parking spaces.
(3) The parking facility to be shared shall be owned by the owner of one of the uses or leased for a minimum one (1) year term or through a permanent easement by the owner of the uses being served. If the term of the use is limited by a conditional use permit, then the term of the lease agreement may be limited accordingly. At the expiration of the term of a lease, the owner must replace the off-site parking or end the use which required the parking.
(4) No changes shall be made to the shared parking facility that would reduce the parking provided for the uses, unless the owner of one of the uses makes other arrangements to provide parking. No such changes shall be made without prior approval.
(5) Parking spaces to be shared shall not be reserved for a specific person, individual or use on a twenty-four-hour basis.
(6) Handicap parking spaces may not be shared unless the uses that are to share the spaces are adjacent to the handicap spaces and no inconvenience to the users of such spaces would be created.
(7) Loading spaces may not be shared.
(8) Any proposed change in the use of a structure that shares a parking facility will require proof that adequate parking is available.
(B) Off-Site Parking. All off-street parking spaces shall be located on the same lot as the building or use, except under all of the following conditions:
(1) The use must supply at least fifty (50) percent of its required parking on-site. The Zoning Administrator, upon review of the following criteria, may grant an exception to this requirement:
(a) Proximity of the proposed parking area to the use served;
(b) Ease and safety of access between the proposed parking area and the use served; 433
Dayton, Ohio Zoning Code Amended September 4, 2019
Section 150.700, Off-Street Parking and Loading Regulations
(c) Use to be served by the proposed off-site parking; and
(d) The hours of operation of the use to be served by the proposed off-site parking.
(2) The off-site parking spaces shall be within a walking distance from a building entrance or use. Walking distance shall mean within 800 feet as measured in a straight line from a building entrance or use to the nearest parking space. If the pedestrian access is to cross an arterial street, appropriate safety measures shall be present to help the pedestrian cross the street. In any case, safe and convenient pedestrian access, such as a sidewalk or path, shall exist or be provided from the structure or use to the parking lot.
(3) Contiguous lots providing off-street parking for more than one use shall provide sufficient spaces to comply with the parking requirements for all uses served.
(4) The off-site parking lot may be located in a different zoning district than the use it serves if a parking facility is permitted by right or by special use permit in the different zoning district.
(5) The off-site parking facility shall be owned by the owner of one of the uses or leased for a minimum one (1) year term or through a permanent easement by the owner of the uses being served. If the term of the use is limited by a special use permit, then the term of the lease agreement may be limited accordingly. At the expiration of the term of a lease, the owner shall renew the lease, shall replace the off-site parking, or end the use which required the parking.
(6) No changes shall be made to the off-site parking lot which would reduce the parking provided for the use, unless other arrangements to provide parking are made by the owner of the use.
(7) All required handicapped spaces shall be located on the same site as the use.
(8) An existing non-conforming parking lot to be used under this Section as off-site parking must be landscaped, paved and striped according to the standards of this Section. (Ord. 30515-05, passed 12-28-05; amend Ord. 31142-11, passed 12-21-11; amend Ord. 31283-13, passed 12-18-13)

Section 150.800, Landscaping & Screening Regulations
expansion is a part unless the alteration or expansion is substantial. An alteration or expansion to an existing property is substantial when:
(1) In the case of a building or structure that does not involve additional land, the square footage of the expansion exceeds twenty-five percent (25%) of the gross floor area of the existing building.
(2) In the case where additional land is involved, the additional land or the expanded square footage of a structure exceeds twenty-five percent (25%) of the existing site or structure.
(3) Land as used herein includes land for open space, parking or building.
(C) Single-family and two-family residences shall be exempt from sub-section 150.800.11, Approval Process for Required Landscaping, Fences, and Walls. (Ord. 30515-05, passed 12-28-05)
150.800.3 Reserved
150.800.4 General Requirements and Maintenance of Yards
Required yards and all other portions of the lot not covered by permitted structures shall be landscaped with grass, trees, shrubbery and/or other appropriate ground cover or landscaping material, which at all times shall be maintained in good and healthy condition.

(F) Except single-family and two-family uses, all parcels shall provide a permanent hose bib that is accessible to all landscaped areas either on an exterior wall or freestanding. (Ord. 30515-05, passed 12-28-05)
150.800.5 Landscaping Requirements Along Street Frontages
In all zoning districts, owners shall plant and maintain shade trees along public street frontages in compliance with the following:
(A) Species and Location Requirements.
(1) Trees shall be limited to species characterized as hardy, long-lived shade trees. Tree species that shall not be permitted are listed in Schedule 150.800.7. The 444
Dayton, Ohio Zoning Code Amended May 29, 2019
Section 150.800, Landscaping & Screening Regulations
Director of Public Works may add additional tree species to those listed in Schedule 150.800.7.
(2) One tree shall be provided for every thirty (30) linear feet of frontage, or fraction thereof, along each road.
(3) Trees are to be planted within ten (10) feet of the rights-of-way of the road or roads within and abutting the development. In those Zoning Districts with no required front or side setbacks, the street trees shall be located in the street right-of-way.
(4) The planting of trees in the street right-of-way underneath overhead primary electric distribution lines is discouraged.
(5) In those locations where an overhead primary electric distribution line exists, trees should be planted a minimum of ten (10) feet away from the overhead primary electric distribution line. If this is not possible due to an insufficient setback or right-of-way, the Zoning Administrator, Board of Zoning Appeals, or the Plan Board, whichever is applicable, may waive the required trees or request that the required trees be planted along a nearby street right-of-way or public park. Such alternate location should be approved by the Department of Public Works.
(6) In the Downtown Districts, the Mature Neighborhood Commercial District, and the Mature General Commercial District, if the street right-of-way lacks a tree lawn, street trees shall be planted in sidewalk pits. The Division of Civil Engineering shall approve the location of these pits. The minimum dimensions for such pits shall be 5 feet X 5 feet. If the sidewalk is too narrow to permit sidewalk pits of such a size, the Zoning Administrator may grant an exception to a dimension that would both accommodate a street tree and permit pedestrian traffic.
(7) Each tree at the time of installation shall have a minimum caliper of between 2.0 and 2.5 inches and a clear trunk height of between five (5) and six (6) feet.
(8) In those instances where eight (8) or more trees are to be planted, there shall be a minimum diversity of two (2) tree species planted at a minimum 3:2 ratio.

The following regulations shall control the computation and measurement of sign area, sign height, window area and building frontage:
(A) Determining Sign Area or Dimension of Signs.
(1) The sign area shall include the face of all display area(s) of the sign. The sign area shall include the frame and structural support unless such structural support is determined to be an architectural feature as defined in sub-section 150.200.2, Definitions. Architectural features that are either part of the building or part of a freestanding structure are not considered signs and are exempt from these regulations.
(2) For a sign that is framed, outlined, painted or otherwise prepared and intended to provide a background for a sign display, the area of the sign shall be the area of not more than three (3) regular geometric shapes that encompass the entire area of the sign including the background or frame.
(3) For a sign comprised of individual letters, figures or elements on a wall or similar surface of a building or structure, or an irregularly shaped freestanding sign, the area of the sign shall be the area of not more than three (3) regular geometric shapes that encompass the perimeter of all of the elements of the display.
(a) When separate elements are organized to form a single sign, but the elements are separated by open space, the area of the sign shall include all the display areas, including the space between the elements.
(b) Up to five (5) percent of the permitted sign area may be considered minor protrusions and extend outside of the maximum limitation of three 456
Dayton, Ohio Zoning Code Amended September 4, 2019
Section 150.900, Sign Regulations
(3) regular geometric shapes, and are, therefore, exempted from being included as part of the sign area. See Figure 1.
(4) For freestanding signs and projecting signs the sign area shall be computed by the measurement of one (1) of the faces when two (2) identical display faces are joined, are parallel, or are within thirty (30) degrees of being parallel to each other and are at no point separated by a distance that exceeds three (3) feet. For any sign that has two (2) display faces that do not comply with the above regulation, or has more than two (2) display surfaces, then each surface shall be included when determining the area of the sign.
In determining the area of freestanding signs, the following shall be exempted from being considered as part of the maximum permitted area, see Figure 2:
(a) The portion of a solid sign base or other sign support, up to a maximum height of four (4) feet that:
(i) Is at least fifty (50) percent screened by landscaping at the time of installation; or
(ii) Complies with the requirements of sub-section (c) below.
(b) The air space under a freestanding sign between supporting posts, other air space between a projecting sign and the wall to which it is attached.
(c) Additional base area, framing or structural supports or other portions of the sign, when such areas are determined to be:
(i) Constructed and designed with materials which are similar to, or compatible with, the architecture of the building or other site features;
(ii) Not intended or designed to include messages; and
(iii) Exclusive of colors, trademarks, or any other decorative design features that are primarily intended to attract attention, rather than be unobtrusive or compatible with the architecture of the building or other site features.

(5) The height of a freestanding sign shall be measured from the elevation of the sidewalk or edge of the public right-of-way immediately adjacent, or nearest, to the sign structure, to the highest point of the sign, its frame, or decorative features
For locations that the Zoning Administrator determines to have unusual or irregular topography (along the street frontage and/or between the street right-of-way and the site of the sign) the Zoning Administrator may approve a modification to the height of the sign for the sole purpose of permitting the proposed sign to be approximately equal to the height of other conforming signs in the vicinity.
(B) Determining Building Frontage and Building Unit. For the purposes of this Section, the building frontage shall include the building walls that: face a public street, face a parking lot which serves the use, or contain a public entrance to the uses therein.

Provided, however, that if the effect of this Zoning Code is to make a sign, that was formerly unlawful or non-conforming, become lawful and/or conforming, then no enforcement action shall be taken except for the imposition and collection of penalties, other than the removal of the sign, for the violations that occurred prior to the effective date of this Zoning Code.

The purpose of 150.925 is to promote the health, safety and welfare of the city by establishing standards and requirements for the construction, alteration, repair, replacement, location or relocation of off-premises signs within the City of Dayton. It is intended to supplement the standards and requirements applicable to all signs as set forth in 150.900 of the Zoning Code. In the event a conflict is found to exist between a provision applicable to all signs as set forth in 150.900 and a provision applicable to off-premises signs as set forth in 150.925, the more restrictive provision shall prevail.
It is the intent of the city to permit off-premise signs within certain districts of the city, subject to height, area and spacing requirements, while restricting, or prohibiting, the placement of off-premises signs within residential and other districts of the city where off-premises signs are incompatible with permitted uses.

(B) Electronic Off-Premise Sign means an off-premise sign, or portion thereof, that can be electronically changed by remote or automatic means, or that appears to change or have movement caused by any method other than the movement or rotation of panels or slats, or manually removing or replacing the off-premise sign or its components, whether the apparent movement or change is in the display, the off-premise signs structure, or any component of the off-premise sign. This includes but is not limited to any video-display, revolving, flashing, or 481

150.950.1 Purposes and Findings
(A) Purpose. The City of Dayton has determined that permitting sexually oriented businesses, as defined in this Section, in proximity to residential, institutional, and non-adult oriented retail uses would have a detrimental effect on such adjacent uses. It has been demonstrated that sexually oriented businesses, as defined in this Section, have been known to cause undesirable secondary effects on residential and institutional uses, particularly those where children are present, as well as adjacent non-sexually oriented business oriented retail uses. The provisions of this Chapter do not have the purpose or effect of imposing a limitation or restriction on the content of any communicative materials, including sexually oriented materials. Further, it is not the intent of this chapter to restrict or deny access by adults to sexually oriented materials protected by the First Amendment, or to deny access by the distributors and exhibitors of sexually oriented entertainment to their intended market. Neither is it the intent nor effect of this chapter to condone or legitimize the distribution of obscene material. Therefore, in order to prevent potential deterioration in Daytons retail areas; and to avoid potential adverse impacts on residential and institutional uses particularly those where children are present, and thereby protecting the public health, safety and welfare, sexually oriented businesses, as defined in this Section, shall be permitted only in the I-1 and I-2 Districts subject to the following requirements.
(B) Findings. The City Commission has received substantial evidence concerning the adverse secondary effects of adult uses on the community in findings incorporated in the cases of City of Renton v. Playtime Theatres, Inc., 475 U.S. 41 (1986), Young v. American Mini Theatres, 426 U.S. 50 (1976), and Barnes v. Glen Theatre, Inc., 501 U.S. 560 (1991), and on studies in other communities, including, but not limited to, Phoenix, Arizona; Tucson, Arizona; Garden Grove, California; Los Angeles, California; Whittier, California; Indianapolis, Indiana; Oklahoma City, Oklahoma; Amarillo, Texas; Austin, Texas; Beaumont, Texas; Houston, Texas; and Seattle, Washington.
