next succeeding day that is not Sunday or a legal holiday.
      (2)   When a public office, in which an act required by law is to be
performed, is closed to the public for the entire day that constitutes the last
day for doing the act or before its usual closing time on that day, the such

not revive the provision originally repealed nor impair the effect of any
saving clause therein.

   (b)   The re-enactment, amendment or repeal of a provision of the Codified

applies to all re-enactments or amendments thereof. 
(ORC § 1.55)

under designated sections of the Codified Ordinances include, in every case,
action taken or authorized under the applicable legislative provision which is
superseded by the Codified Ordinances.
(ORC § 1.23)
   (d)  Whenever reference is made in one section to another section, the
reference shall extend and apply to the section referred to as subsequently
amended, revised, recodified, or renumbered, unless the subject matter be
changed or materially altered by the amendment or revision.
§ 202.06  SEVERABILITY.
   If any provision of a section of the Codified Ordinances or the application
thereof to any person or circumstances is held invalid, the invalidity does not

which can be given effect without the invalid provision or application, and to
this end the provisions are separable.

failure to do any act is declared to be unlawful, the commission or performance
of such act, or the failure to commit or perform such act, as required, shall,
unless another penalty is provided, be deemed a minor misdemeanor and the
offender shall be fined not more than $500 for each offense.  A separate
offense shall be deemed committed each day during or on which a violation or

CHAPTER 204:  OFFICIAL STANDARDS
Editor’s note:
   The State of Ohio operates on Eastern Daylight Savings Time.  Congress, on
March 22, 1966, passed the Uniform Time Act requiring uniform observance
throughout the nation of Daylight Savings Time starting in 1967, except that a
state legislature could exempt the entire state from Daylight Savings Time or
divide a state into not more than two parts, each with a different time
standard.  The Ohio legislature, through inaction, has elected to observe
Eastern Daylight Savings Time throughout the state.
   On August 8, 2005, the Energy Policy Act of 2005 was enacted. This Act
changed the time change dates for Daylight Saving Time in the United States.
Beginning in 2007, the State of Ohio begins Daylight Saving Time at 2:00 a.m.
on the second Sunday in March and reverts to standard time at 2:00 a.m. on the
first Sunday in November. The Secretary of Energy will report the impact of
this change to Congress. Congress retains the right to resume the 2005 Daylight
Saving Time schedule once the Department of Energy study is complete.
   There are no sections in Chapter 204.  This chapter has been established to
provide a place for statutory references, cross-references and any future
legislation.
Statutory reference:
   State flag, see Ohio R.C. § 5.01
   State legal holidays, see Ohio R.C. §§ 1.14 and 5.20 et seq.
   State motto, see Ohio R.C. § 5.06
   State standard of time, see Ohio R.C. § 1.04
CHAPTER 206:  WARDS AND BOUNDARIES (REPEALED)
Editor’s note:
   Chapter 206 was repealed by implication by the status change of the
municipality (April 20, 1981).

(Ord. 84-7, passed 2-10-1984; Am. Ord. 2012-48, passed 8-21-12)
§ 220.05  MOTIONS AND ORDINANCES.
   (a)   When a motion is made and seconded, it shall be stated by the Mayor
before debate. A motion must be reduced to writing, if any member requests it,
and shall not be withdrawn without the consent of Council.
   (b)   When a question is before Council, no motion shall be entertained
unless it is to adjourn, to lay on the table, for the previous question, to
postpone either indefinitely or to a specified time, to refer or to amend. Such
motions shall have precedence in the order mentioned herein.
   (c)   A motion to adjourn shall always be in order, except on immediate
repetition, or when a member has the floor, or when the previous question has
been ordered, or when Council is voting.
   (d)   If a motion to adjourn is made while any question is pending and the
motion is carried, the question cannot again be considered unless it is
reintroduced in the usual way.
   (e)   A motion to lay on the table shall not be amendable or debatable. If
the motion prevails, the consideration of a subject cannot be resumed, except
as unfinished business, without the consent of two-thirds of the members
present.
   (f)   All motions to postpone must be amended as to time, but preclude
debate on the main question. An indefinite postponement is equivalent to a
rejection of the proposition.
   (g)   Any member voting with the prevailing side on a question may move for
a reconsideration of the same, and the motion may be seconded by any member.
However, when a motion to reconsider is once made and lost, it shall not be
renewed. Such a motion is a privilege motion and may precede all other
questions and can be considered at any time after the pending business is
disposed of. A majority of the members present may reconsider any vote.
   (h)   The first reading of a proposed ordinance shall be for information. 
If objection is made to the ordinance, the question shall be: “Shall the
proposition be rejected?”  An objection to an ordinance shall take precedence
over a motion to dispense with the rule requiring ordinances to be read on
three different days.
   (i)   After the second reading of an ordinance, no amendment thereto shall
be in order. Upon the third reading thereof, the question shall be upon the
final passage, which must be determined by a yea and nay vote upon the call of
the roll. No ordinance, resolution or bylaw requiring more than one reading
shall be passed through its several readings together, except by a separate
suspension of the rules for each such ordinance, resolution or bylaw.
   (j)   Ordinances or resolutions authorizing the expenditure of money shall
have the approval of the Finance Committee and any other committee recommending
the same, which approval shall be endorsed on the ordinance or resolution. The
Clerk, when reading such ordinance, shall specifically state that the ordinance
he or she is reading has been endorsed by the Finance Committee or any other
committee of Council. If such ordinances or resolutions are presented without
such approval, the same shall be referred without debate to the Finance
Committee.
   (k)   All new questions shall be appropriately referred to committee without
debate, unless a majority of Council dispenses with this rule. All new
ordinances and resolutions which the Mayor or Village Administrator desires to
be placed on the agenda at the next Council meeting should be submitted to the
proper Chairperson of the standing Council committee at least two weeks prior
to the Council meeting at which such ordinance or resolution is to be
considered.
   (l)   Only the names of Council members or committees of Council shall be
listed on such ordinance or resolution to indicate the proposer of the
ordinance or resolution.
   (m)   Any amendment to this section shall be presented in writing and
referred to the Committee of the Whole and shall not be considered at the same
meeting.
(Ord. 84-7, passed 2-10-1984; Am. Ord. 2012-48, passed 8-21-12)

“pick up” by the village is, and shall be designated as, Public Employee
Contributions and shall be in lieu of contributions to the Public Employees
Retirement System of Ohio by each person within any of the classes established
in this section.  No person subject to this “pick up” shall have the option of

contribution for each person subject to this “pick up” has been made as
provided by the statute.

employee’s deferred salary shall be equal to that percentage of that employee’s
total salary which is required from time to time by the Public Employees
Retirement System of Ohio to be paid as an employee contribution by that
employee, and shall be paid by the village to the Public Employees Retirement
System of Ohio on behalf of that employee as a pick-up in lieu of the Public
Employees Retirement System employee contribution otherwise payable by that
employee.  An employee’s cash salary shall be payable subject to the
appreciable payroll deductions to that employee.  The village shall compute and
remit its employer contribution to the Public Employees Retirement System of
Ohio based upon an employee’s total salary.  The total combined expenditures of
the village for the employees’ total salaries payable under applicable village
policies and the pick-up provisions of this resolution shall not be greater
than the amounts it would have paid for those items had this provision not been
in effect.
   (d)   The Village Clerk-Treasurer is hereby authorized and directed to
implement the provisions of this section to institute the “pick up” of the
statutorily required contributions to the Public Employees Retirement System of
Ohio for those persons reflected in this section, so as to enable them to
obtain the result in federal and state tax deferment.
   (e)   Full-time employees employed by the village after December 31, 2001,
shall have four and one-half percent of their salary deducted and deposited by
the village in the public employees retirement system as their employees
contribution or part thereof in accordance with state law. Should employee
contributions be required in excess of four and one-half percent of salary, the
village shall “pick up” such excess employee contributions in the same manner
as described above in this section.
   (f)   The village shall make such employer contributions as required by and

Ordinances shall have deducted from their pay the statutorily required employee

   (a)   Each full-time employee shall receive eight hours times his or her
regular wage rate per hour for each of the following named holidays, provided
that the employee worked his or her last and next scheduled work day.  If the

thereafter during the remainder of the calendar year. All vacation days shall
be taken within the calendar year, if at all possible, and shall not carryover

vacation shall be given at the discretion of the Village Administrator.
   (c)   Any employee entitled to vacation shall notify his or her supervisor
by April 1 of each calendar year of his or her choice of options which he or

§ 250.15  RESIDENCY REQUIREMENT. [REPEALED]
§ 250.16  CONTRIBUTION TO PUBLIC EMPLOYEES RETIREMENT SYSTEM (PERS).
   (a)   (1)   The full amount of the statutorily required contributions to the
Public Employees Retirement System of Ohio shall be withheld from the gross pay
of each person within any of the classes established in this section and shall
be “picked up” (assumed and paid to the Public Employees Retirement System of
Ohio) by the village.  This “pick up” by the village is, and shall be
designated as, Public Employee Contributions and shall be in lieu of
contributions to the Public Employees Retirement System of Ohio by each person
within any of the classes established in this section.  No person subject to
this “pick up” shall have the option of choosing to receive the statutorily
required contribution to the Public Employees Retirement System of Ohio
directly instead of having it “picked up” by the village or of being excluded
from the “pick up.”
      (2)   The village shall, in reporting and making remittance to the Public
Employees Retirement System of Ohio, report that the Public Employees
contribution for each person subject to this “pick up” has been made as
provided by the statute.
   (b)   The “pick up” by the village, provided by this section, shall apply to
all full-time employees of the village who are or become contributing members
of the Public Employees Retirement System of Ohio as of December 31, 2001.
   (c)   The village’s method of payment of salary to employees who are
participants in PERS as of December 31, 2001, the Public Employees Retirement
System of Ohio, is hereby modified in order to provide for a salary reduction
pick-up of employee contributions to the Public Employees Retirement System, as
follows. The total salary for each employee shall be the salary otherwise
payable under village policies.  The total salary of each employee shall be
payable by the village in two parts: deferred salary and cash salary.  An
employee’s deferred salary shall be equal to that percentage of that employee’s
total salary which is required from time to time by the Public Employees
Retirement System of Ohio to be paid as an employee contribution by that
employee, and shall be paid by the village to the Public Employees Retirement
System of Ohio on behalf of that employee as a pick-up in lieu of the Public
Employees Retirement System employee contribution otherwise payable by that
employee.  An employee’s cash salary shall be equal to the employee’s total
salary less the amount of the pick-up for that employee and shall be payable
subject to the appreciable payroll deductions to that employee.  The village
shall compute and remit its employer contribution to the Public Employees
Retirement System of Ohio based upon an employee’s total salary.  The total
combined expenditures of the village for the employees’ total salaries payable
under applicable village policies and the pick-up provisions of this resolution
shall not be greater than the amounts it would have paid for those items had
this provision not been in effect.
   (d)   The Village Clerk-Treasurer is hereby authorized and directed to
implement the provisions of this section to institute the “pick up” of the
statutorily required contributions to the Public Employees Retirement System of
Ohio for those persons reflected in this section, so as to enable them to
obtain the resultant federal and state tax deferment.
   (e)   Full-time employees employed by the village after December 31, 2001,
shall have four and one-half percent of their salary deducted and deposited by
the village in the Public Employees Retirement System as their employees
contribution or part thereof in accordance with state law. Should employee
contributions be required in excess of four and one-half percent of salary, the
village shall “pick up” such excess employee contributions in the same manner
as described above in this section.
   (f)   The village shall make such employer contributions as required by and
in accordance with state law.

overtime, the remaining overtime shall be offered to qualified employees being
required to perform the work.
   (d)   In any situation requiring overtime, the village will not be required
to follow the procedures set forth in division (c) if notice of the need for
overtime work is known less than one hour before the end of the shift.
   (e)   For the purpose of calculating equal distribution of overtime among
qualified employees, all employees who are offered overtime work and refuse it
or are absent that day shall be credited with having worked the overtime as
shall the employee who performs the work.  This shall not apply to employees on
vacation.  Except for an employee who is absent, an employee shall not be
charged with overtime credit if he or she is not personally contacted.

   In addition to their regular salaries, employees of the Service, Water,
Administrative and Fire Departments who are employed 40 or more hours per week
are entitled to longevity pay as follows. All members who have completed, or
who hereafter complete three years of service, shall be entitled to receive $30
per year longevity allowance up to and including 25 years of service for a

§ 262.11  PENSION WITHHOLDING.
   Beginning on January 1, 1998, and thereafter, the Village of Lockland shall
reduce the withholding for pension purposes of eight and one-half percent of
the salary of each official elected to their office by virtue of the 1997
election, and thereafter for each individual subsequently elected or appointed
to an elective office, and the village shall pay an equal amount directly into
the Public Employees Retirement System on behalf of each such official. The
payments by the village shall be in addition to those payments already being
made.
(Ord. 97-36, passed 10-21-1997)
§ 262.12  PAY IN LIEU OF VACATION.
   In the event of unusual circumstances causing full-time salaried personnel
to be unable to utilize vacation days to which they are entitled in the year
those days are earned, they may, at the discretion of the Village Administrator
(and in the case of the Village Administrator - the Mayor), be paid for unused
vacation time the last paycheck of the calendar year in which the vacation was
earned or the first paycheck of the next calendar year.
(Ord. 98-48, passed 11-7-1998)
§ 262.13  DONATED TIME.
   Permanent, full-time employees of the village may receive donated time from
fellow Lockland employees under the following circumstances:
   (a)   Accumulated sick days, personal days or vacation time may be donated
by a full-time village employee to the account of another full-time village
employee who, as a result of catastrophic illness or cases that result in
extreme hardship for the employee receiving the donation, who has used up all
of his or her sick leave, personal leave and vacation time;
   (b)   Time donated is deducted from the donor’s vacation, sick leave or comp
time balance;
   (c)   The number of hours credited to the employee receiving the donation
depends on the employee’s rate of pay as compared to the rate of pay earned by
the donor. If the donor earns less than the donee, the hours donated will be
prorated. If the donor earns more than the donee, the hours credited will be
greater than those who donated. The list of the donors with accompanying
calculations must be forwarded to the village payroll personnel for
verification and approval. Payroll personnel shall prepare and provide
appropriate forms for this purpose;
   (d)   The number of donated hours an employee is receiving should be
recorded by the payroll personnel;
   (e)   The donor and the employee receiving the donated time need not work in
the same village department;
   (f)   Employees receiving donated time do not accrue vacation or sick leave
for the time donated. In addition, employees on donated time do not receive
holiday pay. No new benefits can be earned by the employee receiving donated
time while using the donated time (e.g. vacation, sick leave, holidays).
Therefore, eight hours must be donated for any work day of the week on which a
holiday falls;
   (g)   Donated time cannot be used to prolong an employee on the payroll in
order to make him or her eligible for any retirement benefits; and
   (h)   When an employee returns to work, any donated time that has not been
used must be returned to the donors on a prorated basis. Upon returning to
work, an employee begins to accumulate vacation and sick time that must be used
before any additional time can be requested from other employees.

§ 262.14  JURY DUTY.
   Any full-time village employee who is called to serve as a juror or who is
subpoenaed to appear before a court, public body, or commission to testify with
regard to matters related to village business, shall be paid his or her regular
pay for any time missed from work because of actually being required to be in
attendance to perform jury duty or testify. Any compensation the employee
receives from the Court, Board or Commission, shall be turned into the Clerk-
Treasurer of the Village of Lockland. Employees who are subpoenaed to testify
in civil or criminal matters not related to village work, will not be
compensated. Employees who are called to jury duty shall only be compensated
for those days when they are actually serving on jury duty. On days when they
have been released from jury duty, they shall report to work.

§ 262.15  MILEAGE REIMBURSEMENT.
   Employees authorized to use their personal vehicle for village business will
be reimbursed for business miles driven. In order to qualify for reimbursement,
the employee must maintain accurate documentation of all miles driven as
required by the Internal Revenue Service. The documentation must include the
date(s), distance and purpose of the business trip and any other information
that may be required by the Village Administrator. The amount of reimbursement
to be paid for business miles driven in a personal vehicle will be the maximum
allowed the Internal Revenue Service as it may determine from time to time.
Reimbursements shall be made weekly.

§ 268.01  BACKGROUND.
   The risk to the Village of Lockland, hereinafter "village," its employees,
and customers from data loss and identity theft is of significant concern to
the village and can be reduced only through the combined efforts of every
employee and contractor.
(Res. 2009-R-12, passed 10-20-2009)
§ 268.02  PURPOSE.
   (a)   The Village of Lockland adopts this Identity Theft Prevention Program
to help protect employees, customers, contractors, and the village from damages
related to the loss or misuse of sensitive information. Furthermore, this
program brings the village in line with Part 681 of Title 16 of the Code of
Federal Regulations, Identity Theft Rules.
   (b)   This program will:
      (1)   Define sensitive information;
      (2)   Describe the physical security of data when it is printed on paper;
      (3)   Describe the electronic security of data when stored and
distributed; and
      (4)   Place the Village of Lockland in compliance with state and federal
law regarding identity theft protection.
   (c)   This program enables the village to protect existing customers,
reducing risk from identity fraud, and minimize potential damage to the village
from fraudulent new accounts. The program will help the village:
      (1)   Identify risks that signify potentially fraudulent activity within
new or existing covered accounts;
      (2)   Detect risks when they occur in covered accounts;
      (3)   Respond to risks to determine if fraudulent activity has occurred
and act if fraud has been attempted or committed; and
      (4)   Update the program periodically, including reviewing the accounts
that are covered and the identified risks that are part of the program.
(Res. 2009-R-12, passed 10-20-2009)
§ 268.03  DEFINITIONS.
   For the purposes of this program, the following terms have the meanings
indicated.
   COVERED ACCOUNT. An account that the village offers or maintains for which
there is a reasonably foreseeable risk to customers or to the safety and
soundness of the village from identity theft, including financial, operational,
compliance, reputation, or litigation risks.
   IDENTIFYING INFORMATION.  Any name or number that may be used alone or with
other information to identify a specific person. This includes name, social
security number, date of birth, official state or government issued driver's
license or identification number, alien registration number, government
passport, and employer or tax identification number.
   IDENTITY THEFT.  A fraud committed or attempted using the identifying
information of another person without authority.
   RED FLAG.  A pattern, practice, or specific activity that indicates the
possible existence of identity theft.
(Res. 2009-R-12, passed 10-20-2009)
§ 268.04  SCOPE.
   (a)   This program applies to employees, contractors, consultants, and
temporary workers, and other workers at the village, including all personnel
affiliated with third parties. Hereinafter, the term "employees" refers to all
of the foregoing.
   (b)   This program has two parts: securing sensitive information, and acting
on red flags, suspicious documents, suspicious personal identifying
information, and suspicious activities (collectively "red flags") to reduce the
risk or damage of identity theft. Under the Sensitive Information Policy,
employees should secure confidential information to the proper extent. Under
the Red Flag Policy, when employees monitoring covered accounts offered or
maintained by the village see a red flag, they should take action prescribed by
§ 268.06 of this chapter to reduce the risk or damage of identity theft to the
customer, employee, or village.
(Res. 2009-R-12, passed 10-20-2009)
§ 268.05  SENSITIVE INFORMATION POLICY.
   Employees are encouraged to use common sense judgment in securing sensitive
information to the proper extent. Furthermore, this section should be read in
conjunction with the Ohio Public Records Act, Ohio R.C. § 149.43, and the
village's open records policy. If an employee is uncertain of the sensitivity
of a particular piece of information, the employee should contact a supervisor.
In the event that the village cannot resolve a conflict between this policy and
the Ohio Public Records Act, the village will contact legal counsel.
   (a)   Sensitive information. Sensitive information includes the following
items, whether stored in electronic or printed format:
      (1)   Credit card information, including any of the following:
         A.   Credit card number (in part or whole)
         B.   Credit card expiration date
         C.   Cardholder name
         D.   Cardholder address
      (2)   Tax identification numbers, including:
         A.   Social Security number
         B.   Business identification number
         C.   Employer identification numbers
      (3)   Payroll information, including, among other information:

      (1)   Hard copy distribution. Each employee performing work for the
village will comply with the following policies:
         A. File cabinets, desk drawers, overhead cabinets, and any other
storage space containing documents with sensitive information will be locked
when not in use.
         B.   Storage rooms containing documents with sensitive information and
record retention areas will be locked at the end of each workday or when
unsupervised.
         C.   Desks, workstations, work areas, printers and fax machines, and
common shared work areas will be cleared of all documents containing sensitive
information when not in use.
         D.   Whiteboards, dry-erase boards, writing tablets, etc. in common
shared work areas containing sensitive information will be erased, removed, or
shredded when not in use.
         E.   When documents containing sensitive information are discarded,
they will be placed inside a locked shred bin or immediately shredded using a
mechanical cross cut or Department of Defense-approved shredding devise. Locked
shred bins are labeled, “Confidential paper shredding and recycling.” City
records however may only be destroyed in accordance with the village's records
retention policy.
      (2)   Electronic distribution. Each employee performing work for the city
will comply with the following policies:
         A.   Internally, sensitive information may be transmitted using
approved municipal e-mail. All sensitive information must be encrypted when
stored in an electronic format.
         B.   Any sensitive information sent externally must be encrypted and
password protected and only to approved recipients. Additionally, a statement
such as this should be included in the e-mail:
            “This message may contain confidential and/or proprietary
information and is intended for the person/entity to whom it was originally
addressed. Any use by others is strictly prohibited.”
(Res. 2009-R-12, passed 10-20-2009)
§ 268.06  IDENTIFYING AND RESPONDING TO RED FLAGS.
   (a)   Potential indicators of fraud.  In maintaining or creating covered
accounts, employees who observe the following red flags, suspicious documents,
suspicious personal identifying information, or suspicious activity should take
the steps set out in division (b) below of this section. Employees should use
common sense judgment in being vigilant for fraudulent activity.
      (1)   Red flags. The following red flags are potential indicators of
fraud.
         A.   Alerts, notifications, or warnings from a consumer reporting
agency;
         B.   A fraud or active duty alert included with a consumer report;
         C.   A notice of credit freeze from a consumer reporting agency in
response to a request for a consumer report; or
         D.   A notice of address discrepancy from a consumer reporting agency
as defined in § 334.82(b) of the Fairness and Accuracy in Credit Transactions
Act; and
         E.   Consumer reports that indicate a pattern of activity inconsistent
with the history and usual pattern of activity of an applicant or customer,
such as
            1.   A recent and significant increase in the volume of inquiries;
            2.   An unusual number of recently established credit
relationships;
            3.   A material change in the use of credit, especially with
respect to recently established credit relationships; or
            4.   An account that was closed for cause or identified for abuse
of account privileges by a financial institution or creditor.
      (2)   Suspicious documents. The following suspicious documents are
potential indicators of fraud.
         A.   Documents provided for identification that appear to have been
altered or forged.
         B.   The photograph or physical description on the document is not
constituent with the appearance of the applicant or customer presenting the
document.
         C.   Other information on the document is inconsistent with
information provided by the person opening a new covered account or customer
presenting the identification.
         D.   Other information on the document is inconsistent with readily
accessible information that is on file with the village, such as a signature
card or a recent check
         E.   A document appears to have been altered or forged, or gives the
appearance of having been destroyed or reassembled.
      (3)   Suspicious personal identifying information. A person providing the
following suspicious personal identifying information is a potential indicator
of fraud.
         A.   Personal information provided is inconsistent when compared
against external information sources used by the city. For example:
            1.   The address does not match any address in the consumer report.
            2.   The Social Security Number (SSN) has not been issued or is
listed on the Social Security Administration's Death Master File; or
            3.   Personal identifying information provided by the customer is
not consistent with other personal identifying information provided by the
customer. For example, there is a lack of correlation between the SSN range and
the date of birth.
         B.   Personal identifying information provided is associated with
known fraudulent activity as indicated by internal or third-party sources used
by the village. For example, the address on the application is the same as the
address provided on a fraudulent application.
         C.   Personal identifying information provided is of a type commonly
associated with fraudulent activity as indicated by internal or third-party
sources used by the village. For example:
            1.   The address on an application is fictitious, a mail drop, or a
prison; or
            2.   The phone number is invalid or is associated with a pager or
answering service.
         D.   The SSN provided is the same as that submitted by other persons
opening an account or other customers.
         E.   The address or telephone number provided is the same as or
similar to the address or telephone number submitted by an unusually large
number of other customers or other persons opening accounts.
         F.   The customer or the person opening the covered account fails to
provide all required personal identifying information on an application or in
response to notification that the application is incomplete.
         G.   Personal identifying information provided is not consistent with
personal identifying information that is on file with the village.
         H.   When using security questions (mother's maiden name, pet's name,
etc.), the person opening the covered account or the customer cannot provide
authenticating information beyond that which generally would be available from
a wallet or consumer report.
      (4)   Suspicious activity. The following suspicious activities are
potential indicators of fraud:
         A.   Shortly following the notice of a change of address for a covered
account, the village receives a request for new, additional, or replacement
goods or services, or for the addition of authorized users on the account.
         B.   A new revolving credit account is used in a manner commonly
associated with known patterns of fraud. For example, the customer fails to
make the first payment or makes an initial payment but no subsequent payments.
         C.   A covered account is used in a manner that is not consistent with
established patterns of activity on the account. There is, for example:
            1.   Nonpayment when there is no history of late or missed
payments;
            2.   A material change in purchasing or usage patterns;
         D.   A covered account that has been inactive for a reasonably lengthy
period of time is used (taking into consideration the type of account, the
expected pattern of usage, and other relevant factors).
         E.   Mail sent to the customer is returned repeatedly as undeliverable
although transactions continue to be conducted in connection with the
customer's covered account.
         F.   The village is notified that the customer is not receiving paper
account statements.
         G.   The village is notified of unauthorized charges or transactions
in connection with a customer's covered account.
         H.   The village receives notice from customers, victims of identity
theft, law enforcement authorities, or other persons regarding possible
identity theft in connection with covered accounts held by the village.
         I.   The village is notified by a customer, a victim of identity
theft, a law enforcement authority, or any other person that it has opened a
fraudulent account for a person engaged in identity theft.
   (b)   Responding to red flags.
      (1)   Once potentially fraudulent activity is detected, an employee must
act quickly as a rapid appropriate response can protect customers and the
village from damages and loss. Using common sense, employees should be vigilant
for fraudulent activity. When detected, an employee should gather all related
documentation and write a description of the situation. The employee then
should present this information to the designated authority for determination.
      (2)   The designated authority will complete additional authentication to
determine whether the attempted transaction was fraudulent or authentic.
      (3)   If a transaction is determined to be fraudulent, appropriate
actions must be taken immediately. Actions may include cancelling the
transaction, notifying and cooperating with appropriate law enforcement,
determining the extent of liability of the village, and notifying the actual
customer that fraud has been attempted.
(Res. 2009-R-12, passed 10-20-2009)
§ 268.07  PERIODIC UPDATES TO PLAN.
   At periodic intervals, occurring at least annually, the program will be
evaluated to determine whether all aspects of the program are up to date and
applicable in the current business environment. In the evaluation, lists of red
flags, suspicious documents, suspicious personal identifying information, and
suspicious activity may be revised, replaced, or eliminated. Defining new red
flags, suspicious documents, suspicious personal identifying information, or
suspicious activity may also be appropriate. Additionally, the evaluation may
result in the village's responses to red flags, suspicious documents,
suspicious personal identifying information, or suspicious activity being
revised or updated.
(Res. 2009-R-12, passed 10-20-2009)
§ 268.08  ADMINISTRATION.
   (a)   Management.  The Village Finance Director is responsible for
implementation and administration of the program. The Finance Director will
report to Council at least annually on compliance by the village with the
program. The report shall address material matters related to the program and
evaluate the effectiveness of the policies and procedures in addressing the
risk of identity theft in connection with the opening of covered accounts and
with respect to existing covered accounts. The Village Council will approve any
material changes to the program as necessary to address changing identity theft
risks.
   (b)   Staff training.  Staff training shall be conducted for all employees,
officials, and contractors for whom it is reasonably foreseeable that they may
come into contact with accounts or personally identifiable information that may
constitute a risk to the city or its customers. The Finance Director is
responsible for ensuring identity theft training for all requisite employees.
Employees must receive annual training in all elements of this policy. To
ensure maximum effectiveness, employees may continue to receive additional
training as changes to the program are made.
   (c)   Oversight.  It is the responsibility of the village to ensure that the
activities of all service providers are conducted in accordance with reasonable
policies and procedures designed to detect, prevent, and mitigate the risk of
identity theft.
      (1)   A service provider that maintains its own identity theft prevention
program, consistent with the guidance of the red flag rules and validated by
appropriate due diligence, may be considered to be meeting these requirements.
      (2)   Any specific requirements should be specifically addressed in the
appropriate contract arrangements.

the provisions of Ohio R.C. § 9.15 pertaining to the final disposition of
indigent persons found within the Village of Lockland.
   (b)   The Village Administrator or his or her designee shall be responsible
for the indigent final disposition program which shall be as follows:
      (1)   Final disposition shall be by cremation only.
      (2)   If the next of kin of the deceased are not available or are
unknown, the Village Administrator or his or her designee shall have the
authority to sign all documents necessary for the cremation of the deceased.
      (3)   Prior to the cremation authorization, the village shall make
reasonable attempt to determine whether or not the deceased person is in fact
indigent, as follows:
      The term INDIGENT DECEDENT means a person who dies without leaving an
ascertainable estate sufficient to pay part or all of the person's final
disposition expenses and whose final disposition expenses are not payable by
the state, except that decedents who earned greater than 125% of the federal
poverty guidelines in the previous 12 months shall be excluded from this
program. The estate of the decedent shall include but not be limited to the
ready availability of real or personal property owned, employment benefits,
pensions, annuities, social security, unemployment compensation, inheritances,
number and age of dependents, outstanding debts,  obligations and liabilities,
and any other relevant considerations concerning the financial condition of the
decedent.
      (4)   The Village of Lockland shall pay a maximum of $800 for the
cremation of the remains of the indigent person. Said services shall include
necessary supplies and procedures and provide a temporary urn for the storage
of the cremated remains of the deceased. The cremated remains of the deceased
shall be released to the decedent's family if the remains are claimed by a
family member within ten days. If the remains are unclaimed, they shall be
permanently stored by the funeral home in an approved facility. The village
shall insure that a death notice is published in an appropriate newspaper.
      (5)   The funeral home shall reduce the above cost to the village by the
amount of any funds received by the funeral home from the deceased's family or
any other source. If additional funds are paid to the funeral home, and the
village has paid herein provided, the funeral home shall refund to the village
the exact amount of additional funds paid to the funeral home within 30 days of
the receipt thereof by the funeral home.
      (6)   In the performance of services under this policy, the funeral home
shall comply with all statutes, ordinances, regulations, and rules of the
federal government, the State of Ohio, the County of Hamilton and the Village
of Lockland which are applicable. Village notices, approvals, authorizations,
waivers, instructions, or any other matters required to be executed by the
Village of Lockland shall be effective only when given in writing and signed by
the Village Administrator or his authorized representative.
      (7)   During the performance of its duties and responsibilities of this
policy, the funeral home agrees that in the hiring of employees for the
performance of work under this policy, the funeral home shall not by reason of
race, color, religion, sex, age, handicap, national origin or ancestry,
discriminate against any citizen in the employment of a person qualified and
available to perform work to which this agreement relates in violation of any
federal, state, or village law or ordinance.

composed of a majority of Lockland residents or people who work in Lockland,
may rent the recreation hall for $25 per use Monday through Thursday. The $25
shall go towards cleaning and the operation of the hall during the course of
use. A $150 deposit to insure the hall is left in good shape with no damage is
required for each rental.
   (c)   If the Village Administrator determines that the group using the hall
has not accomplished the appropriate clean-up, the village shall clean the
premises and charge the group or organization for the costs incurred by the
village.
   (d)   On Friday, Saturday and Sunday, recreation hall shall be available to
the general public for rent. The rental and clean-up fee shall be $125 for
village residents or village based groups. For all others the fee will be $175.
A $50 deposit and full payment is due upon reservation.
   (e)   Any vandalism, breakage or other destruction of, or damage to the
recreation hall or its contents will be the responsibility of the user, whether
the user is a non-profit organization, a for-profit organization, or an
individual. The village retains the right to charge the user for any
replacements or repairs necessary. All renters and groups using the hall
without charge shall be responsible to obey all the rules and regulations
established by the Village Administrator and the ordinances governing the use

however, that preference will be given to village-sponsored or supported
groups. Once the hall is booked and full payment is made, the individual or
group may not be displaced by a later-arriving user desiring to book the hall.
The Village Administrator may revoke or deny the use of the hall where the
organization or individual has demonstrated either inability or an
unwillingness to comply with the responsibilities imposed upon him, her or it
in the use of the hall in the past. The Village Administrator may from time to
time adjust the deposit requirement provided it is uniformly applied to all
users except those described in division (a) above. Said deposit shall be
returned if no damage and appropriate clean-up has occurred or charged against
if repairs or clean-up must be done. Groups which are repeat users may leave
the deposit on file and replenish it as needed.
   (h)   The Village Administrator may make the recreation hall available for
the one-time use by a family of any Lockland resident who has passed away as a
place for a memorial service or funeral or post burial. The use would be
without charge, but shall be subject to division (e), (f) and (g) of this
section.

§ 280.06  RESERVED USE OF LOCKLAND ATHLETIC FIELDS AND PAVILIONS.
   (a)   Parks, athletic fields and pavilions located in village owned park
areas, when not in use for programs organized and supported by the village, may
be reserved for use by private groups.  The Village Administrator, in
consultation with the Mayor and Recreation Director, shall establish a method
for such reservations and establish fees for such use. Those fees may vary
depending upon the day of the week involved, recognizing that there is a higher
demand for such facilities on Fridays, Saturdays, Sundays and holidays than on
other weekdays. Park rentals may include an entire park or portion thereof.
   (b)   Such facilities shall be made available without charge, to any group
or organization sponsored or supported by the village, including, but not
limited to, the Senior Citizens Club, village organized athletic teams and
leagues, recreation programs and health programs.
   (c)   Non-profit corporations and organizations, clubs or individuals
wishing to schedule events for social or civic purposes, but not for profit-
making purposes, which groups are composed of a majority of Lockland residents
or people who work in Lockland, may reserve and rent the facility for fees
fixed by the Village Administrator in consultation with the Recreation Director
and Mayor.
   (d)   When not otherwise in use, non-Lockland residents may reserve and rent
such facilities at separate fees fixed by the Village Administrator in
consultation with the Recreation Director and Mayor.
   (e)   Any vandalism, breakage or other destruction of or damage to the
facilities will be the responsibility of the user, whether the user is a non-
profit organization, a for-profit organization, or an individual. The village
retains the right to charge the user for any replacements or repairs necessary.
All users reserving and using pavilions and recreation fields shall be
responsible to obey all rules and regulations established by the Village
Administrator and the ordinances governing their use. The group or organization
granted use of such facility shall be responsible for the clean-up following
their use. The village will be responsible for emptying garbage cans.
   (f)   Application for sue of parks, pavilions or ball fields shall be made
by a resident or organization to the Village Administrator. The Village
Administrator shall maintain a schedule for the use of the pavilions and ball
fields and the schedule shall be available for public inspection.
   (g)   The Village Administrator shall make the use of such parks, pavilions
and ball fields and recreation fields available under the terms described
herein to any resident or organization in the Village on a first-come, first
served basis; provided, however, that preference will be given to village-
sponsored or supported groups. Once a facility is booked and a deposit placed
on the booking, the individual or group may not be displaced by a later-
arriving user desiring to book the same facility. The Village Administrator may
revoke or deny the use of such facilities where the organization or individual
has demonstrated either an inability or an unwillingness to comply with the
responsibilities imposed upon him, her or it in the use of village facilities
in the past. The Village Administrator may establish a deposit requirement
applied to all users, except those described in division (b) above. Said
deposit shall be returned if no damage and appropriate clean-up has occurred or
be charged against if repairs or clean-up must be done. Groups which are repeat
users may leave the deposit on file and replenish it as needed.

§ 414.02  THROUGH STREETS; STOP AND YIELD RIGHT-OF-WAY SIGNS.
   (a)   All state routes are hereby designated as through highways, provided
that stop signs, yield signs, or traffic-control signals shall be erected at
all intersections with such through highways by the Department of
Transportation as to highways under its jurisdiction and by local authorities
as to highways under their jurisdiction, except as otherwise provided in this
section. Where two or more state routes that are through highways intersect,
and no traffic-control signal is in operation, stop signs or yield signs shall
be erected at one or more entrances thereto by the Department or by local
authorities having jurisdiction, except as otherwise provided in this section.
Whenever the Director of Transportation determines on the basis of an
engineering and traffic investigation that stop signs are necessary to stop
traffic on a through highway for safe and efficient operation, nothing in this
section shall be construed to prevent such installations. When circumstances
warrant, the Director also may omit stop signs on roadways intersecting through
highways under his or her jurisdiction. Before the Director either installs or
removes a stop sign under this division, he or she shall give notice, in
writing, of that proposed action to the affected local authority at least 30
days before installing or removing the stop sign.
   (b)   Other streets or highways, or portions thereof, are hereby designated
as through highways if they are within the municipality, if they have a
continuous length of more than one mile between the limits of the street or
highway or portion thereof, and if they have stop or yield signs or traffic-
control signals at the entrances of the majority of intersecting streets or
highways. For purposes of this section, the limits of the street or highway, or
portion thereof, shall be the municipal corporation line, the physical terminus
of the street or highway, or any point on the streets or highway at which
vehicular traffic thereon is required by regulatory signs to stop or yield to
traffic on the intersecting street, provided, that in residence districts, the
municipality may by ordinance designate such street or highway, or portion
thereof, not to be a through highway and thereafter the affected residence
district shall be indicated by official traffic-control devices. Where two or
more through highways designated under this division intersect and no traffic-
control signal is in operation, stop signs or yield signs shall be erected at
one or more entrances thereto by the Department or by local authorities having
jurisdiction, except as otherwise provided in this section.
   (c)   The Department or local authorities having jurisdiction need not erect
stop signs at intersections they find to be so constructed as to permit traffic
to safely enter a through highway without coming to a stop. Signs shall be
erected at such intersections indicating that the operator of a vehicle shall
yield the right-of-way to or merge with all traffic proceeding on the through
highway.
   (d)   Local authorities, with reference to highways under their
jurisdiction, may designate additional through highways, and shall erect stop
signs, yield signs, or traffic-control signals at all streets and highways
intersecting such through highways, or may designate any intersection as a stop
or yield intersection, and shall erect like signs at one or more entrances to
the intersection.
(ORC § 4511.65)
§ 414.03  TRAFFIC CONTROL SIGNAL TERMS AND LIGHTS.

are permitted to proceed straight through or turn right or left or make a u-
turn movement except as such movement is modified by a lane-use sign, turn
prohibition sign, lane marking, roadway design, separate turn signal
indication, or other traffic control device. Such vehicular traffic, including
vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn movement, shall yield the
right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn
movement to the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching
from the opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard
during the time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the
intersection.
      (2)   Vehicular traffic facing a green arrow signal indication, displayed
alone or in combination with another signal indication, are permitted to
cautiously enter the intersection only to make the movement indicated by such
arrow, or such other movement as is permitted by other indications displayed at
the same time. Such vehicular traffic, including vehicles turning right or left
or making a u-turn movement, shall yield the right-of-way to both of the
following:
         A.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
         B.   Other traffic lawfully using the intersection.
      (3)   A.   Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication,
as provided in Ohio R.C. § 4511.14, pedestrians facing a circular green signal
indication are permitted to proceed across the roadway within any marked or
unmarked associated crosswalk. The pedestrian shall yield the right-of-way to
vehicles lawfully within the intersection or so close as to create an immediate
hazard at the time that the green signal indication is first displayed.
         B.   Pedestrians facing a green arrow signal indication, unless
otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or other traffic control
device, shall not cross the roadway.
   (b)   Steady Yellow Signal Indication.

be exhibited immediately thereafter when vehicular traffic shall not enter the
intersection. The provisions governing vehicular operation under the movement
being terminated shall continue to apply while the steady circular yellow
signal indication is displayed.
      (2)   Vehicular traffic facing a steady yellow arrow signal indication is
thereby warned that the related green arrow movement or the related flashing
arrow movement is being terminated. The provisions governing vehicular
operation under the movement being terminated shall continue to apply while the
steady yellow arrow signal indication is displayed.
      (3)   Pedestrians facing a steady circular yellow or yellow arrow signal
indication, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication as

      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a steady circular red signal
indication, unless entering the intersection to make another movement permitted
by another signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop line; but if
there is no stop line, traffic shall stop before entering the crosswalk on the
near side of the intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, then before
entering the intersection; and shall remain stopped until a signal indication
to proceed is displayed except as provided in divisions (c)(1), (c)(2), and (c)
(3) of this section.
         B.   Except when a traffic control device is in place prohibiting a
turn on red or a steady red arrow signal indication is displayed, vehicular
traffic facing a steady circular red signal indication is permitted, after
stopping, to enter the intersection to turn right, or to turn left from a one-
way street into a one-way street. The right to proceed with the turn shall be
subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a stop at a stop
sign.
      (2)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a steady red arrow signal indication
shall not enter the intersection to make the movement indicated by the arrow
and, unless entering the intersection to make another movement permitted by
another signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop line; but if
there is no stop line, before entering the crosswalk on the near side of the
intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, then before entering the
intersection; and shall remain stopped until a signal indication or other
traffic control device permitting the movement indicated by such red arrow is
displayed.
         B.   When a traffic control device is in place permitting a turn on a
steady red arrow signal indication, vehicular traffic facing a steady red arrow
indication is permitted, after stopping, to enter the intersection to turn
right, or to turn left from a one-way street into a one-way street. The right
to proceed with the turn shall be limited to the direction indicated by the
arrow and shall be subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a
stop at a stop sign.
      (3)   Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication as
provided in Ohio R.C. § 4511.14 or other traffic control device, pedestrians
facing a steady circular red or steady red arrow signal indication shall not
enter the roadway.
      (4)   Local authorities by ordinance, or the Director of Transportation
on state highways, may prohibit a right or a left turn against a steady red
signal at any intersection, which shall be effective when signs giving notice
thereof are posted at the intersection.
   (d)   Flashing Green Signal Indication.  A flashing green signal indication
has no meaning and shall not be used.
   (e)   Flashing Yellow Signal Indication.
      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing circular yellow signal indication, is permitted to cautiously enter
the intersection to proceed straight through or turn right or left or make a u-
turn movement except as such movement is modified by lane-use signs, turn
prohibition signs, lane markings, roadway design, separate turn signal
indications, or other traffic control devices. Such vehicular traffic,
including vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn movement, shall
yield the right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn to
the left shall yield
the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching from the opposite direction so
closely as to constitute an immediate hazard during the time when such turning
vehicle is moving across or within the intersection.
      (2)   A.   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing yellow arrow signal indication, displayed alone or in combination with
another signal indication, is permitted to cautiously enter the intersection
only to make the movement indicated by such arrow, or other such movement as is
permitted by other signal indications displayed at the same time. Such
vehicular traffic, including vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn,
shall yield the right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn to
the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching from the
opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard during the
time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the intersection.
      (3)   Pedestrians facing any flashing yellow signal indication at an
intersection, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or
other traffic control device, are permitted to proceed across the roadway
within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk. Pedestrians shall yield the
right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the
flashing yellow signal indication is first displayed.
      (4)   When a flashing circular yellow signal indication is displayed as a
beacon to supplement another traffic control device, road users are notified
that there is a need to pay additional attention to the message contained
thereon or that the regulatory or warning requirements of the other traffic
control device, which might not be applicable at all times, are currently
applicable.
   (f)   Flashing Red Signal Indication.
      (1)   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing circular red signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop
line; but if there is no stop line, before entering the crosswalk on the near
side of the intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, at the point nearest the
intersecting roadway where the driver has a view of approaching traffic on the
intersecting roadway before entering the intersection. The right to proceed
shall be subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a stop at a
stop sign.
      (2)   Pedestrians facing any flashing red signal indication at an
intersection, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or
other traffic control device, are permitted to proceed across the roadway
within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk. Pedestrians shall yield the
right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the
flashing red signal indication is first displayed.
      (3)   When a flashing circular red signal indication is displayed as a
beacon to supplement another traffic control device, road users are notified
that there is a need to pay additional attention to the message contained
thereon or that the regulatory requirements of the other traffic control
device, which might not be applicable at all times, are currently applicable.
Use of this signal indication shall be limited to supplementing stop, do not
enter, or wrong way signs, and to applications where compliance with the
supplemented traffic control device requires a stop at a designated point.
   (g)   In the event an official traffic-control signal is erected and
maintained at a place other than an intersection, the provisions of this
section shall be applicable except as to those provisions which by their nature
can have no application. Any stop required shall be made at a sign or marking
on the pavement indicating where the stop shall be made, but in the absence of
any such sign or marking the stop shall be made at the signal.

place, these signals shall indicate the following instructions:
   (a)   A steady walking person signal indication, which symbolizes “walk”,
means that a pedestrian facing the signal indication is permitted to start to
cross the roadway in the direction of the signal indication, possibly in
conflict with turning vehicles. The pedestrian shall yield the right-of-way to
vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the walking person
signal indication is first shown.
   (b)   A flashing upraised hand signal indication, which symbolizes “don't
walk”, means that a pedestrian shall not start to cross the roadway in the
direction of the signal indication, but that any pedestrian who has already
started to cross on a steady walking person signal indication shall proceed to
the far side of the traveled way of the street or highway, unless otherwise
directed by a traffic control device to proceed only to the median of a divided
highway or only to some other island or pedestrian refuge area.
   (c)   A steady upraised hand signal indication means that a pedestrian shall
not enter the roadway in the direction of the signal indication.

applicable concentration of alcohol specified in divisions (a)(1)B., (a)(1)C.,
(a)(1)D. and (a)(1)E. of this section or less than the applicable concentration
of a listed controlled substance or a listed metabolite of a controlled
substance specified for a violation of division (a)(1)J. of this section, that
fact may be considered with other competent evidence in determining the guilt
or innocence of the defendant. This division does not limit or affect a
criminal prosecution for a violation of division (b) of this section.
      (3)   Upon the request of the person who was tested, the results of the
chemical test shall be made available to the person or the person’s attorney,
immediately upon the completion of the chemical test analysis. If the chemical

tested may have a physician, a registered nurse, or a qualified technician,
chemist, or phlebotomist of the person’s own choosing administer a chemical
test or tests, at the person’s expense, in addition to any administered at the
request of a law enforcement officer.  If the person was under arrest as
described in R.C. § 4511.191(A)(5), the arresting officer shall advise the
person at the time of the arrest that the person may have an independent
chemical test taken at the person’s own expense. If the person was under arrest
other than described in R.C. § 4511.191(A)(5), the form to be read to the
person to be tested, as required under §
434.012, shall state that the person may have an independent test performed at
the person’s expense. The failure or inability to obtain an additional chemical
test by a person shall not preclude the admission of evidence relating to the
chemical test or tests taken at the request of a law enforcement officer.

the defendant has no attorney, on the defendant.
      (3)   A report of the type described in division (e)(1) of this section

         ALCOHOL MONITORING DEVICE. Means any device that provides for
continuous alcohol monitoring, any ignition interlock device, any immobilizing
or disabling device other than an ignition interlock device that is constantly
available to monitor the concentration of alcohol in a person’s system, or any
other device that provides for the automatic testing and periodic reporting of
alcohol consumption by a person and that a court orders a person to use as a

an offense.
         COMMUNITY ADDICTION SERVICES PROVIDER.  Has the same meaning as in
Ohio R.C.§ 5119.01.
         PHYSICAL CONTROL has the same meaning as in Ohio R.C. § 4511.194.
      (2)   Any person who operates a vehicle upon a highway or any public or
private property used by the public for vehicular travel or parking within this
municipality or who is in physical control of a vehicle shall be deemed to have
given consent to a chemical test or tests of the person’s whole blood, blood
serum or plasma, breath, or urine to determine the alcohol, drug of abuse,
controlled substance, metabolite of a controlled substance, or combination
content of the person’s whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, or urine if
arrested for a violation of §
434.01(a) or (b), §
434.011, Ohio R.C. § 4511.19(A) or (B), Ohio R.C. § 4511.194 or a substantially
equivalent municipal ordinance, or any other municipal OVI ordinance.
      (3)   The chemical test or tests under division (a)(2) of this section
shall be administered at the request of a law enforcement officer having
reasonable grounds to believe the person was operating or in physical control
of a vehicle in violation of a division, section, or ordinance identified in
division (a)(2) of this section. The law enforcement agency by which the
officer is employed shall designate which of the tests shall be administered.
      (4)   Any person who is dead or unconscious, or who otherwise is in a
condition rendering the person incapable of refusal, shall be deemed to have
consented as provided in division (a)(2) of this section, and the test or tests
may be administered, subject to Ohio R.C. §§ 313.12 through 313.16.
      (5)   (a)   If a law enforcement officer arrests a person for a violation
of R.C. § 4511.19(A) or (B), R.C. § 4511.194 or a substantially equivalent
municipal ordinance, or a municipal OVI ordinance and if the person if
convicted would be required to be sentenced under R.C. § 4511.19(G)(1)(c), (d),
or (e), the law enforcement officer shall request the person to submit, and the
person shall submit, to a chemical test or tests of the person’s whole blood,
blood serum or plasma, breath, or urine for the purpose of determining the
alcohol, drug of abuse, controlled substance, metabolite of a controlled
substance, or combination content of the person’s whole blood, blood serum or
plasma, breath, or urine. A law enforcement officer who makes a request
pursuant to this division that a person submit to a chemical test or tests is
not required to advise the person of the consequences of submitting to, or
refusing to submit to, the test or tests and is not required to give the person
the form described in division (c) of this section, but the officer shall
advise the person at the time of the arrest that if the person refuses to take
a chemical test the officer may employ whatever reasonable means are necessary
to ensure that the person submits to a chemical test of the person's whole
blood or blood serum or plasma. The officer shall also advise the person at the
time of the arrest that the person may have an independent chemical test taken
at the person’s own expense. Divisions (A)(3) and (A)(4) of this section apply
to the administration of a chemical test or tests pursuant to this division.
         (b)   If a person refuses to submit to a chemical test upon a request
made pursuant to division (A)(5)(a) of this section, the law enforcement
officer who made the request may employ whatever reasonable means are necessary
to ensure that the person submits to a chemical test of the person’s whole
blood or blood serum or plasma. A law enforcement officer who acts pursuant to
this division to ensure that a person submits to a chemical test of the
person’s whole blood or blood serum or plasma is immune from criminal and civil
liability based upon a claim for assault and battery or any other claim for the
acts, unless the officer so acted with malicious purpose, in bad faith, or in a
wanton or reckless manner.
(ORC § 4511.191(A))
   (b)   Except as provided in division (a)(5) of this section, the arresting
law enforcement officer shall give advice in accordance with this section to

equivalent municipal ordinance, or any other municipal OVI ordinance. The
officer shall give that advice in a written form that contains the information
described in division (c) of this section and shall read the advice to the
person. The form shall contain a statement that the form was shown to the
person under arrest and read to the person by the arresting officer. One or
more persons shall witness the arresting officer’s reading of the form, and the
witnesses shall certify to this fact by signing the form. The person must
submit to the chemical test or tests, subsequent to the request of the
arresting officer, within two hours of the time of the alleged violation and,
if the person does not submit to the test or tests within that two-hour time
limit, the failure to submit automatically constitutes a refusal to submit to
the test or tests.
   (c)   Except as provided in division (a)(5) of this section, if a person is
under arrest as described in division (b) of this section, before the person
may be requested to submit to a chemical test or tests to determine the
alcohol, drug of abuse, controlled substance, metabolite of a controlled
substance, or combination content of the person’s whole blood, blood serum or
plasma, breath, or urine, the arresting officer shall read the following form
to the person:
“You now are under arrest for (specifically state the offense under state law
or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance for which the person was
arrested – operating a vehicle under the influence of alcohol, a drug, or a
combination of them; operating a vehicle while under the influence of a listed
controlled substance or a listed metabolite of a controlled substance;
operating a vehicle after underage alcohol consumption; or having physical
control of a vehicle while under the influence).
“If you refuse to take any chemical test required by law, your Ohio driving
privileges will be suspended immediately, and you will have to pay a fee to
have the privileges reinstated. If you have a prior conviction of OVI, OVUAC,
or operating a vehicle while under the influence of a listed controlled
substance or a listed metabolite of a controlled substance under state or
municipal law within the preceding 20 years, you are now under arrest for state
OVI, and, if you refuse to take a chemical test, you will face increased
penalties if you subsequently are convicted of the state OVI.
“(Read this part unless the person is under arrest for solely having physical
control of a vehicle while under the influence.) If you take any chemical test
required by law and are found to be at or over the prohibited amount of
alcohol, a controlled substance, or a metabolite of a controlled substance in
your whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, or urine as set by law, your
Ohio driving privileges will be suspended immediately, and you will have to pay
a fee to have the privileges reinstated.
“If you take a chemical test, you may have an independent chemical test taken
at your own expense.”
   (d)   If the arresting law enforcement officer does not ask a person under
arrest as described in division (b) of this section or division (A)(5) of this
section to submit to a chemical test or tests under Ohio R.C. § 4511.191 or
this section, the arresting officer shall seize the Ohio or out-of-state
driver’s or commercial driver’s license or permit of the person and immediately
forward it to the court in which the arrested person is to appear on the
charge. If the arrested person is not in possession of the person’s license or
permit or it is not in the person’s vehicle, the officer shall order the person
to surrender it to the law enforcement agency that employs the officer within
24 hours after the arrest, and, upon the surrender, the agency immediately
shall forward the license or permit to the court in which the person is to
appear on the charge. Upon receipt of the license or permit, the court shall
retain it pending the arrested person’s initial appearance and any action taken
under Ohio R.C. § 4511.196.
   (e)   (1)   If a law enforcement officer asks a person under arrest as
described in division (A)(5) of this section to submit to a chemical test or
tests under that division and the test results indicate a prohibited
concentration of alcohol, a controlled substance, or a metabolite of a
controlled substance in the person’s whole blood, blood serum or plasma,
breath, or urine at the time of the alleged offense, or if a law enforcement
officer asks a person under arrest as described in division (b) of this section
to submit to a chemical test or tests under Ohio R.C. § 4511.191 or this
section, if the officer advises the person in accordance with this section of
the consequences of the person’s refusal or submission, and if either the
person refuses to submit to the test or tests or, unless the arrest was for a
violation of §
434.011, Ohio R.C. § 4511.194 or a substantially equivalent municipal
ordinance, the person submits to the test or tests and the test results
indicate a prohibited concentration of alcohol, a controlled substance, or a
metabolite of a controlled substance in the person’s whole blood, blood serum
or plasma, breath, or urine at the time of the alleged offense, the arresting
officer shall do all of the following:
         A.   On behalf of the Registrar of Motor Vehicles, notify the person
that, independent of any penalties or sanctions imposed upon the person, the
person’s Ohio driver’s or commercial driver’s license or permit or nonresident
operating privilege is suspended immediately, that the suspension will last at
least until the person’s initial appearance on the charge, which will be held
within five days after the date of the person’s arrest or the issuance of a
citation to the person, and that the person may appeal the suspension at the
initial appearance or during the period of time ending 30 days after that
initial appearance;
         B.   Seize the driver’s or commercial driver’s license or permit of
the person and immediately forward it to the Registrar. If the arrested person
is not in possession of the person’s license or permit or it is not in the
person’s vehicle, the officer shall order the person to surrender it to the law
enforcement agency that employs the officer within 24 hours after the person is
given notice of the suspension, and, upon the surrender, the officer’s
employing agency immediately shall forward the license or permit to the
Registrar;
         C.   Verify the person’s current residence and, if it differs from
that on the person’s driver’s or commercial driver’s license or permit, notify
the Registrar of the change;
         D.   Send to the Registrar, within 48 hours after the arrest of the
person, a sworn report that includes all of the following statements:
            1.   That the officer had reasonable grounds to believe that, at
the time of the arrest, the arrested person was operating a vehicle in
violation of Ohio R.C. § 4511.19(A) or (B) or a municipal OVI ordinance or for
being in physical control of a stationary vehicle in violation of Ohio R.C. §
4511.194 or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance;
            2.   That the person was arrested and charged with a violation of
Ohio R.C. § 4511.19(A) or (B), Ohio R.C. § 4511.194 or a substantially
equivalent municipal ordinance, or a municipal OVI ordinance;
            3.   Unless division (E)(1)(d)5. of this section applies, that the
officer asked the person to take the designated chemical test or tests, advised
the person in accordance with this section of the consequences of submitting
to, or refusing to take, the test or tests, and gave the person the form
described in division (c) of this section;
            4.   Unless division (E)(1)(d)5. of this section applies, that
either the person refused to submit to the chemical test or tests or, unless
the arrest was for a violation of Ohio R.C. § 4511.194 or a substantially
equivalent municipal ordinance, the person submitted to the chemical test or
tests and the test results indicate a prohibited concentration of alcohol, a
controlled substance, or a metabolite of a controlled substance in the person’s
whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, or urine at the time of the alleged
offense.
            5.   If the person was under arrest as described in division (A)(5)
of this section and the chemical test or tests were performed in accordance
with that division, that the person was under arrest as described in that
division, that the chemical test or tests were performed in accordance with
that division, and that test results indicated a prohibited concentration of
alcohol, a controlled substance, or a metabolite of a controlled substance in
the person’s whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, or urine at the time
of the alleged offense.
      (2)   Division (e)(1) of this section does not apply to a person who is
arrested for a violation of §
434.011, Ohio R.C. § 4511.194 or a substantially equivalent municipal
ordinance, who is asked by a law enforcement officer to submit to a chemical
test or tests under this section, and who submits to the test or tests,
regardless of the amount of alcohol, a controlled substance, or a metabolite of
a controlled substance that the test results indicate is present in the
person’s whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, or urine.
   (f)   The arresting officer shall give the officer’s sworn report that is
completed under this section to the arrested person at the time of the arrest,
or the Registrar of Motor Vehicles shall send the report to the person by
regular first class mail as soon as possible after receipt of the report, but
not later than 14 days after receipt of it. An arresting officer may give an
unsworn report to the arrested person at the time of the arrest provided the
report is complete when given to the arrested person and subsequently is sworn
to by the arresting officer. As soon as possible, but not later than 48 hours
after the arrest of the person, the arresting officer shall send a copy of the
sworn report to the court in which the arrested person is to appear on the
charge for which the person was arrested.
   (g)   The sworn report of an arresting officer completed under this section
is prima facie proof of the information and statements that it contains. It
shall be admitted and considered as prima facie proof of the information and
statements that it contains in any appeal under Ohio R.C. § 4511.197 relative
to any suspension of a person’s driver’s or commercial driver’s license or
permit or nonresident operating privilege that results from the arrest covered
by the report.

the time at which the arresting officer serves the notice of suspension upon
the arrested person. Any subsequent finding that the person is not guilty of
the charge that resulted in the person’s being requested to take the chemical
test or tests under division (a) of this section does not affect the
suspension.
      (2)   If a person arrested for operating a vehicle in violation of §
434.01(a) or (b), Ohio R.C. § 4511.19(A) or (B), or any other municipal OVI
ordinance, or for being in physical control of a vehicle in violation of §

ordinance, regardless of whether the person’s driver’s or commercial driver’s
license or permit or nonresident operating privilege is or is not suspended
under Ohio R.C. § 4511.191(B) or (C) or Ohio R.C. Chapter 4510, the person’s
initial appearance on the charge resulting from the arrest shall be held within
five days of the persons’ arrest or the issuance of the citation to him or her,

than will permit him or her to bring it to a stop within the assured clear
distance ahead.
   (b)   It is prima facie lawful, in the absence of a lower limit declared or
established pursuant to this section by the Director of Transportation or local

not exceeding the following:
      (1)   A.   Twenty miles per hour in school zones during school recess and
while children are going to or leaving school during the opening or closing
hours, and when 20 miles per hour school speed limit signs are erected, except
that on controlled-access highways and expressways, if the right-of-way line
fence has been erected without pedestrian opening, the speed shall be governed
by division (b)(4) of this section, and on freeways, if the right-of-way line
fence has been erected without pedestrian opening, the speed shall be governed
by divisions (b)(10) and (b)(11) of this section. The end of every school zone
may be marked by a sign indicating the end of the zone. Nothing in this section
or in the Manual and Specifications for a Uniform System of Traffic-Control
Devices shall be construed to require school zones to be indicated by signs
equipped with flashing or other lights, or giving other special notice of the
hours in which the school zone speed limit is in effect.
         B.   As used in this section, SCHOOL means any school chartered under
Ohio R.C. § 3301.16 and any nonchartered school that during the preceding year
filed with the Department of Education in compliance with O.A.C. § 3301-35-08,
a copy of the school’s report for the parents of the school’s pupils certifying
that the school meets state minimum standards for nonchartered, nontax-
supported schools and presents evidence of this filing to the jurisdiction from
which it is requesting the establishment of a school zone. SCHOOL also includes
a special elementary school that in writing requests the County Engineer to

portion of a state highway under the jurisdiction of the Director of
Transportation or a request from a County Engineer in the case of a school zone
for a special elementary school, the Director may extend the traditional school
zone boundaries. The distances in divisions (b)(1)C.1. through (b)(1)C.3. below
shall not exceed 300 feet per approach per direction, and are bounded by
whichever of the following distances or combination thereof the Director
approves as most appropriate:
            1.   The distance encompassed by projecting the school building
lines normal to the fronting highway and extending a distance of 300 feet on
each approach direction;
            2.   The distance encompassed by projecting the school property
lines intersecting the fronting highway and extending a distance of 300 feet on
each approach direction;
            3.   The distance encompassed by the special marking of the
pavement for a principal school pupil crosswalk plus a distance of 300 feet on
each approach direction of the highway.
         D.   Nothing in this section shall be construed to invalidate the
Director’s initial action on August 9, 1976, establishing all school zones at
the traditional school zone boundaries defined by projecting school property
lines, except when those boundaries are extended as provided in divisions (b)
(1)A. and (b)(1)C. of this section.
         E.   As used in this division, CROSSWALK has the meaning given that
term in Ohio R.C. § 4511.01(LL)(2).
         F.   The Director may, upon request by resolution of the legislative
authority and upon submission by the municipality of such engineering, traffic,
and other information as the Director considers necessary, designate a school
zone on any portion of a state route lying within the municipality that
includes a crosswalk customarily used by children going to or leaving a school
during recess and opening and closing hours, whenever the distance, as measured
in a straight line, from the school property line nearest the crosswalk to the
nearest point of a crosswalk is no more than 1,320 feet. Such a school zone
shall include the distance encompassed by the crosswalk and extending 300 feet
in each appropriate direction of the state route.
         G.   As used in this section, SPECIAL ELEMENTARY SCHOOL means a school
that meets all of the following:

            5.   The principal or other person in charge of the special
elementary school annually sends a report to the superintendent of the school
district in which the special elementary school is located indicating the total
number of students enrolled at the school, but otherwise the principal or other
person in charge does not report any other information or data to the
superintendent.

attaining the age of 17 years and the person pleads guilty to, is convicted of,
or is adjudicated in juvenile court of having committed a moving violation
during the six-month period commencing on the date on which the person is
issued the probationary driver’s license, the court with jurisdiction over the
violation may order that the holder must be accompanied by the holder’s parent
or guardian whenever the holder is operating a motor vehicle upon a highway or

determining whether each occupant of the motor vehicle is wearing all of the
available elements of a properly adjusted occupant restraining device as
required by division (d) of this section, or for the sole purpose of issuing a
ticket, citation or summons if that requirement has been or is being violated,
or for causing the arrest of or commencing a prosecution of a person for a
violation of that requirement.
   (g)   Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary, no law

forfeiture. The period of registration denial shall be five years after the
date of the order, unless, during that period, the court having jurisdiction of
the offense that led to the order terminates the forfeiture and notifies the
registrar of the termination. The registrar then shall take necessary measures
to permit the person to register a vehicle owned or leased by the person or to
transfer registration of the vehicle.

4507.03, 4507.04 and 4507.05, shall operate any motor vehicle upon a public

vehicular travel or parking in this municipality unless the person has a valid
license as a motorcycle operator that was issued upon application by the
Registrar of Motor Vehicles under Ohio R.C. Chapter 4507. The license shall be
in the form of an endorsement, as determined by the Registrar, upon a driver’s
or commercial driver’s license, if the person has a valid license to operate a
motor vehicle or commercial motor vehicle, or in the form of a restricted
license as provided in Ohio R.C. § 4507.14, if the person does not have a valid
license to operate a motor vehicle or commercial motor vehicle.
   (b)   Upon the request or motion of the prosecuting authority, a
noncertified copy of the law enforcement automated data system report or a
noncertified copy of a record of the registrar of motor vehicles that shows the
name, date of birth, and social security number of a person charged with a
violation of division (a)(1) or (a)(2) of this section may be admitted into
evidence as prima facie evidence that the person did not have either a valid
driver’s or commercial driver’s license at the time of the alleged violation of
division (a)(1) of this section or a valid license as a motorcycle operator
either in the form of an endorsement upon a driver’s or commercial driver’s
license or a restricted license at the time of the alleged violation of
division (a)(2) of this section. The person charged with a violation of

prima facie evidence.
   (c)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of operating a motor vehicle
or motorcycle without a valid license and shall be punished as follows:
      (1)   If the trier of fact finds that the offender never has held a valid
driver’s or commercial driver’s license issued by this state or any other
jurisdiction, or, in a case involving the operation of a motorcycle by the
offender, if the offender has never held a valid license as a motorcycle
operator, either in the form of an endorsement upon a driver’s or commercial
driver’s license or in the form of a restricted license, except as otherwise
provided in this division, the offense is an unclassified misdemeanor. When the
offense is an unclassified misdemeanor, the offender shall be sentenced

be sentenced to a jail term; the offender shall not be sentenced to a community
residential sanction pursuant to §

pursuant to §
698.02(e)(3) or Ohio R.C. § 2929.27(C) to serve a term of community service of
up to 500 hours. The failure of an offender to complete a term of community
service imposed by the court may be punished as indirect criminal contempt
under Ohio R.C. § 2705.02(A) that may be filed in the underlying case. If the
offender previously has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to any violation of
this section or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the offense is
a misdemeanor of the first degree.
      (2)   If the offender’s driver’s or commercial driver’s license or permit
or, in a case involving the operation of a motorcycle by the offender, the
offender’s driver’s or commercial driver’s license bearing the motorcycle
endorsement or the offender’s restricted license was expired at the time of the
offense, except as otherwise provided in this division, the offense is a minor
misdemeanor. If within three years of the offense, the offender previously has
been convicted of or pleaded guilty to two or more violations of this section
or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the offense is a misdemeanor
of the first degree.
   (d)   The court shall not impose a license suspension for a first violation
of this section or if more than three years have passed since the offender’s
last violation of Ohio R.C. § 4510.12, this section, or a substantially
equivalent municipal ordinance.

within three years of the offense the offender previously was convicted of or
pleaded guilty to one or more violations of Ohio R.C. § 4510.12, this section,
or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance within the past three years,
and if the offender’s license was expired for more than six months at the time
of the offense, the court may impose a class seven suspension of the offender’s
driver license, commercial driver’s license, temporary instruction permit,
probationary license or nonresident operating privilege from the range
specified in Ohio R.C. § 4510.02(A)(7).

enforced in accordance with Ohio R.C. § 4503.234. If title to a motor vehicle
that is subject to an order for criminal forfeiture under this division is
assigned or transferred and Ohio R.C. § 4503.234(B)(2) or (3) applies, the
court may fine the offender the value of the vehicle as determined by
publications of the National Automobile Dealers Association. The proceeds from
any fine so imposed shall be distributed in accordance with Ohio R.C. §
4503.234(C)(2).

with electronic monitoring under division (b)(1) or (2) of this section unless,
within 60 days of the date of sentencing, the court issues a written finding on
the record that, due to the unavailability of space at the jail where the
offender is required to serve the jail term imposed, the offender will not be
able to begin serving that term within the 60-day period following the date of
sentencing.
      (2)   An offender sentenced under this section to a period of house
arrest with electronic monitoring shall be permitted work release during that

Treasurer for deposit in the funds as set forth in Ohio R.C. 4513.263(E).
   (f)   Limitations on evidence used for prosecution.
      (1)   Subject to division (f)(2) of this section, the failure of a person
to wear all of the available elements of a properly adjusted occupant
restraining device in violation of division (b)(1) or (b)(3) of this section or
the failure of a person to ensure that each minor who is a passenger of an
automobile being operated by that person is wearing all of the available
elements of a properly adjusted occupant restraining device in violation of
division (b)(2) of this section shall not be considered or used by the trier of
fact in a tort action as evidence of negligence or contributory negligence.
But, the trier of fact may determine based on evidence admitted consistent with
the Ohio Rules of Evidence that the failure contributed to the harm alleged in
the tort action and may diminish a recovery of compensatory damages that
represents non- economic loss, as defined in Ohio R.C. 2307.011, in a tort
action that could have been recovered but for the plaintiff’s failure to wear
all of the available elements of a properly adjusted occupant restraining
device. Evidence of that failure shall not be used as a basis for a criminal
prosecution of the person other than a prosecution for a violation of this
section; and shall not be admissible as evidence in a criminal action involving
the person other than a prosecution for a violation of this section.
      (2)   If, at the time of an accident involving a passenger car equipped
with occupant restraining devices, any occupant of the passenger car who
sustained injury or death was not wearing an available occupant restraining
device, was not wearing all of the available elements of such a device, or was
not wearing such a device as properly adjusted, then, consistent with the Rules
of Evidence, the fact that the occupant was not wearing the available occupant
restraining device, was not wearing all of the available elements of such a
device, or was not wearing such a device as properly adjusted is admissible in
evidence in relation to any claim for relief in a tort action to the extent
that the claim for relief satisfies all of the following:
         A.   It seeks to recover damages for injury or death to the occupant;
         B.   The defendant in question is the manufacturer, designer,
distributor, or seller of the passenger car;
         C.   The claim for relief against the defendant in question is that
the injury or death sustained by the occupant was enhanced or aggravated by
some design defect in the passenger car or that the passenger car was not
crashworthy.
   (g)   Penalty.
      (1)   Whoever violates division (b)(1) of this section shall be fined
$30.
      (2)   Whoever violates division (b)(2) of this section shall be subject
to the penalty set forth in §
408.02.
      (3)   Whoever violates division (b)(3) of this section shall be fined
$20.
      (4)   Except as otherwise provided in this division, whoever violates
division (b)(4) of this section is guilty of a minor misdemeanor. If the
offender previously has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to a violation of
division (b)(4) of this section, whoever violates division (b)(4) of this
section is guilty of a misdemeanor of the third degree.

of improper replacement of a motor vehicle air bag, a misdemeanor of the first
degree on a first offense. On each subsequent offense, or if the violation
results in serious physical harm to an individual, the person is guilty of a
felony to be prosecuted under appropriate state law.
      (2)   A violation of division (c) of this section is a felony to be
prosecuted under appropriate state law.
      (3)   Each manufacture, importation, installation, reinstallation, sale,
or offer for sale in violation of this section shall constitute a separate and
distinct violation.

§ 440.01  LOAD LIMITS.
   (a)   State regulations.
      (1)   A.   The municipality, with respect to highways under their
jurisdiction, upon application in writing, shall issue a special regional heavy
hauling permit authorizing the applicant to operate or move a vehicle or
combination of vehicles as follows:
            1.   At a size or weight of vehicle or load exceeding the maximum
specified in Ohio R.C. §§ 5577.01 to 5577.09, or otherwise not in conformity
with Ohio R.C. §§ 4513.01 to 4513.37.
            2.   Upon any highway under the jurisdiction of municipality except
those highways with a condition insufficient to bear the weight of the vehicle
or combination of vehicles as stated in the application.
            3.   Issuance of a special regional heavy hauling permit is subject
to the payment of a fee established by the municipality in accordance with this
section.
         B.   In circumstances where a person is not eligible to receive a
permit under division (a)(1)A. of this section, the municipality, with respect
to highways under its jurisdiction, upon application in writing and for good
cause shown, may issue a special permit in writing authorizing the applicant to
operate or move a vehicle or combination of vehicles of a size or weight of
vehicle or load exceeding the maximum specified in Ohio R.C. 5577.01 through
5577.09, or otherwise not in conformity with Ohio R.C. 4513.01 through 4513.37,
upon any highway under its jurisdiction.
      (2)   Notwithstanding Ohio R.C. 715.22 and 723.01, the holder of a permit
issued by the Director of Transportation under Ohio R.C. 4513.34 may move the
vehicle or combination of vehicles described in the permit on any highway that
is a part of the state highway system when the movement is partly within and
partly without the corporate limits of the municipality. No local authority
shall require any other permit or license or charge any license fee or other
charge against the holder of a permit for the movement of a vehicle or
combination of vehicles on any highway which is a part of the state highway
system. The Ohio Director of Transportation shall not require the holder of a
permit issued by the municipality to obtain a special permit for the movement
of vehicles or combination of vehicles on highways within the jurisdiction of
the municipality. Permits may be issued for any period of time not to exceed
one year, as the local authority in its discretion determines advisable or for
the duration of any public construction project.
      (3)   A.   The application for a permit issued under this section shall
be in the form that the municipality prescribes. The municipality may prescribe
a permit fee to be imposed and collected when any permit described in this
section is issued. The permit fee may be in an amount sufficient to reimburse
the municipality for the administrative costs incurred in issuing the permit,
and also to cover the cost of normal and expected damage caused to the roadway
or a street or highway structure as the result of the operation of the
nonconforming vehicle or combination of vehicles.
         B.   For the purposes of this section and of rules adopted by the
Director under Ohio R.C. 4513.34, milk transported in bulk by vehicle is deemed
a nondivisible load.
         C.   For purposes of this section and of rules adopted by the Director
under Ohio R.C. § 4513.34, three or fewer aluminum coils, transported by a
vehicle, are deemed a nondivisible load. The Director shall adopt rules
establishing requirements for an aluminum coil permit that are substantially
similar to the requirements for a steel coil permit under O.A.C. Chapter 5501:
2-1.
      (4)   The municipality shall issue a special regional heavy hauling
permit under division (a)(1)A. of this section upon application and payment of
the applicable fee. However, the municipality may issue or withhold a special
permit specified in division (a)(1)B. of this section. If a permit is to be
issued, the municipality may limit or prescribe conditions of operation for the
vehicle and may require the posting of a bond or other security conditioned
upon the sufficiency of the permit fee to compensate for damage caused to the
roadway or a street or highway structure. In addition, the municipality, as a
condition of issuance of an overweight permit, may require the applicant to
develop and enter into a mutual agreement with the municipality to compensate
for or to repair excess damage caused to the roadway by travel under the
permit.
      (5)   Every permit issued under this section shall be carried in the
vehicle or combination of vehicles to which it refers and shall be open to
inspection by any police officer or authorized agent of any authority granting
the permit. No person shall violate any of the terms of a permit.
      (6)   The Director of Transportation may debar an applicant from applying
for a special permit under this section upon a finding based on a reasonable
belief that the applicant has done any of the actions specified in Ohio R.C. §
4513.34(F).
      (7)   Notice and procedures for debarment shall be as provided in Ohio
R.C. § 4513.34(G).
      (8)   A.   No person shall violate the terms of a permit issued under
this section that relate to gross load limits.
         B.   No person shall violate the terms of a permit issued under this
section that relate to axle load by more than 2,000 pounds per axle or group of
axles.
         C.   No person shall violate the terms of a permit issued under this
section that relate to an approved route except upon order of a law enforcement
officer or authorized agent of the issuing authority.
      (9)   A permit issued by the municipality under this section for the
operation of a vehicle or combination of vehicles is valid for the purposes of
the vehicle operation in accordance with the conditions and limitations
specified on the permit. Such a permit is voidable by law enforcement only for
operation of a vehicle or combination of vehicles in violation of the weight,
dimension, or route provisions of the permit. However, a permit is not voidable
for operation in violation of a route provision of a permit if the operation is
upon the order of a law enforcement officer.
(ORC 4513.34)
   (b)   Penalty.  Whoever violates division (a) of this section is guilty of a
minor misdemeanor.
(ORC 4513.99)
   (c)   Local streets. No person shall operate a vehicle exceeding a size as
specified Ohio R.C. 5577.01 through 5577.09, or otherwise not in conformity
with Ohio R.C. 4513.01 through 4513.37, or exceeding a gross weight of five
tons, upon any street in the municipality other than state routes and county
roads, except those local streets designated as a truck route and marked as
such by appropriate traffic signs, and except when such operation is necessary
to load or unload property, to go to or from the usual place of storage of such
vehicle or to perform any other legitimate business or act other than passage
through the municipality. Operators of vehicles so deviating from either a
state route or a designated truck route within the municipality shall confine
such deviation to that required in order to accomplish the purpose of the
departure. On county roads, Council or other duly designated local authority
shall establish reasonable weight limits commensurate with the construction and
material specifications for such roads and the load resistance of such roads as
determined by the County Engineer. County roads shall be posted with signs
indicating such weight limits.
   (d)   Local permit and conditions.  Upon application and for good cause, the
Police Chief may issue a local permit authorizing an applicant to move an
oversize or overweight vehicle or combination of vehicles upon local streets
and highways.
      (1)   No permittee shall be required to obtain a special permit from the
Ohio Director of Transportation for the movement of the vehicle or combination
of vehicles on streets or highways under local jurisdiction. However, the
approval of the Ohio Director of Transportation shall be required for movement
upon state routes as provided in division (a) of this section.
      (2)   The Police Chief may grant a permit for a single or round trip, or
for such period of time, not to exceed one year, as the Police Chief in his or
her discretion deems advisable, or for the duration of any construction
project. The Police Chief may limit or prescribe terms or conditions of
operation for such vehicle or combination of vehicles by designating the route,
hours, speed or such other restrictions as may be necessary for the
preservation of the public peace, property, health and safety. The Police Chief
may require the posting of bond or other security necessary to compensate for
any damage to a roadway or road structure.
      (3)   For each such permit, the Police Chief shall charge $25, and for
each hour of time or any part thereof spent by the Police Department in
supervising the movement of such vehicle, the applicant shall pay the sum of
$50.
      (4)   Except as provided in divisions (a) and (b) of this section,
streets and highways shall be posted with signs indicating “no thru trucks -
gross weight five tons” or words of similar import to inform drivers of the
limitations imposed by this section. No driver shall disobey the instructions
indicated on any such sign.
      (5)   Violation of any of the limitations, terms or conditions of the
permit granted by the Police Chief shall be cause for immediate revocation or
suspension of such permit and denial of request for any future permit. Such
violation shall also subject the violator to the penalties prescribed by
Sections
408.01 and
408.02.

§ 452.05  WILLFULLY LEAVING VEHICLES ON PRIVATE OR PUBLIC PROPERTY.
   (a)   The County Sheriff or Chief of Police, within the Sheriff’s or Chief’s
respective territorial jurisdiction, or a state highway patrol trooper, upon
notification to the Sheriff or Chief of Police of such action and of the
location of the place of storage, may order into storage any motor vehicle,
including an abandoned junk motor vehicle as defined in Ohio R.C. § 4513.63,
that:
      (1)   Has come into the possession of the Sheriff, Chief of Police, or
state highway patrol trooper as a result of the performance of the Sheriff’s,
Chief’s, or trooper’s duties; or
      (2)   Has been left on a public street or other property open to the
public for purposes of vehicular travel, or upon or within the right-of-way of
any road or highway, for 48 hours or longer without notification to the Sheriff
or Chief of Police of the reasons for leaving the motor vehicle in such place.
However, when such a motor vehicle constitutes an obstruction to traffic it may
be ordered into storage immediately unless either of the following applies:
         A.   The vehicle was involved in an accident and is subject to Ohio
R.C. § 4513.66, or any substantially equivalent municipal ordinance;
         B.   The vehicle is a commercial motor vehicle. If the vehicle is a

Chief of Police, or state highway patrol trooper shall order the removal of the
vehicle.
      (3)   Subject to division (c) of this section, the Sheriff or Chief of
Police shall designate the place of storage of any motor vehicle so ordered
removed.

motor vehicle to the location designated by the Sheriff or Chief of Police not
more than two hours after the time it is removed.
   (c)   (1)   The Sheriff or Chief of Police shall cause a search to be made
of the records of the Bureau of Motor Vehicles to ascertain the identity of the
owner and any lienholder of a motor vehicle ordered into storage by the Sheriff
or Chief of Police, or by a state highway patrol trooper within five business
days of the removal of the vehicle. Upon obtaining such identity, the Sheriff
or Chief of Police shall send or cause to be sent to the owner or lienholder at
the owner’s or lienholder’s last known address by certified mail with return
receipt requested, notice that informs the owner or lienholder that the motor
vehicle will be declared a nuisance and disposed of if not claimed within ten
days of the date of mailing of the notice.
      (2)   A.   The owner or lienholder of the motor vehicle may reclaim the
motor vehicle upon payment of any expenses or charges incurred in its removal
and storage, and presentation of proof of ownership, which may be evidenced by
a certificate of title or memorandum certificate of title to the motor vehicle,
a certificate of registration for the motor vehicle, or a lease agreement. Upon
presentation of proof of ownership evidenced as provided above, the owner of
the motor vehicle also may retrieve any personal items from the vehicle without
retrieving the vehicle and without paying any fee. However, a towing service or
storage facility may charge an after-hours retrieval fee established by the
Public Utilities Commission in rules adopted under R.C. § 4921.25 if the owner
retrieves the personal items after hours, unless the towing service or storage
facility fails to provide the notice required under R.C. § 4513.69(B)(3), if
applicable. However, the owner shall not do either of the following:
            1.   Retrieve any personal item that has been determined by the
Sheriff, Chief of Police, or a state highway patrol trooper, as applicable, to
be necessary to a criminal investigation;
            2.   Retrieve any personal item from a vehicle if it would endanger
the safety of the owner, unless the owner agrees to sign a waiver of liability.
         B.   For purposes of division (c)(2) of this section, PERSONAL ITEMS
do not include any items that are attached to the vehicle.
      (3)   If the owner or lienholder of the motor vehicle reclaims it after a
search of the records of the Bureau of Motor Vehicles has been conducted and
after notice has been sent to the owner or lienholder as described in this
section, and the search was conducted by the place of storage, and the notice
was sent to the motor vehicle owner by the place of storage, the owner or
lienholder shall pay to the place of storage a processing fee of $25, in
addition to any expenses or charges incurred in the removal and storage of the
vehicle.
   (d)   If the owner or lienholder makes no claim to the motor vehicle within
ten days of the date of mailing of the notice, and if the vehicle is to be
disposed of at public auction as provided in Ohio R.C. § 4513.62 or any
substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the Sheriff or Chief of Police,
without charge to any party, shall file with the Clerk of Courts of the county
in which the place of storage is located an affidavit showing compliance with
the requirements of this section. Upon presentation of the affidavit, the
Clerk, without charge, shall issue a salvage certificate of title, free and
clear of all liens and encumbrances, to the Sheriff or Chief of Police. If the
vehicle is to be disposed of to a motor vehicle salvage dealer or other
facility as provided in Ohio R.C. § 4513.62 or any substantially equivalent
municipal ordinance, the Sheriff or Chief of Police shall execute in triplicate
an affidavit, as prescribed by the Registrar of Motor Vehicles, describing the
motor vehicle and the manner in which it was disposed of, and that all
requirements of this section have been complied with. The Sheriff or Chief of
Police shall retain the original of the affidavit for the Sheriff’s or Chief’s
records, and shall furnish two copies to the motor vehicle salvage dealer or
other facility. Upon presentation of a copy of the affidavit by the motor
vehicle salvage dealer, the Clerk of Courts, within 30 days of the
presentation, shall issue a salvage certificate of title, free and clear of all
liens and encumbrances.
   (e)   Whenever a motor vehicle salvage dealer or other facility receives an
affidavit for the disposal of a motor vehicle as provided in this section, the
dealer or facility shall not be required to obtain an Ohio certificate of title
to the motor vehicle in the dealer’s or facility’s own name if the vehicle is
dismantled or destroyed and both copies of the affidavit are delivered to the
Clerk of Courts.
   (f)   No towing service or storage facility shall fail to comply with this
section.
(ORC § 4513.61)
   (g)   Abandonment of Junk Motor Vehicle Prohibited.
      (1)   A.   No person shall willfully leave an abandoned junk motor
vehicle, as defined in Ohio R.C. § 4513.63, on private property for more than
72 hours without the permission of the person having the right to the
possession of the property, or on a public street or other property open to the
public for purposes of vehicular travel or parking, or upon or within the
right-of-way of any road or highway for 48 hours or longer without notification
to the Police Chief of the reason for leaving the motor vehicle in that place.
         B.   For purposes of this division (g)(1), the fact that a motor
vehicle has been so left without permission or notification is prima facie
evidence of abandonment.
         C.   Nothing contained in this section and Ohio R.C. §§ 4513.60,
4513.61 and 4513.63 shall invalidate or prevent the enactment of further
provisions of municipal ordinances regulating or prohibiting the abandonment of
motor vehicles on streets, highways, public property or private property within
the municipality.
      (2)   Whoever violates this division (g) is guilty of a minor misdemeanor
and shall also be assessed any costs incurred by the municipality in disposing
of the abandoned junk motor vehicle, less any money accruing to the
municipality from the disposal.

abandoned junk motor vehicle as defined in R.C. § 4513.63, that has been left
on private residential or private agricultural property for at least four hours
without the permission of the person having the right to the possession of the
property. The Sheriff or Chief of Police, upon complaint of a repair garage or
place of storage, may order into storage any motor vehicle, other than an
abandoned junk motor vehicle, that has been left at the garage or place of
storage for a longer period than that agreed upon. When ordering a motor
vehicle into storage pursuant to this division, the Sheriff or Chief of Police
may arrange for the removal of the motor vehicle by a towing service and shall
designate a storage facility.
      (2)   A towing service towing a motor vehicle under division (a)(1) of
this section shall remove the motor vehicle in accordance with that division.

oral or written notification at the time of such arrival that the vehicle owner
or operator may pay a fee of not more than one-half of the fee for the removal
of the motor vehicle established by the Public Utilities Commission in rules
adopted under R.C. § 4921.25, in order to obtain release of the motor vehicle.
However, if the vehicle is within a municipal corporation and the municipal
corporation has established a vehicle removal fee, the towing service shall
give the owner or operator oral or written notification that the owner or
operator may pay not more than one-half of that fee to obtain release of the
motor vehicle. That fee may be paid by use of a major credit card unless the
towing service uses a mobile credit card processor and mobile service is not
available at the time of the transaction.
      (2)   Upon payment of the applicable fee, the towing service shall give
the vehicle owner or operator a receipt showing both the full amount normally
assessed and the actual amount received and shall release the motor vehicle to
the owner or operator. Upon its release, the owner or operator immediately
shall move it so that it is not on the private residential or private
agricultural property without the permission of the person having the right to

fee. However, a towing service or storage facility may charge an after-hours
retrieval fee established by the Public Utilities Commission in rules adopted
under R.C. § 4921.25 if the owner retrieves the personal items after hours,
unless the towing service or storage facility fails to provide the notice
required under R.C. § 4513.69(B)(3), if applicable. The owner of a motor
vehicle shall not do either of the following:
         A.   Retrieve any personal item that has been determined by the

§ 606.02  CULPABLE MENTAL STATES.
   (a)   A person acts purposely when it is the person’s specific intention to
cause a certain result, or, when the gist of the offense is a prohibition
against conduct of a certain nature, regardless of what the offender intends to
accomplish thereby, it is the offender’s specific intention to engage in
conduct of that nature.
   (b)   A person acts knowingly, regardless of purpose, when the person is
aware that the person’s conduct will probably cause a certain result or will
probably be of a certain nature. A person has knowledge of circumstances when
the person is aware that such circumstances probably exist. When knowledge of
the existence of a particular fact is an element of an offense, such knowledge
is established if a person subjectively believes that there is a high
probability of its existence and fails to make inquiry or acts with a conscious
purpose to avoid learning the fact.
   (c)   A person acts recklessly when, with heedless indifference to the
consequences, the person disregards a substantial and unjustifiable risk that
the person’s conduct is likely to cause a certain result or is likely to be of
a certain nature. A person is reckless with respect to circumstances when, with
heedless indifference to the consequences, the person disregards a substantial
and unjustifiable risk that such circumstances are likely to exist.
   (d)   A person acts negligently when, because of a substantial lapse from
due care, the person fails to perceive or avoid a risk that the person’s
conduct may cause a certain result or may be of a certain nature.  A person is
negligent with respect to circumstances when, because of a substantial lapse
from due care, the person fails to perceive or avoid a risk that such
circumstances may exist.
   (e)   When the section defining an offense provides that negligence suffices
to establish an element thereof, then recklessness, knowledge, or purpose is
also sufficient culpability for such element.  When recklessness suffices to
establish an element of an offense, then knowledge or purpose is also
sufficient culpability for such element.  When knowledge suffices to establish
an element of an offense, then purpose is also sufficient culpability for such
element.
(ORC 2901.22)
§ 606.03  CLASSIFICATION OF OFFENSES.
   As used in this General Offenses Code:
   (a)   Offenses include misdemeanors of the first, second, third and fourth

refer to a previous conviction of or plea of guilty to a substantially
equivalent offense under an existing or former law of this municipality, state,
another state, or the United States or under an existing or former municipal

   (d)   Any provision of this Code that refers to a section, or to a division

   (b)   In homicide, the element referred to in division (a)(1) of this
section includes the act that causes death, the physical contact that causes

in question. If any part of the body of a homicide victim is found in this
municipality, the death is presumed to have occurred within this municipality.
   (c)   (1)   This municipality includes the land and water within its
boundaries and the air space above that land and water, with respect to which
this municipality has either exclusive or concurrent legislative jurisdiction.
Where the boundary between this municipality and another jurisdiction is
disputed, the disputed territory is conclusively presumed to be within this
municipality for purposes of this section.
      (2)   The courts of common pleas of Adams, Athens, Belmont, Brown,
Clermont, Columbiana, Gallia, Hamilton, Jefferson, Lawrence, Meigs, Monroe,
Scioto, and Washington counties have jurisdiction beyond the north or northwest

any adjacent court of common pleas that borders on that river and with any

it appears beyond a reasonable doubt that the offense or any element of the
offense took place either in this municipality or in another jurisdiction or
jurisdictions, but it cannot reasonably be determined in which it took place,
the offense or element is conclusively presumed to have taken place in this
municipality for purposes of this section.
   (e)   When a person is subject to criminal prosecution and punishment in

under this section to criminal prosecution and punishment in this municipality
need not be committed personally by the person as long as it is committed by
another person who is in complicity or conspiracy with the person.

the period of limitation does not begin to run until such course of conduct or
the accused’s accountability for it terminates, whichever occurs first.
   (f)   A prosecution is commenced on the date an indictment is returned or an
information filed, or on the date a lawful arrest without a warrant is made, or
on the date a warrant, summons, citation, or other process is issued, whichever
occurs first.  A prosecution is not commenced by the return of an indictment or

though the indictment, information, or process that commenced the prosecution
is quashed or the proceedings on the indictment, information, or process are
set aside or reversed on appeal.
   (j)   The period of limitation for a violation of this Part 6 or Title XXIX
of the Ohio Revised Code that involves a physical or mental wound, injury,
disability, or condition of a nature that reasonably indicates abuse or neglect

      (2)   A public children services agency, or a municipal or county peace
officer that is not the parent or guardian of the child, in the county in which

2015, and apply to a violation of either of those sections committed prior to

(ORC § 2901.13)
§ 606.07  REQUIREMENTS FOR CRIMINAL LIABILITY; VOLUNTARY INTOXICATION.
   (a)   Except as provided in division (b) of this section, a person is not
guilty of an offense unless both of the following apply:
      (1)   The person’s liability is based on conduct that includes either a
voluntary act, or an omission to perform an act or duty that the person is
capable of performing;
      (2)   The person has the requisite degree of culpability for each element
as to which a culpable mental state is specified by the language defining the
offense.
   (b)   When the language defining an offense does not specify any degree of
culpability, and plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict criminal
liability for the conduct described in the section, then culpability is not
required for a person to be guilty of the offense. The fact that one division
of a section plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict liability for an
offense defined in that division does not by itself plainly indicate a purpose
to impose strict criminal liability for an offense defined in other divisions
of the section that do not specify a degree of culpability.
   (c)   (1)   When language defining an element of an offense that is related
to knowledge or intent or to which mens rea could fairly be applied neither
specifies culpability nor plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict
liability, the element of the offense is established only if a person acts
recklessly.
      (2)   Division (c)(1) of this section does not apply to offenses defined
in Ohio R.C. Title XLV.
      (3)   Division (c)(1) of this section does not relieve the prosecution of
the burden of proving the culpable mental state required by any definition
incorporated into the offense.
   (d)   Voluntary intoxication may not be taken into consideration in
determining the existence of a mental state that is an element of a criminal

commission of or an attempt to commit an offense, an attempt to commit an
offense, or an offense, the court shall charge the jury in accordance with Ohio
R.C. 2923.03(D).

prior to the commission of or attempt to commit the offense, the actor
terminated his or her complicity, under circumstances manifesting a complete
and voluntary renunciation of his or her criminal purpose.

law enforcement agency, or a laboratory established by or under the authority
of an institution of higher education that has its main campus in this state
and that is accredited by the Association of American Universities or the North
Central Association of Colleges and Secondary Schools, primarily for the
purpose of providing scientific service to law enforcement agencies, and signed
by the person performing the analysis, stating that the substance that is the
basis of the alleged offense has been weighed and analyzed and stating the
findings as to the content, weight, and identity of the substance and that it
contains any amount of a controlled substance and the number and description of
unit dosages, is prima facie evidence of the content, identity, and weight or
the existence and number of unit dosages of the substance. In any criminal
prosecution for a violation of Ohio R.C. § 2925.041 or a violation of this
chapter, Ohio R.C. Chapter 2925 or Ohio R.C. Chapter 3719 that is based on the
possession of chemicals sufficient to produce a compound, mixture, preparation,
or substance included in Schedule I, II, III, IV, or V, a laboratory report
from the Bureau or from any laboratory that is operated or established as
described in this division that is signed by the person performing the
analysis, stating that the substances that are the basis of the alleged offense
have been weighed and analyzed and stating the findings as to the content,
weight, and identity of each of the substances, is prima facie evidence of the
content, identity, and weight of the substances.
      (2)   Attached to that report shall be a copy of a notarized statement by
the signer of the report giving the name of the signer and stating that the
signer is an employee of the laboratory issuing the report and that performing
the analysis is a part of the signer’s regular duties, and giving an outline of
the signer’s education, training, and experience for performing an analysis of
materials included under this section.  The signer shall attest that
scientifically accepted tests were performed with due caution, and that the
evidence was handled in accordance with established and accepted procedures
while in the custody of the laboratory.
   (b)   The prosecuting attorney shall serve a copy of the report on the
attorney of record for the accused, or on the accused if the accused has no
attorney, prior to any proceeding in which the report is to be used against the
accused other than at a preliminary hearing or grand jury proceeding where the
report may be used without having been previously served upon the accused.
   (c)   The report shall not be prima facie evidence of the contents,
identity, and weight or the existence and number of unit dosages of the
substance if the accused or the accused’s attorney demands the testimony of the
person signing the report, by serving the demand upon the prosecuting attorney,
within seven days from the accused or the accused’s attorney’s receipt of the
report.  The time may be extended by a trial judge in the interests of justice.
   (d)   Any report issued for use under this section shall contain notice of
the right of the accused to demand, and the manner in which the accused shall

substances that are, the basis of the alleged violation preserved for the
benefit of independent analysis performed by a laboratory analyst employed by
the accused person, or, if the accused is indigent, by a qualified laboratory
analyst appointed by the court.  Such portion shall be a representative sample
of the entire substance that is, or of each of the substances that are, the
basis of the alleged violation and shall be of sufficient size, in the opinion
of the court, to permit the accused’s analyst to make a thorough scientific
analysis concerning the identity of the substance or substances.  The
prosecuting attorney shall provide the accused’s analyst with the sample
portion at least 14 days prior to trial, unless the trial is to be held in a
court not of record or unless the accused person is charged with a minor
misdemeanor, in which case the prosecuting attorney shall provide the accused’s
analyst with the sample portion at least three days prior to trial.  If the
prosecuting attorney determines that such a sample portion cannot be preserved
and given to the accused’s analyst, the prosecuting attorney shall so inform
the accused person, or the accused’s attorney.  In such a circumstance, the
accused person is entitled, upon written request made to the prosecuting
attorney, to have the accused’s privately employed or court appointed analyst
present at an analysis of the substance that is, or the substances that are,
the basis of the alleged violation, and, upon further written request, to
receive copies of all recorded scientific data that result from the analysis
and that can be used by an analyst in arriving at conclusions, findings, or
opinions concerning the identity of the substance or substances subject to the
analysis.
   (f)   In addition to the rights provided under division (e) of this section,
any person who is accused of a violation of this chapter or Ohio R.C. Chapters
2925 or 3719 that involves a bulk amount of a controlled substance, or any
multiple thereof, or who is accused of a violation of Ohio R.C. § 2925.11 or a
substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, other than a minor misdemeanor
violation, that involves marihuana, is entitled, upon written request made to
the prosecuting attorney, to have a laboratory analyst of the accused’s choice,
or, if the accused is indigent, a qualified laboratory analyst appointed by the
court, present at a measurement or weighing of the substance that is the basis
of the alleged violation.  Also, the accused person is entitled, upon further
written request, to receive copies of all recorded scientific data that result
from the measurement or weighing and that can be used by an analyst in arriving
at conclusions, findings, or opinions concerning the weight, volume, or number
of unit doses of the substance subject to the measurement or weighing.

   (g)   In addition to the financial sanctions authorized or required under
Ohio R.C. §§ 2929.18 and 2929.28 and to any costs otherwise authorized or
required under any provision of law, the court imposing sentence upon an
offender who is convicted of or pleads guilty to a drug abuse offense may order
the offender to pay to the state, municipal, or county law enforcement agencies
that handled the investigation and prosecution all of the costs that the state,
municipal corporation, or county reasonably incurred in having tests performed
under this section or Ohio R.C. § 2925.51 or in any other manner on any
substance that was the basis of, or involved in, the offense to determine
whether the substance contained any amount of a controlled substance if the
results of the tests indicate that the substance tested contained any
controlled substance. No court shall order an offender under this section to
pay the costs of tests performed on a substance if the results of the tests do
not indicate that the substance tested contained any controlled substance. The
court shall hold a hearing to determine the amount of costs to be imposed under
this section. The court may hold the hearing as part of the sentencing hearing
for the offender.

premises on which it conducts bingo sessions, the lessor of the premises shall
provide only the premises to the organization and shall not provide the
organization with bingo game operators, security personnel, concessions or
concession operators, bingo supplies, or any other type of service. A

circumstances make it impractical for the charitable organization to conduct a
bingo session at the premises, or on the day of the week or at the time
specified on its license or if a charitable organization wants to conduct bingo
sessions on a day of the week or at a time other than the day or time specified
on its license, the charitable organization may apply in writing to the
Attorney General for an amended license pursuant to Ohio R.C. § 2915.08(F). A
charitable organization may apply twice in each calendar year for an amended
license to conduct bingo sessions on a day of the week or at a time other than
the day or time specified on its license. If the amended license is granted,
the organization may conduct bingo sessions at the premises, on the day of the

electronic bingo aid.
            4.   An electronic bingo aid cannot be part of an electronic
network other than a network that includes only bingo aids and devices that are

with any device not located on the premises at which the bingo is being
conducted.
            5.   An electronic bingo aid cannot be used to participate in bingo
that is conducted at a location other than the location at which the bingo

      (3)   Nothing in this division (d) of this section prohibits an employee
of a fraternal organization, veteran’s organization, or sporting organization
from selling instant bingo tickets or cards to the organization’s members or
invited guests, as long as no portion of the employee’s compensation is paid
from any receipts of bingo.

or a mentally or physically disabled child under 21 years of age, shall create
a substantial risk to the health or safety of the child by violating a duty of
care, protection, or support. It is not a violation of a duty of care,
protection, or support under this division when the parent, guardian,

or mental illness or disability of the child by spiritual means through prayer
alone, in accordance with the tenets of a recognized religious body.

when there is a substantial risk that such conduct, if continued, will
seriously impair or retard the child’s mental health or development.

this division and a violation of Ohio R.C. § 4511.19(A), or a substantially
equivalent municipal ordinance, that constitutes the basis of the charge of the
violation of this division. For purposes of Ohio R.C. §§ 4511.191 through

protection order that must be accorded full faith a credit by a court of this
state or that it is not entitled to full faith and credit under 18 U.S.C. 2265
(c).
      (4)   In a prosecution for a violation of this section, it is not

municipality shall designate, for purposes of division (c) of this section, the
minimum number of entrances required to be opened, maintained and staffed at
each live entertainment performance so as to permit crowd control and reduce

that crowds are expected to congregate at the entrances and the amount of
security provided at the restricted entertainment area.
      (2)   Notwithstanding division (e)(1) of this section, a state university

      (2)   No administrator, employee, or faculty member of any primary,
secondary, or post-secondary school or of any other educational institution,

(ORC § 2903.31(A) and (B))
   (c)   (1)   Any person who is subjected to hazing, as defined in division
(a), may commence a civil action for injury or damages, including mental and
physical pain and suffering, that result from the hazing. The action may be
brought against any participants in the hazing, any organization whose local or
national directors, trustees or officers authorized, requested, commanded or
tolerated the hazing, and any local or national director, trustee or officer of
the organization who authorized, requested, commanded or tolerated the hazing.
If the hazing involves students in a primary, secondary or post-secondary
school, university, college or any other educational institution, an action may
also be brought against any administrator, employee or faculty member of the
school, university, college or other educational institution who knew or
reasonably should have known of the hazing and who did not make reasonable
attempts to prevent it and against the school, university, college or other
educational institution. If an administrator, employee or faculty member is
found liable in a civil action for hazing, then notwithstanding Ohio R.C.
Chapter 2743, the school, university, college or other educational institution
that employed the administrator, employee or faculty member may also be held
liable.
      (2)   The negligence or consent of the plaintiff or any assumption of the
risk by the plaintiff is not a defense to an action brought pursuant to this
section. In an action against a school, university, college or other
educational institution, it is an affirmative defense that the school,
university, college or other institution was actively enforcing a policy
against hazing at the time the cause of action arose.

of an offense that is a misdemeanor of the first degree, ethnic intimidation is
a felony to be prosecuted under appropriate state law.

other tests that the physician, in that physician’s good faith medical
judgment, believes are necessary to determine whether an unborn child is

offense or in a violation of Ohio R.C. § 1716.14(A) involving a victim who is

determining the value as required by Ohio R.C. § 2913.61(A) is the aggregate
value of all property or services involved in the offense.
   (b)   (1)   When a series of offenses under Ohio R.C. § 2913.02, or a series
of violations of, attempts to commit a violation of, conspiracies to violate,

2913.03, or 2913.04, Ohio R.C. § 2913.21(B)(1) or (B)(2), or Ohio R.C. §§
2913.31 or 2913.43 involving a victim who is an elderly person or disabled
adult, or any substantially equivalent municipal ordinance to any of these
offenses, is committed by the offender in the offender’s same employment,
capacity, or relationship to another, all of those offenses shall be tried as a
single offense.  When a series of offenses under Ohio R.C. § 2913.02, or a
series of violations of, attempts to commit a violation of, conspiracies to
violate, or complicity in violations of Ohio R.C. § 2913.02 or 2913.43
involving a victim who is an active duty service member or spouse of an active
duty service member, or any substantially equivalent municipal ordinance to any
of these offenses, is committed by the offender in the offender’s same
employment, capacity, or relationship to another, all of those offenses shall
be tried as a single offense.  The value of the property or services involved
in the series of offenses for the purpose of determining the value as required
by Ohio R.C. § 2913.61(A) is the aggregate value of all property and services
involved in all offenses in the series.
      (2)   If an offender commits a series of offenses under Ohio R.C. §
2913.02 that involves a common course of conduct to defraud multiple victims,
all of the offenses may be tried as a single offense.  If an offender is being
tried for the commission of a series of violations of, attempts to commit a
violation of, conspiracies to violate, or complicity in violations of Ohio R.C.
§ 1716.14(A), Ohio R.C. §§ 2913.02, 2913.03, or 2913.04, Ohio R.C. § 2913.21(B)
(1) or (B)(2), or Ohio R.C. §§ 2913.31 or 2913.43, whether committed against
one victim or more than one victim, involving a victim who is an elderly person
or disabled adult, or any substantially equivalent municipal ordinance to any
of these offenses,  pursuant to a scheme or course of conduct, all of those
offenses may be tried as a single offense.  If an offender is being tried for
the commission of a series of violations of, attempts to commit a violation of,
conspiracies to violate, or complicity in violations of Ohio R.C. § 2913.02 or
2913.43, or any substantially equivalent municipal ordinance to any of these
offenses, whether committed against one victim or more than one victim,
involving a victim who is an active duty service member or spouse of an active
duty service member pursuant to a scheme or course of conduct, all of those
offenses may be tried as a single offense. If the offenses are tried as a
single offense, the value of the property or services involved for the purpose
of determining the value as required by Ohio R.C. § 2913.61(A) is the aggregate
value of all property and services involved in all of the offenses in the
course of conduct.
      (3)   When a series of two or more offenses under Ohio R.C. § 2913.40,
2913.48, or 2921.41 is committed by the offender in the offender’s same
employment, capacity, or relationship to another, all of those offenses may be
tried as a single offense.  If the offenses are tried as a single offense, the
value of the property or services involved for the purpose of determining the
value as required by Ohio R.C. § 2913.61(A) is the aggregate value of all
property and services involved in all of the offenses in the series of two or
more offenses.
      (4)   In prosecuting a single offense under division (b)(1), (b)(2) or
(b)(3) of this section, it is not necessary to separately allege and prove each
offense in the series.  Rather, it is sufficient to allege and prove that the
offender, within a given span of time, committed one or more theft offenses or
violations of Ohio R.C. § 2913.40, 2913.48, or 2921.41 in the offender’s same
employment, capacity, or relationship to another as described in division (b)
(1) or (b)(3) of this section, or committed one or more theft offenses that
involve a common course of conduct to defraud multiple victims or a scheme or
course of conduct as described in division (b)(2) of this section. While it is
not necessary to separately allege and prove each offense in the series in
order to prosecute a single offense under division (b)(1), (b)(2), or (b)(3) of
this section, it remains necessary in prosecuting them as a single offense to
prove the aggregate value of the property or services in order to meet the
requisite statutory offense level sought by the prosecution.
   (c)   The following criteria shall be used in determining the value of
property or services involved in a theft offense:
      (1)   The value of an heirloom, memento, collector’s item, antique,
museum piece, manuscript, document, record, or other thing that has intrinsic
worth to its owner and that either is irreplaceable or is replaceable only on
the expenditure of substantial time, effort, or money, is the amount which
would compensate the owner for its loss.
      (2)   The value of personal effects and household goods, and of
materials, supplies, equipment, and fixtures used in the profession, business,
trade, occupation, or avocation of its owner, which property is not covered
under division (c)(1) of this section, and which retains substantial utility
for its purpose regardless of its age or condition, is the cost of replacing
such property with new property of like kind and quality.
      (3)   The value of any real or personal property that is not covered
under division (c)(1) or (2) of this section, and the value of services, is the
fair market value of the property or services.  As used in this section, FAIR
MARKET VALUE is the money consideration which a buyer would give and a seller
would accept for property or services, assuming that the buyer is willing to
buy and the seller is willing to sell, that both are fully informed as to all
facts material to the transaction, and that neither is under any compulsion to
act.
   (d)   Without limitation on the evidence which may be used to establish the
value of property or services involved in a theft offense:
      (1)   When the property involved is personal property held for sale at
wholesale or retail, the price at which the property was held for sale is prima
facie evidence of its value.
      (2)   When the property involved is a security or commodity traded on an
exchange, the closing price or, if there is no closing price, the asked price,
given in the latest marked quotation prior to the offense, is prima facie
evidence of the value of the security or commodity.
      (3)   When the property involved is livestock, poultry, or raw
agricultural products for which a local market price is available, the latest
local market price prior to the offense is prima facie evidence of the value of
the livestock, poultry, or products.
      (4)   When the property involved is a negotiable instrument, the face
value is prima facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (5)   When the property involved is a warehouse receipt, bill of lading,
pawn ticket, claim check, or other instrument entitling the holder or bearer to
receive property, the face value or, if there is no face value, the value of
the property covered by the instrument less any payment necessary to receive
the property, is prima facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (6)   When the property involved is a ticket of admission, ticket for
transportation, coupon, token, or other instrument entitling the holder or
bearer to receive property or services, the face value or, if there is no face
value, the value of the property or services which may be received by the
instrument is prima facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (7)   When the services involved are gas, electricity, water, telephone,
transportation, shipping, or other services for which the rate is established
by law, the duly established rate is prima facie evidence of the value of the
services.
      (8)   When the services involved are services for which the rate is not
established by law, and the offender has been notified prior to the offense of
the rate for the services, either in writing, or orally, or by posting in a
manner reasonably calculated to come to the attention of potential offenders,
the rate contained in the notice is prima facie evidence of the value of the
services.

§ 642.25  DETERMINING PROPERTY VALUE IN ARSON.
   (a)   The following criteria shall be used in determining the value of
property or amount of physical harm involved in a violation of §
642.09(a)(1) or (b)(1):
      (1)   If the property is an heirloom, memento, collector’s item, antique,
museum piece, manuscript, document, record, or other thing that is either
irreplaceable or is replaceable only on the expenditure of substantial time,
effort, or money, the value of the property or the amount of physical harm
involved is the amount that would compensate the owner for its loss.
      (2)   If the property is not covered under division (a)(1) of this
section, and the physical harm is such that the property can be restored
substantially to its former condition, the amount of physical harm involved is
the reasonable cost of restoring the property.
      (3)   If the property is not covered under division (a)(1) of this
section, and the physical harm is such that the property cannot be restored
substantially to its former condition, the value of the property, in the case
of personal property, is the cost of replacing the property with new property
of like kind and quality, and in the case of real property or real property
fixtures, is the difference in the fair market value of the property
immediately before and immediately after the offense.
   (b)   As used in this section, FAIR MARKET VALUE has the same meaning as in
Ohio R.C. § 2913.61.
   (c)   Prima facie evidence of the value of property, as provided in Ohio
R.C. § 2913.61(D), may be used to establish the value of property pursuant to
this section.

2913.01, that involves alleged tampering with a gas, electric, steam or water

tampering occurred has caused the tampering with intent to commit a theft
offense.
   (b)   In a prosecution for a theft offense, as defined in Ohio R.C. §

utility has been reconnected without the consent of the utility is prima facie
evidence that the person in possession or control of the meter, conduit or
attachment at the time of the reconnection has reconnected the meter, conduit
or attachment with intent to commit a theft offense.

standards in the adult community as a whole with respect to what is suitable
for juveniles.

   JUVENILE.  Any unmarried person under 18 years of age.

      (3)   Its dominant tendency is to arouse lust by displaying or depicting
bestiality or extreme or bizarre violence, cruelty, or brutality.
      (4)   Its dominant tendency is to appeal to scatological interest by
displaying or depicting human bodily functions of elimination in a way that

purpose.

tobacco products, or alternative nicotine products.

guilty of a charge of a violation of division (a) of this section in which the

seller, agent or employee raises and proves as an affirmative defense that all
of the following occurred:
         A.   A card holder attempting to purchase or receive cigarettes, other
tobacco products, or alternative nicotine products presented a driver’s or
commercial driver’s license or an identification card.
         B.   A transaction scan of the driver’s or commercial driver’s license

         C.   The cigarettes, other tobacco products, or alternative nicotine
products were sold, given away or otherwise distributed to the card holder in
reasonable reliance upon the identification presented and the completed
transaction scan.
      (2)   In determining whether a seller or an agent or employee of a seller
has proven the affirmative defense provided by division (c)(1) of this section,
the trier of fact in the action for the alleged violation of division (a) of
this section shall consider any written policy that the seller has adopted and
implemented and that is intended to prevent violations of division (a) of this
section. For purposes of division (c)(1)C. of this section, the trier of fact
shall consider that reasonable reliance upon the identification presented and
the completed transaction scan may require a seller or an agent or employee of
a seller to exercise reasonable diligence to determine, and that the use of a
transaction scan device does not excuse a seller or an agent or employee of a
seller from exercising reasonable diligence to determine, the following:
         A.   Whether a person to whom the seller or agent or employee of a
seller sells, gives away or otherwise distributes cigarettes, other tobacco
products, or alternative nicotine products is 21 years of age or older;

Deputy Registrar who issued an identification card under Ohio R.C. §§ 4507.50
to 4507.52 shall be permitted to submit certified copies of the records of that
issuance in lieu of the testimony of the personnel of or contractors with the
Bureau of Motor Vehicles in the action.

§ 698.01  DEFINITIONS.
   For the purpose of this chapter, the following definitions shall apply
unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning.
   DANGEROUS OFFENDER means a person who has committed an offense, whose

be a danger to others, and whose conduct has been characterized by a pattern of
repetitive, compulsive or aggressive behavior with heedless indifference to the
consequences.
   REPEAT OFFENDER means a person who has a history of persistent criminal
activity and whose character and condition reveal a substantial risk that he or
she will commit another offense. It is prima-facie evidence that a person is a

defined in Ohio R.C. § 2901.01, and having been imprisoned pursuant to sentence
for one or more of those offenses, the person commits a subsequent offense of
violence;

(ORC § 2935.36(E))
§ 698.02  PENALTIES FOR MISDEMEANOR.
   (a)   Considerations in misdemeanor sentencing.
      (1)   A court that sentences an offender for a misdemeanor or minor
misdemeanor violation of any provision of the Ohio Revised Code, or of any
municipal ordinance that is substantially equivalent to a misdemeanor or minor
misdemeanor violation of a provision of the Ohio Revised Code, shall be guided
by the overriding purposes of misdemeanor sentencing. The overriding purposes
of misdemeanor sentencing are to protect the public from future crime by the
offender and others and to punish the offender. To achieve those purposes, the
sentencing court shall consider the impact of the offense upon the victim and
the need for changing the offender’s behavior, rehabilitating the defender, and
making restitution to the victim of the offense, the public, or the victim and
the public.
      (2)   A sentence imposed for a misdemeanor or minor misdemeanor violation
of an Ohio Revised Code provision or for a violation of a municipal ordinance
that is subject to division (a)(1) of this section shall be reasonably
calculated to achieve the two overriding purposes of misdemeanor sentencing set
forth in division (a)(1) of this section, commensurate with and not demeaning
to the seriousness of the offender’s conduct and its impact upon the victim,
and consistent with sentences imposed for similar offenses committed by similar
offenders.
      (3)   A court that imposes a sentence upon an offender for a misdemeanor
or minor misdemeanor violation of an Ohio Revised Code provision or for a
violation of a municipal ordinance that is subject to division (a)(1) of this
section shall not base the sentence upon the race, ethnic background, gender,
or religion of the offender.
      (4)   Divisions (a)(1) and (a)(2) of this section shall not apply to any
offense that is disposed of by a traffic violations bureau of any court
pursuant to Traffic Rule 13 and shall not apply to any violation of any
provision of the Ohio Revised Code that is a minor misdemeanor and that is
disposed of without a court appearance. Divisions (a)(1) to (a)(3) of this
section do not affect any penalties established by the municipality for a
violation of its ordinances that are not substantially equivalent to a
misdemeanor or minor misdemeanor violation of a provision of the Ohio Revised
Code.
(ORC 2929.21)
   (b)   Misdemeanor jail terms.
      (1)   Except as provided in §
666.99 or
698.03 of this Code or Ohio R.C. 2929.22 or 2929.23 or division (b)(5) or (b)
(6) of this section and unless another term is required or authorized pursuant
to law, if the sentencing court imposing a sentence upon an offender for a
misdemeanor elects or is required to impose a jail term on the offender
pursuant to this chapter, the court shall impose a definite jail term that
shall be one of the following:
         A.   For a misdemeanor of the first degree, not more than 180 days;
         B.   For a misdemeanor of the second degree, not more than 90 days;
         C.   For a misdemeanor of the third degree, not more than 60 days;
         D.   For a misdemeanor of the fourth degree, not more than 30 days.
      (2)   A.   A court that sentences an offender to a jail term under
division (b) of this section may permit the offender to serve the sentence in
intermittent confinement or may authorize a limited release of the offender as
provided in division (d)(2) of this section. The court retains jurisdiction
over every offender sentenced to jail to modify the jail sentence imposed at
any time, but the court shall not reduce any mandatory jail term.
         B.   1.   If a prosecutor, as defined in Ohio R.C. § 2935.01, has
filed a notice with the court that the prosecutor wants to be notified about a
particular case and if the court is considering modifying the jail sentence of
the offender in that case, the court shall notify the prosecutor that the court
is considering modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case. The
prosecutor may request a hearing regarding the court’s consideration of
modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case, and, if the
prosecutor requests a hearing, the court shall notify the eligible offender of
the hearing.
            2.   If the prosecutor requests a hearing regarding the court’s
consideration of modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case, the
court shall hold the hearing before considering whether or not to release the
offender from the offender’s jail sentence.
      (3)   If a court sentences an offender to a jail term under division (b)
of this section and the court assigns the offender to a county jail that has
established a County Jail Industry Program pursuant to Ohio R.C. 5147.30, the
court shall specify, as part of the sentence, whether the offender may be
considered for participation in the program. During the offender’s term in the
county jail, the court retains jurisdiction to modify its specification
regarding the offender’s participation in the County Jail Industry Program.
      (4)   If a person sentenced to a jail term pursuant to division (b) of
this section, the court may impose as part of the sentence pursuant to Ohio
R.C. § 2929.28 a reimbursement sanction, and, if the local detention facility
in which the term is to be served is covered by a policy adopted pursuant to
Ohio R.C. § 307.93, 341.14, 341.19, 341.21, 341.23, 753.02, 753.04, 753.16,
2301.56, or 2947.19 and Ohio R.C. § 2929.37, both of the following apply:
         A.   The court shall specify both of the following as part of the
sentence:
            1.   If the person is presented with an itemized bill pursuant to
Ohio R.C. § 2929.37 for payment of the costs of confinement, the person is
required to pay the bill in accordance with that section.
            2.   If the person does not dispute the bill described in division
(b)(4)A.1. of this section and does not pay the bill by the times specified in
Ohio R.C. § 2929.37, the Clerk of the Court may issue a certificate of judgment
against the person as described in that section.
         B.   The sentence automatically includes any certificate of judgment
issued as described in division (b)(4)A.2. of this section.
      (5)   If an offender who is convicted of or pleads guilty to a violation
of Ohio R.C. § 4511.19(B), or any substantially equivalent municipal ordinance,
also is convicted of or also pleads guilty to a specification of the type
described in Ohio R.C. § 2941.1414 and if the court imposes a jail term on the
offender for the underlying offense, the court shall impose upon the offender
an additional definite jail term of not more than six months. The additional
jail term shall not be reduced pursuant to any provision of the Ohio Revised
Code. The offender shall serve the additional jail term consecutively to and
prior to the jail term imposed for the underlying offense and consecutively to
any other mandatory term imposed in relation to the offense.
      (6)   A.   If an offender is convicted of or pleads guilty to a
misdemeanor violation of Ohio R.C. § 2907.23, 2907.24, 2907.241, or 2907.25, or
any substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, and to a specification of the
type described in Ohio R.C. § 2941.1421 and if the court imposes a jail term on
the offender for the misdemeanor violation, the court may impose upon the
offender an additional definite jail term as follows:
            1.   Subject to division (b)(6)A.2. of this section, an additional
definite jail term of not more than 60 days;
            2.   If the offender previously has been convicted of or pleaded
guilty to one or more misdemeanor or felony violations of Ohio R.C. § 2907.22,
2907.23, 2907.24, 2907.241, or 2907.25, or any substantially equivalent
municipal ordinance, and also was convicted of or pleaded guilty to a
specification of the type described in Ohio R.C. § 2941.1421 regarding one or
more of those violations, an additional definite jail term of not more than 120
days.
         B.   In lieu of imposing an additional definite jail term under
division (b)(6)A. of this section, the court may directly impose on the
offender a sanction that requires the offender to wear a real-time processing,
continual tracking electronic monitoring device during the period of time
specified by the court. The period of time specified by the court shall equal
the duration of an additional jail term that the court could have imposed upon
the offender under division (b)(6)A. of this section. A sanction imposed under
this division shall commence on the date specified by the court, provided that
the sanction shall not commence until after the offender has served the jail
term imposed for the misdemeanor violation of Ohio R.C. § 2907.23, 2907.24,
2907.241, or 2907.25, or any substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, and
any residential sanction imposed for the violation under division (d) of this
section or Ohio R.C. § 2929.26. A sanction imposed under this division shall be
considered to be a community control sanction for purposes of division (c) or
this section or Ohio R.C. § 2929.25, and all provisions of this Code and the
Ohio Revised Code that pertain to community control sanctions shall apply to a
sanction imposed under this division, except to the extent that they would by
their nature be clearly inapplicable. The offender shall pay all costs
associated with a sanction imposed under this division, including the cost of
the use of the monitoring device.
      (7)   If an offender is convicted of or pleads guilty to a misdemeanor
violation of Ohio R.C. § 2903.13 and also is convicted of or pleads guilty to a
specification of the type described in Ohio R.C. § 2941.1423 that charges that
the victim of the violation was a woman whom the offender knew was pregnant at
the time of the violation, the court shall impose on the offender a mandatory
jail term that is a definite term of at least 30 days.
      (8)   If a court sentences an offender to a jail term under this division
(b), the sentencing court retains jurisdiction over the offender and the jail
term. Upon motion of either party or upon the court’s own motion, the court, in
the court’s sole discretion and as the circumstances warrant, may substitute
one or more community control sanctions under division (d) or (e) of this
section for any jail days that are not mandatory jail days.
(ORC 2929.24)
   (c)   Misdemeanor community control sanctions.
      (1)   A.   Except as provided in §
666.99 and
698.03 of this Code or Ohio R.C. 2929.22 and 2929.23 or when a jail term is
required by law, in sentencing an offender for a misdemeanor, other than a
minor misdemeanor, the sentencing court may do either of the following:
            1.   Directly impose a sentence that consists of one or more
community control sanctions authorized by divisions (d), (e), or (f) of this
section. The court may impose any other conditions of release under a community
control sanction that the court considers appropriate. If the court imposes a
jail term upon the offender, the court may impose any community control
sanction or combination of community control sanctions in addition to the jail
term.
            2.   Impose a jail term under division (b) of this section from the
range of jail terms authorized under that division for the offense, suspend all
or a portion of the jail term imposed, and place the offender under a community
control sanction or combination of community control sanctions authorized under
divisions (d), (e), or (f) of this section.
         B.   The duration of all community control sanctions imposed upon an
offender and in effect for an offender at any time shall not exceed five years.
         C.   At sentencing, if a court directly imposes a community control
sanction or combination of community control sanctions pursuant to division (c)
(1)A.1. of this section, the court shall state the duration of the community
control sanctions imposed and shall notify the offender that if any of the
conditions of the community control sanctions are violated the court may do any
of the following:
            1.   Impose a longer time under the same community control sanction
if the total time under all of the offender’s community control sanctions does
not exceed the five-year limit specified in division (c)(1)B. of this section;
            2.   Impose a more restrictive community control sanction under
division (d), (e), or (f) of this section, but the court is not required to
impose any particular sanction or sanctions;
            3.   Impose a definite jail term from the range of jail terms
authorized for the offense under division (b) of this section.
      (2)   If a court sentences an offender to any community control sanction
or combination of community control sanctions pursuant to division (c)(1)A.1.
of this section, the sentencing court retains jurisdiction over the offender
and the period of community control for the duration of the period of community
control. Upon the motion of either party or on the court’s own motion, the
court, in the court’s sole discretion and as the circumstances warrant, may
modify the community control sanctions or conditions of release previously
imposed, substitute a community control sanction or condition of release for
another community control sanction or condition of release previously imposed,
or impose an additional community control sanction or condition of release.
      (3)   A.   If a court sentences an offender to any community control
sanction or combination of community control sanctions authorized under
division (d), (e), or (f) of this section, the court shall place the offender
under the general control and supervision of the court or of a department of
probation in the jurisdiction that serves the court for purposes of reporting
to the court a violation of any of the conditions of the sanctions imposed. If
the offender resides in another jurisdiction and a department of probation has
been established to serve the Municipal Court or County Court in that
jurisdiction, the sentencing court may request the Municipal Court or the
County Court to receive the offender into the general control and supervision
of that department of probation for purposes of reporting to the sentencing
court a violation of any of the conditions of the sanctions imposed. The
sentencing court retains jurisdiction over any offender whom it sentences for
the duration of the sanction or sanctions imposed.
         B.   The sentencing court shall require as a condition of any
community control sanction that the offender abide by the law and not leave the
state without the permission of the court or the offender’s probation officer.
In the interests of doing justice, rehabilitating the offender, and ensuring
the offender’s good behavior, the court may impose additional requirements on
the offender.  The offender’s compliance with the additional requirements also
shall be a condition of the community control sanction imposed upon the
offender.
      (4)   A.   If the court imposing sentence upon an offender sentences the
offender to any community control sanction or combination of community control
sanctions authorized under division (d), (e), or (f) of this section, and the
offender violates any of the conditions of the sanctions, the public or private
person or entity that supervises or administers the program or activity that
comprises the sanction shall report the violation directly to the sentencing
court or to the department of probation or probation officer with general
control and supervision over the offender. If the public or private person or
entity reports the violation to the department of probation or probation
officer, the department or officer shall report the violation to the sentencing
court.
         B.   If an offender violates any condition of a community control
sanction, the sentencing court may impose upon the violator one or more of the
following penalties:
            1.   A longer time under the same community control sanction if the
total time under all of the community control sanctions imposed on the violator
does not exceed the five-year limit specified in division (c)(1)B. of this
section;
            2.   A more restrictive community control sanction;
            3.   A   combination of community control sanctions, including a
jail term.
         C.   If an offender was acting pursuant to Ohio R.C. § 2925.11(B)(2)
(b), or any substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, and in so doing
violated the conditions of a community control sanction based on a minor drug
possession offense, as defined in Ohio R.C. § 2925.11, the sentencing court may
consider the offender’s conduct in seeking or obtaining medical assistance for
another in good faith or for self or may consider the offender being the
subject of another person seeking or obtaining medical assistance in accordance
with that division as a mitigating factor before imposing any of the penalties
described in division (c)(4)B. of this section.
         D.   If the court imposes a jail term upon a violator pursuant to
division (c)(4)B. of this section, the total time spent in jail for the
misdemeanor offense and the violation of a condition of the community control
sanction shall not exceed the maximum jail term available for the offense for
which the sanction that was violated was imposed. The court may reduce the
longer period of time that the violator is required to spend under the longer
sanction or the more restrictive sanction imposed under division (c)(4)B. of
this section by all or part of the time the violator successfully spent under
the sanction that was initially imposed.
      (5)   Except as otherwise provided in this division, if an offender, for
a significant period of time, fulfills the conditions of a community control
sanction imposed pursuant to division (d), (e), or (f) of this section in an
exemplary manner, the court may reduce the period of time under the community
control sanction or impose a less restrictive community control sanction.
Fulfilling the conditions of a community control sanction does not relieve the
offender of a duty to make restitution under division (f) of this section.
(ORC 2929.25)
   (d)   Community residential sanction.
      (1)   Except when a mandatory jail term is required by law, the court

misdemeanor offenders;
         B.   If the offender is an eligible offender, as defined in Ohio R.C.
§ 307.932, a term in a community alternative sentencing center or district
community alternative sentencing center established and operated in accordance
with that section, in the circumstances specified in that section, with one of
the conditions of the sanction being that the offender successfully complete
the portion of the sentence to be served in the center.
      (2)   A sentence to a community residential sanction under division (d)
(1)B. of this section shall be in accordance with Ohio R.C. § 307.932. In all
other cases, the court that sentences an offender to a community residential
sanction under this division (d) may do either or both of the following:
         A.   Permit the offender to serve the offender’s sentence in
intermittent confinement, overnight, on weekends or at any other time or times
that will allow the offender to continue at the offender’ occupation or care
for the offender’ family;
         B.   Authorize the offender to be released so that the offender may
seek or maintain employment, receive education or training, receive treatment,
perform community service, or otherwise fulfill an obligation imposed by law or
by the court. A release pursuant to this division shall be only for the
duration of time that is needed to fulfill the purpose of the release and for
travel that reasonably is necessary to fulfill the purposes of release.
      (3)   The court may order that a reasonable portion of the income earned
by the offender upon a release pursuant to division (d)(2) of this section be
applied to any financial sanction imposed under division (f) of this section.
      (4)   No court shall sentence any person to a prison term for a
misdemeanor or minor misdemeanor, or to a jail term for a minor misdemeanor.
      (5)   If a court sentences a person who has been convicted of or pleaded
guilty to a misdemeanor to a community residential sanction as described in
division (d)(1) of this section, at the time of reception and at other times
the person in charge of the operation of the halfway house, community
alternative sentencing center, district community alternative sentencing
center, or other place at which the offender will serve the residential
sanction determines to be appropriate, the person in charge of the operation of
the halfway house, community alternative sentencing center, district community
alternative sentencing center, or other place may cause the convicted offender
to be examined and tested for tuberculosis, HIV infection, hepatitis, including
but not limited to hepatitis A, B and C, and other contagious diseases. The
person in charge of the operation of the halfway house, community alternative
sentencing center, district community alternative sentencing center, or other
place at which the offender will serve the residential sanction may cause a
convicted offender in the halfway house, community alternative sentencing
center, district community alternative sentencing center, or other place who
refuses to be tested or treated for tuberculosis, HIV infection, hepatitis,
including but not limited to hepatitis A, B and C, or another contagious
disease to be tested and treated involuntarily.
      (6)   The municipality may enter into a contract with a halfway house for

         I.   A curfew term;
         J.   A requirement that the offender obtain employment;
         K.   A requirement that the offender obtain education or training;
         L.   Provided the court obtains the prior approval of the victim, a

municipal ordinance involving a person who was a family or household member at
the time of the violation, if the offender committed the offense in the
vicinity of one or more children who are not victims of the offense, and if the
offender or the victim of the offense is a parent, guardian, custodian, or
person in loco parentis of one or more of those children. This division does
not limit the court in requiring that the offender obtain counseling for any
offense or in any circumstance not specified in this division.
      (2)   If the court imposes a term of community service pursuant to
division (e)(1)C. of this section, the offender may request that the court
modify the sentence to authorize the offender to make a reasonable
contribution, as determined by the court, to the general fund of the county,
municipality, or other local entity that provides funding to the court. The
court may grant the request if the offender demonstrates a change in
circumstances from the date the court imposes the sentence or that the
modification would otherwise be in the interests of justice. If the court
grants the request, the offender shall make a reasonable contribution to the
court, and the clerk of the court shall deposit that contribution into the
general fund of the county, municipality, or other local entity that provides
funding to the court. If more than one entity provides funding to the court,
the clerk shall deposit a percentage of the reasonable contribution equal to
the percentage of funding the entity provides to the court in that entity’s
general fund.
      (3)   In addition to the sanctions authorized under division (e)(1) of
this section, the court imposing a sentence for a misdemeanor, other than a
minor misdemeanor, upon an offender who is not required to serve a mandatory
jail term may impose  any other sanction that is intended to discourage the
offender or other persons from committing a similar offense if the sanction is
reasonably related to the overriding purposes and principles of misdemeanor
sentencing.
      (4)   The court imposing a sentence for a minor misdemeanor may impose a
term of community service in lieu of all or part of a fine. The term of
community service imposed for a minor misdemeanor shall not exceed 30 hours.

(ORC 2929.27)
   (f)   Financial sanctions.
      (1)   In addition to imposing court costs pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2947.23,
the court imposing a sentence upon an offender for a misdemeanor, including a
minor misdemeanor, may sentence the offender to any financial sanction or
combination of financial sanctions authorized under this division (f). If the
court in its discretion imposes one or more financial sanctions, the financial
sanctions that may be imposed pursuant to this section include, but are not
limited to, the following:
         A.   Restitution.
            1.   Unless the misdemeanor offense is a minor misdemeanor or could
be disposed of by the Traffic Violations Bureau serving the court under Traffic
Rule 13, restitution by the offender to the victim of the offender’s crime or
any survivor of the victim, in an amount based upon the victim’s economic loss.
The court may not impose restitution as a sanction pursuant to this division if
the offense is a minor misdemeanor or could be disposed of by the Traffic
Violations Bureau serving the court under Traffic Rule 13. If the court
requires restitution, the court shall order that the restitution be made to the
victim in open court or to the adult probation department that serves the
jurisdiction or the clerk of the court on behalf of the victim.
            2.   If the court imposes restitution, the court shall determine
the amount of restitution to be paid by the offender. If the court imposes
restitution, the court may base the amount of restitution it orders on an
amount recommended by the victim, the offender, a presentence investigation
report, estimates or receipts indicating the cost of repairing or replacing
property, and other information, provided that the amount the court orders as
restitution shall not exceed the amount of economic loss suffered by the victim
as a direct and proximate result of the commission of the offense. If the court
decides to impose restitution, the court shall hold an evidentiary hearing on
restitution if the offender, victim, or survivor disputes the amount of
restitution. If the court holds an evidentiary hearing, at the hearing the
victim or survivor has the burden to prove by a preponderance of the evidence
the amount of restitution sought from the offender.
            3.   All restitution payments shall be credited against any
recovery of economic loss in a civil action brought by the victim or any
survivor of the victim against the offender. No person may introduce evidence
of an award of restitution under this section in a civil action for purposes of
imposing liability against an insurer under Ohio R.C. § 3937.18.
            4.   If the court imposes restitution, the court may order that the
offender pay a surcharge, of not more than five percent of the amount of the
restitution otherwise ordered, to the entity responsible for collecting and
processing restitution payments.
            5.   The victim or survivor of the victim may request that the
prosecutor in the case file a motion, or the offender may file a motion, for
modification of the payment terms of any restitution ordered. If the court
grants the motion, it may modify the payment terms as it determines
appropriate.
         B.   Fines.  A fine of the type described in divisions (f)(1)B.1. and
2. of this section payable to the appropriate entity as required by law:
            1.   A fine in the following amount:
               a.   For a misdemeanor of the first degree, not more than
$1,000;
               b.   For a misdemeanor of the second degree, not more than $750;
               c.   For a misdemeanor of the third degree, not more than $500;
               d.   For a misdemeanor of the fourth degree, not more than $250;

control sanction, including a supervision fee under Ohio R.C. § 2951.021;
               b.   All or part of the costs of confinement in a jail or other
residential facility, including, but not limited to, a per diem fee for room
and board, the costs of medical and dental treatment, and the costs of
repairing property damaged by the offender while confined;
               c.   All or part of the cost of purchasing and using an
immobilizing or disabling device, including a certified ignition interlock
device, or a remote alcohol monitoring device that a court orders an offender
to use under Ohio R.C. 4510.13.
            2.   The amount of reimbursement under division (f)(1)C.1. of this
section shall not exceed the total amount of reimbursement the offender is able
to pay and shall not exceed the actual cost of the sanctions. The court may
collect any amount of reimbursement the offender is required to pay under that
division. If the court does not order reimbursement under that division,
confinement costs may be assessed pursuant to a repayment policy adopted under
Ohio R.C. 2929.37. In addition, the offender may be required to pay the fees
specified in Ohio R.C. 2929.38 in accordance with that section.
      (2)   A.   If the court determines a hearing is necessary, the court may
hold a hearing to determine whether the offender is able to pay the financial
sanction imposed pursuant to this division (f) or court costs or is likely in
the future to be able to pay the sanction or costs.
         B.   If the court determines that the offender is indigent and unable
to pay the financial sanction or court costs, the court shall consider imposing
and may impose a term of community service under division (e)(1) of this
section in lieu of imposing a financial sanction or court costs. If the court
does not determine that the offender is indigent, the court may impose a term
of community service under division (e)(1) of this section in lieu of or in
addition to imposing a financial sanction under this division (f) and in
addition to imposing court costs. The court may order community service for a
minor misdemeanor pursuant to division (e)(4) of this section in lieu of or in
addition to imposing a financial sanction under this section and in addition to
imposing court costs. If a person fails to pay a financial sanction or court
costs, the court may order community service in lieu of the financial sanction
or court costs.
      (3)   A.   The offender shall pay reimbursements imposed upon the
offender pursuant to division (f)(1)C. of this section to pay the costs
incurred by a county pursuant to any sanction imposed under division (d), (e),
or (f) of this section or in operating a facility used to confine offenders
pursuant to a sanction imposed under division (d) of this section to the County
Treasurer. The County Treasurer shall deposit the reimbursements in the
county’s general fund. The county shall use the amounts deposited in the fund
to pay the costs incurred by the county pursuant to any sanction imposed under
division (d), (e), or (f) of this section or in operating a facility used to
confine offenders pursuant to a sanction imposed under division (d) of this
section.
         B.   The offender shall pay reimbursements imposed upon the offender

municipal corporation pursuant to any sanction imposed under division  (d),
(e), or (f) of this section or in operating a facility used to confine
offenders pursuant to a sanction imposed under division (d) of this section to
the Treasurer of the municipal corporation. The Treasurer shall deposit the
reimbursements in the municipal corporation’s general fund. The municipal
corporation shall use the amounts deposited in the fund to pay the costs
incurred by the municipal corporation pursuant to any sanction imposed under
division (d), (e), or (f) of this section or in operating a facility used to
confine offenders pursuant to a sanction imposed under division (d) of this
section.
         C.   The offender shall pay reimbursements imposed pursuant to
division (f)(1)C. of this section for the costs incurred by a private provider
pursuant to a sanction imposed under division (d), (e), or (f) of this section
to the provider.
      (4)   In addition to any other fine that is or may be imposed under this
division (f), the court imposing sentence upon an offender for misdemeanor
domestic violence or menacing by stalking may impose a fine of not less than
$70 nor more than $500, which shall be transmitted to the Treasurer of Ohio to
be credited to the address confidentiality program fund created by Ohio R.C. §
111.48.
      (5)   A.   Except as otherwise provided in this division (f)(5), a
financial sanction imposed under division (f)(1) of this section is a judgment
in favor of the state or the political subdivision that operates the court that
imposed the financial sanction, and the offender subject to the financial
sanction is the judgment debtor. A financial sanction of reimbursement imposed
pursuant to division (f)(1)C.1.a. of this section upon an offender is a
judgment in favor of the entity administering the community control sanction,
and the offender subject to the financial sanction is the judgment debtor.  A
financial sanction of reimbursement imposed pursuant to division (f)(1)C.1.b.
of this section upon an offender confined in a jail or other residential
facility is a judgment in favor of the entity operating the jail or other
residential facility, and the offender subject to the financial sanction is the
judgment debtor. A financial sanction of restitution imposed pursuant to
division (f)(1)A. of this section is an order in favor of the victim of the
offender’s criminal act that can be collected through execution a certificate
of judgment as described in division (f)(5)B.1. of this section, through as
described in division (f)(5)B.2. of this section or through an order as
described in division (f)(5)B.3. of this section and the offender shall be
considered for purposes of the collection as a judgment debtor.
         B.   Once a financial sanction is imposed as a judgment or order under
this division, the victim, private provider, state, or political subdivision
may bring an action to do any of the following:
            1.   Obtain from the Clerk of the court in which the judgment was
entered a certificate of judgment that shall be in the same manner and form as
a certificate of judgment issued in a civil action;
            2.   Obtain execution of the judgment or order through any
available procedure, including any of the procedures identified in Ohio R.C. §
2929.18(D)(1) and (D)(2) or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance.
            3.   Obtain an order for the assignment of wages of the judgment
debtor under Ohio R.C. § 1321.33 or a substantially equivalent municipal
ordinance.
      (6)   The civil remedies authorized under division (f)(4) of this section
for the collection of the financial sanction supplement, but do not preclude,
enforcement of the criminal sentence.
      (7)   Each court imposing a financial sanction upon an offender under
this division (f) may designate the Clerk of the Court or another person to
collect the financial sanction. The Clerk, or another person authorized by law
or the court to collect the financial sanction may do the following:
         A.   Enter into contracts with one or more public agencies or private
vendors for the collection of amounts due under the sanction. Before entering
into a contract for the collection of amounts due from an offender pursuant to
any financial sanction imposed pursuant to this division (f), a court shall
comply with Ohio R.C. §§ 307.86 to 307.92.
         B.   Permit payment of all or any portion of the sanction in
installments, by financial transaction device if the court is a County Court or
a Municipal Court operated by a county, or by any other reasonable method, in
any time, and on any terms that the court considers just, except that the
maximum time permitted for payment shall not exceed five years. If the court is
a County Court or a Municipal Court operated by a county, the acceptance  of
payments by any financial transaction device shall be governed by the policy
adopted by the Board of County Commissioners of the county pursuant to Ohio
R.C. § 301.28. If the court is a Municipal Court not operated by a county, the
Clerk may pay any fee associated with processing an electronic transfer out of
public money or may charge the fee to the offender.
         C.   To defray administrative costs, charge a reasonable fee to an
offender who elects a payment plan rather than a lump sum payment of any
financial sanction.

preclude a victim from bringing a civil action against the offender.

§ 698.03  IMPOSING SENTENCE FOR MISDEMEANOR.
   (a)   (1)   Unless a mandatory jail term is required to be imposed by Ohio
R.C. 1547.99(G), 4510.14(B), or 4511.19(G), or any other provision of the
Revised Code, or any municipal ordinance, a court that imposes a sentence under
this chapter upon an offender for a misdemeanor or minor misdemeanor has
discretion to determine the most effective way to achieve the purposes and
principles of sentencing set forth in §
698.02.
      (2)   Unless a specific sanction is required to be imposed or is
precluded from being imposed by the section setting forth an offense or the
penalty for an offense or by any provision of §§
666.99 or
698.02 of this Code or Ohio R.C. 2929.23 to 2929.28, a court that imposes a
sentence upon an offender for a misdemeanor may impose on the offender any
sanction or combination of sanctions under §
698.02(b) to (f). The court shall not impose a sentence that imposes an
unnecessary burden on local government resources.
   (b)   (1)   In determining the appropriate sentence for a misdemeanor, the
court shall consider all of the following factors:
         A.   The nature and circumstances of the offense or offenses;
         B.   Whether the circumstances regarding the offender and the offense
or offenses indicate that the offender has a history of persistent criminal
activity and that the offender’s character and condition reveal a substantial
risk that the offender will commit another offense;
         C.   Whether the circumstances regarding the offender and the offense
or offenses indicate that the offender’s history, character, and condition
reveal a substantial risk that the offender will be a danger to others and that
the offender’s conduct has been characterized by a pattern of repetitive,
compulsive, or aggressive behavior with heedless indifference to the
consequences;
         D.   Whether the victim’s youth, age, disability, or other factor made
the victim particularly vulnerable to the offense or made the impact of the
offense more serious;
         E.   Whether the offender is likely to commit future crimes in
general, in addition to the circumstances described in divisions (b)(1)B. and
C. of this section;
         F.   Whether the offender has an emotional, mental, or physical
condition that is traceable to the offender’s service in the armed forces of
the United States and that was a contributing factor in the offender’s
commission of the offense or offenses;
         G.   The offender’s military service record.
      (2)   In determining the appropriate sentence for a misdemeanor, in
addition to complying with division (b)(1) of this section, the court may
consider any other factors that are relevant to achieving the purposes and
principles of sentencing set forth in §
698.02(a).
   (c)   Before imposing a jail term as a sentence for a misdemeanor, a court
shall consider the appropriateness of imposing a community control sanction or
a combination of community control sanctions under §
698.02(c), (d), (e), and (f). A court may impose the longest jail term
authorized under §
698.02(b) only upon offenders who commit the worst forms of the offense or upon
offenders whose conduct and response to prior sanctions for prior offenses
demonstrate that the imposition of the longest jail term is necessary to deter
the offender from committing a future crime.
   (d)   (1)   A sentencing court shall consider any relevant oral or written
statement made by the victim, the defendant, the defense attorney, or the
prosecuting authority regarding sentencing for a misdemeanor. This division
does not create any rights to notice other than those rights authorized by Ohio
R.C. Chapter 2930.
      (2)   At the time of sentencing for a misdemeanor or as soon as possible
after sentencing, the court shall notify the victim of the offense of the
victim’s right to file an application for an award of reparations pursuant to
Ohio R.C. 2743.51 to 2743.72.

      (1)   For a misdemeanor of the first degree, not more than $5,000;
      (2)   For a misdemeanor of the second degree, not more than $4,000;

$2,000;
      (7)   For a minor misdemeanor not specifically classified, not more than
$1,000.
   (b)   When an organization is convicted of an offense not specifically
classified, and the section defining the offense or penalty plainly indicates a
purpose to impose the penalty provided for violation upon organizations, then
such penalty shall be imposed in lieu of the penalty provided in this section.
   (c)   When an organization is convicted of an offense not specifically
classified, and the penalty provided includes a higher fine than that provided
in this section, then the penalty imposed shall be pursuant to the penalty
provided for violation of the section defining the offense.
   (d)   This section does not prevent the imposition of available civil
sanctions against an organization convicted of an offense pursuant to §
606.09, either in addition to or in lieu of a fine imposed pursuant to this
section.

§ 698.05  MULTIPLE SENTENCES.
   (a)   Except as provided in division (b) of this section, Ohio R.C. §
2929.14(C), or Ohio R.C. § 2971.03(D) or (E), a prison term, jail term, or
sentence of imprisonment shall be served concurrently with any other prison
term, jail term, or sentence of imprisonment imposed by a court of this
municipality, the state, another state, or the United States.  Except as
provided in division (b)(2) of this section, a jail term or sentence of
imprisonment for misdemeanor shall be served concurrently with a prison term or
sentence of imprisonment for felony served in a state or federal correctional
institution.
   (b)   (1)   A jail term or sentence of imprisonment for a misdemeanor shall
be served consecutively to any other prison term, jail term, or sentence of
imprisonment when the trial court specifies that it is to be served
consecutively or when it is imposed for a misdemeanor violation of Ohio R.C.
2907.322, 2921.34 or 2923.131.  When consecutive sentences are imposed for
misdemeanors under this division, the term to be served is the aggregate of the
consecutive terms imposed, except that the aggregate term to be served shall
not exceed 18 months.
      (2)   A jail term or sentence of imprisonment imposed for a misdemeanor
violation of Ohio R.C. 4510.14, 4510.16, 4510.21, or 4511.19, or a
substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, shall be served consecutively to
a prison term that is imposed for a felony violation of Ohio R.C. 2903.06,
2903.07, 2903.08 or 4511.19 or a felony violation of Ohio R.C. 2903.04
involving the operation of a motor vehicle by the offender and that is served
in a state correctional institution when the trial court specifies that it is
to be served consecutively. When consecutive jail terms or sentences of
imprisonment and prison terms are imposed for one or more misdemeanors and one
or more felonies under this division, the term to be served is the aggregate of
the consecutive terms imposed, and the offender shall serve all terms imposed
for a felony before serving any term imposed for a misdemeanor.

   Except as otherwise provided in Ohio R.C. 4510.07 or in any other provision
of the Revised Code, whenever an offender is convicted of or pleads guilty to a
violation of any provision of this Code of Ordinances that is substantially
equivalent to a provision of the Revised Code, and a court is permitted or
required to suspend a person’s driver’s or commercial driver’s license or
permit for a violation of that provision, a court, in addition to any other
penalties authorized by law, may suspend the offender’s driver’s or commercial
driver’s license or permit or nonresident operating privileges for the period
of time the court determines appropriate, but the period of suspension imposed
for the violation of the provision of this Code of Ordinances shall not exceed
the period of suspension that is permitted or required to be imposed for the
violation of the provision of the Revised Code to which the provision of this
Code of Ordinances is substantially equivalent.

844.99   Penalty
§ 844.01  PURPOSE.
   The United States Supreme Court has recognized that door-to-door canvassers,
"whether selling pots or distributing leaflets, may lessen the peaceful
enjoyment of a home," and that "burglars frequently pose as canvassers, either
in order that they may have a pretense to discover whether a house is empty and
hence ripe for burglary, or for the purpose of spying out the premises in order
that they may return later." Martin v. City of Struthers, 319 U.S. 141,144
(1943). These problems continue to be associated with door-to-door, as are even
graver ones. Therefore, the  public purpose of this Chapter is to vigorously
protect the First Amendment right of free speech and its accompanying promise
of anonymity for the door-to-door canvassers, while prudently balancing that
right with the government's equally important role in preventing fraud,
minimizing crime, protecting the personal security of its citizens, and above
all, facilitating every citizen's personal right to privacy.
(Ord. 2008-49, passed 9-16-2008)
§ 844.02  DEFINITIONS.
   For the purpose of this chapter, the following definitions shall apply
unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning.
   CANVASSER.  Any individual who enters upon private property without
invitation or permission for the purposes of door-to-door canvassing as defined
above.
   CHARITABLE/RELIGIOUS/POLITICAL SOLICITATION. Door-to-door canvassing by any
person, the primary purpose of which is to solicit funds or sell goods for the
benefit of charitable or not-for-profit organizations, or for the purpose of
providing information, either written or oral, to the occupants of the dwelling
about candidates for public office, political issues, or religious or church
related matters.
   COMMERCIAL SOLICITATION. The act of door-to-door canvassing for the purpose
of soliciting orders for or making sales of goods, wares, merchandise, or
service, or seeking donations or raising funds for any cause or organization
for profit without prior appointment or permission of the occupant or occupants
of such dwellings and which is not charitable/religious/political solicitation.
   DOOR-TO-DOOR CANVASSING.    Entering upon  private property and/or private
residences with the purpose of contacting the occupants thereof either face-to-
face, by depositing documents at the residence, or both, but without invitation
or permission to do so by the owners or occupants of such private property or
residences. This shall include but not be limited to such activities that are
for the purpose of advertising, promoting, selling, explaining and/or
proselytizing any product, service, organization or cause, or for the purpose
of surveying or poll-taking. DOOR-TO-DOOR CANVASSING shall include both
commercial solicitation and charitable/religious/political solicitation. It is
not the purpose of this chapter to regulate activities such as a mail carrier
or meter reader entering upon private property in performance of his or her
duties, or other similar persons where permission to enter property is implied
by the service rendered.

§ 881.01  DEFINITIONS.
   For purposes of this chapter the following words and phrases shall have the
following meanings ascribed to them respectively.
   HOTEL.  Every establishment kept, used, maintained, advertised or held out
to the public to be a place where sleeping accommodations are offered for a
consideration to guests, in which five or more rooms are used for the
accommodation of such guests, whether the rooms are in one or several
structures. The term shall include motel if the establishment meets the
definition of hotel as contained in this section.
   OCCUPANCY.  The use or possession, or the right to the use or possession of
any room or rooms or space or portion thereof, in any hotel for dwelling,
lodging or sleeping purposes. The use or possession or right to use or possess
any room or any suite of connecting rooms as office space, banquet or private
dining rooms, or exhibit, sample or display space shall not be considered
occupancy within the meaning of this definition unless the person exercising
occupancy uses or possesses, or has the right to use or possess all or any
portion of the room or suite of rooms for dwelling, lodging or sleeping
purposes.
   OPERATING.  The person who is proprietor of the hotel, whether in the
capacity of owner, lessee, mortgagee in possession, licensee, or any other
capacity. Where the OPERATOR performs his or her functions through a managing
agent or any type or character other than an employee, the managing agent shall
also be deemed an OPERATOR for the purposes of this chapter and shall have the
same duties and liabilities as his or her principal. Compliance with the
provisions of this chapter by either the principal or the managing agent shall,
however, be considered to be compliance by both.
   RENT.  The consideration received for occupancy valued in money, whether
received in money or otherwise, including all receipts, cash, credits and
property or services of any kind or nature, and also any amount for which the
occupant is liable for the occupancy without any deductions therefrom
whatsoever.
   TAX ADMINISTRATOR.  The Tax Administrator of the municipality so designated
and appointed by the Mayor with the approval of Council. In the absence of a
specific designation by the Mayor and Council, the Village Administrator shall
fill that role.

2018-10, passed 3-26-2018)
§ 881.02  RATE OF TAX.
   (a)   Commencing on January 1, 1999, for the purpose of providing revenue
for the purposes of general municipal operations, and capital improvements by
the village, there is levied a tax of three percent on all rents received by a
hotel for lodging furnished to transient guests. This tax shall be known as the
transient occupancy tax.
   (b)   This tax constitutes a debt owed by the transient guest to the
village, which is satisfied only by payment to the operator as trustee for the
village, or to the village. The transient guest shall pay the tax to the
operator of the hotel at the time the rent is paid. If the rent is paid in
installments, a proportionate share of the tax shall be paid with each
installment. The unpaid tax shall be due upon the transient guest’s ceasing to
occupy space in the hotel. If for any reason the tax due is not paid to the
operator of the hotel, the Tax Administrator may require that the tax be paid
directly to the village.

subdivisions;
      (3)   Upon rents of $2 a day or less.
   (b)   No exemption claimed under divisions (a)(1) or (2) of this section
shall be granted except upon a claim therefore made at the time rent is
collected and under penalty of perjury upon a form prescribed by or
satisfactory to the Tax Administrator. All claims of exemption under division
(a)(3) of this section shall be made in the manner prescribed by or
satisfactory to the Tax Administrator.
(Ord. 98-35, passed 9-15-1998; Am. Ord. 2018- 10, passed 3-26-2018)
§ 881.04  TAX TO BE SEPARATELY STATED AND CHARGED.
   (a)   The tax to be collected shall be stated and charged separately from
the rent and shown separately on any record thereof, at the time when the
occupancy is arranged or contracted and charged for, and upon every evidence of
occupancy or any bill or statement or charge made for the occupancy issued or
delivered by the operator. The tax shall be paid by the occupant to the
operator as trustee, and the operator shall be liable for the collection
thereof and for the tax.
   (b)   No operator of a hotel shall advertise or state in any manner, whether
directly or indirectly, that the tax or any part thereof will be assumed or
absorbed by the operator, or that it will not be added to the rent, or that, if
added, any part will be refunded except in the manner hereinafter provided.
(Ord. 98-35, passed 9-15-1998)

Occupancy Tax Ordinance by registering with the Tax Administrator for the
purpose of collecting from transient guests the Transient Occupancy Tax and
remitting such tax to the Tax Administrator. This certificate does not

§ 881.06  REPORTING AND REMITTING.
   (a)   Each operator shall, on or before the last day of the month following
the close of each calendar quarter, or at the close of any shorter reporting
period which may be established by the Tax Administrator, make return to the
Tax Administrator, on forms obtainable from him or her, of the total rents
charged and received and the amount of tax filed by occupants with the operator
during the reporting period shall be filed with the report. At the time the
return is filed, the full amount of the tax collected shall be remitted to the
Tax Administrator. The Tax Administrator may establish shorter reporting
periods for any certificate holder if he or she deems it necessary in order to
insure collection of the tax and he or she may require further information in
the return if the information is pertinent to the collection of the tax.
Returns and payments are due immediately upon cessation of business for any
reason. All taxes collected by operators pursuant to this chapter shall be held
in trust for the account of the village until payment thereof is made to the
Tax Administrator. All returns and payments submitted by each operator shall be
treated as confidential by the Tax Administrator and shall not be released
except upon order of a court of competent jurisdiction or to an officer or
agent of the United States, the State of Ohio, the County of Hamilton, or the
Village of Lockland for official use only. The nonavailability or failure to
obtain forms shall not relieve an operator from the timely payment of tax.
   (b)   No person, including any officer of a corporation or employee of a
corporation having control or supervision of or charged with the responsibility
of filing returns, shall fail to file any return or report required to be filed
by this chapter, or statement, or aid or abet another in the filing of any
false or fraudulent return, report or statement.
   (c)   If any operator required to file quarterly returns under this chapter
fails, on two consecutive quarters within a 12 month period, to file the
returns when due or to pay the tax thereon, or if any operator authorized by
the Tax Administrator to file returns at less frequent intervals, fails on two
or more occasions within a 24 month period, to file the returns when due to pay
the tax due thereon, the Tax Administrator may require the operator to furnish
security in an amount equal to the average tax liability of the operator for a
period of one year, as determined by the Tax Administrator from a review of
returns or other information pertaining to the operator, which amount shall in
no event be less than $100.  This security may be in the form of an advance tax
payment to be applied to pay the tax due on subsequent returns, or a corporate
surety bond, satisfactory to the Tax Administrator conditioned upon payment of
the tax due with the returns from the operator. This security must be filed
within ten days following the operator’s receipt of the notice from the Tax
Administrator of its requirements. A corporate surety bond filed under this
section shall be returned to the operator if; for a period of 12 months
following the date the bond was filed, the operator has filed all returns and
remitted payment therewith within the time prescribed in this chapter.
   (d)   If any operator required to file returns and to remit tax due to the
village under the provisions of this chapter, fails for any reason to make the
filing or payment, any of its officers or employees having control or
supervision of or charged with the responsibility of filing returns and making
payments, shall be personally liable for the failure. The dissolution of a
corporation shall not discharge an officer or employee’s liability for a prior
failure of the corporation to file returns or remit tax due. The sum due for
this liability may be collected by assessment in the manner provided in this
chapter.

   (a)   Original delinquency.  Any operator who fails to remit any tax imposed
by this chapter within the time required shall pay a penalty equal to ten
percent of the amount of the tax, in addition to the tax.
   (b)   Continued delinquency.  Any operator who fails to remit any delinquent
remittance on or before a period of 30 days following the date on which the
remittance first became delinquent shall pay a second delinquency penalty equal
to ten percent of the amount of the tax and previous penalty in addition to the
tax and the ten percent penalty first imposed. An additional penalty equal to
ten percent of the total tax and penalty of the previous 30 day period shall be
added for each successive 30 day period that the account remains delinquent.
   (c)   Fraud.  If the Tax Administrator determined that the nonpayment of any
remittance due under this chapter is due to fraud, a penalty equal to 25
percent of the amount of the tax shall be added thereto in addition to the
penalties stated in divisions (a) and (b) of this section.
   (d)   Interest.  In addition to the penalties imposed, any operator who

until paid.

§ 881.08  FAILURE TO COLLECT AND REPORT TAX, DETERMINATION OF TAX BY TAX
ADMINISTRATOR.
   (a)   If any operator shall fail or refuse to collect the tax and fail to
make, within the time provided in this chapter, any report and remittance of
the tax or any portion thereof required by this chapter, the Tax Administrator
shall proceed in such manner as he or she may deem best to obtain facts and
information on which to base the estimate of the tax due. As soon as the Tax
Administrator procures whatever facts and information that he or she is able to
obtain upon which to base the assessment of any tax imposed by this chapter and
payable by any operator who has failed or refused to collect the same and to
make such report and remittance, he or she shall proceed to determine and
assess against the operator the tax, interest and penalties provided for by
this chapter. In case this determination is made, the Tax Administrator shall
give a notice of the amount so assessed by serving it personally or by
depositing it in the United States mail, postage prepaid, addressed to the
operator so assessed at his or her last known address.
   (b)   The operator may within 30 days after the personal serving or mailing
of the notice make application in writing to the Tax Administrator for a
hearing on the amount assessed. If application by the operator for a hearing is
not made within the time prescribed, the tax, interest and penalties, if any,
determined by the Tax Administrator shall become final and conclusive and
immediately due and payable.
   (c)   If the application is made, the Tax Administrator shall give notice to
the operator to show cause at a time and place fixed in the notice why the
amount specified therein should not be fixed for such tax, interest and
penalties.
   (d)   At the hearing, the operator may appear and offer evidence why the
specified tax, interest and penalties should not be so fixed.
   (e)   After the hearing, the Tax Administrator shall determine the proper
tax to be remitted and shall thereafter give written notice to the person of
the determination and the amount of the tax, interest and penalty. The amount
determined to be due shall be payable after 30 days unless an appeal is taken
as provided in §
881.09. Subject to the policies laid down by the Board of Review, the Tax
Administrator shall have the power to compromise any assessment of interest and
penalties.

   (a)   A Board of Review, consisting of the Solicitor, the Village Clerk-
Treasurer and a resident of the municipality to be appointed by the Mayor, is
hereby established.
   (b)   A majority of the members of the Board shall constitute a quorum. The
Board shall adopt its own procedural rules and shall keep a record of its
transactions. All hearings by the Board shall be conducted privately unless the
taxpayer requests a public hearing. The provisions of §
881.06(a), with reference to the confidential character of information required
to be disclosed by this chapter, shall apply to such matters as may be heard
before the Board on appeal, but shall not apply in cases where the taxpayer has
requested a public hearing.
   (c)   Any person dissatisfied with any ruling or decision by the Tax
Administrator which is made under the authority conferred by this chapter may
appeal therefrom to the Board of Review within 30 days from the announcement of
such ruling or decision by the Tax Administrator. The Board shall, on hearing,
have the authority to affirm, reverse or modify any such ruling or decision, or
any part thereof.

payment to the village of any tax imposed by this chapter to keep and preserve
all records that may be necessary to determine the amount of the tax that he or
she may have been liable for the collection of, and payment to, the village. If
the operator furnishes lodging not subject to the tax, the operator’s records
shall show the identity of the transient guest, if the sale was exempted for
any other reason.
   (b)   All such records and other documents shall be open during business
hours to the inspection of the Tax Administrator and shall be preserved for a
period of four years, unless the Tax Administrator, in writing, consents to
their destruction within that period, or by order requires that they be kept
longer.
   (c)   In enforcement under this chapter the Tax Administrator shall have all
authority and power set forth in the enforcement of the chapter of the Village
of Lockland Code of Ordinances.

received by the village under this chapter, it may be refunded as provided in
divisions (b) and (c) of this section provided a claim in writing therefore,
stating under penalty of perjury the specific grounds upon which the claim is
founded, is filed with the Tax Administrator within three years of the date of
payment. The claim shall be on forms furnished by the Tax Administrator.
   (b)   An operator may claim a refund or take as credit against taxes
collected and remitted the amount overpaid, paid more than once, or erroneously
or illegally collected or received when it is established in a manner
prescribed by the Tax Administrator that the person from whom the tax has been
collected was not a transient guest. However, neither a refund nor a credit
shall be allowed unless the amount of tax so collected has either been refunded
to the transient guest or credited to rent subsequently payable by the
transient to the operator.
   (c)   A transient guest may obtain a refund of taxes overpaid or paid more
than once or erroneously or illegally collected or received by the village by
filing of a claim in the manner provided in division (a) of this section; but
only when the tax was paid by the transient guest directly to the Tax
Administrator, or when the transient guest having paid the tax to the operator,
established to the satisfaction of the Tax Administrator that the transient
guest has been unable to obtain a refund from the operator who collected the
tax.
   (d)   No refund shall be paid under the provisions of this section unless
the claimant established his or her right thereto by written records showing
entitlement thereto and the refund exceeds $1.

§ 882.04  ALLOCATION OF NET PROFITS.
   Where a person conducts a business both within and outside the municipality,
the portion of the entire net profits of such business to be allocated as
having been made within the municipality may be determined from the records of
such business if such business has bona fide records which disclose with
reasonable accuracy what portion of its net profits is attributable to that
part of its activities conducted within the municipality, or, at the option of
the taxpayer, may be determined by the following formula, which shall be used
if the taxpayer has no bona fide records showing net profits from Lockland
business activities, subject, however, to the provisions of division (b):
   (a)   Multiply the entire net profits of the business by a business
allocation percentage to be determined by:
      (1)   Ascertaining the percentage which the average net book value of the
real and tangible personal property owned or used in the business and situated
within the municipality, during the period covered by the return, is of the
average net book value of all the real and tangible personal property owned or
used in the business, wherever situated, during such period;
      (2)   Ascertaining the percentage which the gross receipts of the
business from sales made and services performed in the municipality, during the
period covered by the return, is of the total gross receipts from all sales and
services, wherever made or performed, during such period;
      (3)   Ascertaining the percentage which the total wages, salaries,
commissions and other compensation paid during the period covered by the
return, to employees for services performed in the municipality, is of the
total wages, salaries, commissions and other compensation paid, during such
period, to all employees within and outside the municipality;
      (4)   Adding together the percentages determined in accordance with
divisions (a)(1) through (3), or such of the aforesaid percentages as are
applicable to the particular taxpayer, and dividing the total so obtained by
the number of percentages used in deriving such total.
      (5)   A factor is applicable even though it may be allocable entirely in
or outside the municipality.
   (b)   However, if a just and equitable result cannot be obtained under the
formula provided for herein, the Board of Review, upon application of the
taxpayer, or the Tax Commissioner, shall, under uniform regulations adopted by
the Board, have the authority to substitute other factors or methods calculated
to effect a fair and proper allocation.

§ 882.05  OPERATING LOSS CARRY-FORWARD.
   (a)   The portion of a net operating loss sustained in any taxable year,
allocable to the municipality, may be applied against the portion of the profit
of succeeding tax years, allocable to the municipality, until exhausted, but in
no event for more than the five taxable years immediately following the year in
which the loss occurred. No portion of a net operating loss shall be carried
back against net profits of any prior year.
   (b)   The portion of a net operating loss sustained shall be allocated to
the municipality in the same manner as provided herein for allocating net
profits to the municipality.
   (c)   The Tax Commissioner shall provide by rules and regulations the manner
in which such net operating loss carry-forward shall be determined.
(Ord. 1455, passed 5-17-1967)
§ 882.06  CONSOLIDATED RETURNS.

accordance with rules and regulations prescribed by the Tax Commissioner.
   (b)   In the case of a corporation that carried on transactions with its
stockholders or with other corporations related by stock ownership,
interlocking directorates or some other method, the Tax Commissioner shall
require such information, in addition to the return hereinafter provided for,
as he or she may deem necessary to ascertain whether net profits are properly
allocated to the municipality. If the Tax Commissioner finds net profits are
not properly allocated to the municipality by reason of transactions with
stockholders or with other corporations related by stock ownership,
interlocking directorates or some other method, he or she may require the
filing of a consolidated return or adjust such transactions so as to produce a
fair and proper allocation of net profits to the municipality.
(Ord. 1455, passed 5-17-1967)
§ 882.07  CAPITAL GAINS.

profits are exempted from municipal income taxes under such section.

commissions or other compensation is subject to the tax imposed by this
chapter, shall, whether or not a tax is due thereon, make and file, on or
before April 30 in each year, a return with the Tax Commissioner.  A taxpayer
on a fiscal year accounting basis for federal income tax purposes shall,
beginning with his or her first fiscal year, any part of which falls within the
effective period of this chapter, file his or her return within four months
from the end of such fiscal year or period.  The Tax Commissioner is hereby
authorized to provide by regulation that the return of an employer, showing the
amount of tax deducted by such employer from the salaries, wages, commissions
or other compensation of an employee, and paid by him, her or them to the Tax
Commissioner shall be accepted as the return required of any employee whose
sole income, subject to tax under this chapter, is such salary, wages,
commissions or other compensation.
   (b)   The return shall be filed with the Tax Commissioner on a form or forms
furnished by or obtainable upon request from the Tax Commissioner setting
forth:
      (1)   The aggregate amounts of salaries, wages, commissions and other
compensation earned, and gross income from any business, profession or other
activity, less allowable expenses incurred in the acquisition of such gross
income, earned during the preceding year and subject to such tax;
      (2)   The amount of the tax imposed by this chapter on such earnings and
profits; and
      (3)   Such other pertinent statements, information returns or other
information as the Tax Commissioner may require, including a statement that the
figures used in the return are the figures used in the return for federal
income tax, adjusted to set forth only such income as is taxable under this
chapter.
   (c)   The Tax Commissioner may extend the time for filing of the annual
return upon the request of the taxpayer for a period of not to exceed six
months, or one month beyond any extension requested of or granted by the
Internal Revenue Service for the filing of the federal income tax return. The
Tax Commissioner may require a tentative return, accompanied by payment of the
amount of tax shown to be due thereon, by the date the return is normally due.
No penalty or interest shall be assessed in those cases in which the return is
filed and the final tax paid within the period as extended.
   (d)  The taxpayer making a return shall, at the time of the filing thereof,
pay to the Tax Commissioner the amount of taxes shown as due thereon, provided,
however, that where any portion of the tax so due has been deducted at the
source, pursuant to §
882.12, or where any portion of such tax has been paid by the taxpayer pursuant
to §
882.13, or where an income tax, creditable against the municipal tax pursuant
to §
882.21 has been paid to another municipality, county or JEDD, credit for the
amount so paid shall be deducted from the amount shown to be due and only the
balance, if any, shall be due and payable at the time of filing such return.
   (e)  A taxpayer who has overpaid the amount of tax to which the municipality
is entitled under this chapter may have such overpayment applied against any
subsequent liability hereunder or, at his or her election indicated on the
return, such overpayment, or part thereof, shall be refunded, provided that no
additional taxes or refunds of less than $5 shall be collected or refunded.

additional income and pay any additional tax due, or claim a refund of tax
overpaid, subject to the requirements and limitations contained in §§
882.17 and
882.21. Such amended returns shall be on a form obtainable on request from the
Tax Commissioner.
   (b)   Within three months from the final determination of any federal tax
liability affecting the taxpayer’s municipal tax liability, such taxpayer shall
make and file an amended municipal return showing income subject to the
municipal tax, based upon such final determination of federal tax liability,
and pay any additional tax shown due thereon or make claim for refund of any
overpayment.

§ 882.12  COLLECTION AT SOURCE.
   (a)   Each employer within, or doing business within the municipality, who
employs one or more persons on a salary, wage, commission or other compensation
basis, shall deduct, at the time of the payment of the salaries, wages,
commissions or other compensation, the tax of two and one-tenth percent of the
gross salaries, wages, commissions or other compensation due by the employer to
each employee. Employers withholding, on average during the preceding calendar
year not more than $1,000 per month shall, on or before the last day of April,
July, October, and January of each year, make a return and pay to the Tax
Commissioner the amount of taxes so deducted during the preceding calendar
quarter. Employers withholding, on average during the preceding calendar year
more than $1,000 per month shall, on or before the last day of the succeeding
month make a return and pay to the Tax Commissioner the amount of taxes so
deducted during the preceding month. The return shall be on a form or forms
prescribed by or acceptable to the Tax Commissioner and shall be subject to the
rules and regulations prescribed therefore by the Tax Commissioner.
   (b)   Each employer, in collecting the tax, shall be deemed to hold the
same, until payment is made by the employer to the municipality, as a trustee
for the benefit of the municipality and any tax collected by the employer from
his or her employees shall, until the same is paid to the municipality, be
deemed a trust fund in the hands of the employer.  Each employer shall be
liable for the payment of the tax required to be deducted and withheld, whether
or not the tax, in fact, has been withheld.
   (c)   It shall be the responsibility, jointly and severally, of the
president and treasurer of each corporation required to withhold the tax from
wages of its employees under this section, to see that all taxes so withheld
are paid to the municipality in accordance with this section.  If taxes
withheld by a corporation from the salaries of its employees are not paid to
the municipality in accordance with this section, the president and treasurer
of the corporation shall each be criminally liable under §§
882.18 and
882.99.
   (d)   On or before January 30 of each year, each employer shall file a
reconciliation withholding return, on a form or forms prescribed by and
obtainable from the Tax Commissioner, setting forth the names and addresses of
all employees from whose compensation the tax was withheld during the preceding
calendar year, the amount of tax withheld from the listed employees and such
other information as may be required by the rules and regulations adopted by
the Tax Commissioner.
   (e)   No person shall be required to withhold the tax on the wages or other
compensation paid domestic servants employed exclusively in or about the
person’s residence.
   (f)   Any officer or supervisor having control or supervision of, or charged
with the responsibility of filing, any return or declaration required by this
chapter, and with the responsibility for making payment of the tax or withheld
income taxes, or any officer or supervisor of a corporation who is responsible
for execution of the corporation’s fiscal responsibilities, shall be personally
liable for the failure to file any return or declaration or pay the tax or
employer withholding due by the provisions of this chapter.  The dissolution,
termination or bankruptcy of a corporation does not discharge a responsible
officer’s or supervisor’s liability for failure of the corporation to file
returns or declarations or pay tax or employer withholding when due.

profit or loss from such business activity together with the estimated tax due
thereon, if any.

during the life of this chapter, or within four months of the date the taxpayer
first becomes subject to this section.

municipal tax to be withheld from any portion of such income and for income
taxes to be paid to another taxing municipality for which credit is allowed
against the municipal tax under §
882.21.
   (e)   A declaration of estimated tax to be paid the municipality shall be
accompanied by a payment of at least one fourth of the estimated tax, less
credit for taxes withheld or paid to another municipality, and at least a
similar amount shall be paid on or before the last day of the seventh, tenth
and thirteenth months after the beginning of the tax year.
   (f)   A declaration may be amended at any time, provided, however, that in
case an amended declaration is filed, the unpaid balance shown due thereon
shall be paid in equal installments on or before the remaining payment dates.
   (g)   An amended declaration must be filed on or before April 15 of any
year, or, in the case of a taxpayer on a fiscal year accounting basis, on or
before the date fixed by regulation of the Tax Commissioner, if it appears that
the original declaration made for such year underestimated the taxpayer’s
income by 30 percent or more. At such time, a payment which, together with
prior payments, is sufficient to pay the taxpayer’s entire estimated liability
shall be made. If, upon the filing of the return required by §
882.10, it appears that the taxpayer did not pay 70 percent of his or her tax
liability, as shown on such return, on or before April 15, or the date fixed by
regulation, whichever is applicable, the difference between 70 percent of the
taxpayer’s liability and the amount of estimated tax he or she actually paid on
or before April 15, or the date fixed by regulation, whichever is applicable,
shall be subject to the interest and penalty provisions of §
882.16.
   (h)   On or before the last day of the fourth month of the calendar or
fiscal year following that for which the declaration was filed, an annual
return shall be filed and any balance which may be due the municipality shall
be paid therewith in accordance with §

§ 1024.13  REVIEWING DEVELOPMENTS SUBJECT TO DISCRETIONARY REVIEW BY THE
VILLAGE.
   (a)   Except on residential properties of 6,000 square feet or less, where
the village has discretionary development review of a proposed development,
either because of planned unit development, conditional use or variance zoning
review, the use of development contracts, or otherwise, the village shall
require a property owner to provide a tree plan prior to approval by the
village. That plan shall contain a complete survey plat of all trees located on
the development site with calipers in excess of two inches, identifying each by
species, size and location. Stands of trees may be identified by designating a
stand of trees on the survey plat and approximating the number of each species
and size of trees within the stand. The survey shall also identify the trees to
be removed and the trees to be retained as a part of the development. Where
trees are to be removed as a result of the development, the developer shall
provide a plan identifying what replacement of trees is to take place on the
site including the location, species and size of the replacement trees. The
tree plan and supporting data shall be reviewed by the Village Administrator
who may consult with the Tree Commission and who shall consider any guidelines
that have been established by the Tree Commission. The Village Administrator
may approve, approve with conditions, or disapprove the tree plan and so advise
the Building Inspector, Zoning Inspector, Planning Commission, Zoning Board of
Appeals or Village Council, whichever is appropriate depending upon the nature
of the zoning or development review underway. Tree approval by the Village
Administrator does not authorize any building or development activity or
constitute zoning approval and the developer must still comply with any
requirements for and obtain a building permit or zoning approval.
   (b)   No certificate of occupancy shall be issued pursuant to §
1264.07 of the Lockland Code of Ordinances, unless the village officer, who may
from time to time be empowered to issue a certificate of occupancy, determines
that the site is in compliance with the requirements of the approved tree plan.
   (c)   Under appropriate circumstances, the village may require the posting
of surety to ensure compliance with the conditions of a tree approval. If the
required tree approval conditions have not been met within the life of the
surety and provided the Village Administrator and his or her designee have not
granted a written extension, the village shall use the surety to ensure that
those conditions are met.
   (d)   All tree plan approvals shall be conditioned upon the maintenance of
the trees and require replacement where such trees fail to survive.
Replacements shall be required within 30 days of notice by the Village
Administrator, except that during the winter season, at the request of the
property owner, the Village Administrator may grant a longer period of time for
the replacement of trees.

person, provided that such notice and order shall be deemed to be properly
served upon such owner, occupant or agent if a copy thereof is sent by
certified mail to his or her last known address and a copy is posted in a
conspicuous place in or on the property affected.
   (b)   Any person affected by any notice of violation and order to comply or
revocation or denial of a tree plan may request and be granted a hearing on the
matter before the Village Tree Commission, provided that such person files in
the office of the Village Administrator, a written petition requesting such
hearing and setting forth the name, address and phone number of the petitioner
and a brief statement of the grounds for such appeal or for the mitigation of
any item appearing on any order issued by the Village Administrator relating to
tree plans. The petition shall be filed within ten days after the date of the
notice of order or the denial of approval of a tree plan. Upon receipt of such
a petition, the Tree Commission shall set a time and place for a hearing before
the Commission and shall give the petitioner written notice thereof. A hearing
shall commence within a reasonable time, not to exceed 15 days after a petition
has been filed. At such a hearing, the petitioner shall be given an opportunity
to be heard and to show cause why any item appearing on such notice and order
should be modified or withdrawn. The failure of the petitioner or his or her
representative to appear and state his or her case at such hearing shall have
the same effect as if no petition were filed.
   (c)   After a hearing, the Tree Commission shall sustain, modify or withdraw
any item appearing on the notice or order, by a majority vote, depending upon
its findings as to whether or not the ordinances of the village relating to
trees have been complied with. The petitioner and the Village Administrator
shall be notified, in writing, of such findings.
   (d)   The proceedings at such hearing, including the findings and decisions
of the Tree Commission and reasons therefore, shall be summarized and reduced

shall include a copy of every notice and order issued in connection with the
matter.

§ 1026.02  PURPOSE AND SCOPE OF CHAPTER.

of-way permits to persons for such use or occupancy, and to set forth the
related policies of the village.

required by law. Each permittee shall obtain any and all such additional state,
federal or village franchises, licenses or permits necessary to the operation

provided, however, that no permittee holding a valid right-of-way permit shall
be required to obtain a franchise for any type of services rendered by the
permittee for which the village did not require franchise at the time the
permittee’s permit was last issued or renewed. Should there be a direct
conflict between the provisions of this chapter and a valid franchise, the
provisions of the franchise shall prevail; provided, however, that additional
obligations shall not be construed as a conflict.
   (c)   The Administrator is hereby directed and empowered to enforce the
provisions of this chapter.
   (d)   The village’s policy regarding rights-of-way is:
      (1)   To promote the utilization of rights-of-way for the public health,
safety and welfare and to promote economic development in the village;
      (2)   To promote the availability of a wide range of utility,
communication and other services, including the rapid deployment of new
technologies and innovative services, to the village’s residents and taxpayers
at reasonable costs;
      (3)   To promote cooperation among the permittees and the village in the
occupation of rights-of-way, and work therein, in order to minimize public
inconvenience during right-of-way work, and eliminate wasteful, unnecessary or
unsightly duplication of facilities;
      (4)   To promote public safety and protect public property;
      (5)   To ensure adequate public compensation for private use of the
rights-of-way and the costs related thereto, including the regulation thereof;
      (6)   To promote and require reasonable accommodation of all uses of
rights-of-way; and when all requests for right-of-way use cannot be
accomplished, to give priority for use of rights-of-way, in the order
indicated, from highest to lowest, to the following users:
         A.   The village for governmental purposes;
         B.   Another governmental entity for governmental purposes with the
village’s concurrence, or other governmental use required by law;
         C.   General right-of-way permittees and proprietary uses by the
village; and
         D.   Limited right-of-way permittees; provided, however, that the
Administrator may reasonably require cooperation and accommodation among
permittees in the public interest.
      (7)   To assure that applicants have the financial, technical and
managerial resources to comply with this chapter and the provisions of any
right-of-way permit issued hereunder; provided that, for purposes of this
chapter, an applicant possessing valid certification from the Public Utilities
Commission of Ohio, including certification pursuant to Ohio R.C. 4933.81 et
seq., for the services to be provided by the facilities subject to this chapter
shall be presumed to possess the requisite financial, technical and managerial
resources, unless otherwise shown by clear and convincing evidence.
   (e)   All right-of-way permits granted hereunder shall be non-exclusive and
no property right of any nature shall be created by the granting of a permit
under this chapter.
   (f)   This chapter does not apply to structures or facilities owned or
operated by the village or any village operations that occupy or use the
rights-of-way. Further, the costs imposed by the village’s occupancy or use of
the rights-of-way shall not be included in the costs to the village to maintain
and manage the rights-of-way.

§ 1026.03  PROHIBITION; TYPES OF PERMITS; RIGHT-OF-WAY COMMITTEE.

such manner as the regulations require. There shall be no application fee. Any
person holding a valid franchise shall be granted a general right-of-way
permit. Such general right-of-way permit shall be valid so long as the
underlying franchise is valid and the applicable provisions of that franchise,
the right-of-way permit and of this chapter are complied with; provided,
however, that such right-of-way permit shall only relate to and entitle the
permittee to utilize the rights-of-way, in accordance with this chapter, for
purposes directly related to the provision of the specific services for which
it has a franchise. Any other right-of-way use by such permittee shall require
a separate or amended right-of-way permit issued pursuant to division (b)

   (b)   All other applications for general right-of-way permits, or amendments
or renewals thereof, shall be filed with the Village Administrator in such form
and in such manner as the regulations require, along with an application fee of
$300. The Administrator shall determine if the application is in order and
shall, within 45 days of the receipt of a complete application, issue a written
report regarding such application. The report shall recommend that the Right-
of-Way Committee deny or grant the right-of-way permit, subject to any
appropriate terms and conditions, in accordance with the criteria set forth in
this chapter. The Administrator’s report shall be served upon the applicant by
mail along with a notice of when the Right-of-Way Committee will consider the
same. The meeting of the Right-of-Way Committee shall be scheduled within 15
days of the serving the report on the applicant unless otherwise agreed to by
the applicant. The Right-of-Way Committee shall then consider such
recommendation and make a final determination in writing, within 15 days of the
Administrator’s report unless waived by the applicant, as to whether or not
such right-of-way permit should be granted and if so, upon what terms and
conditions. The term of each such general right-of-way permit shall be for ten
years from issuance, or such lesser term as the applicant requests. Decisions
of the Right-of-Way Committee regarding general right-of-way permits may be
appealed to the Village Council. Such appeal shall be filed with the Village
Administrator in such form as the regulation requires, within 15 days of the
decision appealed from. Decisions of Village Council on such appeals shall be
final and appealable pursuant to R. C. Chapter 2506.
   (c)   An application for a limited right-of-way permit, or renewal thereof,
shall be filed with the Village Administrator in such form and in such manner
as the regulations require, along with an application fee of either: (1) $50
for a limited right-of-way permit for residential purposes; or (2) $300 for all
others for a three-year period of time or $100 for a one-year period of time.
If the Administrator determines that the application is in order and that the
criteria set forth in §
1026.05 have been met, and that the application should be granted, the
Administrator shall, within 45 days of the receipt of a completed application,
grant or renew a limited right-of-way permit subject to any appropriate terms
and conditions or deny the same. The Administrator's grant, renewal or denial
shall be served upon the applicant by mail at the address set forth in the
application. The term of such limited right-of-way permits shall be three years
from the issuance if a fee of $300 is paid, or one year from the issuance if a
fee of $100 is paid, or such lesser term as the applicant requests. A limited
right-of-way permit for residential purposes may be granted for an indefinite
term from issuance, but may be canceled by the Administrator with 60 days
written notice.
   (d)   Any applicant may appeal any decision of the Village Administrator to
the Right-of-Way Committee within ten days of the Administrator’s
determination. The Right-of-Way Committee shall then review the matter and
after affording the applicant an opportunity to be heard either in person or in
writing render a final determination within 15 days of the filing of the
appeal, unless such period is waived by the applicant. Except to the extent
otherwise appealable by law pursuant to R. C. Chapter 2506, the Right-of-Way
Committee’s decision shall be final with regards to applications for limited
right-of-way permits.
   (e)   Any right-of-way permittee shall, within 30 days of the granting or
renewal of any right-of-way permit hereunder, if and as applicable, pay a pro-
rata portion of the fees required by §
1026.07(b) or (c); provided, however, that should the permittee appeal, and
during the pendency thereof the permittee does not use or occupy any right-of-
way, the permittee shall not be required to pay such pro-rata portion of the
fees until such appeal has been finally determined.

(Ord. 2007-32, passed 9-18-2007)
§ 1026.06  OBLIGATIONS OF PERMITTEES; CONDITIONS OF PERMITS.
   (a)   In addition to the other requirements set forth herein and in the
regulations each permittee, except a limited right-of-way permittee for
residential purposes, shall:
      (1)   Use its best efforts to cooperate with other permittees and the
village for the best, most efficient, most aesthetic and least obtrusive use of
rights-of-way, consistent with safety, and to minimize traffic and other
disruptions including street cuts;
      (2)   Participate in such joint planning, construction and advance
notification of right-of-way work, excepting such work performed in an
emergency provided the permittee uses its best efforts to contact the village
at the earliest possible time after beginning any such emergency work requiring
excavation or other interference with the flow of traffic, as may be required
this chapter and as may be more specifically set forth in regulations
promulgated pursuant to this chapter;
      (3)   Reasonably cooperate with other permittees in utilization of,
construction in and occupancy of private rights-of-way within the village, but
only to the extent the same is consistent with the grant thereof, is not
additionally burdensome to any property owner or unreasonably burdensome to the
permittee; provided, however, that nothing in this division shall be construed
to require expenditure of funds or rearrangement of facilities by a permittee
without fair compensation.
      (4)   At the direction of the Administrator upon reasonable written
notice as determined by the Administrator after consulting with the affected
permittees and taking into account the size of the project, the time necessary
to perform removal or rearrangement work, the difficulty associated with such
removal or rearrangement, costs and such other matters as the Administrator
deems appropriate, a permittee shall, at its sole cost, including but not
limited to engineering, construction, permits and other such costs, temporarily
or permanently remove or rearrange its facilities:
         A.   As deemed necessary or otherwise in the public interest by the
Administrator to accommodate construction, repair or modification of any

granted by the Administrator, the permittee may petition the Right-of-Way
Committee for additional time to relocate its facilities.
      (5)   Provide maps and other information relating to a permittee’s

   (b)   No person shall establish or maintain, or permit to be established or
maintained, any connection whereby a private, auxiliary or emergency water

such supply has been approved by the Village Administrator and by the Ohio
Environmental Protection Agency.
   (c)   The Village Administrator shall cause surveys and investigations to be
made of industrial and other properties served by the public water supply where
actual or potential hazards to the public water supply may exist. Such surveys

   (d)   The Village Administrator or his or her duly authorized representative
may enter, at any reasonable time, any property served by a connection to the
public water supply or distribution system of the village for the purpose of
inspecting the piping system thereof.  On demand, the owner, lessee or occupant
of any property so served shall furnish to the Village Administrator any
information which he or she may request regarding the piping system or water
use on such property. The refusal to furnish such information, when demanded,
shall, within the discretion of the Village Administrator, be deemed evidence
of the presence of improper connections as provided in this section.
   (e)   The Village Administrator is hereby authorized and directed to
discontinue, after reasonable notice to the occupant thereof, the water service
to any property wherein any connection in violation of this section is known to

regulations consistent with and in furtherance of the purposes of this section
to provide an effective means for  protecting the public water system of the

valuable benefit to land, any owner of real estate premises maintaining such
water service connections shall assume responsibility for the total of all
water charges levied against the premises during such ownership in the same
manner as the person who actually incurred the charges.  This assumption of
responsibility shall be a necessary condition to the continuance of water
service to the premises, and the failure to pay such charges when billed in
accordance with the provisions of this chapter shall constitute grounds for the
Village Administrator to refuse water service to the premises.

property is about to be sold or transferred, the Administrator may only make a
certification if the rents have been due and unpaid for at least 60 days and
the Administrator has provided the responsible party with written notice of the
impending certification at least 30 days prior to the certification.
   (e)     The amount certified shall be a lien on the owner’s property from
the date placed on the list and duplicate and shall be collected in the same
manner as other taxes.

water supply and the method of connection and use of such supply shall have
been approved by the Director of Lockland Water System and the Ohio
Environmental Protection Agency.

§ 1064.01  FALSE ALARM DEFINED.
   “False alarm” as used in this chapter, includes any alarm or report of an
alarm received by the Police or Fire Department of the Village of Lockland that
has resulted from either the mechanical malfunction of an alarm system located
within the village and/or the negligence of the owner of property within the
village and/or his or her agents and/or employees in the setting of the alarm
system, including, but not limited to, those which proximately cause the alarm
to register and be received by or reported to the Police or Fire Department.
Whether or not an alarm or a report of an alarm received by the Village of
Lockland Police or Fire Department qualifies as a false alarm is a decision to
be made by the Chief of Police or Fire Chief of the Village of Lockland, after
proper investigation of the circumstances surrounding said alarm receipt has
been completed by said village officer or by personnel assigned to do so and
report their recommendation to their respective chief.
(Ord. 2012-45, passed 8-21-12)
§ 1064.02  NOTICE OF FALSE ALARMS.
   The Chief of Police and/or the Fire Chief shall give written notice of each
qualified false alarm by regular mail to the owner of the property upon which
the alarm system is located. The notice shall also provide that the property
owner may make a written appeal the determination of a false alarm to the
Village Administrator.

§ 1064.03  ASSESSMENT FOR EXCESSIVE FALSE ALARMS.

section, the owner of the property upon which the alarm system is located shall
be charged the sum of $100 per false alarm for each and every false alarm in
excess of two for said calendar year.
(Ord. 2012-45, passed 8-21-12)
§ 1064.04  NOTICE OF ASSESSMENT.
   The Financial Services Manager of the Village of Lockland shall, upon
notification of the Police Chief or Fire Chief, give notice by regular mail to
the owner of the property upon which the alarm system is located, at the
address of record with the Hamilton County Auditor, to pay the $100 per false
alarm assessment. In the event the same is not paid within 30 days after the
mailing of said notice, then said amount shall be determined to be delinquent
and shall be collected in a manner as is authorized by law, unless appealed as
provided in §
1064.05.
(Ord. 2012-45, passed 8-21-12)
§ 1064.05  APPEALS.

Village Administrator, the determination of a false alarm within 30 days of
mailing of the written notice. Upon receipt of a written appeal of a false
alarm determination from the property owner, the Village Administrator, in his
or her discretion, may waive, modify, or set aside the calculation of the
number of false alarms in order to avoid any injustice to the alarm user as a
result of alarm signals which do not constitute false alarms, as defined in §
1064.01. The Village Administrator shall issue a written decision within 30
days of the receipt of the appeal.

distances for setbacks and structure dimensions, all distances are measured
along a horizontal plane from the appropriate line, edge of building,
structure, storage area, parking area or other object. These distances are not
measured by following the topography of the land. When measuring a required
distance, such as the minimum distance between a structure and a lot line, the
measurement is made at the closest or shortest distance between the two
objects.  Exceptions to this rule are as follows:
      (1)   Measurement of vehicle stacking or travel areas. Measurement of a
minimum travel distance for vehicles, such as garage entrance setbacks and
stacking lane distances, is measured down the center of the vehicle travel
area. For example, curving driveways and travel lanes are measured along the
arc of the driveway or traffic lane.
      (2)   Measurements involving a structure. Measurements involving a
structure are made to the closest wall of the structure. Chimneys, eaves and
bay windows up to 12 feet in length, are not included in the measurement. Other
features, such as covered porches and entrances, are included in the
measurement.
      (3)   Underground structures. Structures or portions of structures that
are entirely underground are not included in measuring required distances.
   (b)   Fractions. When calculations result in fractions the results are
rounded as follows:
      (1)   Minimum requirements. When a regulation is expressed in terms of a
minimum requirement, any fractional result over 0.5 is rounded up to the next
consecutive whole number.
      (2)   Maximum limits. When a regulation is expressed in terms of maximum
limits, any fractional result will be rounded down to the next lower whole
number.
   (c)   Structure height.
      (1)   Principal structure height is measured from the finished grade at
the building line, if higher to the top of the cornice of flat roofs, or to the
deck line of a mansard roof, or to the mid-height of the highest gable or
dormer in a pitched or hipped roof, or, if there are no gables or dormers, to
the mid-height of a pitched or hipped roof. Exceptions to the height
limitations on structures are as follows: Height limits do not apply to farm
buildings and structures, church steeples, spires, belfries, cupolas, domes,
false mansards, monuments, water towers, fire and hose towers, windmills,
chimneys, smoke stacks, or flag poles.
      (2)   Other structures. The height of other structures such as fences is
the vertical distance from the ground level immediately under the structure to
the top of a structure. Special measurement provisions are also provided below.
         A.   Measuring height of fences on top of retaining walls. Fences on
the top of retaining walls are measured from the top of the retaining wall.
         B.   Measuring height of decks.  Deck height is determined by
measuring from the ground to the top of the floor of the deck if there is no
rail and from the average finished grade to the top of the rails for all other
situations.
         C.   Building and mechanical equipment. Upon approval of the Planning
Commission, building and mechanical equipment within the Industrial,
Commercial, or Open Space and Public Lands Districts may be placed on the roof
of structures resulting in a combined structure and equipment height that
exceeds the height limit within the respective district, provided:
            1.   The equipment itself does not exceed ten feet in height;
            2.   The equipment is set back a minimum of 15 feet from exterior
walls; and
            3.   The equipment is adequately screened from view.
   (d)   Lot width. The horizontal distance between the side lot lines as
measured from the midpoint of one side lot line to the midpoint of the other
side lot line.
   (e)   Minimum and maximum separation distance. In cases where a minimum or
maximum separation distance applies, the minimum or maximum distance is
measured in a straight line, without regard to intervening structures, from the
closest property line of the use being regulated to the closest property line,
district boundary line or use from which the minimum or maximum distance is
required.

compatible with uses permitted within the Industrial Districts, and by so
doing, making land more readily available for industry;
   (d)   To protect adjacent residential districts by restricting the types of
manufacturing  bordering residential districts to those which are less likely
to create objectionable influences beyond their district boundaries and by
separating and insulating residential districts from the most intense
manufacturing activities through the provision of landscaped buffer areas;

   The purpose of the Planned Development “PD” District is to permit
comprehensively planned developments approved by the Planning Commission and
Village Council under more flexible zoning guidelines and site design criteria
than permitted in traditional districts. The suspension of traditional zoning
provisions is intended to:
   (a)   Encourage creative, high quality site design practices in the
development of commercial and industrial areas;
   (b)   Promote harmony and integration with existing developments; protect
adjoining properties from adverse impacts;
   (c)   Promote safe and efficient pedestrian, bicycle, and vehicular
movement;
   (d)   Promote efficient layout of infrastructure; and
   (e)   Promote protection or enhancement of natural and historic resources.

   In place of enforcing the traditional zoning provisions, the village may
exercise control through approval, denial, or amendment of the development plan
and by requiring standards, design criteria, conditions, and agreements
appropriate for the particular site it surrounds, and for the proposed use or
uses. While certain modifications to the requirements of the Subdivision
Regulations may be permitted in a Planned Development, careful coordination of
the design and review of the proposed platting and improvements is encouraged.

of this chapter shall apply only to such new and expanded uses, alterations,
and changes of use and shall not apply to existing use conditions.
      (2)   If any of the modifications in §
1262.03(a)(1) occur and the existing parking or loading stalls exceed the
requirements of this chapter, the parking stall quantity in excess of the
minimum requirements may be applied to future modifications where applicable.
   (b)   Existing uses.  The off-street parking and loading requirements of

(Ord. 2012-20, passed 4-17-2012)
§ 1262.07  REQUIRED OFF-STREET PARKING STALLS.
    Except as otherwise provided in this section, the quantity of off-street
parking stalls for each newly established principal use on a parcel shall be
provided according to the units of measurement indicated for that use in
Schedule 1262.07 Off-Street Parking Stall Requirements.
   (a)   Computation of required stalls.  The following provision shall govern
the computation of the number of off-street parking stalls required.
      (1)   When the calculation of minimum required parking stalls for a
particular use results in a fractional number, the number shall be rounded up
to the next consecutive whole number.
      (2)   In any places of assembly in which the seats in the auditorium or
assembly area consist of benches, pews or other similar seating facilities, and
the number of seats are a factor in the calculation of the minimum required
parking stalls, each 20 inches of such seating facilities shall be counted as
one seat for the purpose of determining the minimum number of required parking
stalls.
      (3)   When parking stall requirements are calculated on the number of
faculty, staff, students or employees, the maximum number likely to be present
at any one time shall govern.
      (4)   For uses not expressly listed in Schedule 1262.07 Off-Street
Parking Stall Requirements, parking stalls shall be provided on the same basis
as required for the most similar use as determined by the Village Council
pursuant to
Chapter 1276.
   (b)   Reduction in minimum required parking stalls.  In the event that the
number of parking stalls required in the Schedule of Off-Street Parking Stall
Requirements for a proposed use cannot be placed on the parcel in accordance
with these regulations without the demolition of an existing structure or
elimination of required landscaping to accommodate a parking area, the Planning
Commission may authorize up to a 20 percent reduction in the total number of
parking stalls required on the lot. The Planning Commission may issue such an
authorization only upon the request of the applicant and only upon determining
that the reduction in the number of required parking stalls will not
unreasonably increase parking congestion along public streets or in parking
areas located on nearby lots.  After such authorization is granted, the
applicant shall not expand or replace the existing structure unless the full
required amount of off-street parking is provided on the lot.
   (c)   Spaces for the handicapped.  Handicapped-accessible parking stalls
shall be provided in accordance with the provisions of the
Ohio Building Code and may be counted as part of the minimum parking stall
requirements of this chapter.
   (d)   Shared parking.  Joint use of up to 50 percent of required parking
stalls may be permitted for two or more uses located on the same parcel or
adjacent parcels provided that the applicant can demonstrate to the village
that the uses will not substantially overlap in hours of operation or in demand
for the shared stalls.  This shall be guaranteed by a written agreement from
the owner or between the owners involved and all future owners or assigns which
shall be submitted with the required plan.  Shared parking stalls shall be
located no more than 300 feet from the uses they are intended to serve.

      (11)   Any unauthorized warning signs which make use of words such as
"Stop," "Look," "Danger," or any other words, phrases, symbols or characters
which might interfere with, mislead or confuse traffic.
      (12)   Any signs or other advertising structures containing any obscene
matter.
      (13)   Marquee signs.
(Ord. 2012-20, passed 4-17-2012)
§ 1264.11  GENERAL STANDARDS.
   All signs located within the village are subject to the following
regulations and limitations, where applicable and unless otherwise specified:
   (a)   Sign quality and durability.
      (1)   Structural elements. The construction and structural components of
all signs shall be in accordance with the standards and regulations of the
Village Building Code.
      (2)   Aesthetic and visual elements.  All signs, including materials,
paint, lettering, graphics, etc., shall be of a durable, professional quality.
   (b)   Height.
      (1)   Height of ground, monument, and pole signs.
         A.   Sign without mounding.  The height of a freestanding sign shall
be calculated by measuring the vertical distance between the top part of such
sign or its structure, whichever is highest, to the elevation of the ground
directly beneath the center of the sign.  The elevation of the ground directly
beneath the center of the sign shall be construed to be the lower of the
existing grade prior to construction or the newly established grade after
construction, exclusive of any filling, berming, mounding or excavating solely
for the purpose of locating the sign.
         B.   Sign with mounding.  In cases in which the newly established
grade within the required front yard consists of man-made berms, hills, or
other similar ground formations with sides steeper than one foot rise to four
feet horizontal, the enforcing officer shall utilize the elevation of the
street curb nearest to the location of the sign for determining sign height. 
If no street curb exists, the elevation of the edge of the pavement nearest the
sign location shall be used.  See Figure 1266.06-A.
         C.   Structural support included in sign height.  Any material whose
major function is to provide structural support for a sign shall be considered
part of the sign for purposes of determining sign height.

      (2)   Minimum height of structure-mounted signs. The bottom of every
awning, canopy, walkway sign, flat sign and wall sign shall be elevated at
least eight feet above grade.  Where multiple flat or wall signs are permitted
on the same façade, they shall maintain the same top and bottom elevations
above grade as one another.
   (c)   Measurement of sign face area.
      (1)   Determination of sign face area.  The area of a sign shall be
determined by computing the entire area within a single polygon that completely
enclosed the sign face (i.e., the extreme limits of lettering, representations,
emblems or other figures, together with all surrounding material, color,
lighting, trim or ornamentation forming an integral part of the display or used
to differentiate the sign from the background from which it is placed) and in
which polygon no interior angle is greater than 180 degrees.  See Figure
1264.11-B.

IMAGES/0-0-0-3278.jpg]
 
      (2)   Area of Sign With More Than One Exterior Face.  The area of a sign
designed with more than one exterior face shall be computed as including 100
percent of all sign face areas as defined above that are visible from any
ground position.  A V-shaped sign whose interior angle is 90 degrees or less
shall be counted as two sign faces.
      (3)   Exceptions. Where a sign is attached to a wall or fence, the area
of the entire wall or fence shall not be computed in determining the maximum
sign area.
   (d)   Setback. Except as otherwise provided, no sign shall be closer than
ten feet to a right-of-way or six feet from a side lot line.
   (e)   Illumination.
      (1)   Location and design of light source.  Whenever an external
artificial light source is used for a sign, such source shall be located,
shielded, and directed so as not to be directly visible from any public street
or private residence.  No receptacle or device housing a permitted light source
for a sign shall protrude more than 18 inches from the face of the sign or
building to which it is attached.
      (2)   Level of illumination.  In no event shall the illumination of any
sign, resulting from any internal or external artificial light source, exceed
50 foot candles when measured with a standard light meter held perpendicular to
the sign face at a distance equal to the narrowest dimension of such sign
face.  All artificial illumination shall be so designed, located, shielded, and
directed as to illuminate only the sign face or faces and to prevent the
casting of glare or direct light upon adjacent property or streets.
      (3)   Signs adjacent to residential districts.  Any illuminated sign
located on a lot abutting or across a street from, and visible from, any
residential district shall not be illuminated from the hours of 10:00 p.m. to
7:00 a.m. except that such sign may remain illuminated during such time as the
activity to which the sign pertains is open for business so long as such sign
is not a public or private nuisance.
      (4)   Flashing lights prohibited.  Except for public service signs when
expressly permitted by this section, no flashing, blinking, or intermittent
lights shall be permitted.
   (f)   Electronic changeable copy. Electronic copy signs are permitted
provided that movement is limited to scrolling, or flashing copy with a minimum
six-second delay.  Animation and graphics are prohibited.
   (g)   Landscaping.  The base of all ground-mounted signs shall be landscaped
pursuant to the requirements of Chapter 1266 Landscaping.
   (h)   General safety. Notwithstanding any other provision of this section,
no sign shall be constructed or maintained in any area or in any manner so as
to create a nuisance or a threat to the public safety or welfare.
   (i)   Traffic safety.
      (1)   Confusion with traffic signals.  No sign shall be maintained at any
location where by reason of its position, size, shape, content , color, or
illumination it may obstruct, impair, obscure, interfere with the view of, or
be confused with any traffic control sign, signal, or device or where it may
interfere with, mislead, or confuse traffic.
      (2)   Obstruction of sight triangles prohibited. A ground, pole or
monument sign may not be closer to a lot line or right-of-way than the greater
of one-half the sign height or 15 feet when within a sight triangle. See Figure
1264.11-C.

   (j)   Obstructions to access ways. No sign or sign structure shall obstruct
free ingress to or egress from a fire escape, door, window, or other required
access way.
   (k)   Signs in right-of-way. No sign, except governmental signs, shall be
placed in or extend into or over any public property or public right-of-way.
   (l)   Sign spacing. No sign shall be nearer than two feet to any other sign
or structure, other than a structure to which it is lawfully attached.
   (m)   Signs on lots with multiple uses. When more than one user occupies a
zoning lot, the owner of the lot shall be responsible for allocating permitted
signage among such users.
   (n)   Sign maintenance and abandonment. All signs and sign structures shall
be maintained in a safe and attractive condition. Signs and structures which
have been abandoned or are not maintained in accordance with this Zoning Code
and other applicable regulations of the village shall be removed within 60 days
by the latest permit holder or owner or by the village at the expense of such
permit holder or owner.
   (o)   Nonconforming signs.
      (1)   A sign conforming to the regulations prevailing prior to the
effective date of this Zoning Code or otherwise lawfully erected, but which
does not conform to the regulations of this Zoning Code or a subsequent
amendment, shall be construed to be a legal nonconforming sign.
      (2)   Nonconforming signs may be maintained and structural parts may be
replaced or restored to a safe condition, if required. However, any sign or
part thereof which has been removed, destroyed, otherwise taken down for any
purpose consistent with the provisions of
Chapter 1278 Nonconforming Uses and Structures, shall not be rebuilt, re-
erected or relocated unless it is made to comply with this Zoning Code and the
Building Code.

§ 1264.13  SIGN REGULATION BY DISTRICT.
   (a)   Residential districts.
      (1)   Purpose. Signage in the Residential Districts should be used for
purposes typically accessory to residential uses and which do not impact
neighboring residences.  The sign regulations for these districts are intended
to limit the type, number, size and duration of signage permitted in order to
prevent the creation of nuisances and impacts on the use and enjoyment of
surrounding residential property.
      (2)   Applicability. These regulations shall apply to all zoning lots
within the R-1, Large Lot Residential, R-2, Medium Lot Residential, and R-3,
Medium Lot Residential Districts.
      (3)   Sign type, size and height standards for the Residential Districts.

      (4)   Supplemental regulations.
         A.   Multi-Family Residential shall be entitled to one wall or ground
sign consistent with the provisions of 1264.13(a)(3) above. 
   (b)   Residential-Office District.
      (1)   Purpose. The sign regulations for the Residential Office District
are intended to limit the type, number, size and duration of signage permitted
in order to prevent the creation of nuisances and impacts on the use and
enjoyment of surrounding residential property, while allowing signage to
function principally to identify occupants of establishments within the
District.  Freestanding signs should accent the landscape and building signs
should accent the buildings in such a manner so as to not detract from the low-
impact, residential-office character of the neighborhood.
      (2)   Applicability. These regulations shall apply to all zoning lots
within the RO Residential-Office District.
      (3)   Sign type, size and height standards for the Residential Office

      (3)   Be constructed in accordance with all applicable Building Code
regulations.
      (4)   Not be maintained or affixed to any building that has been declared
by the Code Enforcement Officer as dangerous and unsafe and a public nuisance

securely barricaded. The holder of the billboard permit for such sign shall be
given 30 days notice of the order of the Code Enforcement Officer prior to any
action to enforce this provision.
   (b)   Construction of signs. No person shall construct a billboard:
      (1)   As a roof sign.
      (2)   Within 200 feet in any direction of any school or hospital.
      (3)   Within 100 feet in any direction of a residential district boundary
line.
      (4)   In any park, parkway, or playground under the jurisdiction of the
village, the establishment of which has been authorized by Council, or within
200 feet in any direction of the boundary of any such park, parkway or

      (5)   As a double-faced, side-by-side, stacked, or decked sign, with a
combined sign face area of more than 150 square feet.

      (9)   As a ground sign more than 40 feet above the grade of the lot or
location being occupied by such sign, or the average natural grade at the sign

with this section shall be measured along the nearest edge of the pavement
between points directly opposite the center of the signs along the same side of
the street or highway on which the sign is to be located.
   (d)   Lighting requirements for billboards.  Lighting shall not be used in
any way in connection with any billboard unless it is so effectively shielded
as to prevent beams or rays of light from being directly cast on any portion of
the street or highway, or is of such low intensity or brilliance as not to
cause glare or to impair the vision of the driver of any motor vehicle or to
otherwise interfere with any driver's operation of a motor vehicle. Illuminated
off-premise signs shall not produce more than one foot candle of illumination
four feet from the sign, when measured from the base of the sign.
   (e)   Billboard construction permit.
      (1)   A person may not construct a billboard without first obtaining a
billboard construction permit from the Code Enforcement Officer. Application
for a billboard construction permit must be made on a form provided by the
village. The billboard construction permit is required in addition to a
building permit and any other permit or license required by law or ordinance.
The fee for a billboard construction permit is $70.00 for each billboard face.
A billboard construction permit may not be issued unless approved by the Code
Enforcement Officer as conforming to this chapter and all other applicable
codes.
      (2)   The Code Enforcement Officer has the duty to inspect the
construction of billboards. On determining that the construction has been
completed in accordance with all applicable codes, the Code Enforcement Officer
has the duty to assign a billboard permit number to each billboard face. The
owner of the billboard must permanently display the permit number and the
owner's name on the sign or accompanying structure so that the name and number
are clearly visible from the public right-of-way.
      (3)   If the person displaying the sign is not the owner of record of the
real property on which the sign is displayed, the person shall keep on file and
make available for inspection on demand by the Code Enforcement Officer, the
name and address of the property owner or tenant in possession and
documentation executed by the property owner or tenant in possession
establishing the right of the applicant to display the sign.
      (4)   If a holder of a billboard permit transfers ownership of a
billboard, the person to whom ownership has been transferred must notify the
village in writing of the transfer within 90 days of the transfer and provide
the Code Enforcement Officer  with the name, address and telephone number of
the person responsible for maintaining the sign in compliance with this
chapter.
   (f)   Reconstruction of nonconforming signs prohibited. The structural
support of billboards deemed nonconforming uses under the zoning code may not
be reconstructed, rebuilt, or replaced nor the face area of such signs
increased. Any nonconforming sign damaged or destroyed to the extent of 60
percent or more of its estimated replacement cost at the time of its damage or
destruction may not be repaired, rebuilt, or reconstructed except in conformity
with this chapter.
   (g)   Annual billboard sign permit renewal.
      (1)   By December 31 of every other year beginning in 2011, every person
displaying a billboard must apply to the Code Enforcement Officer for renewal
of every billboard permit for each billboard being displayed. Renewal may be
based on an owner's certification of compliance filed with the Code Enforcement
Officer in accordance with division (g)(2) below of this section or inspection
by the Code Enforcement Officer in accordance with division (g)(3) of this
section.
      (2)   A person displaying a billboard may file with the Code Enforcement
Officer a verified certification that each sign displayed by the person is
being displayed and maintained in accordance with the provisions of this
chapter. The certification must be made on a form prescribed by the Code
Enforcement Officer and filed with the Code Enforcement Officer  by December
31. The certification must be based on inspection of each sign by the applicant
made within 30 days of the certification. The person displaying a billboard
must keep on file and make available for inspection on demand by the Code
Enforcement Officer a written record of each inspection made. The fee for
renewal of a billboard permit based on an owner's certification of compliance
is $20.00 for each sign face.
      (3)   A person displaying a billboard may apply to the Code Enforcement
Officer for inspection of the sign. Application must be made on a form
prescribed by the Code Enforcement Officer and timely filed. The Code
Enforcement Officer has the duty to inspect each sign and determine if it is
being displayed and maintained in accordance with the provisions of this
chapter. The fee for renewal of a billboard permit based on inspection by the
Code Enforcement Officer is $40.00 for each sign face.
      (4)   In the event a person displaying a billboard fails to apply for
renewal and either file a certification pursuant to division (2) above or apply
to the Code Enforcement Officer for inspection pursuant to division (3) in a
timely manner, the Code Enforcement Officer has the duty to inspect each sign
and determine if it is being displayed and maintained in accordance with the
provisions of this chapter. The fee for renewal of a billboard permit based on
inspection by the Code Enforcement Officer made pursuant to this paragraph is
$50.00 for each sign face. If the person displaying a billboard fails to pay
the inspection fee and correct any violations within the time provided by the
Code Enforcement Officer that person is subject to penalty as provided in §
1246.27.
      (5)   If the Code Enforcement Officer finds that a person has falsely
certified that signs displayed by the person are being displayed and maintained
in accordance with the provisions of this chapter, the Code Enforcement Officer
has the duty to reject the certification, require the applicant to file for
renewal pursuant to division (2) of this section and disqualify that person
from renewing permits based on filing an owner's certification of compliance. A
person so disqualified will remain disqualified for five years unless
reinstated pursuant to division (6) of this section.
      (6)   A person disqualified pursuant to division (5) of this section may
request a hearing before the Board of Zoning Appeals to present evidence that
the certification was correct or that the false statements were inadvertent or
the result of careless error. If the Code Enforcement Officer finds that the
certification was correct or that the false statements were inadvertent or the
result of careless error, the Code Enforcement Officer has the duty to issue
permits based on the owner's certification as it may be amended to correct any
misstatement and to remove the disqualification; provided, however, on a second
finding within a five-year period that an owner has filed a false
certification, whether through inadvertence, careless error or otherwise, the
Code Enforcement Officer has the duty to reject the certification, require the
applicant to file for renewal pursuant to division (1) of this section and
disqualify that person from renewing permits based on filing an owner's
certification of compliance for five years.

Screening shall consist of walls, hedges, fences, vegetation, or an acceptable
combination of these elements, provided that screening must be at least six
feet in height.
   (b)   Vegetation used for screening shall have a minimum of 75 percent
opacity at all times within two years of planting.
(Ord. 2012-20, passed 4-17-2012)
§ 1266.09  SCREENING OF EXTERIOR MECHANICAL EQUIPMENT.
   Exterior components of plumbing, processing, heating, cooling, and
ventilating systems (including, but not limited to piping, tanks, stacks,
collectors, heating, cooling, and ventilating-equipment fans, blowers,
ductwork, vents, louvers, meters, compressors, motors, incinerators, ovens,
etc.) shall not be directly visible at ground level. Any landscaping or
structural means employed to screen exterior components of plumbing,
processing, heating, cooling, and ventilating systems from direct view shall
appear as integrated parts of the buildings; shall be constructed of
complementary and durable materials; and finished in a texture and color scheme
complementary to the overall architectural design. Any exterior components of
plumbing, processing, heating, cooling, and ventilating systems and their
screening devices which will be visible from upper floors of adjacent buildings
shall be kept to a visible minimum; shall be installed in a neat and compact
fashion; and shall be painted such a color as to allow their blending with
their visual backgrounds.
(Ord. 2012-20, passed 4-17-2012)
§ 1266.11  SCREENING OF TRASH CONTAINER RECEPTACLES.
   Trash containers shall be screened according to the following minimum
standards:
   (a)   Trash containers designed to service more than one residential unit or
to service a non-residential structure shall be screened on all sides on four
sides by walls, fences, or natural vegetation or an acceptable combination of
these elements.
   (b)   The height of such screening shall be at least six feet. Vegetation
shall have a minimum opaqueness of 75 percent at all times within two years of
planting. The use of evergreen vegetation is encouraged. Vegetation shall be a
variety that will attain six feet in height within two years of planting.
(Ord. 2012-20, passed 4-17-2012)
§ 1266.13  OFF-STREET PARKING AREA LANDSCAPING.
   (a)   Purpose. Landscaping within parking areas, whether ground cover or
upright plant material, is necessary not only to reduce the generation of heat
and water runoff, but to break up visually the expanse of paved areas. The use
of parking islands or peninsulas strategically placed throughout the parking
lot is required to landscape parking lot interiors. The use of shade trees in
these landscape areas is encouraged.
   (b)   Applicability. The provisions of this section apply to nonresidential
parking areas within the R-1, R-2, R-2, RO, GC, HOC, LI and GI districts. If a
requirement for landscaping in conjunction with off-street parking coincides
with any other landscaping or buffer requirement of this chapter, the other
landscaping or buffering requirement shall control.
   (c)   Required landscaping. Any open parking area containing more than 6,000
square feet of area or 15 or more parking spaces shall provide the following
landscaping:
      (1)   Perimeter of parking area.  Except where the parking is adjacent to
a main building, a landscaped perimeter strip of no less than ten feet in width
shall surround the perimeter of the parking lot.  The edge of the parking lot
shall be the edge of the perimeter strip. No parking or pavement shall be
allowed in the perimeter strip except for intersecting drives and walkways. 
One tree is required for every 40 linear feet of perimeter. 
      (2)   Interior parking area landscaping.
         A.   An area equal to five percent of the total area devoted to
parking space and parking lanes shall be landscaped and permeable.
         B.   Whenever possible, large parking areas of 30,000 square feet or
larger shall be designed so as to break up their visual expanse and create the
appearance of smaller parking lots. This distinction or separation can be
achieved by interspersing yard space and buildings in strategic areas and by
taking advantage of natural features such as slope, existing woodland or
vegetation, drainage courses, and retention areas.
         C.   Landscaping in parking areas shall be dispersed throughout in
peninsulas or islands. The minimum island or peninsula size shall be 180 square
feet with a two-foot minimum distance between all trees or shrubs and the edge
of pavement where vehicles overhang and should have a minimum width of ten
feet. Islands shall typically be located every 12 parking spaces and shall be
curbed.
         D.   The required plant materials for the interior of parking areas
shall be one deciduous tree for every 3,000 square feet.
(Ord. 2012-20, passed 4-17-2012)
§ 1266.15  GROUND SIGN LANDSCAPING.
   (a)   Signage that is required to comply with this Zoning Code per the
requirements of §
1264.03 Scope, is also subject to the requirements of §
1266.15 Ground Sign Landscaping if it is one of the following sign types:
      (1)   Ground sign;
      (2)   Pole sign;
      (3)   Monument sign; or
      (4)   Subdivision entry sign.
   (b)   Landscaped area shall be required around the base of a sign and shall
be the greater of the two formulations:
      (1)   Two square feet per one square foot of sign area; or
      (2)   Two feet horizontal distance on all sides of the sign's perimeter.
   (c)   Plant material should be selected with careful consideration for
height so as to prevent blocking the sign's graphic and message.
(Ord. 2012-20, passed 4-17-2012)
§ 1266.17  PLANT MATERIAL SPECIFICATIONS.
   The following sections include specifications for plant materials.
Alternatives to these materials that can be shown to meet both the intent and
requirements of this Zoning Code may be approved by the Planning Commission as
part of a site plan:
   (a)   Shrubs. Shrubs shall be at least 24 inches  average height and spread
at the time of planting and, where required for screening, shall form a
continuous, year-round, solid visual screen within five years after planting.
   (b)   Ground cover and grass. Ground cover shall be planted a minimum of
eight inches on center and shall be planted in such a manner to present a
finished appearance and 75 percent coverage after one complete growing season.
If approved as part of a site plan, ground cover may also consist of rocks,
pebbles, wood chips, grass alternatives and other material.
   (c)   Prohibited tree species. Within any required landscaping, the
following tree species may not be used:
      (1)   Box Elder Tree of Heaven Catalpa;
      (2)   Black Walnut Poplar Willow Mulberry;
      (3)   Mountain Ash Siberian Elm Black Locust;
      (4)   Hickory;
      (5)   Female Gingko;
      (6)   Emerald Ash Borer;
      (7)   In addition to the specific species listed above, trees which
produce nuts, seeds, or fruit that can create a hazard to pedestrians or
vehicles, shall not be planted in such a manner that the natural drip line of
an average adult tree of the species planted will be any closer than three feet
of a pedestrian walkway or parking lot.
(Ord. 2012-20, passed 4-17-2012)
§ 1266.19  MAINTENANCE AND REPLACEMENT REQUIREMENTS.
   The owner shall be responsible for maintaining all landscaping in good
condition to present a healthy, neat, and orderly appearance. This should be
accomplished by the following standards:
   (a)   All plant growth in landscaped areas shall be controlled by pruning,
trimming, or other suitable methods so that plant materials do not interfere
with public utilities, restrict pedestrian or vehicular access, or otherwise
constitute a traffic hazard.
   (b)   All planted areas shall be maintained in a relatively weed-free
condition, clear of undesirable undergrowth, and free from refuse and debris.
   (c)   Replacement plants shall conform to the standards that govern original
installation. Dead or unhealthy plants shall be replaced within the next
planting season.
   (d)   Where practicable, an irrigation system should be installed in
accordance with the requirements of this chapter.
   (e)   The Code Enforcement Officer shall have the authority to inspect
landscaping and check it against the approved plan on file.
(Ord. 2012-20, passed 4-17-2012)
§ 1266.21  CLEAR SIGHT DISTANCE AT STREET AND ACCESS ROAD INTERSECTIONS.
   (a)   Purpose. To insure that landscape materials do not constitute a
driving hazard, a “clear sight triangle” will be observed at all street
intersections or intersections or driveways with streets.
   (b)   Definition. A clear sight triangle is the triangular area formed by a
diagonal line connecting two points located on intersecting right-of-way lines
(or a right-of-way line and the edge of an access road), each point being 15
feet from the intersection, and the two intersecting right-of-way lines (or a
right-of-way line and an access road). See Figure 1266.21-A on the following
page.
   (c)   Design.  The entire area of the clear sight triangle should be
designed as illustrated in Figure 1266.21-A to provide the driver of the
vehicle entering the intersection with an unobstructed view to all points nine
feet above the roadway along the centerline.  The recommended distance depends
upon the design speed of the higher-order street and therefore is greater for
arterial streets than for collectors.
   (d)   Restrictions within clear sight triangles.  Within the sight triangle
no landscape material with a height greater than 12 inches shall be permitted
with the exception of trees that conform to the following standards. Trees
shall be permitted within the sight triangles as long as, except during early
growth stages, only the tree trunk (no limbs, leaves, etc.) is visible between
the ground and nine feet above the ground, or otherwise does not present a
traffic visibility hazard. Restrictions shall not apply to the following:
      (1)   Existing natural grades which, by reason of natural topography,
rise 12 or more inches above the level of the center of the adjacent
intersection;
      (2)   Fire hydrants, public utility poles, street markers, governmental
signs, and traffic control devices.

and common carrier exchange access services.
(Ord. 2012-20, passed 4-17-2012)
§ 1268.05  APPLICATION PROCEDURE.
   (a)   Any person or company intending to apply for the placement or
operation of a wireless communications antenna, or site within the village
shall first schedule a pre-application conference with the Village
Administrator or his assignee.  At this conference, the prospective applicant
must present to the Village Administrator or his assignee any proposed
locations for the equipment or site, also demonstrating the need for a tower
and that all alternatives to the construction of a new tower, such as co-
location, have been exhausted.  This information should identify the area
within which the tower may be located, the maximum height of the proposed tower
and identify any possible users that may co-locate at the site.  The purpose of
the pre-application conference will be to evaluate the impact on adjacent areas
and neighborhoods, discuss possibilities of co-location, and identify
alternative suitable sites that may minimize the negative impact on residential
areas.
   (b)   Upon completion of the pre-application conference, an application may
be filed with the office of the Village Administrator. The application shall be
in compliance with the provisions of this chapter, and in compliance with all
applicable provisions of the Village Zoning Code except those in conflict with
this chapter, and in such form as approved by the Village Administrator.  If
the application does not conform with said provisions, the applicant shall be
notified by the Village Administrator and no further consideration of the
application shall occur until it is in compliance with the terms of the
ordinance.
   (c)   The application fee for a wireless communication system, tower,
antenna, or site shall be $2,000 for each proposed location and $500 for each
new user proposing to co-locate.
(Ord. 2012-20, passed 4-17-2012)
§ 1268.07  USE REGULATIONS.
   The following use regulations shall apply to wireless communications
antennas and towers:
   (a)   A wireless communications site, subject to this chapter, may be
permitted as follows within GI, General Industrial and LI, Light Industrial
zoning districts, provided such wireless communication otherwise complies with
this chapter.
   (b)   Wireless communications sites in a zoning district or area where such
use is permitted shall not be located any closer to any residential zoning
district than as follows:
      (1)   If a wireless communication tower is 100 feet or less in height,
the site shall be located no closer than 500 feet to any residential zoning
district.
      (2)   For any wireless communication tower exceeding 100 feet in height,
the site may not be located closer to any residential zoning district than a
distance equal to 500 feet plus two feet for each foot of height that the tower
exceeds 100 feet.
   (c)   A wireless communications antenna may be mounted to or within an
existing structure, such as a communications tower (whether said tower is for
wireless purposes or not), smoke stack, steeple, water tower or other tall
structures in any zoning district or area where a wireless communication site
is permitted.  Wireless communication antenna may only be placed on the top of
buildings that are greater than 35 feet in height.
   (d)   Micro antennas may be placed on any buildings in a zoning district or
area where a wireless communication site is permitted.  A micro antenna shall
not be subject to the set back requirements of other wireless communication
towers provided it is placed on the roof of an existing building.
   (e)   All other uses accessory to the wireless communications antenna and
towers including , but not limited to business offices, maintenance depots, and
materials and vehicle storage, are prohibited from the site unless otherwise
permitted in the zoning district in which the wireless communications antenna
and/or tower is located.
(Ord. 2012-20, passed 4-17-2012)
§ 1268.09  STANDARDS FOR LOCATION OF WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS ANTENNAS AND
TOWERS.
   (a)   The following standards shall apply to all wireless communications
antennas and towers:
      (1)   The wireless communications company shall demonstrate, using the
latest technological evidence, why the antenna or tower must be placed in a
proposed location in order to serve its necessary function in the company's
grid system.  Part of this demonstration shall include a drawing showing the
boundaries of the area around the proposed location which would probably also
permit the antenna to function properly in the company's grid system. This area
shall be considered the allowable zone.
      (2)   If the communications company proposes to build a wireless
communications tower (as opposed to mounting the antenna on an existing
structure), it is required to demonstrate that it has contacted the owners of
any nearby tall structures within the allowable district or area, asked for
permission to install the communications antenna on those structures, and was
denied for either non-economic reasons or that a clearly unreasonable economic
demand was made by the owner, based on prevailing market values.
   (b)   The village may deny the application to construct a new wireless
communications tower if the applicant has not made a good faith effort to mount
the antenna on existing structures.
(Ord. 2012-20, passed 4-17-2012)
§ 1268.11  STANDARDS FOR APPROVAL OF ALL WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS ANTENNAS AND
TOWERS.
   (a)   Antenna/tower height. The applicant shall demonstrate that the planned
height of a wireless communications tower is no higher than necessary to
function satisfactorily and to accommodate the co-location requirements as set
out in Subsection 1268.05.  No tower that is taller than the necessary height
shall be approved, and the height of any tower to be greater than 200 feet must
first be approved by the Planning Commission.  Towers shall be monopole
construction unless it is demonstrated upon application that another type of
tower is required for safety purposes and it has been approved by the Planning
Commission.
   (b)   Setbacks from the base of the tower. If a new wireless communications
tower is to be constructed in an industrial zoning district, the minimum
distance between the base of the tower, or if so supported, between any guy
wire anchors supporting the tower, and any property line which abuts a zoning
district other than a residential district shall be no closer to that district
than the greater of 50 percent of the tower height or 50 feet.
   (c)   Wireless communications tower safety. All wireless communications
towers shall be fitted with anti-climbing devices as approved by the
manufacturers.  Furthermore, the applicant shall demonstrate that the proposed
wireless communications tower and its antenna are safe and that the surrounding
properties will not be negatively affected by tower failure, falling ice or
other debris, electromagnetic fields or radio frequency interference.  However,
if a specific safety issue in question is determined to be regulated by either
FCC Regulations or applicable Building Code regulations, and the operation or
construction is in compliance with such regulations, then this requirement for
safety shall be deemed to have been met.  Subsequent to the installation of a
wireless communications tower site, if it is determined by the Village Council,
upon presentation of proper and sufficient documentation, and after a public
hearing, that the operation of a wireless communications tower is inherently
dangerous or is a demonstrable health hazard, the wireless communication tower
shall be declared to be a nuisance and all operation shall cease.  The tower or
antenna shall also be removed as provided under §
1268.15 of this chapter.  However, no order of removal shall be made if it is
inconsistent with any provisions herein or with any existing FCC Regulations.
   (d)   Fencing. A fence or wall shall be required around the wireless
communications tower and its support structure(s), unless the antenna is
mounted on an existing structure.  The fence shall be a minimum of eight feet
in height and shall be erected to prevent access to non-authorized personnel.
   (e)   Landscaping. Landscaping in compliance with a plan approved by the
Village Administrator or his assignee, shall be provided to screen as much of
the support structure and ground level features as is possible.  In addition,
existing vegetation on and around the site shall be preserved to the greatest
extent possible.
   (f)   Limiting the number of wireless communications towers. In order to
reduce the number of antenna support structures needed in the village, the
owner of an existing wireless communications tower shall not unreasonably deny
a request to accommodate other users, including other wireless communications
companies, and the antenna of local or joint police, fire, and ambulance
department.  Nothing contained herein is intended to prevent the owner of the
existing wireless communications tower from receiving reasonable compensation
for the use of its tower by commercial users. Unless waived for good cause by
the Planning Commission to minimize impact on adjoining property, for the
purposes of encouraging co-location of wireless antenna and other users,
wireless communication towers shall be designed, engineered, and constructed as
follows:
      (1)   Towers less than 75 feet tall shall be designed, engineered and
constructed to support antennas installed by at least two wireless
communication service users;
      (2)   Towers more than 75 feet in height, but less than 150 feet shall be
designed, engineered and constructed to support antennas installed by at least
three wireless communication service users; and
      (3)   Towers 150 feet in height or taller shall be designed, engineered
and constructed to support antennas installed by at least four wireless
communication service users.
      (4)   As used in divisions (1), (2) and (3) above, the term "users" shall
include the antennas of police, fire and ambulance departments.  In addition,
an applicant must demonstrate that the area acquired by lease or otherwise
acquired for the use and construction of the tower and accessory structures is
sufficient in size to accommodate any additional structures that may be
required if additional users are added to the tower.
   (g)   Licensing. The communications company must demonstrate to the village
that it is licensed by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC). The owner
of the tower must also annually provide to the village no later than January 31
of each year, and at such time as a new user is added, a list of all users of
the tower and each user shall provide the village with a copy of that user's
license with the FCC.  No approval will be granted to any applicant or user
unless proof of a current FCC license for the proposed use of the tower is
provided.
   (h)   Access. Access to the wireless communications site shall be paved with
concrete or asphalt, and the perimeter of the access drive and parking lot
shall be curbed.
   (i)   Required parking. If the wireless communications site is fully
automated, adequate parking shall be required for maintenance workers.  If the
site is not fully automated, the number of required parking spaces shall equal
the number of employees working on the largest shift.  All parking
specifications and requirements shall be consistent with the applicable parking
requirements as established in the Village's Code of Ordinances.
   (j)   Appearance. Wireless communications towers under 200 feet in height
shall be painted silver or have a galvanized finish retained, or be finished
with a neutral color matching its background in order to reduce visual impact. 
The applicant shall demonstrate that the proposed wireless communication tower
is the least aesthetically intrusive facility for the neighborhood and
function.  It is further recommended that all buildings and structures be
architecturally compatible with the neighborhood and function.  Wireless
communications towers may not be artificially lighted except when required by
the FAA.  Furthermore, no wireless communication tower or antenna and accessory
buildings and structures shall contain any signage except safety signage.  All
utility lines serving the towers shall be underground, unless there is a
demonstrated safety hazard created by underground installation.
   (k)   Site plan and documentation required. A full site plan shall be
required for all proposed wireless communications sites, except antenna to be
placed on existing structures, at a reasonable scale, but not smaller than 1
inch to 20 feet (1" = 20'), indicating, as a minimum, the following:
      (1)   The total area of the site and the identity of the owners(s).
      (2)   The existing zoning of the property in question and existing zoning
and ownership of all adjacent properties.
      (3)   All public and private right-of-way and easement lines located on
or adjacent to the property which is proposed to be continued, created,
relocated or abandoned.
      (4)   Existing topography with a maximum of five foot contours intervals.
      (5)   The proposed finished grade of the development shown by contours
not exceeding five foot intervals.
      (6)   The location of all existing buildings and structures and the
proposed location of the wireless communications tower and all wireless
communications support structures including dimensions, heights, and where
applicable, the gross floor area of the buildings.
      (7)   The locations and dimensions of all curb cuts, driving lanes, off-
street parking and loading areas including the number of spaces, grades,
surfacing materials, drainage plans and illumination of the facility.
      (8)   All existing and proposed sidewalks and open areas on the site.
      (9)   The location of all proposed fences, screening and walls.
      (10)   The location of all existing and proposed streets.
      (11)   All existing and proposed utilities including types and grades.
      (12)   The schedule of any phasing of the project.
      (13)   Documentation which shows all buildings and structures on adjacent
lots and any additional lot which has a lot line within 500 feet of the lot on
which the tower is proposed to be located, and the identity of the owner(s). 
The approximate elevation of the highest point of each building or structure
shall be noted.  Applicant may identify any additional features in the area
(such as existing screening, fences and topography) which may be helpful in
considering the impact of the proposed tower on nearby property.
      (14)   A report for all proposed wireless communication sites, except
antenna to e placed on existing structures, to include: a description of the
tower with technical reasons for its design; documentation establishing the
structural integrity for the tower's proposed uses; the general capacity of the
tower, and information necessary to assure that ANSI standards are met; a
statement of intent on whether excess space on the tower will be leased; proof
of ownership of the proposed site or authorization to utilize it; and a visual
study depicting “where within the village limits any portion of the proposed
tower could be seen.”
      (15)   Any other information as may be required to determine the
conformance with this Code and any applicable provisions of the Building and
Zoning Codes.
   (l)   Notwithstanding the foregoing division, for wireless communications
antenna to be placed on an existing structure, with no new tower to be erected,
the applicant need submit to the Village Administrator only such information as
is required to insure compliance with the applicable provisions of this chapter
and the Building and Zoning Codes, including but not limited to, FCC licensing,
safety provisions as to the antenna and authorization to utilize the site.
(Ord. 2012-20, passed 4-17-2012)
§ 1268.13  MAINTENANCE.
   Any owner or person in charge of property used as a wireless communications
site shall maintain such property and all structures in good condition and free
from trash, outdoor storage, weeds and other debris, and the Village
Administrator or his designee may inspect the property at any reasonable time
to assure that such property is properly maintained.  Any owner of a wireless
communications tower shall, at least 30 days in advance, notify the Village
Administrator in writing of its intent to discontinue operation or service, or
transfer of ownership.
(Ord. 2012-20, passed 4-17-2012)
§ 1268.15  REMOVAL.
   (a)   Any wireless communications tower that has discontinued its service
for a period of six continuous months or more is hereby determined to be a
nuisance.  A tower declared to be a nuisance, must be removed, along with all
accessory structures related thereto, and the property restored to its former
condition.  DISCONTINUED  shall mean that the structure has not been properly
maintained, has been abandoned, become obsolete, or is unused or has ceased the
daily activities or operations which had occurred.
   (b)   Whenever, upon inspection, it shall appear that a wireless
communications tower or site has been abandoned or its use discontinued, and
its removal is directed by the Village Council, the Village Administrator or a
designated representative shall notify, either by personal delivery or by
certified mail, the owner or person in charge of the property on which the
tower is located that the tower must be taken down and removed.  The Village
Administrator or a designated representative, in addition to any other
citations, notices, penalties or remedies provided by law or ordinance, is
authorized to proceed in a manner consistent with and pursuant to Ohio R.C. §§
715.26 and 715.261 to maintain the public health, safety and welfare and to
recover costs as appropriate.

Chapter 1026.
   (h)   Home occupations. The purpose of this section is to set forth
regulations that control the establishment and operation of home occupations.
The intent of these regulations is to control the nonresidential use of a
residential dwelling unit so that the nonresidential use is limited in size and
scope and does not disrupt the residential character of the neighborhood in
which it is located. A home occupation may only be permitted within a
residential dwelling unit within the village if it meets all of the
requirements set forth in divisions (h)(1) through (10) below.
      (1)   Prior to establishing a home occupation, the owner or occupant of
the dwelling shall apply and receive approval for a zoning certificate issued
by the Code Enforcement Officer.
      (2)   The home occupation shall be clearly incidental and secondary in
importance to the use of the dwelling for dwelling purposes.
      (3)   No home occupation shall be permitted in any accessory building.
      (4)   Any on-site business related in any manner to the home occupation
shall be conducted by occupants of the dwelling unit.
      (5)   The business activity, including the storage of equipment, supplies
or any apparatus used in the home occupation, shall be conducted entirely
within the dwelling unit and no use of a garage, an accessory building or an
outdoor area shall be permitted. Any activity, material, goods, or equipment
indicative of the proposed use shall be carried on, utilized or stored within
the dwelling unit and shall not be visible from any public way or adjacent
property.
      (6)   A home occupation may be conducted in any area of the principal
dwelling including the basement provided such home occupation shall occupy no
more than one room in the dwelling unit or an area equal to 20 percent of the
area of the main floor of the dwelling unit, whichever is greater. The area of
an attached garage shall not be included when calculating the area of the main
floor of the dwelling unit.
      (7)   The business activity shall only use customary home equipment and
shall not create a nuisance by reason of generating any noise, odor, dust,
vibrations, fumes, smoke, electromagnetic interference or truck or delivery
vehicle traffic which would depreciate or change the residential character of
the neighborhood in which the proposed use is located.
      (8)   There shall not be any sign or change in the outside appearance of
the building or premises, or other visible exterior change related to the home
occupation, except for a name plate that is maximum one square foot in area
that may indicate the occupant's name and type of occupation.
      (9)   The business activity shall not constitute a fire hazard
endangering the site of the home occupation and adjoining property sites. There
shall be no storage of hazardous, combustible or flammable matter, accumulation
of rubbish or waste paper, and storage of cartons and/or boxes situated in a
manner that would endanger life or property in case of an actual fire.
      (10)   The business activity shall not cause an increase in the use of
any public utility (water, sewer, electric, sanitation, etc.) in such a manner
that the use of the utility for the residence and home occupation exceeds the
average use for residences in the neighborhood of the proposed use.
      (11)   There shall not be regular selling of goods or service,
deliveries, and/or other activities which result in the number of automobiles
or trucks attracted to the premises being greater than that which is normally
associated with residential uses, including normal fluctuations in the level of
residential activities.
   (i)   Outdoor lighting.
      (1)   Purpose.  The regulations established in this division are designed
and intended to prevent excessive spillover of light and glare from the zoning
lot on which the light source is located.  The standards contained in this
division are deemed to be the minimum standards necessary to prevent nuisance
and adverse impacts on the public health, safety, and welfare.
      (2)   Outdoor lighting for single-family dwellings in Residential and
Residential Office Districts. Where lamp posts and similar lighting fixtures
which are for the purpose of illuminating walks and drives are used in
conjunction with single-family dwellings within the Residential District, the
light may not exceed 0.5 footcandle at all property lines, with the exception
of such lights that may occur at driveway entrances, in which case they must
not exceed 0.5 footcandle at the street right-of-way line;
      (3)   Outdoor lighting in all Non-Residential Districts or for Non-
Residential uses within the Residential District.
         A.   Applicability.  All exterior lighting in non-residential
districts and in conjunction with non-residential uses occurring in the
Residential District, except street lighting and other village-owned lighting,
shall comply with the following standards.
         B.   Conditional use.  Any outdoor lighting to which this section
applies that cannot meet the minimum requirements of this section, must obtain
a conditional use permit pursuant to
Chapter 1280.
         C.   All outdoor lighting shall be designed and located such that the
maximum illumination measured in footcandles at the property line shall not
exceed 1.0.
         D.   All outdoor lighting for non-residential uses shall be located,
screened, or shielded so that adjacent residential uses are not directly
illuminated.
         E.   No outdoor lighting shall be of such an intensity or brilliance
as to cause glare or to impair the vision of drivers.
         F.   The following factors shall be considered in the evaluation of
lighting plans:
            1.   Pole height;
            2.   Type of luminaire;
            3.   Site coverage - average maintained;
            4.   Uniformity;
            5.   Intensity at property line.

only to a single building or a single parcel of land, the setback requirement
shall be met if the turbine is placed so that no portion of a rotor blade
extends closer than five feet to the utility line.
            2.   Residential. With respect to proximity to the boundaries of
parcels within a Residential District, a wind turbine shall be set back from
the property line a minimum distance equal to two times the height of the wind
turbine. In the case of a wind turbine that does not exceed 35 feet in height
and is located in a Residential District, the wind turbine shall be set back at
least 15 feet from all property lines, and no portion of a rotor blade shall
extend closer than five feet to any lot line.
         B.   The height of a ground-mounted wind turbine shall be limited by
the setback requirements of this section. The height of a rooftop or other
building-mounted wind turbine shall not exceed the maximum permitted building
height for the property by more than 20 cent.  For a rooftop or other building-
mounted wind turbine that exceeds the maximum permitted building height by more
than 20 percent the Village Planning Commission, after a public hearing, may
approve a greater height if the Commission determines that the placement of the
turbine and context of the turbine site will mitigate any significant negative
visual or safety impacts on nearby properties.
         C.    Small wind energy systems shall not exceed 45 decibels, as
measured at the closest neighboring inhabited dwelling. The level, however, may
be exceeded during short-term events such as utility outages and/or severe
windstorms.
         D.   Wall wind energy systems shall be equipped with manual
(electronic or mechanical) and automatic over speed controls to limit the blade
rotation speed to within the design limits of the wind energy system.
         E.   Small wind energy systems shall be accompanied by a line drawing
showing the electrical components in sufficient detail to allow for a
determination that the manner of installation conforms to the National
Electrical Code.
         F.   A capacity of not more than ten kilowatts maximum power.
         G.   No small wind energy system shall be installed until evidence has
been given that the utility company has been informed of the customer's intent
to install an interconnected customer owned generator. Off-grid systems shall
be exempt from this requirement.
   (f)   Conditional use permit for wind turbine systems.
      (1)   Building permit required.  No wind energy facility, or addition of
a wind turbine to an existing wind energy facility, shall be constructed or
located within the village unless the Village Planning Commission has approved

use approval. Solar panels mounted on primary structures are considered to be
appurtenances and subject to applicable code restrictions in each zoning
district.  The amount of solar panels that may be installed may be no more than
is necessary to serve the needs of the structures located on the parcel.
            1.   Solar panels on principal structure in Residential Districts. 
If the solar panels are within a Residential District, they must be attached to
a building, must be installed parallel to the roof slope, and project no more
than 12 inches from the roof surface.  If an applicant wishes to install solar
panels within a Residential District contrary to these requirements, a variance
is required.
         B.   Location with conditional use. Conditional use approval is
required in accordance with Chapter 1280 when the solar panel energy conversion
system is a stand-alone facility.  Free-standing solar panels are considered to
be accessory uses, subject to accessory use code and zoning and building permit
requirements in each zoning district, however they shall not be counted as
contributing to the total square footage of accessory uses/structures.
            1.   Solar panels not on principal structure in Residential
Districts.  Solar panels within the Residential District that are located
anywhere except on the principal structure are prohibited.
      (2)   Mounting requirements.  Solar panels must be installed in
accordance with the manufacturer's design and operation standards as well as

      (4)   On-site transmission and power lines between alternative energy
systems shall, to the maximum extent practicable, be placed underground.
   (j)   Exemptions for alternative energy systems located on village-owned
property.
      (1)   Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, any small wind
energy system or solar panel located on property owned by the village may be
exempted from any provision of this chapter (except those provisions relating
to permit and inspection fees), provided that any proposal for such a system
will be reviewed by the Planning Commission, which may recommend exemption from
such sections of this chapter as are deemed practicable by the Commission, and
further provided that Council may determine on a case-by-case basis whether to
grant such an exemption.
      (2)   In granting or denying any exemption hereunder, Council shall
consider the recommendation of the Planning Commission, if any, but is not
bound by said recommendation.
      (3)   Notwithstanding any provision contained in this section to the
contrary, Council may initiate and approve an exemption from any provision of
this chapter (except those pertaining to permit and inspection fees) for any
small wind turbine systems or solar panels to be located on village property
without prior recommendation of the Planning Commission.
   (k)   Dismantling and removal of alternative energy systems. If the property
upon which a small wind turbine facility or solar panel is located, sold or
otherwise transferred, or the wind turbine or solar panel structure is in any
way abandoned or neglected or becomes dilapidated, the seller or conveyor of
such premises shall cause the facility to be dismantled completely, including
all support structures and appurtenances, and removed from the property.
However, if the purchase contract or other means of conveyance provides
specifically for the wind turbine facility or solar panel  to remain in place
for use by the successive possessor of the property, then this section shall
not apply.
   (l)   Variances. The Board of Zoning Appeals may vary or permit exceptions
to any of the provisions of this chapter if it finds that such variance or
exception will not violate the spirit or intent of this chapter and that a more
harmonious and useful development will result.

§ 1276.03  PURPOSE.
   The use interpretation authority established by this section is intended to
recognize that the provisions of this Zoning Code cannot possibly address every
specific use which may occur. Many such uses, however, can be readily addressed
by an interpretation of this Zoning Code in light of the general and specific
purposes for which the Zoning Code has been enacted.
(Ord. 2012-20, passed 4-17-2012)
§ 1276.05  PARTIES ENTITLED TO SEEK SIMILAR USE DETERMINATIONS.
   Applications for similar use determinations may be filed by any property
owner or his or her agent; provided, however, that similar use determinations
shall not be sought by any person based solely on hypothetical facts or where
the interpretation would have no effect other than as an advisory opinion.
(Ord. 2012-20, passed 4-17-2012)
§ 1276.07  PROCEDURE.
   (a)   Application. Applications for similar use determinations shall be
filed in accordance with the requirements of
Chapter 1276.
   (b)   Action by Code Enforcement Officer.  Upon receipt of a properly
completed application for a similar use interpretation, the Code Enforcement
Officer shall forthwith transmit to the Planning Commission for its review and
recommendation to the Village Council.

CHAPTER 1278:  NONCONFORMING USES AND STRUCTURES
Section
1278.01   Purpose
1278.03   Nonconforming use of structures and land
1278.05   Nonconforming structure
1278.07   Nonconforming parking facilities
1278.09   Nonconforming signs

§ 1278.01  PURPOSE.
   (a)   The purpose of this chapter is to recognize the existence of lots,
uses, structures and structures that lawfully existed at the time enactment of
this Zoning Code, or amendment thereto, but which now do not conform with one
or more of the regulations contained in this Zoning Code. Nonconforming status
is considered to be incompatible with permitted uses in the zoning district in
which it exists. Therefore, nonconforming uses, structures, lots, and
structures are subject to regulations limiting their use, restoration,
reconstruction, extension, and substitution. Such nonconforming status shall be
continued only in conformance with this Zoning Code.
   (b)   A nonconforming lot, use, structure does not include nonconformity
with regulations pursuant to a legally granted variance from a zoning
regulation.
(Ord. 2012-20, passed 4-17-2012)
§ 1278.03  NONCONFORMING USE OF STRUCTURES AND LAND.
   A use of structure or land, or structure and land in combination, existing
lawfully on the effective date of this Zoning Code, or any amendment thereto,
but which does not conform to the use regulations of the district in which it
is located, is a nonconforming use. A nonconforming use may continue so long as
it remains otherwise lawful and does not constitute a public nuisance, subject
to the following provisions:
   (a)   Alteration or reconstruction of a structure occupied by a
nonconforming use. No structure occupied by a nonconforming use shall be
reconstructed or structurally altered unless the use thereof is changed to a
use permitted in the district in which the structure is located.
   (b)   Enlargement or expansion of nonconforming use of structures or land. 
A nonconforming use of a structure or land shall not be physically enlarged,
expanded, or relocated to a part of the lot that was not occupied by the use at
the time it became nonconforming.
   (c)   Change or substitution of use.  A nonconforming use of a structure,
structure or land shall not be changed or substituted to another nonconforming
use unless the Board of Zoning Appeals, finds that the use proposed is equally
appropriate or more appropriate to the district than the existing nonconforming
use, and that the use proposed is in less conflict with the character of uses
permitted in the applicable zoning district than the existing nonconforming
use. In permitting such change, the Board of Zoning Appeals may require
appropriate conditions and safeguards in accordance with other provisions of
this Zoning Code to lessen or minimize the impact of the nonconforming use.
Whenever a nonconforming use is changed to a less intensive use, such use shall
not thereafter be changed to a more intensive nonconforming use.
   (d)   Discontinuance of use. Discontinuance of the nonconforming use of a
structure, part of a structure, lot or part of a lot for a continuous period of
12 months or longer shall constitute voluntary abandonment of such use and
thereafter any use of the premises shall conform to the use regulations of the
district in which the structure or lot is located.
   (e)   Damage or destruction. In the event a structure that is occupied by a
nonconforming use is destroyed by any means to the extent of 60 percent  or
more of the total market value of the improvements, as currently listed by the
Hamilton County Auditor, it shall not be rebuilt, restored or re-occupied for
any use unless such use conforms to the use regulations of the district in
which the structure is located.
(Ord. 2012-20, passed 4-17-2012)
§ 1278.05  NONCONFORMING STRUCTURES.
   A structure existing lawfully on the effective date of this Zoning Code, or
any amendment thereto, but which does not conform to the area or width of the
lot, yard dimensions, lot coverage, height of structure or other regulations of
the district in which it is located, is a nonconforming structure. A
nonconforming structure may continue to be used or occupied by a use permitted
in the district in which it is located so long as it remains otherwise lawful
and does not constitute a public nuisance, subject to the following provisions:
   (a)   Maintenance and repair. Ordinary repairs, or repair or replacement of
non load-bearing walls, fixtures, wiring, driveways or plumbing may be
performed on a nonconforming structure or on any portion thereof provided,
however, no structural parts shall be replaced except when required by law to
restore such structure to a safe condition or to make the structure conform to
the regulations of the district in which it is located.
   (b)   Enlargements or extensions. A nonconforming structure shall not be
enlarged or extended unless:
      (1)   The original structure is made to conform to the regulations of the
district in which it is located; or
      (2)   The proposed extension is in compliance with the regulations of the
district in which it is located, and will not increase any existing
nonconformity in any other portion of the structure; or
      (3)   The structure extension will reduce a nonconforming condition.
   (c)   Moving. A nonconforming structure shall not be moved in whole or in
part to any other location on the lot or to another premises unless the
structure is made to conform to the regulations of the district in which it is
to be located.
   (d)   Change in principal use of structure. The principal use of a
nonconforming structure may be changed to any other use permitted in the
district in which it is located, so long as the new use complies with all the
regulations of this Zoning Code specified for such use.
   (e)   Restoration of damaged structure. If a nonconforming structure is
damaged or destroyed by any cause to the extent of less than 60 percent of the
total market value of the improvements, as currently listed by the Hamilton
County Auditor, those portions so destroyed or damaged may be restored to the
original footprint and floor area of the structure. Any restoration that
exceeds the original footprint and/or floor area must be made to conform to the
regulations of the district in which the structure is located. All repairs and
restorations shall be in compliance with the following conditions:
      (1)   A zoning certificate authorizing such restoration shall be
obtained.
      (2)   Such restoration shall be completed within a period of one year
from the date of damage or destruction.
      (3)   Such restoration shall not cause a new nonconformity, nor shall it
increase the degree of nonconformity or noncompliance existing prior to such
damage or destruction.
      (4)   Any nonconforming structure destroyed by any means to the extent of
more than 60 percent of the total market value of the improvements, as
currently listed by the Hamilton County Auditor, shall require approval by the
Board of Zoning Appeals prior to restoration.
   (f)   Reducing a nonconforming site condition on a single-family lot. If an
enlargement, extension or relocation of a nonconforming structure on a single-
family lot is proposed that will result in a reduction in the existing
nonconformity, then such enlargement, extension or relocation may be permitted.
A zoning certificate authorizing the reduction of a nonconforming site
condition shall be approved by the Code Enforcement Officer.

§ 1278.07  NONCONFORMING PARKING FACILITIES.
   A structure or use existing lawfully on the effective date of this Zoning
Code, or an amendment thereto, that does not comply with the off-street parking
regulations, may be occupied by the existing structure or use without modifying
such parking facilities. In the event that an existing structure is altered or
a use is changed or substituted in accordance with these regulations, then off-
street parking shall be provided in accordance with the numerical and design
requirements of Chapter 1262 for the intended use.
(Ord. 2012-20, passed 4-17-2012)
§ 1278.09  NONCONFORMING SIGNS.
   A sign, lawfully existing on the effective date of this Zoning Code, or any
amendment thereto, but which fails to conform to the sign regulations of the

shall comply with the regulations of this chapter and Chapter 1264.
(Ord. 2012-20, passed 4-17-2012)
§ 1278.11  NONCONFORMING LOTS.
   A lot of record that does not comply on the effective date of this Zoning
Code, or any amendment thereto, with the lot area or lot width regulations of
the district in which the lot is located may be used as follows:
   (a)   Existing dwelling on a residential lot. If the lot is occupied by a
dwelling, such dwelling shall be maintained and may be repaired, modernized or
altered, provided that the structure shall not be enlarged in floor area unless
the enlarged section(s) complies with all regulations of this Zoning Code,
except the lot area and lot width regulations of the district in which the lot
is located. The number of dwelling units shall not be increased unless all
regulations, including lot area, are in compliance with this Zoning Code.
   (b)   Vacant single nonconforming lot of record. A vacant non-conforming lot
that is in separate ownership and not of continuous frontage with other lots in
the same ownership shall be permitted to be developed or redeveloped as a site
for a single-family dwelling provided that the dwelling and its accessory uses
comply with all regulations of this Zoning Code, except the lot area and lot
width regulations of the district in which the lot is located.
   (c)   Lots in combination. If a vacant nonconforming lot adjoins one or more
lots, all of which are controlled or pending control of a person or entity
intending to redevelop the property jointly, such lot shall be re-platted to
create conforming lots as a prerequisite for development.

(Ord. 2012-20, passed 4-17-2012)
§ 1278.15  CHANGE FROM NONCONFORMING USE.
   A nonconforming structure or use shall cease to be considered as such
whenever it first comes into compliance with the regulations of the district in
which it is located. Upon such compliance, no nonconforming use shall be made,
resumed or reinstated.
(Ord. 2012-20, passed 4-17-2012)

lawfully created or established in accordance with the zoning regulations in
existence at that time. If the evidence submitted indicates the lot, structure,
structure or use was legally established and has since become nonconforming
because of the establishment of or amendment to this Zoning Code, the Code
Enforcement Officer shall issue a certificate of nonconforming use. This
certificate shall specify the reason why the use, structure, structure or lot

of the extent and kind of use made of the property in question, the portion of
the structure or land used for the nonconforming use, and the extent that
dimensional requirements are nonconforming.
(Ord. 2012-20, passed 4-17-2012)
§ 1278.19  EXISTING USE DEEMED CONDITIONAL USE; PERMIT REQUIRED FOR CHANGE.
   Any lawfully existing use that, at the time of its establishment, was not
classified as a conditional use, but which now, because of the passage of this
Zoning Code or amendment thereto, is listed as a conditional use in the

Zoning Code which shall not be contrary to the public interest and where owing
to special conditions, a literal enforcement of the provisions of this Zoning
Code would result in practical difficulties. A variance shall not be granted
unless the Board of Zoning Appeals makes a specific finding based directly on

standards and conditions imposed by this section have been met by the
applicant. No variance shall be granted which will alter the character and use
of a zoning district or to correct an error of judgment in zoning laws.
   (a)   Application requirements. Except as otherwise permitted in this Zoning
Code, a variance from the terms of this Zoning Code shall not be granted by the
Board of Zoning Appeals unless and until a written application for a variance

variance unless it shall, in each specific case, make specific findings of fact
directly based upon the particular evidence presented to it, that supports
conclusions from the factors below:
      (1)   Whether the property will yield a reasonable return without the
variance or whether there can be a beneficial use of the property without the
variance; 
      (2)   Whether the variance is substantial;
      (3)   Whether the essential character of the neighborhood would be
substantially altered or whether adjoining properties would suffer a
substantial detriment as a result of the variance;
      (4)   Whether the variance would adversely affect the delivery of
governmental services;
      (5)   Whether the property owner purchased the property with knowledge of
the zoning restrictions;

intent and requirements of this Zoning Code.
      (7)   A narrative statement evaluating the effects on adjoining property,
the effect of such elements as noise, glare, odor, fumes, and vibration on
adjoining property; and a discussion of the general compatibility with adjacent

the specific requirements for conditionally permitted uses as specified in this

or with any specific objective of any plans adopted by the village and/or the

neighboring uses.
      (5)   Will be served adequately by essential public facilities and
services such as highways, streets, police and fire protection, drainage

or agencies responsible for the establishment of the proposed use shall be able
to adequately provide any such services.
      (6)   Will not create excessive additional requirements at public cost
for public facilities and services and will not be detrimental to the economic
welfare of the community.

and conditions of operation that will be detrimental to any persons, property,
or the general welfare by reason of excessive production of traffic, noise,

      (8)   Will have vehicular approaches to the property that shall be
designed so as not to create an interference with traffic on surrounding public
thoroughfares.
      (9)   Will not result in the destruction, loss, or damage of a natural,
scenic, or historic feature of major importance.
      (10)   In making its determination, the Board of Zoning Appeals shall
apply the following standards to conditional uses in the various districts:
         A.   Commercial Districts.
            1.   The location, size, and intensity of the use and all potential
traffic impacts, vehicular or pedestrian, so as to avoid the creation of
undesirable and hazardous conditions.

physical and economic conditions so as to foster overall harmonious
relationships between characteristic groups of businesses in a district.
         B.   Industrial Districts.

GENERAL PROVISIONS
§ 1460.01  STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION.
   Article XVIII, Section 3, of the Ohio Constitution grants municipalities the
legal authority to adopt land use and control measures for promoting the
health, safety, and general welfare of its citizens. Therefore, the Council of
the Village of Lockland, State of Ohio, adopts the following provisions.
(Ord. 2004-25, passed 6-3-2004)
§ 1460.02  FINDINGS OF FACT.
   The village has special flood hazard areas that are subject to periodic
inundation which may result in loss of life and property, health and safety
hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public
expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base.
Additionally, structures that are inadequately elevated, floodproofed, or
otherwise protected from flood damage also contribute to the flood loss. In
order to minimize the threat of such damages and to achieve the purposes
hereinafter set forth, these regulations are adopted.
(Ord. 2004-25, passed 6-3-2004)
§ 1460.03  STATEMENT OF PURPOSE.
   It is the purpose of these regulations to promote the public health, safety
and general welfare, and to:
   (a)   Protect human life and health;
   (b)   Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control
projects;
   (c)   Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with
flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
   (d)   Minimize prolonged business interruptions;
   (e)   Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and
gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer runs, streets and bridges located in
areas of special flood hazard;
   (f)   Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the proper use and
development of areas of special flood hazard so as to protect property and
minimize future flood blight areas;
   (g)   Ensure that those who occupy the areas of special flood hazard assume
responsibility for their actions;
   (h)   Minimize the impact of development on adjacent properties within and
near flood prone areas;
   (i)   Ensure that the flood storage and conveyance functions of the
floodplain are maintained;
   (j)   Minimize the impact of development on the natural, beneficial values
of the floodplain;
   (k)   Prevent floodplain uses that are either hazardous or environmentally
incompatible; and
   (l)   Meet community participation requirements of the National Flood
Insurance Program.
(Ord. 2004-25, passed 6-3-2004)
§ 1460.04  METHODS OF REDUCING FLOOD LOSS.
   In order to accomplish its purposes, these regulations include methods and
provisions for:
   (a)   Restricting or prohibiting uses which are dangerous to health, safety,
and property due to water hazards, or which result in damaging increases in
flood heights or velocities;
   (b)   Requiring that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which
serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction;
   (c)   Controlling the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels,
and natural protective barriers, which help accommodate or channel flood
waters;
   (d)   Controlling filling, grading, dredging, excavating, and other
development which may increase flood damage; and
   (e)   Preventing or regulating the construction of flood barriers which will
unnaturally divert flood waters or which may increase flood hazards in other
areas.
(Ord. 2004-25, passed 6-3-2004)
§ 1460.05  LANDS TO WHICH THESE REGULATIONS APPLY.
   These regulations shall apply to all areas of special flood hazard within
the jurisdiction of the village as identified in §
1460.06, including any additional areas of special flood hazard annexed by the
village.
(Ord. 2004-25, passed 6-3-2004)
§ 1460.06  BASIS FOR ESTABLISHING THE AREAS OF SPECIAL FLOOD HAZARD.
   (a)   For the purposes of these regulations, the following studies and/or
maps are adopted:
      (1)   Flood Insurance Rate Map Hamilton County, Ohio and Incorporated
Areas dated May 17, 2004. Flood Insurance Study Hamilton County, Ohio and
Incorporated Areas dated May 17, 2004.
      (2)   Any hydrologic and hydraulic engineering analysis authored by a
registered professional engineer in the State of Ohio which has been approved
by the village as required by §
1460.26.
   (b)   Any revisions to the aforementioned maps and/or studies are hereby
adopted by reference and declared to be a part of these regulations. Such maps
and/or studies are on file at the Village Administration Offices, 101 North
Cooper Avenue, Lockland, Ohio.
(Ord. 2004-25, passed 6-3-2004)
§ 1460.07  ABROGATION AND GREATER RESTRICTIONS.
   These regulations are not intended to repeal any existing ordinances
including subdivision regulations, Zoning or Building Codes. In the event of a
conflict between these regulations and any other ordinances the more
restrictive shall be followed. These regulations shall not impair any deed
restriction covenant or easement but the land subject to such interests shall
also be governed by the regulations.
(Ord. 2004-25, passed 6-3-2004)
§ 1460.08  INTERPRETATION.
   In the interpretation and application of these regulations, all provisions
shall be:
   (a)   Considered as minimum requirements;
   (b)   Liberally construed in favor of the governing body; and
   (c)   Deemed neither to limit nor repeal any other powers granted under
state statutes. Where a provision of these regulations may be in conflict with
a state or federal law, such state or federal law shall take precedence over
these regulations.
(Ord. 2004-25, passed 6-3-2004)
§ 1460.09  WARNING AND DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY.
   The degree of flood protection required by these regulations is considered
reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on scientific and engineering
considerations. Larger floods can and will occur on rare occasions. Flood
heights may be increased by manmade or natural causes. These regulations do not
imply that land outside the areas of special flood hazard or uses permitted
within such areas will be free from flooding or flood damage. These regulations
shall not create liability on the part of the village, any officer or employee
thereof, or the Federal Emergency Management Agency, for any flood damage that
results frown reliance on these regulations or any administrative decision
lawfully made thereunder.
(Ord. 2004-25, passed 6-3-2004)
§ 1460.10  SEVERABILITY.
   Should any section or provision of these regulations be declared by the
courts to be unconstitutional or invalid, such decision shall not affect the
validity of the regulations as a whole, or any part thereof other than the part
so declared to be unconstitutional or invalid.
(Ord. 2004-25, passed 6-3-2004)
DEFINITIONS
§ 1460.11  DEFINITIONS.

exceeded in any given year. The base flood may also be referred to as the one
percent chance annual flood or 100-year flood.
   BASE (100-YEAR) FLOOD ELEVATION (BFE). The water surface elevations of the
base flood in relation to a specified datum, usually the National Geodetic
Vertical Datum of 1929 or the North American Vertical Datum of 1988, and
usually expressed in Feet Mean Sea Level (MSL). In Zone AO areas, the base
flood elevation is the natural grade elevation plus the depth number (from one
to three feet).
   BASEMENT. Any area of the building having its floor subgrade (below ground
level) on all sides.
   DEVELOPMENT. Any manmade change to improved or unimproved real estate,
including but not limited to buildings or other structures, mining, dredging,
filling, grading, paving, excavation or drilling operations or storage of
equipment or materials.
   ENCLOSURE BELOW THE LOWEST FLOOR. See LOWEST FLOOR.
   EXECUTIVE ORDER 11988 (FLOODPLAIN MANAGEMENT). Issued by President Carter in
1977, this order requires that no federally assisted activities be conducted in
or have the potential to affect identified special flood hazard areas, unless
there is no practicable alternative.
   FEDERAL EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT AGENCY (FEMA). The agency with the overall
responsibility for administering the National Flood Insurance Program.
   FILL. A deposit of earth material placed by artificial means.
   FLOOD or FLOODING. A general and temporary condition of partial or complete
inundation of normally dry land areas from:
      (1)   The overflow of inland or tidal waters; and/or
      (2)   The unusual and rapid accumulation or runoff of surface waters from
any source.
   FLOOD HAZARD BOUNDARY MAP (FHBM). Usually the initial map produced by the
Federal Emergency Management Agency, or U.S. Department of Housing and Urban
Development, for a community depicting approximate special flood hazard areas.
   FLOOD INSURANCE RATE MAP (FIRM). An official map on which the Federal
Emergency Management Agency or the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban
Development has delineated the areas of special flood hazard.
   FLOOD INSURANCE RISK ZONES. Zone designations on FHBMs and FIRMs that
indicate the magnitude of the flood hazard in specific areas of a community.
Following are the zone definitions:
      ZONE A. Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year flood; base
flood elevations are not determined.
      ZONES A1-30 and ZONE AE. Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-
year flood; base flood elevations are determined.
      ZONE AO. Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year flood; with
flood depths of one to three feet (usually sheet flow on sloping terrain);
average depths are determined.
      ZONE AH. Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year flood;
flood depths of one to three feet (usually areas of ponding); base flood
elevations are determined.
      ZONE A99. Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year flood to
be protected from the 100-year flood by a federal flood protection system under
construction; no base flood elevations are determined.
      ZONE B and ZONE X (SHADED). Areas of 500-year flood; areas subject to the
100-year flood with average depths of less than one foot or with contributing
drainage area less than one square mile; and areas protected by levees from the
base flood.
      ZONE C and ZONE X (UNSHADED). Areas determined to be outside the 500-year
floodplain.
   FLOOD INSURANCE STUDY (FIS). The official report in which the Federal
Emergency Management Agency or the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban
Development has provided flood profiles, floodway boundaries (sometimes shown
on Flood Boundary and Floodway Maps), and the water surface elevations of the
base flood.
   FLOOD PROTECTION ELEVATION. The FLOOD PROTECTION ELEVATION, or FPE, is the
base flood elevation plus any freeboard. In areas where no base flood
elevations exist from any authoritative source, the flood protection elevation
can be historical flood elevations, or base flood elevations determined and/or
approved by the floodplain administrator.
   FLOODWAY.
      (1)   A FLOODWAY is the channel of a river or other watercourse and the
adjacent land areas that have been reserved in order to pass the base flood
discharge. A FLOODWAY is typically determined through a hydraulic and
hydrologic engineering analysis such that the cumulative increase in the water
surface elevation of the base flood discharge is no more than a designated
height. In no case shall the designated height be more than one foot at any
point within the community.
      (2)   The FLOODWAY is an extremely hazardous area, and is usually
characterized by any of the following: moderate to high velocity flood waters,
high potential for debris and projectile impacts, and moderate to high erosion
forces.
   FREEBOARD. A factor of safety usually expressed in feet above a flood level
for the purposes of floodplain management. FREEBOARD tends to compensate for
the many unknown factors that could contribute to flood heights greater than
the height calculated for a selected size flood and floodway conditions, such
as wave action, obstructed bridge openings, debris and ice jams, and the
hydrologic effect of urbanization in a watershed.
   HISTORIC STRUCTURE. Any structure that is:
      (1)   Listed individually in the National Register of Historic Places (a
listing maintained by the U.S. Department of Interior) or preliminarily
determined by the Secretary of the Interior as meeting the requirements for
individual listings on the National Register;
      (2)   Certified or preliminarily determined by the Secretary of the
Interior as contributing to the historical significance of a registered
historic district or a district preliminarily determined by the Secretary to
qualify as a registered historic district;
      (3)   Individually listed on the State of Ohio’s inventory of historic
places maintained by the Ohio Historic Preservation Office; or
      (4)   Individually listed on the inventory of historic places maintained
by the village whose historic preservation program has been certified by the
Ohio Historic Preservation Office.
   HYDROLOGIC AND HYDRAULIC ENGINEERING ANALYSIS. An analysis performed by a
professional engineer, registered in the State of Ohio, in accordance with
standard engineering practices as accepted by FEMA, used to determine flood
elevations and/or floodway boundaries.
   LETTER OF MAP CHANGE (LOMC). A LETTER OF MAP CHANGE is an official FEMA
determination, by letter, to amend or revise effective Flood Insurance Rate
Maps, Flood Boundary and Floodway Maps, and Flood Insurance Studies. LOMC’s are
broken down into the following categories:
      LETTER OF MAP AMENDMENT (LOMA). A revision based on technical data
showing that a property was incorrectly included in a designated special flood
hazard area. A LOMA amends the current effective Flood Insurance Rate Map and
establishes that a specific property is not located in a special flood hazard
area.
      LETTER OF MAP REVISION (LOMR). A revision based on technical data that,
usually due to manmade changes, shows changes to flood zones, flood elevations,
floodplain and floodway delineation, and planimetric features. One common type
of LOMR, a LOMR-F, is a determination concerning whether a structure or parcel
has been elevated by fill above the base flood elevation and is, therefore,
excluded from the special flood hazard area.
      CONDITIONAL LETTER OF MAP REVISION (CLOMR). A formal review and comment
by FEMA as to whether a proposed project complies with the minimum National
Flood Insurance Program floodplain management criteria. A CLOMR does not amend
or revise effective Flood Insurance Rate Maps, Flood Boundary and Floodway
Maps, or Flood Insurance Studies.
   LOWEST FLOOR. The lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area (including
basement) of a structure. This definition excludes an “enclosure below the
lowest floor” which is an unfinished or flood resistant enclosure usable solely
for parking of vehicles, building access or storage, in an area other than a
basement area, provided that such enclosure is built in accordance with the
applicable design requirements specified in these regulations for enclosures
below the lowest floor.
   MANUFACTURED HOME. A structure, transportable in one or more sections, which
is built on a permanent chassis and is designed for use with or without a
permanent foundation when connected to the required utilities. The term
MANUFACTURED HOME does not include a “recreational vehicle.” For the purposes
of these regulations, a manufactured home includes manufactured homes and
mobile homes as defined in Ohio R.C. Chapter 3733.
   MANUFACTURED HOME PARK. As specified in the O.A.C. 3701-27-01, a
manufactured home park means any tract of land upon which three or more
manufactured homes, used for habitation are parked, either free of charge or
for revenue purposes, and includes any roadway, building, structure, vehicle,
or enclosure used or intended for use as part of the facilities of the park. A
tract of land that is subdivided and the individual lots are not for rent or
rented, but are for sale or sold for the purpose of installation of
manufactured homes on the lots, is not a manufactured home park, even though
three or more manufactured homes are parked thereon, if the roadways are
dedicated to the local government authority.
   NATIONAL FLOOD INSURANCE PROGRAM (NFIP). The NFIP is a federal program
enabling property owners in participating communities to purchase insurance
protection against losses from flooding. This insurance is designed to provide
an insurance alternative to disaster assistance to meet the escalating costs of
repairing damage to buildings and their contents caused by floods.
Participation in the NFIP is based on an agreement between local communities
and the federal government that states if a community will adopt and enforce
floodplain management regulations to reduce future flood risks to all
development in special flood hazard areas, the federal government will make
flood insurance available within the community as a financial protection
against flood loss.
   NEW CONSTRUCTION. Structures for which the “start of construction” commenced
on or after the initial effective date of the village’s Flood Insurance Rate
Map, September 4, 1986, and includes any subsequent improvements to such
structures.
   PERSON. Includes any individual or group of individuals, corporation,
partnership, association, or any other entity, including state and local
governments and agencies. An agency is further defined in Ohio R.C. § 111.15 as
any governmental entity of the state and includes, but is not limited to, any
board, department, division, commission, bureau, society, council, institution,
state college or university, community college district, technical college
district, or state community college. “Agency” does not include the general
assembly, the controlling board, the adjutant general’s department, or any
court.
   RECREATIONAL VEHICLE. A vehicle which is:
      (1)   Built on a single chassis;
      (2)   Four hundred square feet or less when measured at the largest
horizontal projection;
      (3)   Designed to be self-propelled or permanently towable by a light
duty truck; and
      (4)   Designed primarily not for use as a permanent dwelling but as
temporary living quarters for recreational, camping, travel, or seasonal use.
   REGISTERED PROFESSIONAL ARCHITECT. A person registered to engage in the
practice of architecture under the provisions of Ohio R.C. §§ 4703.01 to
4703.19.
   REGISTERED PROFESSIONAL ENGINEER. A person registered as a professional
engineer under Ohio R.C. Chapter 4733.
   REGISTERED PROFESSIONAL SURVEYOR. A person registered as a professional
surveyor under Ohio R.C. Chapter 4733.
   SPECIAL FLOOD HAZARD AREA. Also known as “Areas of Special Flood Hazard,” it
is the land in the floodplain subject to a one percent or greater chance of
flooding in any given year. SPECIAL FLOOD HAZARD AREAS are designated by the
Federal Emergency Management Agency on Flood Insurance Rate Maps, Flood
Insurance Studies, Flood Boundary and Floodway Maps and Flood Hazard Boundary
Maps as Zones A, AE, AH, AO, Al-30, and A99. SPECIAL FLOOD HAZARD AREAS may
also refer to areas that are flood prone and designated from other federal,
state or local sources of data including but not limited to historical flood
information reflecting high water marks, previous flood inundation areas, and
flood prone soils associated with a watercourse.
   START OF CONSTRUCTION. The date the building permit was issued, provided the
actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition,
placement, or other improvement was within 180 days of the permit date. The
actual start means either the first placement of permanent construction of a
structure on a site, such as the pouring of slab or footings, the installation
of piles, the construction of columns, or any work beyond the stage of
excavation; or the placement of a manufactured home on a foundation. Permanent
construction does not include land preparation, such as clearing, grading and
filling; nor does it include the installation of streets and/or walkways; nor
does it include excavation for a basement, footings, piers, or foundations or
the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the installation on the
property of accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds not occupied as
dwelling units or not part of the main structure. For a substantial
improvement, the actual START OF CONSTRUCTION means the first alteration of any
wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building, whether or not
that alteration affects the external dimensions of a building.
   STRUCTURE. A walled and roofed building, manufactured home, or gas or liquid
storage tank that is principally above ground.
   SUBSTANTIAL DAMAGE. Damage of any origin sustained by a structure whereby
the cost of restoring the structure to its before damaged condition would equal
or exceed 50 percent of the market value of the structure before the damage
occurred.
   SUBSTANTIAL IMPROVEMENT. Any reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, or
other  improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds 50
percent of the market value of the structure before the “start of construction”
of the improvement. This term includes structures which have incurred
“substantial damage,” regardless of the actual repair work performed. The term
does not, however, include:
      (1)   Any improvement to a structure which is considered “new
construction;”
      (2)   Any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing
violations of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications
which have been identified prior to the application for a development permit by
the local code enforcement official and which are the minimum necessary to
assure safe living conditions; or
      (3)   Any alteration of a “historic structure,” provided that the
alteration will not preclude the structure’s continued designation as a
“historic structure.”
   VARIANCE. A grant of relief from the standards of these regulations
consistent with the variance conditions herein.
   VIOLATION. The failure of a structure or other development to be fully
compliant with these regulations.

and other data showing areas of special flood hazard:
   (a)   In areas where FEMA has not identified special flood hazard areas, or
in FEMA identified special flood hazard areas where base flood elevation and
floodway data have not been identified, the Floodplain Administrator shall
review and reasonably utilize any other flood hazard data available from a
federal, state, or other source.
   (b)   Base flood elevations and floodway boundaries produced on FEMA flood
maps and studies shall take precedence over base flood elevations and floodway
boundaries by any other source that reflect a reduced floodway width and/or
lower base flood elevations. Other sources of data, showing increased base
flood elevations and/or larger floodway areas than are shown on FEMA flood maps
and studies, shall be reasonably used by the Floodplain Administrator.
   (c)   When Preliminary Flood Insurance Rate Maps and/or Flood Insurance
Study have been provided by FEMA:
      (1)   Upon the issuance of a Letter of Final Determination by the FEMA,
the preliminary flood hazard data shall be used and replace all previously
existing flood hazard data provided from FEMA for the purposes of administering
these regulations;
      (2)   Prior to the issuance of a Letter of Final Determination by FEMA,
the use of preliminary flood hazard data shall only be required where no base
flood elevations and or floodway areas exist or where the preliminary base
flood elevations or floodway area exceed the base flood elevations and/or
floodway widths in existing flood hazard data provided from FEMA. Such
preliminary data may be subject to change and/or appeal to FEMA.
   (d)   The Floodplain Administrator shall make interpretations, where needed,
as to the exact location of the flood boundaries and areas of special flood
hazard. A person contesting the determination of the location of the boundary
shall be given a reasonable opportunity to appeal the interpretation as
provided in §§
1460.33 through
1460.38.
   (e)   Where a map boundary showing an area of special flood hazard and field
elevations disagree, the base flood elevations or flood protection elevations
(as found on an elevation profile, floodway data table, established high water
marks, and the like) shall prevail.
(Ord. 2004-25, passed 6-3-2004)
§ 1460.23  SUBSTANTIAL DAMAGE DETERMINATIONS.
   (a)   Damages to structures may result from a variety of causes including
flood, tornado, wind, heavy snow, fire, and the like. After such a damage
event, the Floodplain Administrator shall:
      (1)   Determine whether damaged structures are located in special flood
hazard areas;
      (2)   Conduct substantial damage determinations for damaged structures
located in special flood hazard areas; and
      (3)   Make reasonable attempt to notify owners of substantially damaged
structures of the need to obtain a floodplain development permit prior to
repair, rehabilitation, or reconstruction.
   (b)   Additionally, the Floodplain Administrator may implement other
measures to assist with the substantial damage determination and subsequent
repair process. These measures include issuing press releases, public service
announcements, and other public information materials related to the floodplain
development permits and repair of damaged structures; coordinating with other
federal, state, and local agencies to assist with substantial damage
determinations; providing owners of damaged structures materials and other
information related to the proper repair of damaged structures in special flood
hazard areas; and assist owners of substantially damaged structures with
increased cost of compliance insurance claims.

reduction of the flood carrying capacity of watercourses is minimized.
   (a)   Development in floodways.
      (1)   In floodway areas, development shall cause no increase in flood
levels during the occurrence of the base flood discharge. Prior to issuance of
a floodplain development permit, the applicant must submit a hydrologic and
hydraulic analysis, conducted by a registered professional engineer,
demonstrating that the proposed development would not result in any increase in
the base flood elevation.
      (2)   Development in floodway areas causing increases in the base flood
elevation may be permitted provided all of the following are completed by the
applicant:
         A.   Meet the requirements to submit technical data in §
1460.21(a);
         B.   An evaluation of alternatives which would not result in increased
base flood elevations and an explanation why these alternatives are not
feasible;
         C.   Certification that no structures are located in areas which would
be impacted by the increased base flood elevation;
         D.   Documentation of individual legal notices to all impacted
property owners within and outside the community, explaining the impact of the
proposed action on their property; and
         E.   Concurrence of the Village Administrator of the Village of
Lockland and the Chief Executive Officer of any other communities impacted by
the proposed actions.
   (b)   Alterations of a watercourse. For the purpose of these regulations, a
watercourse is altered when any change occurs within its banks. The extent of
the banks shall be established by a field determination of the “bankfull
stage.” The field determination of “bankfull stage” shall be based on methods
presented in Chapter 7 of the USDA Forest Service General Technical Report RM
245, Stream Channel Reference Sites: An Illustrated Guide to Field Technique or
other applicable publication available from a federal, state, or other
authoritative source. For all proposed developments that alter a watercourse,
the following standards apply.
      (1)   The bankfull flood carrying capacity of the altered or relocated
portion of the watercourse shall not be diminished. Prior to the issuance of a
floodplain development permit, the applicant must submit a description of the
extent to which any watercourse will be altered or relocated as a result of the
proposed development, and certification, by a registered professional engineer
that the bankfull flood carrying capacity of the watercourse will not be
diminished.
      (2)   Adjacent communities, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, and the
Ohio Department of Natural Resources, Division of Water, must be notified prior
to any alteration or relocation of a watercourse. Evidence of such notification
must be submitted to the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
      (3)   The applicant shall be responsible for providing the necessary
maintenance for the altered or relocated portion of the watercourse so that the
flood carrying capacity will not be diminished. The Floodplain Administrator
may require the permit holder to enter into an agreement with the village
specifying the maintenance responsibilities. If an agreement is required, it
shall be made a condition of the floodplain development permit.
      (4)   The applicant shall meet the requirements to submit technical data
in §
1460.21(a)(1)C. when an alteration of a watercourse results in the relocation
or elimination of the special flood hazard area, including the placement of
culverts.

§ 1460.36  VARIANCES.
   Any person believing that the use and development standards of these
regulations would result in unnecessary hardship may file an application for a
variance. The Board of Zoning Appeals shall have the power to authorize, in
specific cases, such variances from the standards of these regulations, not
inconsistent with federal regulations, as will not be contrary to the public
interest where, owning to special conditions of the lot or parcel, a literal
enforcement of the provisions of these regulations would result in unnecessary
hardship.
   (a)   Application for a variance.
      (1)   Any owner, or agent thereof, of property for which a variance is
sought shall make an application for a variance by filing it with the
Floodplain Administrator, who upon receipt of the variance shall transmit it to
the Board of Zoning Appeals.
      (2)   Such application at a minimum shall contain the following
information:
         A.   Name, address, and telephone number of the applicant;
         B.   Legal description of the property;
         C.   Parcel map;
         D.   Description of the existing use;
         E.   Description of the proposed use;
         F.   Location of the floodplain;
         G.   Description of the variance sought; and
         H.   Reason for the variance request.
      (3)   All applications for a variance shall be accompanied by a variance
application fee set in the Schedule of Fees adopted by the Village Council.
   (b)   Notice for public hearing. The Board of Zoning Appeals shall schedule
and hold a public hearing within 30 days after the receipt of an application
for a variance from the Floodplain Administrator. Prior to the hearing, a
notice of such hearing shall be given not less than ten days prior to the date
of the hearing by written notice which shall be mailed by the Clerk of Council,
by first class mail, to the owners of the property within, contiguous to and
directly across the street from the affected parcel or parcels, to the
addresses of such owners appearing on the County Auditor’s current tax list or
the Treasurer’s mailing list and to such other list that may be specified by
the legislative authority, or by such other means as the municipality deems
appropriate, such as publishing notice in a newspaper of general circulation.
Failure of any person, other than the applicant, to receive notice of any
hearing under this section shall in no way affect the validity of the action
taken.
   (c)   Public hearing.
      (1)   At such hearing the applicant shall present such statements and
evidence as the Board of Zoning Appeals requires. In considering such variance
applications, the Board of Zoning Appeals shall consider and make findings of
fact on all evaluations, all relevant factors, and standards specified in other
sections of these regulations and the following factors:
         A.   The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the
injury of others;
         B.   The danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion
damage;
         C.   The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to
flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner;
         D.   The importance of the services provided by the proposed facility
to the community;
         E.   The availability of alternative locations for the proposed use
which are not subject to flooding or erosion damage;
         F.   The necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where
applicable;
         G.   The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and
anticipated development;
         H.   The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan
and floodplain management program for that area;
         I.   The safety of access to the property in times of flood for
ordinary and emergency vehicles;
         J.   The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise, and
sediment transport of the flood waters and the effects of wave action, if
applicable, expected at the site; and
         K.   The costs of providing governmental services during and after
flood conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities and
facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water systems, and streets and
bridges.
      (2)   Variances shall only be issued upon:
         A.   A showing of good and sufficient cause;
         B.   A determination that failure to grant the variance would result
in exceptional hardship due to the physical characteristics of the property.
Increased cost or inconvenience of meeting the requirements of these
regulations does not constitute an exceptional hardship to the applicant;
         C.   A determination that the granting of a variance will not result
in increased flood heights beyond that which is allowed in these regulations;
additional threats to public safety; extraordinary public expense, nuisances,
fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local laws;
         D.   A determination that the structure or other development is
protected by methods to minimize flood damages; and
         E.   A determination that the variance is the minimum necessary,
considering the flood hazard, to afford relief.
      (3)   Upon consideration of the above factors and the purposes of these
regulations, the Board of Zoning Appeals may attach such conditions to the
granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes of these
regulations.
   (d)   Other conditions for variances.
      (1)   Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any
increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.
      (2)   Generally, variances may be issued for new construction and
substantial improvements to be erected on a lot of one-half acre or less in
size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed
below the base flood level, providing items in division (c)(1)A. to K. of this
section have been fully considered. As the lot size increases beyond one-half
acre, the technical justification required for issuing the variance increases.
      (3)   Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written
notice that the structure will be permitted to be built with a lowest floor
elevation below the base flood elevation and the cost of flood insurance will
be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the reduced lowest floor
elevation.
(Ord. 2004-25, passed 6-3-2004)
§ 1460.37  PROCEDURE AT HEARINGS.

upon the application, plans or specifications on which the issuance of the
certificate was based.
      (2)   The revocation notice shall be in writing and served upon the
holder of the certificate, the owner, his or her agent, or the person having
charge of the work being performed on the property. A revocation notice shall
also be posted upon the building or structure in question by the village.
Revocation of a certificate shall be subject to appeal to the Housing Appeals
Board as provided in §
1480.08.
   (k)   Effect of failure to obtain certificate of use and occupancy.  Subject
to the phase-in provisions of this section, it shall be a condition precedent
to the collection of rent for the letting of any rental dwelling unit within
the village that a current certificate of use and occupancy has been obtained
by the property owner for that unit. A property owner’s failure to obtain and
maintain a current certificate of use and occupancy shall therefore constitute
a complete defense, subject to any limitations in Ohio R.C. Chapter 5321, to
payment of rent for any and all rental dwelling unit(s) lacking a current
certificate of use and occupancy.

§ 1484.09  POINT OF SALE INSPECTIONS ON VACANT, FORECLOSED PROPERTIES.
   (a)   Point of sale inspections are hereby authorized on all properties that
are subject to the vacant, foreclosed property registration. Mortgagees shall
arrange to have all properties subject to the requirements of this chapter
inspected by the code official within five business days of filing for the
property to be sold at a judicial sale. If the mortgagee fails to arrange an
inspection, the property shall be inspected by the code official pursuant to
Ohio R.C. § 2329.17(B) prior to the property being sold at a judicial sale or
pursuant to a search warrant issued by a court of competent jurisdiction.
   (b)   If, as a result of the above inspection, the code official determines
that health code violations, housing code violations, hazards, or structural
defects exist on the property, the code official shall provide written notice
via certified mail to the mortgagee or the mortgagee's agent, as designated on
the foreclosed vacant property registration form, the owner or record, and any
equitable lien holders, informing the parties of the following:
      (1)   The need to repair and correct the violations, hazards, or
structural defects prior to the judicial sale;
      (2)   If the property is not brought into compliance within 30 calendar
days of the issuance of the notice of violation, the code official may correct
or repair some or all of the violations;
      (3)   If the code official corrects or repairs some or all of the
violations, the code official shall notify the Village Solicitor and the
Village Solicitor shall promptly place a priority lien on the property for the
total cost of abating the violations. The Village Solicitor shall collect the
priority lien from the proceeds of the judicial sale of the property, or upon
any subsequent sale of the property, or by the methods provided in Ohio R.C. §
715.261. When notice is given as provided for in this section, the lien shall
be a priority over liens of prior record and the lien will be effective on the
date the village incurs the costs of repairs as provided in Ohio R.C. § 715.26
(B).
   (c)   The mortgagee may post a bond in an amount equal to the cost of
abatement of the code violations which may include repair or demolition. The
mortgagee must submit to the code official written cost estimates by
contractors for abating the violations. The code official will establish the
bond amount based upon the submitted cost estimates. Upon successful submission
of the bond, the mortgagee shall be exempt from the requirements of §
1484.09(b)(2). The code official may extend the compliance date up to 90 days
if a bond is posted. An additional 90 days may be extended in writing by the
code official if good cause or diligence in abating the violations is
demonstrated. If the violations are not abated in conformance with the terms of
this section, the bond will be forfeited and the code official shall cause the
violations to be abated with the proceeds of the forfeiture.

property for which a notice of violation is issued under this chapter to
correct health or building code violations shall be jointly and severally
liable for the costs incurred by the village for the abatement of violations on
the property. Joint and several liability shall be attributed to each entity in
the chain of title from the date of issuance of orders forward.
(Ord. 2014-39, passed 8-19-2014)

be determined or declared invalid by any final court action or by reason of any
preemptive legislation, the remaining provisions, sections, paragraphs,
sentences or words of this chapter shall remain in full force and effect.

§ 1490.01  LEGISLATIVE FINDING.
   Acting pursuant to the Home Rule powers afforded the village by the
constitution and statutes of the state, it is hereby found and determined that
there exist within the village blighted and deteriorating areas of the nature
defined in this chapter which constitute a serious and growing menace injurious
and inimical to the public health, safety, morals and general welfare of the
residents thereof; that the existence of such areas:
   (a)   Constitutes an economic and social liability;
   (b)   Substantially impairs and arrests the sound growth of the community by
causing the obsolescence of urban neighborhoods and facilities, and by impeding
and retarding the sound private development of property and creation and
preservation of housing and employment opportunities; that both properties
improved with structures and vacant properties contribute to the above
conditions; that this menace is beyond remedy and control solely by regulatory
processes and exercise of the police power, and cannot be dealt with
effectively by the ordinary operation of private enterprise without the aids
herein provided; that the elimination by the village, in whole or in part, of
blighted and deteriorating areas by urban renewal as defined herein is
necessary for the public welfare and is a public  use  and purpose for which
public money may be expended and private property acquired;  that in blighted
areas the conditions of blight spread throughout the area in many instances
requiring, for  the public welfare, the acquisition by the village of both
properties which do and properties which do not contribute to the qualification
of the area as blighted; and that in deteriorating areas the public welfare
requires acquisition of properties which contribute to the qualification of the
area as deteriorating in order to prevent deterioration into a blighted area,
but in deteriorating areas the village will not implement eminent domain for
blight elimination for other properties; and
   (c)   Contributes substantially and increasingly to the spread of crime, and
to losses by fire and accident, necessitating excessive and disproportionate
expenditures of public funds for the preservation of the public health and
safety, for crime prevention, correction, prosecution and punishment, for the
treatment of juvenile delinquency, for the maintenance of adequate police, fire
and accident protection and for other public services and facilities.

area to acquire either by negotiation or appropriation any property, whether or
not a particular property contributes to the qualification of the area as a
blighted area or deteriorating area, the acquisition of which is reasonably
necessary in carrying out the urban renewal plan. The acquisition authorization
stated here in no respect limits the village’s authority to acquire any
property for any public purpose other than blight elimination. The Village
Administrator is hereby authorized in blighted or deteriorating areas to
rehabilitate property, demolish the buildings and do other site preparation
work on property acquired by the village, to cause such studies, plans and
surveys to be made by force account or by contract which are necessary and
proper to carry out the project improvements in accordance with Council-
approved design plans, to do all things necessary or appropriate to carry out
the acquisition of property, redevelopment, rehabilitation, demolition of

will not be necessary to carry out the urban renewal plan if the owner makes
the property conform to the urban renewal plan, then in such case the Village
Administrator, in lieu of acquiring such property may, on behalf of the
village, enter into an agreement with such owner in which the owner agrees to
conform the land, the structures thereon and the use thereof to the urban
renewal plan within the time set forth in the agreement. The Village
Administrator may require as a condition to entering into such agreement that
the owner furnish such security for the performance of obligations under such
agreement as the Village Administrator believes is necessary in order to
protect the interests of the village.
(Ord. 96-32, passed 5-21-1996)

Council to modify an urban renewal plan. Such petition shall be in writing and
shall state in detail the modification desired. Upon receipt of such petition,
Council shall refer it to the Village Planning Commission for its
recommendation. The Village Planning Commission shall either approve or
disapprove or further modify the modification and return the petition to
Council, together with its recommendation.
   (b)   In the event the proposed modification contemplates an expansion of
the urban renewal or project area, documentation shall be prepared giving
evidence that at the time of the proposed modification either:

or project area qualifies as a blighted or deteriorating area; or
      (2)   The entire urban renewal or project area including the proposed
additional area qualifies as a blighted or deteriorating area.
   (c)   In the event the proposed modification contemplates an alteration of
the urban renewal or project area boundaries, additional public acquisition of
property, or a change in zoning within the area, Council shall, before
considering it, hold a public hearing thereon, during which an opportunity
shall be provided for all persons or organizations interested to be heard,
either in person or by counsel. Notice of such hearing shall be given in the
manner prescribed in §
1490.07 of this chapter. Council may either approve, modify or reject the
proposed modification by a majority vote unless the Planning Commission has
failed to approve the plan, in which case it may be approved by a vote of not
less than two-thirds of the members of Council. If the proposed modification is
adopted by Council, it shall become a part of the urban renewal plan.
(Ord. 96-32, passed 5-21-1996)
§ 1490.13  DISPOSITION OF PROPERTY.
   (a)   The Mayor or Village Administrator is hereby authorized to negotiate

village to execute and administer in the village the urban renewal programs
financed or assisted by federal or state agencies. In the execution and

§ 1491.01  LEGISLATIVE FINDING.
   (a)   It is hereby found and determined that there exist within the Village
of Lockland premises that by reason of age, obsolescence, dilapidation,
deterioration, lack of maintenance or repair or a combination thereof
constitute a blight and a nuisance upon the surrounding neighborhood because
they are fire hazards, health hazards, places of retreat for immoral or
criminal purposes or for the breach of the public peace, substantial and
unreasonable interferences with the reasonable and lawful use and enjoyment of
other premises in the neighborhood, or factors seriously depreciating property
values in the area.
   (b)   It is further found that programs aimed at specific elimination of the
particular blights or nuisances in the village have sometimes proven inadequate
or ineffective, have sometimes failed to prevent recurrence of the nuisance or
blight, and have sometimes resulted merely in the alteration of the nature or
form of the nuisance or blight that previously existed.  It is further found
that it therefore becomes necessary in order to eliminate nuisance and blight
and prevent recurrence of blight on the premises for the village to obtain the
title of the blight or provide for its removal by others and to make further
provisions for future development, redevelopment or use of the premises in such
a way as to prevent any recurrence of blight or nuisance on the premises.
   (c)   It is further found and determined that acquisition of such blighted
property by the village in order to eliminate blight or nuisance and to prevent
its recurrence constitutes a public purpose.
(Ord. 01-07, passed 3-20-2001)
§ 1491.02  DEFINITIONS.
   For the purpose of this chapter the words and phrases defined in the
sections hereunder shall have the meanings therein respectively ascribed to
them, unless a different meaning is clearly indicated by the context.
   BLIGHTED PREMISES.  Premises which because of their age, obsolescence,
dilapidation, deterioration, lack of maintenance or repair or any combination
thereof constitute a serious fire hazard, a serious health hazard, a
substantial and unreasonable interference with the reasonable and lawful use
and enjoyment of other premises within the neighborhood or a factor seriously
depreciating property values in the neighborhood.
   NEIGHBORHOOD.  An area of the village comprised of all premises or parcels
of land which in whole or in part are located within a radius of 500 feet of
any one parcel or lot within the village.
   REDEVELOPMENT.  The acquisition of blighted premises, the demolition of a
structure or structures thereon, the making of site improvements, including the
construction or reconstruction thereon, or the sale of property for use in
accordance with the Zoning Code.  REDEVELOPMENT may include the construction or
improvement by the village of any buildings for public use or for resale to
private persons.
   REHABILITATION.  The restoration, rehabilitation or conservation of blighted
premises by improvement, modernization or repair of a structure or structures
thereon to bring it into conformance with applicable building and zoning
provisions of the village.
(Ord. 01-07, passed 3-20-2001)
§ 1491.03  DETERMINATION OF BLIGHTED PREMISES.
   The Village Administrator shall present to Council, from time to time, a
report which shall list therein the location and ownership of premises which
the Village Administrator has reason to believe are blighted premises as
defined in this chapter, and which are located in the village.  The report will
state briefly the factors which, in the Village Administrator’s opinion, would
warrant the determination that the premises so listed in the report are
blighted.  The premises so listed in the report shall be only those blighted
premises which, in the opinion of the Village Administrator, are such that, in
order to eliminate the existing blight and to prevent future blight,
acquisition thereof will be necessary for one or more of the following reasons:
   (a)   The owner of the premises cannot or will not:
      (1)   Eliminate the blighted condition, and/or
      (2)   Prevent recurrence of blight; or
   (b)   The owner has not responded to a lawful order by the village to take
action to eliminate its recurrence within 30 days after due notice of the
request or order has been given by:
      (1)   Posting such order or notice on the premises;
      (2)   Personal delivery;
      (3)   Mailing such order or notice to the last known address of the
owner; or
      (4)   Publishing once a week for three consecutive weeks in a newspaper
of general circulation a notice of the issuance of the order relating to the
premises and directing the owner to contact the buildings and inspections
officials of the village in regard to such order; and
   (c)   Direct action, short of acquisition by the village to eliminate the
blight, including but not limited to clearing the premises of the debris,
demolition of blighted structures, or barricading such structure has proved to
be unsuccessful:
      (1)   To eliminate the blight; or
      (2)   To prevent its recurrence; or
   (d)   In the opinion of the Village Administrator, based upon conditions
existing on the premises and in the neighborhood, such direct action would be
likely to prove inadequate to eliminate blight or prevent its recurrence.
(Ord. 01-07, passed 3-20-2001)
§ 1491.04  PUBLIC HEARING.
   Upon receipt of a report from the Village Administrator, Council shall set a
date for a public hearing in regard to the existence of blight on the premises
and necessity for acquisition by the village in order to eliminate blight and
prevent the recurrence thereof.  The hearing shall be held not less than 15 nor
more than 45 days from the time such report of the Village Administrator is
received.  Upon the fixing of a day for a public hearing, the Clerk of Council
shall promptly cause notice to be given to the owner or owners of record of the
premises and the occupants thereof, if any, or the person in charge of the
premises, if any, notifying them of the time and place of the hearing and
apprising them of their right to appeal at such hearing to show cause why the
premises should not be declared to be blighted or why the village should not
acquire the premises for the purpose of eliminating blight thereon and
preventing the recurrence of blight.  Notice of such hearing shall be given by:
   (a)   Posting the notice thereof on the premises;
   (b)   Personal service; or
   (c)   Mailing such order or notice to the last known address of the owner or
person in charge of the premises or to the occupants thereof.
(Ord. 01-07, passed 3-20-2001)
§ 1491.05  PROCEDURE.
   (a)   At the hearing required by §
1491.04, the report of the Village Administrator shall be read and shall
constitute prima facie evidence of blight on the premises and need for the
village to acquire such premises in order to eliminate the blight and prevent
recurrence of blight thereon.  Thereafter, the owner, person in charge,
occupant of the premises or any person having an interest therein may proceed
to show cause why the premises should not be declared blighted or the village
should not acquire the premises for the purposes of eliminating blight or
preventing its recurrence.  At the hearing, the owner, person in charge of the
premises or occupant may cause to be presented to the Council any records of
the village pertaining to issues relevant to the hearing and may examine
village employees or agents in regard thereto; provided that the production of
such records or the presence of such employees is requested by the owner,
person in charge or occupant of the premises in writing at least 24 hours prior
to the hearing.
   (b)   If the owner, person in charge or occupant of the premises does appear
and presents testimony for the purpose of showing cause why the premises should
not be declared blighted or the village should not acquire the premises for the
purposes of eliminating the blight and preventing recurrence of blight, the
Village Administrator, or duly appointed representative, shall proceed to
present evidence to Council of the existence of blight on the premises and need
to acquire the premises for elimination of the blight and the prevention of the
recurrence of the blight thereon.  Members of the public residing in the
neighborhood or who may otherwise have knowledge of the condition of such
premises may address the Council at the hearing in regard to the proposed
action of the village.
   (c)   Council may adjourn the hearing from time to time and grant
continuances to the Village Administrator, the Village Administrator’s
representative or the owner, person in charge or occupant of the premises, in
order for them to present further argument or evidence in regard to the
evidence of blight on the premises or the need for the village to acquire the
premises in order to eliminate blight or prevent the recurrence of blight
thereon.
(Ord. 01-07, passed 3-20-2001)
§ 1491.06  LEGISLATIVE DETERMINATION.
   (a)   Council, upon completion of the hearing, shall at the same or at a
subsequent meeting decide and make findings as to:
      (1)   Whether or not the premises are blighted in accordance with this
chapter; and
      (2)   Whether or not it is necessary for the village to acquire the
premises in order to eliminate blight thereon and to prevent the recurrence of
blight.
   (b)   (1)   Should Council determine that the premises are not blighted as
defined in this chapter, it may direct the Village Administrator to take

Administrator to take appropriate action in regard thereto short of
acquisition.
   (c)   If Council finds that the premises are blighted as defined in this
chapter and that acquisition by the village is necessary in order to eliminate
the blight and prevent the recurrence of blight on the premises, the Village
Administrator shall be and hereby is authorized to proceed to take the proper
action to acquire the premises, eliminate the blight and prevent the recurrence
of blight in accordance with the provisions of this chapter.

   (b)   Acquire the premises by court action exercising the village’s

bowstring truss construction.
(Ord. 2014-50, passed 10-21-2014)
§ 1630.02  DEFINITIONS.
   APPROVED SYMBOL.  A Maltese Cross measuring eight inches horizontally and
eight inches vertically. The sign background shall be reflective white in
color. The Maltese Cross and contents shall be reflective red in color with a

sidelight, it may be a permanent non-fading sticker or decal. Signs not
directly applied to doors or sidelights shall be of sturdy, non-fading, weather
resistant material. See the figures attached to Ordinance 2014-50.
   BOWSTRING TRUSS.  A type of construction (wood/steel) where to top chord is

§ 1630.09  COMPLIANCE WITH CHAPTER.
   Where the owner of the structure and the authority having jurisdiction
disagree as to the use of light-frame truss-type construction within the
structure, the owner shall be granted not more than 45 days to provide written
verification from a licensed engineer or licensed architect; otherwise, the
owner shall comply with the rule.
