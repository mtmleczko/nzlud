PREFACE 
    This Code constitutes a recodification of the general and permanent ordinances of the Town of Wendell, North Carolina. 
    Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the 1986 Code, as supplemented through September 12, 1994, and ordinances subsequently adopted by the Board of Commissioners. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this Code, the reader can locate any section of the 1986 Code, as supplemented, and any subsequent ordinance included herein. 
    The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order, and the various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Notes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state law have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this Code. 
Chapter and Section Numbering System 
    The chapter and section numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and local government codes. Each section number consists of two parts separated by a dash. The figure before the dash refers to the chapter number, and the figure after the dash refers to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the second section of chapter 1 is numbered 1-2, and the first section of chapter 6 is 6-1. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter, and at the same time new sections can be inserted in their proper place by using the decimal system for amendments. For example, if new material consisting of one section that would logically come between sections 6-1 and 6-2 is desired to be added, such new section would be numbered 6-1.5. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject. The next successive number shall be assigned to the new article or division. New chapters may be included by using one of the reserved chapter numbers. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. 
Page Numbering System 
    The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the volume. The number to the right of the colon represents the number of the page in that portion. In the case of a chapter of the Code, the number to the left of the colon indicates the number of the chapter. In the case of an appendix to the Code, the letter immediately to the left of the colon indicates the letter of the appendix. The following are typical parts of codes of ordinances, which may or may not appear in this Code at this time, and their corresponding prefixes:

Indexes 
    The indexes have been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the indexes themselves which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which the user is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
    A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up-to-date. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited, and the affected page or pages will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
    Keeping this publication up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. As revised pages are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
Acknowledgments 
    This publication was under the direct supervision of Alyce A. Whitson, Senior Code Attorney, and Deborah J. Heath, Editor, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida. Credit is gratefully given to the other members of the publisher's staff for their sincere interest and able assistance throughout the project. 
    The publisher is most grateful to Stacy Griffin, Town Planner, Brian Pridgen, Town Attorney, and Teresa Piner, Planning Director, for their cooperation and assistance during the progress of the work on this publication. It is hoped that their efforts and those of the publisher have resulted in a Code of Ordinances which will make the active law of the Town of Wendell readily accessible to all citizens and which will be a valuable tool in the day-to-day administration of the town's affairs.

    The town manager shall determine the character and type of construction and of the material to be used in accordance with specifications of the town as outlined in the codes and ordinances designating standards for street improvements. The Board of Commissioners may, on recommendation from the town manager, determine whether the work proposed should be done and shall determine the responsibilities of the property owners with regard to the work with the following guidelines to apply: 
(1)  Driveways. Driveway entrances will be considered prior to the letting of contracts for the improvement. Driveway widths shall be constructed in accordance with the specifications of the town. Driveway entrance widths shall be requested and so marked by the property owner, as well as driveway entrance locations, prior to the letting of contracts. The property owner shall be responsible for the cost of replacing any driveway or walkway within the street right-of-way as a result of new street construction. Property owners desiring driveways from the driveway entrances and aprons onto their property shall be responsible for this work under separate contract. All driveways requiring curb cuts shall be paved from the street to the property line. The town shall not be responsible for irregular driveway tie-ins to any new driveway entrances and aprons because of differences of elevation. 
(2)  Old drainage pipe. Drainage pipe and other materials on the right-of-way at the time of construction which was purchased by the property owner will be removed and placed on the lot of the owner for his disposition. The town will haul away such items if so requested by the property owner. 
(3)  New drainage. Catchbasins, manholes, and storm sewer pipe are designed and installed in a way to best drain the project and not change the natural flow of water. As nearly as possible, streets are designed to pick up stormwater at the point where it leaves private property, carry it in the gutter or pipes through the project, and discharge it in a natural drainage ditch, usually on private property or a drainage easement. The town will install pipe in ditches in rights-of-way or in dedicated drainage easements if the property owners will purchase the pipe and have it delivered to the site. Under this policy, the town bears the costs of labor for the installation and the property owner bears the cost of the materials. Catchbasins, manholes, and storm sewer pipe designed to be installed within the project shall be considered a part of the project, the cost of which shall be included into the total cost of improvements. 
(4)  Removal of trees and shrubs. During the construction, it may be necessary to remove trees and shrubs which fall in line with the planned improvement. Any trees or shrubs a property owner wishes to transplant should be removed from this area before construction begins. 
(5)  Seeding and grassing after improvement. Property owners shall be responsible for seeding and grassing the area between the curb and the property line, as they may desire. Backfill behind the curbline shall be considered a part of the project and will be performed by either the town or the contractor. Special landscaping costs shall be borne by the property owner and shall be arranged by the property owner.

(a)  Upon completion of the street improvement, the town manager shall compile the total cost of the project and present to the Board of Commissioners at the next regularly scheduled meeting a report of the per front foot cost. After reviewing and accepting the manager's report, the board shall pass a resolution declaring the front foot costs to be assessed on the abutting lots and parcels of land, order preparation of an assessment roll, set a time for a public hearing on the assessment roll, and order the resolution published in a local newspaper notifying the public of the planned hearing. 
(b)  Each property owner affected shall receive a special notice of the meeting. At the time of the public hearing, the Board of Commissioners shall hear allegations and objections of all persons interested who appear.

Chapter 1 - PURPOSE AND APPLICABILITY 

1.1 - Title 
    This Ordinance is officially titled as the "Unified Development Ordinance of the Town of Wendell, North Carolina," and shall be known as the "UDO." 
1.2 - Intent 
    The general purpose of this Ordinance shall be to facilitate a coordinated, balanced, sustainable, and harmonious development of the land within the corporate limits of the town and the town's extraterritorial jurisdiction. More specific goals of the UDO are: to ensure such development occurs in a manner that will best promote the health, safety, and general welfare of the people; to provide economy in the process of development; to make provisions for traffic circulation and connectivity; to provide services to ensure safety from fire, panic, and other hazards; to optimize natural resources such as light and air; to facilitate the provision of transportation, water, sewage, schools, parks, and other public requirements; to promote desirable living conditions and the sustained stability of neighborhoods; to protect property against blight and depreciation; and to conserve environmental resources. 
    In addition, this Ordinance seeks to implement the policy recommendations of the Town Plan of Wendell as adopted by the Wendell Board of Commissioners on April 23, 2007 as well any subsequent amendments to that plan. This document reflects the collective vision of the citizens of Wendell with respect to how they desire their town to look and grow, including:

  Provide for the dedication or reservation of adequate spaces for open space, public lands and buildings; 
  Conserve and enhance environmental quality; 
  Provide for the dedication or provision of facilities for adequate stormwater management drainage. 
1.3 - Authority 
    The zoning provisions in this UDO are enacted herein are under the authority of North Carolina General Statute § 160A Article 19, which extends to cities the authority to enact regulations which promote the health, safety, and the general welfare of the community. It further authorizes cities to regulate and restrict the erection, construction, reconstruction, alteration, repair or use of buildings, structures, or land. This section authorizes the establishment of overlay districts in which additional regulations may be imposed upon properties that lie within the boundary of the district. The statutes also require that all such regulations shall be uniform for each use class or type of building throughout each district, but that the regulations in one district may differ from those in other districts. 
    The subdivision provisions in this UDO are enacted herein are under the authority of G.S. § 160A Article 19, Part 2 which provides for the coordination of streets within proposed subdivisions with existing or planned streets and with other public facilities; the dedication or reservation of recreation areas serving residents of the immediate neighborhood within the subdivision, or alternatively, for the provision of funds to be used to provide recreation opportunities serving residents of more than one neighborhood; and for the distribution of population and traffic in a manner that will avoid congestion and overcrowding. 
1.4 - Jurisdiction 
    The provisions of the UDO shall apply within the corporate limits of the Town and within the extraterritorial jurisdiction established by ordinance, as provided under GS §160A-360, the jurisdiction being delineated on a map and approved by the Wake County Board of Commissioners. These regulations apply to the development and use of all land and structures within the corporate limits of the Town of Wendell, North Carolina, and within the extraterritorial jurisdiction exercised by ordinance and denoted on the Zoning Map as is on file at the Wendell Planning Department. This map and its boundaries shall be incorporated and made part of this Ordinance. 
1.5 - Compliance or Required Conformance to UDO Provisions 
A.  Conformance In General. From and after the adoption of the UDO, no real property lying within the jurisdiction of the UDO shall be subdivided except in conformance with all applicable provisions of the UDO. In addition, after the effective date of the UDO, no plat for subdivision of land within the jurisdiction of the UDO shall be certified for recording by the Administrator, and the Clerk of Superior Court shall not order the recording of a plat until it has been submitted and approved in accordance with the provisions of the UDO. 
    Furthermore, no land or structure shall be used or occupied, and no structure or parts shall be constructed, erected, altered, or moved, unless in conformity with all of the regulations herein specified for the zoning district in which it is located. Every building erected, moved, or structurally altered shall be located on a lot conforming to the requirements of the district. 
B.  Exemptions for Bona Fide Farms. 
1.  As established by House Bill 168 (Session Law 2011-363) and described in G.S. 160A-360, Section 4, subsection (k), property that is used for bona fide farm purposes within Wendell's Extra Territorial Jurisdiction (ETJ) shall be exempt from the provisions of this ordinance. For the purpose of applying exemptions to bona fide farms, "property" means a single tract of property or an identifiable portion of a single tract. In order to determine whether a property is being used for bona fide farm purposes, refer to G.S. 160A-360, Section 4, subsection (k), or see the definition for "Bona Fide Farm" contained in Chapter 19. 
2.  As permitted under Senate Bill 263 (Session 2011), an accessory building of a "bona fide farm" as defined by G.S. 153A-340(b) within the Town of Wendell's zoning jurisdiction has the same exemption from the building code as it would have under county zoning as provided by Part 3 of Article 18 of Chapter 153A of the General Statutes. 
1.6 - Relation to Prior Zoning and Subdivision Ordinances 
A.  Continuation of Provisions. To the extent that the provisions of this chapter are the same as the previously adopted provisions that they replace in the Town of Wendell's Zoning Ordinance and Subdivision Regulations, they shall be considered as continuation thereof and not as new enactment unless otherwise specifically provided. 
B.  Repeal of Existing Subdivision and Zoning Regulations. Upon adoption of the UDO, the town's existing development regulations shall be repealed. These regulations include the subdivision regulations entitled "Subdivision Regulations of the Code of Ordinances of the Town of Wendell, North Carolina" as adopted on September 9, 2002 and as subsequently amended and the zoning regulations entitled "Zoning Code of Ordinances of the Town of Wendell, North Carolina" as adopted on January 14, 1980 and as subsequently amended. The adoption of the UDO, however, shall not affect or prevent any pending or future prosecution of, or action to abate an existing violation of said regulations. 
1.7 - Conflict with Other Laws 
    It is not intended that this Ordinance repeal, supersede, annul, impair, or interfere with any existing easements, private agreements, vested rights or building permits previously adopted or issued pursuant to law and currently effective. 
    All existing lots of record, platted prior to the adoption of this ordinance and upon which no buildings have been erected, shall be grandfathered upon the date of adoption of this ordinance and shall not be subject to the new lot standards herein. However, buildings upon such lots shall be subject to standards in this Ordinance. 
    Furthermore, should the courts declare any section or provisions of this chapter invalid, such decision shall not affect the validity of the chapter as a whole or any part thereof, other than the part so declared to be invalid. 
1.8 - Official Zoning Map 
    The map entitled Zoning Map of The Town of Wendell, North Carolina, as adopted by the Wendell Board of Commissioners and certified by the Town Clerk establishes the official zoning districts and overlay districts. 
A.  The Town is divided into districts whose locations and boundaries are shown on the official zoning map for the town. The Official Zoning Map of the Unified Development Ordinance is hereby adopted by reference and declared to be a part of this Ordinance. It is attached and recorded in the minutes of the Town Board of Commissioners. 
B.  The map shall be identified by the signature of the Mayor, attested by the Town Clerk, and bearing the official seal of the town under the following words: "This is to certify that this is the Official Zoning Map of the Unified Development Ordinance for the Town of Wendell, North Carolina." The date of adopting shall also be shown. 
C.  Changes to Map. 
1.  If, in accordance with the provisions of this chapter, changes are made in the zoning district boundaries or other matter shown on the map, such changes shall be made together with an entry on the map as follows: "On (date) by official action of the Town Board the following changes were made in the Official Zoning Map: (brief description of nature of change)." The entry shall be signed by the Mayor and attested by the Town Clerk. No amendment to this chapter that involves matter portrayed on the map shall become effective until after such change and entry have been made on the map. Changes to the map may be tracked by staff using Geographic Information Systems (GIS) software. 
2.  The Town Board shall give official notice of the zoning change to the Zoning Administrator within 24 hours after passage of the change. 
3.  Regardless of all copies of the map that may exist, the Official Zoning Map, which shall be located at Town Hall, shall be the final authority as to the current zoning status of land, water areas, and buildings in the town. 
D.  In the event that the Official Zoning Map becomes damaged, destroyed, lost, or difficult to interpret, the Town Board may by ordinance adopt a new Official Zoning Map, which shall be the same in every detail as the map it supersedes. The new map shall bear the signatures of the current Mayor and Town Clerk and shall bear the seal of the Town under the following words: "This is to certify that this Official Zoning Map supersedes and replaces the Official Zoning Map adopted (date of adoption of Map replaced)." The date of adoption of the new Official Zoning Map shall also be shown. 
E.  The Administrator shall be responsible for the maintenance and revision of the Official Zoning Map. Upon notification by the Town Board that a zoning change has been made, the Administrator shall make the necessary changes on the Official Zoning Map within 24 hours of notification. 
F.  Map Interpretation. The following rules shall apply in the interpretation of district boundaries and the location of centers shown on the zoning map: 
1.  Unless otherwise specifically indicated, where district boundaries are indicated on the zoning map as approximately parallel to following the centerline of a street, highway, railroad right-of-way, utility easement, streambed, or riverbed, or such lines extended, then the lines shall be construed to be the district boundaries. 
2.  Boundaries indicated, as approximately following platted lot lines, shall be construed as following the lot lines. 
3.  Boundaries indicated, as approximately following the Town limits, shall be construed as following the Town limits. 
4.  If a district boundary divides a lot, the requirement for the district in which the greater portion of the lot lies shall be extended to the balance of the lot, provided that such extension shall not include any part of the lot which lies more than 50 feet beyond the district boundary, and further provided that the remaining parcel shall not be less than the minimum required for the district in which it is located. 
5.  Where any public street or alley is hereafter officially vacated or abandoned, the regulations applicable to parcels of abutting property shall apply to that portion of the street or alley thereto by virtue of the vacation or abandonment. 
6.  In case any further uncertainty exists, the Board of Adjustment shall interpret the intent of the map as to the location of the boundaries. 
1.9 - Conformance with Adopted Plans 
    All development plans shall be in conformance with all adopted plans (including comprehensive plans, transportation plans, small area plans, open space and greenway plans, or any other plan adopted by the Wendell Board of Commissioners). 
A.  The Town Plan of Wendell. The Town Plan of Wendell was adopted by the Town of Wendell on April 23, 2007 and sets forth growth policies for the following 20 years.

C.  In any event, wherever the requirements of this chapter are in conflict with other requirements of lawfully adopted rules, regulations, ordinances, deed restrictions, or covenants, the most restrictive, or that imposing the highest standards, shall govern. 
D.  When any requirement of this Ordinance results in a fraction of a unit, a fraction of one-half or more shall be considered a whole unit and a fraction of less than one-half shall be disregarded. When the determination of the number of dwelling units permitted on a lot results in a fraction of a dwelling unit, a fraction of one-half or more shall be considered a dwelling unit and a fraction of less than one-half shall be disregarded.

Chapter 2 - DISTRICT PROVISIONS 

2.1 - General Intent 
    The zoning districts for the Town of Wendell are ordered and classified according to the Rural-Urban Transect, the model from which the Town's Framework Plan was derived. The Framework Plan is a policy map intended to provide guidance to Wendell's leaders as they make decisions on where and how the community should grow. 
    The Transect is a method of classifying the natural and built environments as a continuum of six conditions, ranging from rural to urban. The value of the Transect is that it classifies development form with the appropriate land use and development context. For example, a rural street typically has no curbs or sidewalks and its buildings look like farmhouses or barns. An urban street, depending on the intensity of urbanism, may have curbs and gutters, regularly placed street trees, sidewalks, and building forms that include common walls, flat roofs, and cornices. Each Transect zoning category has detailed provisions for the mix of uses, building type, density, height, street design, the design of parks and open space, the mix of uses, building design, parking, streetscape and other aspects of the human environment. 

T1 & T2: Natural & Rural Zones 
The Transect begins with two zones that are rural in character: the Natural Zone (or T-1), which is made up of lands protected in perpetuity as natural, recreational or agricultural areas; and the Rural Zone (T-2), which includes areas of high agricultural, scenic, or environmental value that should be protected. 
T3: Suburban Zone 
The transition zone between countryside and town is called the Suburban Zone (T-3). The T-3 area consists primarily of single family homes. Although the T-3 area is primarily a residential zone, it may have other development types, such as schools and other civic uses. 
T4: General Urban Zone 
T-4 development is primarily residential, but more urban in character, having a higher density with a mix of housing types and a greater mix of uses, including neighborhood-serving commercial uses. 
T5: Urban Center Zone 
At the more urban end of the spectrum is the Urban Center Zone, or T-5. This can be a small neighborhood center or a larger Community/Town center, the latter serving more than one neighborhood. 
T6: Urban Core Zone 
The Urban Core or Downtown (T-6) serves not only adjacent neighborhoods, but the entire town and the region. It is typically the central business district where the greatest mix of uses occurs. 
    Special Districts. The Special Districts make allowance for specialized activities and development types, such as big box retail, institutional campuses, and industrial zones. 
    The zoning districts for the Town of Wendell have been ordered along the Rural-Urban Transect, providing for appropriate development standards along the continuum (rather than a one-size-fits all approach) as well as a simplified tool for users of this Ordinance to facilitate appropriate forms of development. 
    The graphic on this page shows the defining features of various types of developments along the Rural-Urban Transect spectrum. 

A.  Establishment of Base Districts. In accordance with North Carolina General Statute 160A-382 that sets forth the establishment of zoning regulation by district, the Town of Wendell is hereby divided into various zoning districts that set forth uniform regulations for the development of land within each district. 
    These district regulations are intended to provide a regulating plan for the use of land and buildings in standards of good health and safety and in conditions of orderly community development. These regulations shall apply to all land and structures within the respective zoning district.

*Designated floodplain area may not be platted as buildable lot. 
B.  Planned Development Districts. The following districts function as floating overlay districts. They are permitted subject to the minimum development size and/or density of the underlying district. 
Traditional Neighborhood Development (TND) ( Old NT and PUD) 
C.  Overlay Districts. In accordance with North Carolina General Statute 160A-382, the following overlay districts are established. These overlay districts impose additional requirements on properties within one or more underlying base or conditional districts. 
Manufactured Housing Overlay (MHO) (Old MHOD) 
Gateway Overlay (GO) (Old SHOD) 
D.  Conditional Districts. Where lands are classified in a conditional zoning district, any conditions approved by the Board of Commissioners shall apply in addition to the regulations governing development in the corresponding base zoning district. The procedure for the establishment of these districts is found in Section 15.13. See Section 2.18, Conditional Districts, for additional details. Each District has a corresponding Conditional District. 
2.2 - Form-Based Standards by Zoning District 

2.3 - Use Categories and Tables of Permitted Uses 
A.  All uses permitted in this Ordinance have been divided into eight general categories and are generally defined as follows: 
1.  Residential. Premises available for long-term human habitation by means of ownership and rental, but excluding short-term leasing or rental of less than a month's duration. 
2.  Lodging. Premises available for short-term human habitation, including daily and weekly rental. 
3.  Office/Service. Premises available for the transaction of general business and the provision of services, but excluding retail sales and manufacturing, except as a minority component. 
4.  Retail/Restaurants. Premises available for the commercial sale of merchandise, prepared foods, and food and drink consumption, but excluding manufacturing. 
5.  Entertainment/Recreation. Premises for the gathering of people for purposes such as arts and culture, amusement, and recreation. 
6.  Manufacturing/Wholesale/Storage. Premises available for the creation, assemblage, storage, and repair of items including their wholesale or retail sale. 
7.  Civic/Institutional. Premises available for organizations dedicated to religion, education, government, social service, health care, and other similar functions. 
8.  Infrastructure. Uses and structures dedicated to transportation, communication, information, and utilities. 
B.  Interpretation of Use Matrices. 
1.  Permitted/Prohibited Uses. Uses not listed as permitted (P); permitted with additional standards (PS); or requiring a special use permit (SUP) are presumed to be prohibited from the applicable zoning district. 
2.  Uses Not Listed. In the event that a particular use is not listed in the Use Matrix, and such use is not listed as a prohibited use and is not otherwise prohibited by law, the Administrator shall determine whether a materially similar use exists in this Chapter. Should the Administrator determine that a materially similar use does exist, the regulations governing that use shall apply to the particular use not listed and the Administrator's decision shall be recorded in writing. Should the Administrator determine that a materially similar use does not exist, this Chapter may be amended to establish a specific listing for the use in question. 
a.  Materially Similar Uses. The Administrator may determine that a use is materially similar if: 
i.  The use is listed as within the same Structure or Function classification as the use specifically enumerated in the Use Matrix, as determined by the Land-Based Classification Standards ("LBCS") of the American Planning Association [Reference: http://www.planning.org/lbcs/index.html]. The use shall be considered materially similar if it falls within the same LBCS classification and meets the requirements of subsection ii below. 
ii.  The proposed use shall not generate average daily trips exceeding other similar uses proposed in the zoning district by more than 10 percent, as determined by the Institute of Transportation Engineers, Trip Generation (most recent edition)(the "ITE Manual"), which document is hereby incorporated by this reference. If the trip generation is not listed in the ITE Manual, then the use shall be considered materially similar to the use that most closely approximates the proposed use. The Administrator may also refer to similar local traffic studies. 
3.  Rules of Construction. In order to assist in interpretation of the Use Matrix, the LBCS numbers, where applicable, are enumerated in Chapter 19, Definitions. In interpreting the Use Matrix, the following rules of construction shall apply: 
a.  If a use is listed for a specific classification, while a more general classification within the same industry classification is also listed for another use, the specific classification governs. A specific use is not permitted in all districts where uses assigned to the general classification are permitted simply because they share a similar LBCS code number. The numbers increase as the use classifications get more specific. 
b.  Some uses are listed separately, but fall within the same LBCS classification. The uses within one such classification are not permitted in other zoning districts simply because they fall within the same LBCS classification. 
C.  Use Matrices.

Chapter 5 - BUILDING TYPES AND DESIGN STANDARDS 

5.1 - Purpose and Intent 
    The standards in this Chapter are intended to attach the same or greater level of importance to building design as is placed on the uses contained within buildings. The established architectural vernacular of the Town of Wendell exhibits a wide variety of common building types and this Ordinance has established regulations specific to these typologies. The rich architectural history and vocabulary of the Town presents a wide variety of development options for using traditional building forms. New and renovated buildings in Wendell are expected to contribute to the vibrancy and attractiveness of the Town. 
    This chapter is guided by and intends to fulfill the following principles of the Town Plan of Wendell: 
  Preserve the small-town feel and historic character of the community. 
  Protect and enhance the strengths of the downtown core. 
  Promote Wendell's attractiveness to business and people of all walks of life. 
  Provide for a range of housing opportunities, including upscale housing, senior housing, and downtown living choices. 
5.2 - Applicability 
    The following provisions shall apply throughout the jurisdiction of this Ordinance, regardless of the underlying zoning district provisions. However, the building type standards only apply to those buildings which are specified for the various zoning districts in this chapter. 
5.3 - General Building Design Requirements 
    Unless otherwise noted, all buildings except manufactured buildings and those regulated by the North Carolina Building Code for One and Two-Family Dwellings shall meet the following provisions: 

A.  All Buildings to Front on Street or Public Space: All buildings except for buildings in the M&I District shall front on a public street or public space. Such buildings shall include a principal building entrance and architectural front. With the provision of alley access, lots may front upon a public open space which shall have public street access, but shall be of sufficient design to allow for access by emergency services. 

B.  Building Entrances: A primary entrance facade shall be oriented toward the street, be designed for the pedestrian, and be distinguishable from the rest of the building and other entrances. Additional entrances may be oriented toward side or rear parking lots. Service entrances for shipping and receiving shall be oriented away from the public street. 

C.  Architectural Style: When a building design exhibits a known architectural style (e.g., Colonial, Victorian, Classical Revival) the details shall be complementary with that style. 
D.  Termination of Vistas: Important street vistas identified in any adopted plan should terminate in a focal point, such as a building or other architectural or natural feature. 
E.  Compatibility: Adjacent buildings should relate in similarity of scale, roof pitch, height, architectural elements, and/or lot configuration. 
F.  Wall Materials: When two or more materials are used on a facade, the visually heavier material (i.e., masonry) should be placed below the lighter material (i.e., siding) to give the sense of support and grounding. 
G.  Underground Wiring: To reduce the visual impact of overhead wiring, new utility services shall be located underground. 
H.  Type of Construction: Manufactured, mobile, and metal units shall be prohibited, except as may be allowed in Section 4.6, Temporary Uses, for a temporary office or classrooms, site management, or storage uses during construction projects. 
I.  Roof Pitch: Roof pitches less than 4:12 and flat roofs will require a parapet wall. 
J.  Public Art: Public art, such as statues, fountains, and other works of art are encouraged. 
5.4 - Exceptions 
A.  While it is expected that some new building types will be introduced to the Town, these variations should be based upon the predominant types listed in this Chapter. Innovative planning or design ideas for development in any district where the proposed building types are different than those allowed by the base district requirements may be approved subject to the approval of a Conditional District. 
B.  Buildings in the M&I District are exempt from the building design requirements of this chapter, except for those requirements in Section 5.6, Encroachments. 
C.  Where specific architectural elements are required as part of an adopted plan or associated with local historic guidelines, these shall take precedence over the building design requirements of this chapter. 
5.5 - Building Heights 
    Building heights shall be as specified in the building type sections that follows and shall be determined according to the provisions below. 
A.  Story: That part of a building or building above ground level and between a floor and the floor or roof next above shall be considered a story. A mezzanine shall be considered a story if it exceeds one-third of the area of the floor immediately below. A penthouse shall be considered a story if it exceeds one-third of the area of the roof. The under-roof area with dormers does not count as a story. 

B.  Items Not Included in Calculation: The height limitations of this Ordinance shall not apply to church spires, belfries, cupolas, and domes not intended for human occupancy, monuments, water towers, mechanical penthouses (provided they are set back 20 feet from the front elevation), observation towers, transmission towers, chimneys, smokestacks, conveyors, flagpoles, masts and antennas (provided evidence from appropriate authorities is submitted to the effect that such building or buildings will not interfere with any airport zones or flight patterns). 
    As noted above, the portion of a residential building that is located within a pitched roof areas (attic area) shall not be counted toward the maximum story requirement. 
5.6 - Encroachments 
    Certain architectural features are permitted to encroach into the front setback (except as noted). The following standards shall be established for encroachments: 
A.  Arcades: Building arcades, if provided, should be designed to avoid the swing of car doors parked parallel to the arcade. In addition the sidewalk within the arcade should be sufficient to accommodate the intended uses (i.e. outdoor seating) while providing suitable clearances per the American with Disabilities Act Accessibilities Guidelines (ADAAG). 

Building arcades should avoid the swing of car doors and provide adequate space for pedestrians. 
B.  Awnings: All commercial awnings, if provided, may encroach and shall be supported by means of a frame attached directly to the building receiving beneficial use of the awning. In no case shall awnings be supported by a frame attached to a sidewalk or other public right-of-way. 
C.  Bay Windows: Commercial Bay windows shall not exceed a maximum projection of two feet from the primary wall. In addition, it shall not contain habitable floor space, but may provide seating as an integral element. 
D.  Balconies, Porches, and Stoops: Only open balconies, porches, and stoops are permitted as encroachments. To the extent possible, these features are to remain visually permeable so that the front door can be easily seen from the street or sidewalk. Roofs and Ordinance-required railings are permitted. Enclosure of these areas with screening is considered an enclosure for the purposes of this section. 
E.  Handicapped Ramps: A ramp installed on a residential building to provide access for a disabled resident may encroach into the front setback, unless a less obtrusive means of access can be provided at another entry point (i.e., the back door). 
F.  Rear Yard Encroachments: Open decks, porches, patios, and other similar buildings not exceeding a finished height above grade of 30 inches may encroach into the side and rear setback to within five feet of the property line. 
G.  Encroachments over the Public Rights-of-Way: With approval of the Town or NCDOT (whichever has authority over a street), upper story balconies or bay windows may encroach into the right-of-way, but shall be a minimum of three feet behind the curb. 
H.  Shrubbery, Driveways, Retaining Walls, Fences, Curbs, Ornamental Objects, and Buffer strips: Shrubbery, driveways, retaining walls, fences, curbs, ornamental objects, and planted buffer strips shall not be construed to be encroachments on yards.

Chapter 6 - ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION 

6.1 - Purpose and Intent 
    A primary and fundamental element of this Ordinance is the protection of our existing environmental resources including floodplains and other stream corridors, wetlands, watersheds and groundwater recharge areas, soils, forest stands, specimen trees and other significant vegetation and wildlife. These elements are of economic value to the Town and make it a desirable place to live and visit. 
6.2 - Land Suitability 
    Land subject to flood hazard, improper drainage, erosion or that is for topographical or other reasons unsuitable for development as determined by the Town of Wendell, shall not be platted or developed for residential use nor for any other uses that will continue or increase the danger to health, safety, or property unless the hazards can be and are corrected. 
A.  Demolition Landfill Development: Areas that have been used for the disposal of solid waste shall not be subdivided into commercial or residential building sites. This includes areas that have been used for the disposal of trash, demolition waste, construction debris, stumps, and other waste materials.

The steepness of the proposed slope at clearing limit is greater (steeper) than 3:1 (horizontal: vertical) 4. The height of the proposed grade change (cut or fill) is less than or equal to 3 feet. 4. The height of the proposed grade change is greater than 3 feet.  
6.5 - Stormwater Runoff Provisions: Post-Construction Stormwater Ordinance 
A.  Title: This section and related sections shall officially be known as the "Post-Construction Stormwater Ordinance." 
B.  Authority: The Town of Wendell is authorized to adopt this ordinance pursuant to North Carolina law, including but not limited to Article 14, Section 5 of the Constitution of North Carolina; the municipal Charter of the Town of Wendell; North Carolina General Statutes 143-214.7 and rules promulgated by the Environmental Management Commission thereunder; Session Law 2004-163; Chapter 160A, §§ 174, 185 [as well as Chapter 113A, Article 4 (Sedimentation Pollution Control)]; [Article 21, Part 6 (Floodway Regulation)]; [Chapter 160A, Article 19 (Planning and Regulation of Development); Chapter 153A, Article 18]; as well as Chapter 153A, Article 18 related to statutory authority for planning and regulation of development (Parts 1, 2, and 3), including particularly but not limited to G.S. 153A-324 (enforcement), G.S. 153A-330 and 331 (subdivision), G.S. 153A-340 (zoning). 
C.  Findings. It is hereby determined that: 
    Development and redevelopment alter the hydrologic response of local watersheds and increases stormwater runoff rates and volumes, flooding, soil erosion, stream channel erosion, nonpoint and point source pollution, and sediment transport and deposition, as well as reducing groundwater recharge; 
    These effects can be managed and minimized by applying proper design and well-planned controls to manage stormwater runoff from development sites. 
    Further, the Federal Water Pollution Control Act of 1972 ("Clean Water Act") and federal Post-Construction Stormwater Rules promulgated under it compel the Town to adopt the minimum stormwater controls such as those included in this ordinance. 
    Therefore, the Town of Wendell establishes this set of water quality and quantity regulations to meet the requirements of state and federal law regarding control of stormwater runoff and discharge. 
D.  Purpose. 
1.  General: The purpose of this ordinance is to protect, maintain and enhance the public health, safety, environment and general welfare by establishing minimum requirements and procedures to control the adverse effects of increased post-development stormwater runoff and nonpoint and point source pollution associated with new development and redevelopment as well as illicit discharges into municipal stormwater systems. 
2.  Specific: This ordinance seeks to meet its general purpose through the following specific objectives and means: 
a.  Requiring that new development and redevelopment maintain the pre-development hydrologic response in their post-development state as nearly as practicable for the applicable design storm to reduce flooding, stream bank erosion, nonpoint and point source; 
b.  Establishing minimum post-development stormwater management standards and design criteria for the regulation and control of stormwater runoff quantity and quality; 
c.  Encouraging the use of better management and site design practices, such as the use of vegetated conveyances for stormwater and the preservation of green space and other conservation areas to the maximum extent practicable; 
d.  Establishing provisions for the long-term responsibility for and maintenance of Structural and Non-Structural stormwater BMPs to ensure that they continue to function as designed, are maintained appropriately, and pose no threat to public safety; 
e.  Establishing administrative procedures for the submission, review, approval and disapproval of stormwater management plans, for the inspection of approved projects, and to assure appropriate long-term maintenance; 
f.  Managing flooding and downstream impacts with an awareness of impending regional growth. 
E.  Definitions: When used in this Ordinance, the following words and terms shall have the meaning set forth in this section, unless other provisions of this Ordinance specifically indicate otherwise. 
    Built-upon area (BUA) means that portion of a development project that is covered by impervious or partially impervious surface including, but not limited to, buildings; pavement and gravel areas such as roads, parking lots, and paths; and recreation facilities such as tennis courts. "Built-upon area" does not include a wooden slatted deck, the water area of a swimming pool, or permeable pavement that meets the standards outlined in the North Carolina Division of Water Quality Stormwater Best Management Practices Manual. 
    Density means the calculation of the total impervious area of a project divided by the total project area. Surface water bodies shall be included in calculations of project density. 
    Department means the North Carolina Department of Environment and Natural Resources. 
    Design Manual means the North Carolina Department of Environment and Natural Resources Stormwater Best Practices Manual approved for use in Phase II jurisdictions by the Department for the proper implementation of the requirements of the federal Phase II stormwater program. All references herein to the Design Manual are to the latest published edition or revision. 
    Development means any land disturbing activity that increases the amount of built-upon area or that decreases the infiltration of precipitation into the soil. 
    Division means the Division of Water Quality in the North Carolina Department of Environment and Natural Resources. 
    Flood Protection Zone means the FEMA 100-year floodplain as identified on the current Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) published by FEMA. 
    High-Density Project. A project is a High-Density Project if it has 24 percent or more Built-upon Area (BUA) based on total project acreage for all residential and non-residential Development. Any project that exceeds the low density threshold for built-upon area. 
    Impervious Area. Impervious areas are those surfaces which prevent the infiltration of or impede the rate of infiltration of stormwater into the soil as compared with the natural conditions prior to development. Common areas include, but are not limited to, rooftops, sidewalks, walkways, patio areas, driveways, parking lots, storage areas, engineered and compacted gravel surfaces used for vehicular travel or parking and other surfaces which prevent or impede the natural infiltration of stormwater runoff that existed prior to development. 
    Larger common plan of development or sale means an area where multiple separate and distinct construction or land disturbing activities will occur under one plan. A plan is any announcement or piece of documentation (including but not limited to a sign, public notice or hearing, sales pitch, advertisement, loan application, drawing, permit application, zoning request, subdivision application or computer design) or physical demarcation (including but not limited to boundary signs, lot stakes, or surveyor markings) indicating that construction activities may occur on a specific plot. 
    Low-Density project. A project is a Low-Density project if it has more than 15 percent Built-Upon Area (BUA) and no more 24 percent Built-Upon Area(BUA) based on total project acreage for all residential and non-residential development. 
    A project with an overall density at or below the relevant Low-Density threshold, but containing areas with a density greater than the overall project density, may be considered low density as long as the project meets or exceeds the post-construction model practices for Low-Density projects and locates the higher density in upland areas and away from surface waters and drainage ways to the maximum extent practical. 
    Non-Structural BMP means a practice that is intended to reduce the impacts of stormwater runoff by managing pollution at the source and that is not a physical device constructed to control or treat stormwater runoff. Examples of Non-Structural BMP's include reducing impervious areas, making use of existing natural features and system, reforestation, and cluster development. 
    1-year, 24-hour storm means the surface runoff resulting from a 24-hour rainfall of an intensity expected to be equaled or exceeded, on average, once in 12 months and with a duration of 24 hours. 
    Owner means the legal or beneficial owner of land, including but not limited to a mortgagee or vendee in possession, receiver, executor, trustee, or long-term or commercial lessee, or any other person or entity holding proprietary rights in the property or having legal power of management and control of the property. "Owner" shall include long-term commercial tenants; management entities, such as those charged with or engaged in the management of properties for profit; and every person or entity having joint ownership of the property. 
    Redevelopment means any rebuilding activity other than a rebuilding activity that results in no net increase in built-upon area and provides equal or greater stormwater control than the previous development. 
    Residential infill development means residential development which is 1) located within the primary corporate limits or adjacent to the primary corporate limits, and 2) less than 20 acres in size, and 3) has no vacant or underdeveloped land of ten acres or more in size adjacent to the project which could be feasibly added to the development to create a larger subdivision. 
    Structural BMP means a physical device designed to trap, settle out, or filter pollutants from stormwater runoff; to alter or reduce stormwater runoff velocity, amount, timing, or other characteristics; to approximate the pre-development hydrology on a developed site; or to achieve any combination of these goals. Structural BMP includes physical practices such as constructed wetlands, vegetative practices, filter strips, grassed swales, and other methods installed or created on real property. 
    Substantial progress. For the purposes of determining whether sufficient progress has been made on an approved plan, one or more of the following construction activities toward the completion of a site or subdivision plan shall occur: 
(1)  Obtaining a grading permit and conducting grading activity on a continuous basis and not discontinued for more than 30 days; or 
(2)  Installation and approval of on-site infrastructure; or obtaining a building permit for the construction and approval of a building foundation. 
    Substantial progress for purposes of determining whether an approved plan is null and void is not necessarily the same as "substantial expenditures" used for determining vested rights pursuant to applicable law. 
    Ultra Low-Density Project. A project is an Ultra Low-Density project if it has 15 percent or less Built-Upon Area (BUA) and has less than one dwelling unit per acre for all residential and non-residential Development. 
    A project with an overall density at or below the relevant Ultra Low-Density threshold, but containing areas with a density greater than the overall project density, may be considered ultra low-density as long as the project meets or exceeds the post-construction model practices for Ultra Low-Density projects and locates the higher density in upland areas and away from surface waters and drainage ways to the maximum extent practicable.

3.  Applications for Approval. 
a.  Concept Plan and Consultation Meeting. Before a stormwater management permit application is deemed complete, the Stormwater Administrator or developer may request a consultation on a concept plan for the post-construction stormwater management system to be utilized in the proposed development project. This consultation meeting should take place at the time of the preliminary plan of subdivision or other early step in the development process. The purpose of this meeting is to discuss the post-construction stormwater management measures necessary for the proposed project, as well as to discuss and assess constraints, opportunities and potential approaches to stormwater management designs before formal site design engineering is commenced. Local watershed plans, the Zebulon and Wendell Open Space and Greenway Master Plan, the Framework Plan (as described in the Town of Wendell Comprehensive Plan), and other relevant resource protection plans should be consulted in the discussion of the concept plan. 
To accomplish this goal, the following information should be included in the concept plan, which should be submitted in advance of the meeting: 
i.  Existing Conditions/Proposed Site Plans: Existing conditions and proposed site layout sketch plans, which illustrate at a minimum: existing and proposed topography; Perennial and Intermittent streams; mapping of predominant soils from soil surveys (if available); boundaries of existing predominant vegetation; proposed limits of clearing and grading; and location of existing and proposed roads, buildings, parking areas and other impervious surfaces. 
ii.  Natural Resources Inventory: A written and graphic inventory of natural resources at the site and surrounding area as it exists prior to the commencement of the project. This description should include a discussion of soil conditions, forest cover, geologic features, topography, wetlands, and native vegetative areas on the site, as well as the location and boundaries of other natural feature protection and conservation areas such as lakes, ponds, floodplains, stream buffers, Flood Protection Zones, and other setbacks (e.g., drinking water well setbacks, septic setbacks, etc.). Particular attention should be paid to environmentally sensitive features that provide particular opportunities or constraints for Development and stormwater management. 
iii.  Stormwater Management System Concept Plan: A written and graphic concept plan of the proposed post-development stormwater management system including: preliminary selection and location of proposed structural stormwater controls; low-impact design elements; location of existing and proposed conveyance systems such as grass channels, swales, and storm drains; flow paths; location of floodplain/floodway limits; relationship of site to upstream and downstream properties and drainages; and preliminary location of any proposed stream channel modifications, such as bridge or culvert crossings. 
b.  Stormwater Management Permit Application. 
i.  Purpose: The stormwater management permit application shall detail how post-development stormwater runoff will be controlled and managed and how the proposed project will meet the requirements of this ordinance, including Section N, Standards. 
ii.  Downstream Impact Analysis: As part of the permit application, all development and redevelopment shall perform a Downstream Impact Analysis as specified in Section N.1. 
iii.  Plan Certification: All such plans shall be prepared by a qualified registered North Carolina professional engineer, surveyor, soil scientist or landscape architect, and the engineer, surveyor, soil scientist or landscape architect shall perform services only in their area of competence, and shall verify that the design of all stormwater management facilities and practices meets the submittal requirements for complete applications, that the designs and plans are sufficient to comply with applicable standards and policies found in the Design Manual, and that the designs and plans ensure compliance with this ordinance.

M.  Standards Based on Project Density. 
1.  Development Standards for Ultra-Low and Low-Density Projects: Ultra-Low and Low-Density projects shall comply with each of the following standards, in addition to the general standards found in Section B in this Section: 
a.  Stormwater runoff from the development shall be transported from the development by vegetated conveyances to the maximum extent practicable. 
b.  All Development and Redevelopment shall be located outside the Riparian Buffer Zone and Flood Protection Zone. 
c.  The approval of the stormwater permit shall require an enforceable restriction on property usage that runs with the land, such as a recorded deed restriction or protective covenants, to ensure that future development and redevelopment maintains the site consistent with the approved project plans. 
d.  With the exception of Residential Infill Development, no Development or Redevelopment shall contribute a nitrogen export lead exceeding 3.6 pounds per acre per year, unless it achieves classification as an LID Project in accordance with Section N.2.5. In calculating the nitrogen export, the applicant must use the known footprint method. 
e.  For Ultra Low-Density Projects only, pervious portions of the site must be utilized to the maximum extent practicable to convey and control stormwater runoff. 
f.  For Low-Density Projects only, Structural and Non-Structural BMPs shall control and treat the difference in the stormwater runoff peak discharge rate leaving the project site between the pre- and post-development conditions for, at a minimum, the one-year, 24-hour storm. Runoff volume drawdown time shall be a minimum of 48 hours, but not more than 120 hours. 
g.  General engineering design criteria for all projects shall be in accordance with 15A NCAC 2H .1008(c), as explained in the Design Manual. 
h.  Developers must manage residential runoff so that after Development the site will not exceed the Target Curve Numbers in the table in Section M.2. 
i.  Ultra-Low Density Projects and Low-Density Projects may be eligible for target curve number credits, as described found in Section M.3, below. 
2.  Maximum Curve Number after Development: Developers must manage residential runoff so that after development the site will not exceed the following composite curve numbers, in accordance with procedures specified in the United States Department of Agriculture, Natural Resource Conservation Service, Technical Release 55, Urban Hydrology for Small Watersheds. 
Project Density Maximum Composite Curve Number, by Soil Group A B C D Ultra-Low 43 63 76 81 Low 48 66 78 83 High n/a n/a n/a n/a  
3.  Target Curve Number Credits. 
a.  Purpose: The purpose of establishing a stormwater credit system is to provide incentives to implement better site design and locate new development in a manner that causes less impact to aquatic resources. Certain development practices reduce the generation of stormwater from the site; thereby reducing the size and cost of stormwater storage. In addition, these practices can provide partial removal of many pollutants. The credit system directly translates into cost savings and better protection of water resources. 
b.  Disconnected Impervious Surfaces: Disconnected impervious surfaces, included permeable pavers, are encouraged. Runoff from these disconnected surfaces must be spread over pervious areas as sheet flow. As a credit, these disconnected impervious surfaces will be assigned the lower curve number specified by procedures of the United States Department of Agriculture, Natural Resources Conservation Service, Technical Release 55, Urban Hydrology for Small Watersheds. 
c.  Reforestation: The planting of trees and shrubs is encouraged as a means of reducing runoff. As a credit for such practices, reforested areas will be assigned the curve number for woods in good condition per procedures in the United States Department of Agriculture, Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS), Technical Release 55, Urban Hydrology for Small Watersheds . Areas planted with trees or shrubs must meet the following standards to qualify for the credit. 
i.  Tree/Shrub Density and Spacing: Planted trees or shrubs must meet the minimum density and spacing standards of the NRCS, as specified in the Field Office Technical Guide. Existing trees or shrubs may be used towards meeting the planting standard. 
ii.  Mulching: An initial application of mulch is required for the area designated for reforestation. Mulching must meet applicable standards of the NRCS, as specified in the Field Office Technical Guide. Existing groundcover may be used towards meeting the mulching standard. 
d.  Cluster and Open Space Subdivisions: Cluster and open space subdivisions are encouraged. In applying curve number calculations to such developments, calculations must take into account the lots' proportionate share of right-of-way and permanent open space. 
e.  Calculations Regarding Ponds, Lakes, and Streams: Surface water bodies may not be assigned a curve number for impervious surfaces. Instead, such water bodies will be removed from calculations so that developments are not penalized for their presence. Surface water bodies shall be included in calculations of project density. 
4.  Development Standards for High-Density Projects: High-density projects shall implement stormwater control measures that comply with each of the following standards, in addition to the general standards found in subsection N of this chapter. 
a.  The measures shall control and treat runoff from the first inch of rain. Runoff volume drawdown time shall be a minimum of 48 hours, but not more than 120 hours. 
b.  All structural stormwater treatment systems used to meet the requirements of the program shall be designed to have a minimum of 85 percent average annual removal for Total Suspended Solids (TSS). 
c.  With the exception of Residential Infill Development, no Development or Redevelopment shall contribute a nitrogen export lead exceeding 3.6 pounds per acre per year, unless it achieves classification as an LID Project in accordance with Section N.2.5. In calculating the nitrogen export, the applicant must use the know footprint method. 
d.  Structural and Non-Structural BMPs shall be used to ensure there is no net increase in peak flow leaving the site from the pre- and post-development conditions for the one-year, 24-hour storm. Runoff volume drawdown time shall be a minimum of 48 hours, but not more than 120 hours. 
e.  General engineering design criteria for all projects shall be in accordance with 15A NCAC 2H .1008(c), as explained in the Design Manual. 
f.  All development and redevelopment shall be located outside the Riparian Buffer and Flood Protection Zone. These zones shall be in accordance with the following provisions: 
i.  Except where other applicable buffer standards are more restrictive, the Riparian Buffer Zone shall extend a minimum of 50 feet landward of all Perennial and Intermittent Surface Waters. The most restrictive standards shall apply. 
ii.  The Riparian Buffer Zone shall remain undisturbed unless otherwise permitted by this section. 
iii.  The Flood Protection Zone shall extend throughout the FEMA 100-year floodplain as identified on the current Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) published by FEMA. The Flood Protection Zone shall remain undisturbed unless otherwise permitted by this section. 
iv.  No Development or Redevelopment is permitted within the Riparian Buffer Zone or the Flood Protection Zone except for stream bank or shoreline restoration or stabilization, water dependent structures, and public or private projects such as road crossings and installations, utility crossings and installations, and greenways, where no practical alternatives exist. 
v.  Permitted activities within the Riparian Buffer Zone and the Flood Protection Zone shall minimize impervious coverage, direct runoff away from surface waters to achieve diffuse flow, and maximize the utilization of Non-Structural BMPs. 
vi.  Where the Riparian Buffer Zone and the Flood Protection Zone both are present adjacent to surface waters, the more restrictive shall apply. 
g.  The approval of the stormwater permit shall require an enforceable restriction on property usage that runs with the land, such as recorded deed restrictions or protective covenants, to ensure that future Development and Redevelopment maintains the site consistent with the approved project plans. Buffer widths and locations shall be clearly delineated on all plans, final plat, and as-builts. 
N.  General Standards. 
1.  Downstream Impact Analysis: The Downstream Impact Analysis must be performed in accordance with the "ten percent rule," and a copy of the analysis must be provided with the permit application. The purpose of the Downstream Impact Analysis is to determine if the project will cause any unintentional additional impacts on flooding or channel degradation downstream of the project site. The analysis must include the assumptions, results and supporting calculations to show safe passage of post-development design flows downstream. This analysis shall be performed at the outlet(s) of the site, and downstream at each tributary junction to the point(s) in the conveyance system where the area of the portion of the site draining into the system is less than or equal to ten percent of the total drainage area above that point. 
The typical steps in the application of the ten percent rule are: 
a.  Using a topographical map, determine the point downstream where the proposed site equals ten percent of the total drainage area, called ten percent point. Identify all tributary junctions between the downstream site boundary and the ten percent point. All points identified, as well as the outlet of the site, are known as ten percent rule comparison points. 
b.  Using a hydraulic model with existing land uses, determine the pre-development peak runoff rate (cfs) for the ten-year design storm event at each comparison point. 
c.  Insert the proposed site design and proposed BMP's into land uses and determine the post-development peak runoff rate for the ten-year design storm at each comparison point. 
d.  If the ten-year post-development peak discharge rate is greater than the pre-development discharge rate at any comparison point, then one of the following actions must be taken: 
i.  Revise the site plan for the proposed site to incorporate better use of natural features, design additional structural control facilities, reduce impervious cover, or alter timing of peak flows to lower post-Development flows at each comparison point to pre-Development levels. 
ii.  Obtain a flow easement from downstream property owners through the ten percent point where the post-Development peak discharge rate is higher than the pre-Development peak discharge rate. 
iii.  Work with the town to determine other acceptable approaches to reduce the peak discharge rate for the ten-year storm. 
For further information on the ten percent rule, refer to the Georgia Stormwater Manual , www.georgiastormwater.com. 
2.  Standards for Stormwater Control Measures. 
a.  Evaluation According to Contents of Design Manual: All stormwater control measures and stormwater treatment practices (or BMPs) required under this ordinance shall be evaluated by the Stormwater Administrator according to the policies, criteria, and information, including technical specifications and standards and the specific design criteria for each stormwater practice, in the Design Manual. The Stormwater Administrator shall determine whether proposed BMPs will be adequate to meet the requirements of this ordinance. 
b.  Determination of Adequacy; Presumptions and Alternatives: Stormwater treatment practices that are designed, constructed, and maintained in accordance with the criteria and specifications in the Design Manual will be presumed to meet the minimum water quality and quantity performance standards of this ordinance. Whenever an applicant proposes to utilize a practice or practices not designed and constructed in accordance with the criteria and specifications in the Design Manual, the applicant shall have the burden of demonstrating that the practice(s) will satisfy the minimum water quality and quantity performance standards of this ordinance. The Stormwater Administrator may require the applicant to provide documentation, calculations, and examples as necessary for the Stormwater Administrator to determine whether such an affirmative showing is made. 
c.  Separation from Seasonal High Water Table: For BMPs that require a separation from the seasonal high-water table, the separation shall be provided by at least 12 inches of naturally occurring soil above the seasonal high-water table. 
d.  Changes to Stormwater Plan Based on Emerging Technologies: Subject to the standards of this ordinance and other applicable law, a developer, in conjunction with the development's lot owners, may submit an application to revise the approved stormwater plan so as to use new technologies or best management practices not available when the original stormwater plan was approved. Innovative technologies may be used on a demonstration basis for a period of one year while simultaneously collecting data on the effectiveness of the technology according to its design. If at the end of the demonstration period the technology is not performing according to its intended design functions as judged by the Stormwater Administrator, the developer must retrofit the site with a standard technology. 
3.  Additional Stormwater Management Measures: In some cases, the Stormwater Administrator may require more stringent stormwater management measures where it is determined that additional measures are required to protect water quality and maintain existing and anticipated uses of these waters or to minimize offsite damage from stormwater runoff in accordance with the purpose of this ordinance as defined in Section D. 
4.  Dedication of BMPS, Facilities and Improvements: The town may accept dedication of any existing or future stormwater management facility for maintenance, provided such facility meets all the requirements of this ordinance and includes adequate and perpetual access and sufficient area, by easement or otherwise, for inspection and regular maintenance. 
5.  Low Impact Development (LID) Project Classifications. 
a.  All development or redevelopment to which this ordinance applies may be submitted for classification as a Low Impact Development (LID) Project. 
b.  Classification as a Low Impact Development requires that the development mimic the pre-developed hydrologic conditions of the site, as defined as "woods in good condition" for the two-year, 24-hour storm, within ten percent. The pre-developed conditions shall include: its hydrologic balance; frequency distribution of high flows; magnitude, frequency, and duration of low flows; groundwater recharge (or infiltration), and flow length and pattern. The conditions shall be measured through the comparison between measures of the pre-developed and developed conditions including: total runoff volume, time of concentration, curve number, and peak discharge. Mimicry of the pre-developed hydrologic conditions may be achieved through such techniques as the minimization of disturbed areas and the use of on-lot distributed retention storage as described in more detail on Wake County's Stormwater Web Site under Low Impact Development. 
c.  The following techniques must be used to achieve LID classification: 
i.  Natural site design in consultation with the Town; 
ii.  Site buildings, roads, and other disturbance in the least environmentally sensitive areas, pursuing steep slopes, naturally well draining soils, and other hydrologically valuable features undisturbed. 
d.  In addition, one of the following two techniques must be used to achieve LID classifications: 
i.  Bio-retention systems; 
ii.  On-site infiltration; 
e.  In additions, at least one of the following techniques must be used to achieve LID: 
i.  Retention of 50 percent of vegetated area, including open space, landscaping, or forests; 
ii.  Installation of tree-box filters for all residential street trees; 
iii.  Installation of driveway runners (in lieu of fully paved driveways) for all residential driveways; 
iv.  Installation of a Disconnected Impervious Surface (DIS) system on all residential lots (in accordance with the NCDENR Stormwater BMP manual), with all yards fully sodded: 
a.  Installation shall be confirmed prior to CO, but no easement shall be required. 
v.  Use of Permeable pavement for private driveways, private roads, or parking areas in accordance with the North Carolina Stormwater Best Management Practices Design Manual; 
vi.  Installation of one underground rain cistern per lot; 
vii.  Installation of vegetated roofs; 
viii.  Increasing all buffers in the Riparian Buffer Zone of the Flood Protection Zone, whichever is greater, by 50 feet, in accordance with Section M.1 for Low-Density Development and Ultra Low Density projects and Section M.4 for High-Density Projects; 
ix.  Use of reclaimed water for all buildings in accordance with State and local laws; 
x.  Use of innovative LID techniques subject to the approval of the Town. For residential projects, this could include such things as additional stormwater measures in common areas (such as impervious surface pavers in a clubhouse parking lot, or rain gardens incorporated into passive open space). 
f.  For Development and Redevelopment projects achieving classification as LID Projects, the Stormwater Administrator shall waive the stormwater permit fee if stipulated in the fee schedule duly adopted by the applicable governing board. 
g.  Wake County will expedite the permitting process for Development and Redevelopment projects achieving classification as an LID Project. 
6.  On-Site Wastewater: Onsite systems disposal systems shall be operated and maintained in accordance with the Regulations Governing Sewage Treatment and Disposal Systems in Wake County (Regulations) adopted by the Wake County Board of Human and Environmental Services and enforced by Wake County. Onsite systems shall be inspected, permitted, repaired and/or professionally operated in accordance with the Regulations and in a manner to prevent adverse to prevent adverse impacts on surface water and groundwater. The Town of Wendell and WCES shall collaborate on identification of areas of high risks for system failures and associated need for environmental surveys, system repairs and possible service by municipal utilities.

( Ord. No. O-2-2017, §§ 1-4, 1-9-2017 ) 
6.6 - Stream Corridor Buffers (Stream Protection) 
A.  Purpose and Intent. Stream corridor buffers protect water quality by filtering pollutants from runoff, controlling soil erosion, enhancing fish and wildlife habitat and reducing flooding. 
    The Buffer Zone shall extend 50 feet landward of all perennial and intermittent surface waters. A perennial or intermittent surface water shall be deemed present if the feature is approximately shown on either of the most recent version of the soil survey map prepared by the Natural Resources Conservation Service of the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) or the most recent version of the 1:24,000 scale (7.5 minute) quadrangle topographic maps prepared by the United States Geologic Survey (USGS). An exception to this requirement may be allowed when surface waters area not present in accordance with the provisions of 15A NCAC 2B .0233 (3)(a) or similar site-specific determination made using Division-approved methodology. The Buffer Zone shall remain undisturbed unless permitted by this section. 
    The Flood Protection Zone shall extend throughout the FEMA 100-year floodplain as identified on the current Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) published by FEMA. The Flood Protection Zone shall remain undisturbed unless otherwise permitted by this section. 
    Where the Buffer Zone and the Flood Protection Zone both are present adjacent to surface waters, the more restrictive shall apply. 
    The base distance for the Buffer Zone is calculated at 50 feet plus two feet per one percent of slope. Wetlands, slopes greater than 25 percent and impervious surfaces do not count toward the buffer width. See graphic below for an example of the application of the buffer guidelines to a hypothetical riparian landscape. 

B.  General Provisions. 
1.  Buffer areas must be clearly delineated on all site plans, including construction plans, grading and clearing plans, and erosion and sediment control plans. 
2.  Buffer boundaries must be marked on site prior to any land disturbing activities. 
3.  Buffer areas as well as all buffer requirements must be specified on the recorded plat, on individual deeds, and in property association documents. 
4.  Public infrastructure such as road crossings and utility lines are allowed where no practical alternative exists, but these activities should minimize impervious surface area and avoid large amounts of vegetation removal by crossing the buffer at a minimum 75 degree angle. 
6.7 - Flood Damage Protection Ordinance 
A.  Statutory Authorization. The Legislature of the State of North Carolina has in Part 6, Article 21 of Chapter 143; Parts 3, 5, and 8 of Article 19 of Chapter 160A; and Article 8 of Chapter 160A of the North Carolina General Statutes, delegated the responsibility to local governmental units to adopt regulations designed to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare of its citizenry. Therefore, the Board of Commissioners of the Town of Wendell, North Carolina, does ordain as follows: 
B.  Findings of Fact. 
1.  The flood prone areas within the jurisdiction of The Town of Wendell are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life, property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures of flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety, and general welfare. 
2.  Those flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions by materials such as trees, limbs, sediment, construction debris, etc. in floodplains causing increases in flood heights and velocities, and by the occupancy in flood prone areas by uses vulnerable to floods or hazardous to other lands which are inadequately elevated, flood-proofed, or otherwise unprotected from flood damages. 
C.  Statement of Purpose. It is the purpose of this section to promote public health, safety, and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions within flood prone areas and provisions designed to: 
1.  Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety, and property due to water or erosion hazards, or which result in damaging increases in erosion, flood heights or velocities; 
2.  Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction; 
3.  Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural protective barriers, which are involved in the accommodation of flood waters; 
4.  Control filling, grading, dredging, and all other development which may increase erosion or flood damage; and, 
5.  Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands. 
D.  Objectives. The objectives of this Ordinance are: 
1.  To protect human life and health; 
2.  To minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects; 
3.  To minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public; 
4.  To minimize prolonged business losses and interruptions; 
5.  To minimize damage to public facilities and utilities (i.e., water and gas mains, electric, telephone, cable and sewer lines, streets, and bridges) that are located in flood prone areas; 
6.  To help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of flood prone areas in such a manner as to minimize flood blight areas; and, 
7.  To ensure that potential homebuyers are notified that property is in a Special Flood Hazard Area.

a.  Any correction of existing violations of State or Community health, sanitary, or safety code specifications which have been identified by the community code enforcement official and which are the minimum necessary to assure safe living conditions; or, 
b.  Any alteration of a historic structure, provided that the alteration will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a historic structure. 
    Variance is a grant of relief from the requirements of this ordinance. 
    Violation means the failure of a structure or other development to be fully compliant with the community's floodplain management regulations. A structure or other development without the elevation certificate, other certifications, or other evidence of compliance required in Sections J and G is presumed to be in violation until such time as that documentation is provided. 
    Water Surface Elevation (WSE) means the height, in relation to mean sea level, of floods of various magnitudes and frequencies in the floodplains of coastal or ravine areas. 
    Watercourse means a lake, river, creek, stream, wash, channel or other topographic feature on or over which waters flow at least periodically. Watercourse includes specifically designated areas in which substantial flood damage may occur.

2.  Specific Standards. In all Special Flood Hazard Areas where Base Flood Elevation (BFE) data has been provided and in Future Conditions Flood Hazard Areas where Future Conditions Flood Elevations data has been provided, as set forth in Section F.2, or Section J.3.k and l, the following provisions, in addition to those provisions in Section 6.7.G.1, are required: 
a.  Elevated Buildings. Fully enclosed area, of new construction and substantially improved structures, which is below the lowest floor: 
i.  Shall not be designed or used for human habitation, but shall only be used for parking of vehicles, building access, or limited storage of maintenance equipment used in connection with the premises. Access to the enclosed area shall be the minimum necessary to allow for parking of vehicles (garage door) or limited storage of maintenance equipment (standard exterior door). The interior portion of such enclosed area shall not be finished or partitioned into separate rooms, except to enclose storage areas; 
ii.  Shall be constructed entirely of flood resistant materials below the regulatory flood protection elevation; 
iii.  Shall include, in Zones A, AE and X (Future), flood openings to automatically equalize hydrostatic flood forces on walls by allowing for the entry and exit of floodwaters. To meet this requirement, the openings must either be certified by a professional engineer or architect or meet or exceed the following minimum design criteria; 
(a)  A minimum of two flood openings on different sides of each enclosed area subject to flooding; 
(b)  The total net area of all flood openings must be at least 1 square inch for each square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding; 
(c)  If a building has more than one enclosed area, each enclosed area must have flood openings to allow floodwaters to automatically enter and exit; 
(d)  The bottom of all required flood openings shall be no higher than one foot above the adjacent grade; 
(e)  Flood openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, or other coverings or devices, provided they permit the automatic flow of floodwaters in both directions; and 
(f)  Enclosures made of flexible skirting are not considered enclosures for regulatory purposes, and, therefore, do not require flood openings. Masonry or wood underpinning, regardless of structural status, is considered an enclosure and requires flood openings as outlined above. 
b.  Additions/Improvements: 
i.  Additions and/or improvements to pre-FIRM structures when the addition and/or improvements in combination with any interior modifications to the existing structure are: 
(a)  Not a substantial improvement, shall be designed to minimize flood damages and must not be any more non-conforming than the existing structure. 
(b)  No substantial improvements are permitted within the flood hazard area. 
ii.  Additions to post-FIRM structures with no modifications to the existing structure other than a standard door in the common wall shall require only the addition to comply with the standards for new construction. 
iii.  Additions and/or improvements to post-FIRM structures when the addition and/or improvements in combination with any interior modifications to the existing structure are: 
(a)  Not a substantial improvement, the addition and/or improvements only must comply with the standards for new construction. 
(b)  A substantial improvement, both the existing structure and the addition and/or improvements must comply with the standards for new construction. 
iv.  Where an independent perimeter load-bearing wall is provided between the addition and the existing building, the addition(s) shall be considered a separate building and only the addition must comply with the standards for new construction. 
c.  Recreational Vehicles: Recreation vehicles placed on sites within a Special Flood Hazard Area shall either: 
i.  Be on site for fewer than 180 consecutive days and be fully licensed and ready for highway use (a recreational vehicle is ready for highway use if it is on its wheels or jacking system, is attached to the site only by quick disconnect type utilities and has no permanently attached additions); or, 
H.  Standards for Floodplains without Established Base Flood Elevations. Within the Special Flood Hazard Areas designated as Approximate Zone A and established Section F.2, where no Base Flood Elevation (BFE) data has been provided by FEMA, the following provisions, in addition to Sections G.1 and G.2, shall apply: 
1.  No encroachments, including fill, new development, or substantial improvements shall be permitted within a distance of 50 feet each side from top of bank or five times the width of the stream on each side whichever is greater, unless certification with supporting technical data by a registered professional engineer is provided demonstrating that such encroachments shall not result in any increase in flood levels during the occurrence of the base flood discharge. 
2.  The BFE used in determining the regulatory flood protection elevation shall be determined based on one of the following criteria set in priority order: 
a.  If Base Flood Elevation (BFE) data is available from other sources, all new construction and substantial improvements within such areas shall also comply with all applicable provisions of this ordinance and shall be elevated or floodproofed in accordance with standards in Sections J.3.k and l. 
b.  All subdivision, manufactured home park and other development proposals shall provide Base Flood Elevation (BFE) data if development is greater than five acres or has more than 50 lots/manufactured home sites. Such Base Flood Elevation (BFE) data shall be adopted by reference per Section F.2 to be utilized in implementing this ordinance. 
c.  When Base Flood Elevation (BFE) data is not available from a Federal, State, or other source as outlined above, the reference level shall be elevated to or above the regulatory flood protection elevation, as defined in Section F.2. 
I.  Floodways and Non-Encroachment Areas. Areas designated as floodways or non-encroachment areas are located within the Special Flood Hazard Areas established in Section F.2. The floodways and non-encroachment areas are extremely hazardous areas due to the velocity of floodwaters that have erosion potential and carry debris and potential projectiles. The following provisions, in addition to standards outlined in Sections G.1 and G.2, shall apply to all development within such areas: 
1.  No encroachments, including fill, new construction, substantial improvements and other developments in accordance with G.1.a. shall be permitted unless it has been demonstrated that: 
a.  The proposed encroachment would not result in any increase in the flood levels during the occurrence of the base flood, based on hydrologic and hydraulic analyses performed in accordance with standard engineering practice and presented to the Administrator prior to issuance of floodplain development permit, or 
b.  A Conditional Letter of Map Revision (CLOMR) has been approved by FEMA. A Letter of Map Revision (LOMR) must also be obtained upon completion of the proposed encroachment. 
2.  If Section I.1 is satisfied, all development shall comply with all applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of this ordinance. 
3.  No new or additional manufactured homes shall be permitted, except replacement manufactured homes in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision, provided the following provisions are met: 
a.  The anchoring and the elevation standards of Section G.2.c; and 
b.  The no encroachment standard of Section I.1.

Chapter 7 - OPEN SPACE 

7.1 - Purpose and Intent 
    This chapter is guided by and intends to fulfill Principle 7 of the Town Plan of Wendell , which calls for an "increase in community amenities, such as parks. . ." Additionally, the purpose of this Chapter is to permanently set aside and save for public use and enjoyment undeveloped or predominately undeveloped land which has value for one or more of the following purposes: (1) park and recreational purposes, (2) conservation of land and other natural resources, or (3) historic or scenic purposes. 
7.2 - Applicability 
A.  All residential development classified as major subdivisions shall be required to dedicate open space. Developers may, as an alternative and with proper justification, elect to pay a fee in lieu of land dedication with approval of the Board of Commissioners. 
B.  Exemptions: Developments in OSC and RA districts are required to conserve open space by their base district standards (see Chapter 2). These districts are therefore exempt from the dedication requirements of this Chapter. 
7.3 - General Provisions and Standards 
    All land dedicated for open space shall substantially meet the criteria below: 
A.  Land eligible for possible open space dedication and/or credit include areas not covered by residential and commercial building lots or parking lots, dry detention structures, planting yards, streets, or required setbacks and meets the requirements of this section and section 7.4, Open Space Types. 
B.  Accessibility. 
1.  Open space shall be conveniently accessible to all residents of the development, and/or the public and shall have at least 60 feet of frontage or 25 percent of its perimeter on at least one public street within the development. 
2.  All residential units within a major subdivision of the town shall be within close proximity of open space. 
3.  With the approval of the Administrator, open space land may be cleared of underbrush and debris and may contain one or more of the following enhancements: landscaping, walls, fences, walks, statues, boardwalks, wildlife viewing sites, educational and informational signs and exhibits, utilities, irrigation, fountains, ball fields, playground equipment, historic sites and structures, and other appropriate structures. 
C.  Location. 
1.  Open space land shall be located so as to at least serve the needs of the residents of the neighborhood and/or the residents of the immediate area within which the development is located. 
2.  Open space land should provide focal points for developments and the Town. 
3.  Enhancements should be located toward the interior of the open space land to provide for adequate safety of users. 
4.  Areas described in the Zebulon & Wendell Open Space & Greenway Master Plan or any other adopted open space land or greenways plan shall be preserved and dedicated where practical and feasible. 
D.  Usability. 
1.  At least one-half of the total open space land dedicated shall be located outside areas of special flood hazard, including the 100-year floodplain. Within the area proposed for dedication, sufficient engineering data and/or detail shall be indicated to insure compliance with this section. 
2.  Dedicated areas including road/street rights-of-way, easements or areas for public utility transmission lines shall not receive credit in the computation for the amount of open space land required. 
E.  Topography. The Administrator shall have the right to disqualify lands proposed for open space where topography makes them unsuitable for their intended open space use. 
F.  Shape. The shape of land for active recreation shall be suitable for, but not limited to, playground, courts, or playfields. The shape of land for passive recreation shall be sufficient to encompass the walking or jogging path, natural or cultural resource or other proposed area. 
G.  Plan Compatibility. For developments which abut or include areas designated on the Open Space & Greenway Master Plan , the Town may require that the open space be located in accordance with the proposed site or portion of an existing site as shown thereon. For developments that abut or include areas designated as future greenways on the Open Space & Greenway Master Plan , the Board of Commissioners shall require a 20-foot minimum width public pedestrian and non-motorized vehicle easement be dedicated along all such areas in all or part of the open space land required under this Chapter. 
H.  Dedication Procedure. Open space land shall be separately deeded to either a homeowner's association, a non-profit land trust or conservancy, Wake County, to the Town of Wendell (upon approval by the Board of Commissioners), or may be held in private ownership with conservation easements recorded in the Wake County Register of Deeds in a form approved by the Town. A metes and bounds description of the space to be preserved and limits on its use shall be recorded on the development plan, in homeowner covenants, and on individual deeds when open space lands are not held entirely in common. Alternative means of permanent open space preservation may include acceptance by a land conservation trust or a unit of government. Private management alternatives will also be permitted. It is the intent of this chapter that all dedicated lands remain perpetually as open space lands. 
I.  Design and Development Plans. The Administrator shall review all open space lands design and development plans for consistency with the intent of this chapter. When such land design and plans are determined appropriate by the administrator, the Administrator may approve them. 
7.4 - Open Space Types 
    Open Space land shall be classified in accordance with this Chapter. Open space, not classified under these types, shall not be counted toward the dedication requirement of this Ordinance. 
A.  Types. 
1.  Passive Open Space (Unimproved): Up to 75 percent of the park, recreation, and open space lands shall be provided for passive recreation purposes such as walking, jogging, relaxation, etc. Preservation of cultural or natural resources such as steep slopes, rock outcroppings, mature woodlands or water resources may also be counted towards passive recreation provided there is access for public enjoyment and appreciation of such resources. 
2.  Park Space (Improved): At least 25 percent of the park, recreation, and open space land shall be provided as improved Park Space. Improved Park Space must be primarily grassed and properly maintained, and contain the minimum amenities described below. Additionally, one-third of the required Park Space must be completely designed for active recreation purposes such as playgrounds, tennis courts, ball fields, volleyball courts, etc. Constructed multi-use paths (paved; min. ten ft. wide) within greenway easements required by the Open Space and Greenway Master Plan, or which could reasonably connect to a planned greenway shown in an adopted plan, while passive in nature, shall be credited as active recreational open space for the area of the public greenway easement. Indoor recreational facilities, including but not limited to indoor pools and fitness centers, as well as permitted rooftop amenities may also count towards open space requirements. 
a.  Minimum Amenities for Park Space. 
i.  Public Seating: Provide seating areas appropriate to the intended use of the space (e.g., park benches and durable theft/vandalism-resistant chairs in formal/active spaces and garden wall seats in informal spaces). Seating must be provided at a minimum rate of 1 seating area per 10,000 square feet. 
ii.  Supplemental Tree Planting/Significant Species Preservation: A minimum of one tree (two-inch caliper minimum measured six inches above the ground at installation) or one preserved existing canopy tree a minimum of 12 inches caliper for every 2,500 square feet of required park space. 
iii.  Trash Receptacle: Garbage receptacles and recycling receptacles shall be required for each park space at a minimum rate of one per 20,000 square feet of space. Receptacles shall use a metal, decorative design and shall be placed in close proximity to gathering spaces. The administrator may waive the requirement for receptacles for park spaces less than 10,000 square feet, where no more than two public seating areas are provided. 
iv.  Bicycle Parking: At least two bicycle parking spaces shall be required for every one-quarter acre of park space (minimum 1/4 acre). 
v.  Paved Walkways: All park spaces shall incorporate hard-surface (non-gravel) walkways into the overall design. 
b.  Active Recreation Example. 
i.  Based on the Town's dedication requirements (Section 7.5), a 100-lot subdivision would be required to dedicate a total of 4 acres of open space. Up to 75 percent (three acres) of the open space could remain Passive (unimproved). A minimum of one acre must be Park Space (improved). Of that one acre, one-third of the land (14,375 square feet) shall be fully occupied by an active recreational use, such as a playground, tennis court (7,200 sq. ft. for single), basketball court (3,108 sq. ft.), swimming pool, ballfield, etc. 
B.  Common Area Open Space. Common, open space lands are designed to serve the residents of the immediate block or neighborhood. Ownership and maintenance of such common areas shall be in fee simple title to a homeowners association or similar organization. 
C.  Public Open Space. Public Open Space lands shall be dedicated to the Town of Wendell, Wake County, or a non-profit conservancy organization for ownership and maintenance. Public open space shall be open to the public. Hours of access may be restricted in accordance with health and safety guidelines. Open space lands dedicated to the Town of Wendell shall be in accordance with an Open Space Land Master Plan or other adopted plan and approved by the Board of Commissioners for ownership and maintenance.

( Ord. No. O-31-2017 , §§ 2, 3, 10-9-2017) 
7.6 - Payment in Lieu of Open Space Dedication 
A.  Any person developing and/or subdividing property subject to this Chapter, upon approval of the Board of Commissioners, may make a payment in lieu of any required dedication of open space land. 
B.  Value Determination. 
1.  For all multi-family developments (excluding townhomes), payment in lieu of dedication shall be established by the adopted Town of Wendell fee schedule. Payment in lieu of dedication for single family detached and townhome developments shall be the product of the average post-development appraised value per acre of the land within the development multiplied by the number of acres required to be dedicated: as shown in the following formula and as described in section 2 and section 3 below: 
2.  Average Post Development Appraised Per Acre Value of Entire Development 
x (Required Open Space Dedication) 
= Payment in Lieu Dedication Fee 
3.  The average Post Development Appraised Value per acre of the Entire Development shall be established by an appraiser at the applicant's expense. The appraiser shall be a member in good standing of the American Institute of Real Estate Appraisers. 
4.  Any disagreement in the amount of required payment shall be resolved by conducting a second professional appraisal of the fair market value of the property. Another professional appraiser shall be mutually agreed upon by the developer and Town. This appraiser shall be appointed by the Town, at the developer's expense, should an initial agreement not be reached. 
C.  The Board of Commissioners may, at its discretion, accept either an equitable amount of land in another location or a fee paid to the Town in lieu of dedication. A combination of open space land dedication and payments-in-lieu of dedication may be permitted. 
D.  All open space land dedication payments made in lieu of dedication shall be made at the time of Preliminary Plat approval. Failure to make such dedication and/or submit the required fee along with such applications will delay approval of such submissions until payment is rendered. All funds received for payment in lieu of dedication shall be deposited in a special fund or line item to be used only for the acquisition, development, management and/or redevelopment of public open space by the Town. 
E.  Reasons for payments in lieu of dedication may include, but are not limited to, proximity to existing public parks and/or existing topographic or geographic conditions. 
( Ord. No. O-31-2017 , § 4, 10-9-2017) 
Chapter 8 - TREE PROTECTION AND LANDSCAPING 

8.1 - Purpose and Intent 
    The appropriate use of existing and supplemental landscaping enhances the aesthetic appearance of new development and blends new development with the natural landscape. The conservation of native evergreen and deciduous plant materials blends the built environment with new construction while maintaining the aesthetic character of the Town. This Chapter is intended to establish minimum standards for the protection of existing trees and design of landscapes to enhance Wendell's visual and environmental character by: 
A.  Encouraging the conservation of existing trees and vegetation, which contribute to preservation of wildlife habitat; promotion of natural diversity; air quality; groundwater recharge; energy conservation; and reduced stormwater runoff. 
B.  Separating incompatible land uses in order to minimize potential nuisances such as the transmission of noise, dust, odor, litter, and glare of lights; 
C.  Enhancing property values and establishing a sense of privacy. 
D.  Preserving and protecting the identity and character of Wendell and enhancing the business economy. 
E.  Encouraging cooperation with Wake County Capital Tree Program to preserve and protect trees recognized by the program. 
8.2 - Applicability 
A.  After the adoption date of this ordinance, these requirements shall apply to: 
1.  New Development: New residential, commercial, industrial, institutional, or mixed-use buildings, developments, or subdivisions; 
2.  Building Expansion: Any existing principal structure which is expanded by 25 percent or more. The landscaping improvements are required for the expanded portion of existing development only. 
3.  Parking Lot Expansion: Any existing parking lot (paved or unpaved) expanded or improved to add 12 or more spaces. If a parking lot is expanded, then buffers and parking lot landscaping requirements shall be applicable. 
4.  Change of Use: If the zoning district classification changes for an existing use then the parcel shall comply with the landscaping requirements of this Chapter or, at a minimum, the intent of this Chapter as prescribed by the Administrator. The owner or developer may need to install additional plant material on the parcel in order to meet the intent of this Chapter, especially on developed sites, or to bring the parcel up to the standards for the type of buffer landscaping which would be required under this Chapter. 
B.  Where the requirements of this Chapter and a zoning district's dimensional requirements differ, the more restrictive requirement will apply. 
8.3 - General Provisions 
A.  Existing Vegetation, Fences, Walls, and Berms: Existing trees or shrubs will be conserved to satisfy the landscaping requirements of this Chapter. Significant existing vegetation within landscaped areas shall be preserved and credited toward required landscaping. Existing berms, walls, or fences within the landscaped area, but not including chain link fencing, may be used to fulfill the standards for the type of landscaping required, provided that these elements are in good condition. 
B.  Protection of Vegetation During Design: The Town expects new development, through the protection of trees and existing vegetation, to be creative in design and placement of buildings, structures, parking and other impervious surfaces as to preserve natural features and to complement the existing topography. 
C.  Installation of New Vegetation and Other Features: New plant material should complement existing vegetation. If existing significant vegetation and other site features do not fully meet the standards for the type of landscaping required, then additional vegetation and/or site features (including fences) shall be planted or installed within the required landscaping area. 
D.  Grading and Development in Required Landscape Areas: The required landscaping shall not contain any development, impervious surfaces, or site features that do not function to meet these standards or that require removal of existing significant vegetation. No grading, development, or land-disturbing activities shall occur within required landscaped areas if forest canopy, specimen trees, or significant vegetation exists within the buffer yard, unless approved by the Administrator. If grading within a planting yard is proposed, slopes of 3:1 or less are encouraged to ensure the proper transition of grades to the adjacent property and to facilitate landscaping and maintenance. 
E.  Easements & Rights-of-Way: Nothing shall be planted or installed within an underground or overhead utility easement or a drainage easement without the consent of the Administrator and the easement holder at the time of site plan approval. 
F.  Building Setbacks: Required building setbacks (as listed in Chapter 5) shall supersede Buffer or Street Yard requirements. 
G.  Protection during Surveying: No tree greater than 12 inches in diameter at breast height (DBH) located on public property or within a required tree protection area shall be removed for the purpose of surveying without an approval from the Administrator. 
H.  Tree Trimming: Every owner of any tree overhanging any street or right-of-way within the Town shall prune the branches so that such branches shall not obstruct the view of any street intersection and so that there shall be a clear space of eight feet above the surface of the street or sidewalk. Said owners shall remove all dead, diseased or dangerous trees, or broken or decayed limbs which constitute a menace to the safety of the public in accordance with the standards specified in section 'M' below. The Town is authorized to remove and/or trim trees and shrubs from public properties and public rights-of-way. The North Carolina Department of Transportation is authorized to remove and or trim trees and shrubs in the public rights-of-way owned by the State of North Carolina. Approval from the Administrator is required to trim a tree in a tree save area, required landscaping area, or buffer yard more than 25 percent of its overall canopy. 
I.  Removal by Utility Companies: Trees to be removed from the public right-of-way by electric utilities and other overhead utilities must be replaced by such entity in equal quantity and minimum caliper size with an approved species. 
J.  Tree Topping/Shearing: Tree topping and/or shearing shall be prohibited on all trees on public property, designated rights-of-way, required tree save areas, landscaping, and buffer yards unless otherwise approved by the Tree Board. Trees severely damaged by storms or other causes, or certain trees under utility lines or other obstructions where other pruning practices are impractical may be exempted from this Chapter at the determination of the Administrator. 
K.  Tree Replacement: Should any tree designated in a tree save area, required landscaping area, planting strip or planting yard die within two years of issuance of the certificate of occupancy, the owner of the property/developer shall replace it within 180 calendar days. See Section 8.12 for more information. 
L.  Removal of Dead Trees on Public Property: Approval by the Tree Board shall be required for removal of trees that are dead, infected by disease, or determined to be a hazard to public safety and welfare. 
M.  Tree Removal on Private Property: The Town shall have the right to cause or approve the removal of any dead or diseased trees or tree parts on private property when such trees constitute a hazard to life and property, or harbor insects or disease which constitutes a potential threat to other trees in the Town. The Administrator or their designee will notify in writing the owner(s) of such trees or tree parts. Removal shall be done at the owner(s) expense within 90 calendar days after the date of service of notice. In the event of failure of the owner(s) to comply with such provisions, the Town shall have the authority to remove such trees and charge the cost of removal to the owner. 
N.  Stumps: All stumps of trees shall be removed or shall be ground up within 90 calendar days of tree removal. This applies to both public and private property. 
O.  Alternate Methods of Compliance: 
1.  Alternate landscape plans, plant materials, or methods may be used in situations where strict adherence to the provisions of this Chapter would result in impractical or unreasonable situations. Such situations may result from severe topography, natural rock formations, and utility easements, lot configurations, or other physical conditions. The Administrator must approve alternate methods of compliance. 
2.  Alternate landscape plans shall be reviewed based on their effectiveness and performance in meeting the spirit and intent of this ordinance. The Administrator shall review the alternate plan taking into account adjacent land uses, amount of plantings, species arrangement, and coverage. 
8.4 - Landscape Plan 
A.  Applicability: 
1.  A landscape plan, to include tree preservation, shall be required prior to any land disturbance for any proposed development plan. (Predevelopment site grading, or any land disturbing activity of one acre or more that is not regulated by a previously approved site plan, shall be governed by the provisions of Chapter 6, Environmental Protection.) The plan shall contain the information detailed in Section 16.8, Landscape Plan Requirements. 
2.  Minor changes or additions to existing development or approved plans may be submitted via an abbreviated site plan. An abbreviated site plan shall be allowed when a proposed change is physically limited to only a portion of the site. An abbreviated site plan shall include, but not be limited to, items listed in Section 16.10. The Administrator shall determine when an abbreviated site plan may be submitted for a detailed site plan and what items shall be included. 
B.  Revisions to Approved Landscape Plans: Due to lack of plant availability, approved landscape plans may require minor revisions. Minor revisions to landscape plans may be approved by the Administrator if: 
1.  There is no reduction in the quantity of plant material. 
2.  There is no significant change in size or location of plant materials. 
3.  The new plants are of the same general category (i.e., canopy trees, understory trees, shrubs, groundcover) and have the same general design characteristics (mature height, crown spread) as the materials being replaced. 
( Ord. No. O-4-2017, § 5, 1-9-2017 ) 
8.5 - Tree Protection 
A.  Protection and Preservation 
1.  General Provisions 
a.  Wooded sites offer the distinct advantages of providing shade and aesthetically pleasing views. Vegetation on sloping sites plays a critical role in maintaining aesthetic quality, water quality, and in minimizing erosion and downstream flooding. Selective retention of significant vegetation should occur, particularly in areas or portions of a site that are located within a fragile ecological setting. 
b.  Significant forest stands, natural vegetation, specimen trees, severe natural topography, drainage features and water courses should be preserved to the extent that is reasonable and practical while otherwise not reasonably prohibiting development. Forested and vegetated areas whose physical site conditions render them unsuitable for development should be set aside as conservation areas or as open space. Isolated pockets of existing trees, specimen trees, Heritage Trees, and trees recognized under the Capital Trees Program should be protected as a valuable asset of the property where practical. 
c.  Planting Season: The planting season for trees shall be September 1 through May 31 unless otherwise permitted by the Administrator. 
2.  Preservation of Existing Trees 

a.  Required Tree Save Areas: Trees and existing vegetation shall be preserved in accordance with the table above. Exceptions shall be approved by the Administrator, who shall work jointly with the developer and design team during the project approval process. Surveyors should use a GPS device to flag trees for preservation or further study. 
b.  Existing Trees: Notwithstanding the requirements in the table above, canopy trees at least 12 inches DBH and all understory trees greater than four inches DBH anywhere on the site shall be preserved to the greatest extent practical and incorporated into the required landscaping. 
c.  All plans to remove trees greater than 12 inches DBH for Parks & Recreational Open Space uses shall be approved by the Board of Commissioners. 
d.  Tree Protection Plan: 
i.  A tree protection plan, showing there will be no disturbance in the Critical Root Zone (CRZ) shall be submitted prior to grading. Trenching, placing backfill, driving, or parking equipment in the CRZ, and the dumping of materials detrimental to plant health in close proximity of the trees to be preserved is prohibited. 
ii.  Where existing trees are to be preserved in a buffer zone, limits of grading shall maintain a minimum 20-foot separation from the base of each tree or to the dripline. 
e.  When selecting which trees to preserve, the following shall be considered: 
i.  Age, condition, and type of tree, not limited solely to species, but to include: uniqueness, historical significance, placement, etc. 
ii.  Existing and proposed grading; 
iii.  Location of site improvements and utility connections. 
f.  Landscape Credits for Tree Preservation: Preserved trees shall be credited toward the satisfaction of the minimum landscape planting requirements based on the following details: 
i.  Minimum size requirement to qualify for tree preservation credit is four inches in diameter at breast height (DBH). 
ii.  Landscape credits for existing trees in parking areas and buffer or street yards shall be given at a rate of one tree per four inches of DBH of existing tree preserved. 
iii.  Credits for tree preservation are only offered when a tree preservation plan is submitted prior to grading the site. 
iv.  These credits shall only be given if the trees preserved are located in or within 15 feet of the specific area (street/buffer planting areas and parking area). For example: The trees preserved in the street planting area shall be given credit for the street planting requirements only. Credit for trees preserved in the parking area shall apply only to the parking requirements, etc. 
g.  Replacement of Preserved Trees: Should any tree designated for preservation in the tree protection plan die within two years of issuance of the certificate of occupancy, the owner of the property/developer shall replace it within 180 calendar days with landscaping equal to what would be required in this Chapter. 
8.6 - Buffers and Screening 
A.  Required Buffer Yards: 
1.  Buffer yards are planting areas located parallel to the side and rear lot lines designed to separate incompatible adjacent uses and provide privacy and protection against potential adverse impacts of an adjoining incompatible use or zoning district. 
2.  The size of a buffer shall be determined both by the zoning district of the proposed development and by the adjacent zoning district(s). Buffer yards shall be required in accordance with the table below when any use is being established on a property that abuts an existing developed lot or less intense zoning district. 
a.  Notwithstanding the following chart, where a more intense proposed use abuts an existing single family residential use within any zoning category, a Type B buffer yard shall be required. This provision shall not negate the requirement for Type A buffer yards to be installed where required by this section. 

3.  Buffer yards are intended to be constructed along the perimeter of the property; however, when there is irregular topographic conditions such as the perimeter of the property is at a lower grade than the use being screened, the Administrator may require the relocation of the required buffer yard in order to better serve its purpose. 
4.  Where a proposed use or development type abuts multiple use types or zoning districts along the same side or rear year, the largest buffer will apply. 
5.  Buffers shall not be located on any portion of any existing or proposed street right-of-way. Buffers shall be permitted to intersect utility easements or run parallel with them; however, they shall not be permitted to run linear with and be superimposed on them. 
B.  Buffer Yard Types 


C.  Additional Buffer Requirements 
1.  Fences and Walls: A six-foot tall privacy fence or wall made of treated and stained wood, brick, stone, or other composite material as approved by the Administrator and maintained in a like-new manner, may be used to reduce the required buffer width by 25 percent. (This reduction shall not apply to Buffer Yard Type A, Option B.) 
2.  Berms: All berms, if provided, shall not exceed a slope with maximum rise of one foot to a run of two feet (a ratio of 1:2) and a maximum height of four feet. All berms, regardless of size, shall be stabilized with a ground cover or other suitable vegetation or permanent slope retention device. Berms taller than four feet shall be approved by the Administrator on a case by case basis. 
3.  Existing Vegetation: Existing vegetation within the buffer yard which meets or exceeds the standards of this section shall be maintained and may receive partial or total credit toward screening requirements. 
8.7 - Subdivision Plantings 
A.  Applicability: Residential uses with front setbacks of five feet or more in a residential or mixed-use subdivision that includes more than five dwelling units. Foundation planting requirements shall apply to all residential development. 
B.  Required Planting: 
1.  A front yard planting shall be required for single family dwellings with setbacks of 15 feet or more. Front yard plantings shall be located within the front yard of the property boundary and do not remove the requirement for street tree plantings within the right-of-way. The developer may choose a tree from the Acceptable Plant Material List (Appendix A). The type of front yard planting required shall vary according to the lot width as follows: 
a.  0-49 feet: one understory or ornamental tree required 
b.  50-99 feet: one canopy tree required 
c.  100+ feet: one canopy tree required per 50 feet of lot width 
2.  Required street trees (see Section 8.8) and/or existing trees over four inches DBH may be counted toward fulfillment of the front yard planting requirement above. 
3.  Where there are abutting rear yards, one tree and one shrub shall be planted on each lot for every 15 feet of rear property line. Existing vegetation may be used towards satisfying this requirement. 
4.  Planted areas around cable boxes and HVAC units shall be provided with a minimum of four three-gallon evergreen shrubs, unless some other opaque screening is provided, planted five feet on center surrounding the box/unit. Shrubs shall have a minimum planted height of 18 inches (1.5 ft.). 
5.  Foundation plantings are required at a rate of one shrub per five linear feet of dwelling frontage. Multi-family uses shall install foundation plantings along the foundation of all street facing sides, whether public or private, with the exception of rear alleys. 
8.8 - Street Tree Plantings 
    Trees shall be planted in the right-of-way in planting strips or in tree wells, as indicated in the following table. Spacing of trees should allow for a clear view of buildings and land uses.

A.  Applicability: 
1.  Street trees shall be planted in the right-of-way, between the street and the sidewalk, in all zoning districts except in OSC, RA districts, where no street trees are required. This requirement shall apply to newly constructed streets and as feasible on existing or reconstructed streets, as determined by the TRC. 
2.  Where sidewalk is only required on one side of the street, street trees shall be planted at the same intervals and the same distance from the curb on both sides of the street. 
3.  Where specific cross-sections or streetscape plans have been developed as part of an adopted corridor or small area plan, the required plantings shall adhere to said plan. 
B.  Planting strips shall have a minimum width of seven feet for canopy and understory trees. See Appendix F for an approved street tree list, which includes spacing and planting strip width requirements. Planting strips are permitted and encouraged to be designed as bio-swales (rain gardens) to substitute for conventional piped storm drainage. 
C.  In mixed-use districts along street frontages that contain ground floor retail uses and on-street parking, or where specified on an adopted area plan, trees shall be planted in tree wells. Tree wells shall provide an adequate root aeration zone around the base of a tree. Tree grates or ground cover shall cover the exposed area of soil and protect this zone. The wells shall be a minimum of five feet square. 
D.  Planting strips shall not be required in alleys. 
E.  Street trees shall be planted as canopy trees and installed at an average distance of 40 feet on-center. Where overhead utilities exist prior to development, understory trees may be substituted, installed at an average distance of 25 feet on-center. 
F.  Street trees shall be placed at least eight feet from light poles and ten feet from electrical transformers in order to allow these utilities to be safely serviced. 
G.  Along State-maintained roads, plantings shall comply with NCDOT standards. 
H.  Where conflicts exist which prevent required street trees from being installed within the road right-of-way, the required plantings shall be installed on private property parallel to the road as a Street Yard instead. 
I.  Street tree species should be consistent within a given block, as determined by the administrator. Appendix F includes approved street tree species. 
8.9 - Street Yards 
    A Street Yard consists of a planting area parallel to a public right-of-way but on private property, typically between the sidewalk and new development. It is designed to provide continuity of vegetation along the right-of-way and to soften the impact of development by providing a pleasing view from the road. 
A.  Applicability: 
1.  Any use with a rear yard that abuts a street right-of-way. 
2.  All non-residential uses in CH districts with front setbacks greater than 20 feet. 
3.  All uses in MH, MHO, and M&I districts 
B.  Minimum Width: Street Yards shall be a minimum of ten feet wide. 
C.  Required Landscaping: 
1.  Commercial and Industrial Uses: Two canopy trees or four understory trees, and eight shrubs (five to seven gallon) per 100 linear feet or a combination thereof to include a minimum of 50 percent evergreens. 
2.  Multi-Family Uses: Two canopy trees per 100 linear feet of frontage. Foundation plantings shall be provided for multi-family uses at a rate of one shrub per five linear feet of dwelling frontage. 
D.  Landscape Credits: Landscape credits for existing trees within Street Yards will be given at the rate of one shade tree per each existing tree four inches in DBH or greater. 
E.  Tree Spacing: These trees shall be evenly distributed along the street frontage, but they are not required to be at absolute equal intervals. This will allow for some flexibility in design while discouraging long intervals without trees. 
F.  No more than 20 percent of the Street Yard may be used for walkways or signs. 
G.  Parking, merchandise display and off-street loading are prohibited in the Street Yard. 
H.  All trees in Street Yards shall be planted no closer than four feet from any public right-of-way. 
8.10 - Parking Lot Screening 
A.  Applicability: Perimeter yard of all parking areas visible from the street (except single-family homes). 
B.  Minimum Planting: Semi-Opaque Screen from the ground to at least a height of 3.5 feet for screening of car lights and glare (minimum width: ten feet). 

Screen parking lots from the street with landscaping or a solid decorative wall or fence or combination thereof. 
C.  Performance Standard: This type of screening functions as a semi-opaque screen around the perimeter of a parking lot from the ground to at least 3.5 feet for the screening of car lights and glare. This shall only be required along the parking area that fronts the public right-of-way or any side of a parking lot that is not protected by a Type C buffer yard. The location of such yards shall be determined by the Administrator upon review. Effective screening devices may include solid decorative brick walls, wood fences, earth berms, and tight evergreen hedges which shall reach the required height within two years of planting, or any combination of the above. Groundcover, exclusively, shall be planted in the sight triangle on each side of drives or streets. A six-foot opening shall be allowed every 150 feet to permit pedestrian passage where a formal connection to a sidewalk or pathway is provided. 
D.  Screening of Open Storage, Above Ground Utilities, and Dumpsters: Any open storage of merchandise, equipment, materials or goods (other than those on display for retail sales), above ground utilities, loading areas, and dumpsters areas shall be screened from view from any street right-of-way. These areas shall include adjacent planting islands and shall be landscaped with an evergreen screen and fully enclosed in a fence or wall of at least six feet in height (see also Section 4.3, Containment Areas for Trash and Recyclables). 

Enclose dumpsters and storage areas with plantings and walls or fences
8.11 - Parking Lot Landscaping 
A.  Intent: Planting areas within and adjacent to parking areas designed to provide shade and improve the attractiveness of a large area of pavement. 
B.  Applicability: Interiors of all parking areas with more than 12 spaces. 
C.  Minimum Plantings: 
1.  Trees: One canopy tree per 12 parking spaces. 
2.  Shrubs: Four per 12 parking spaces. 
3.  Plantings shall be in a planting area within the parking lot measuring at least 300 square feet and protected by curbs or wheel stops. Planting areas may have no bare soil. 
4.  For parking lots of 24 spaces or less, trees and shrubs may be planted at the end of parking rows or in planting strips as defined above. 
D.  Performance Standards: Parking lot landscaping functions as a tree ceiling over a parking area providing shelter from sun and rain and minimizing the impact of runoff by providing "green" surface area on which to collect. 
1.  Canopy trees shall be planted in a manner that provides shade for the entire parking area at maturity. No parking space shall be more than 60 feet from the base of a canopy tree (parking lots using bioretention areas, as outlined in the section below, are exempt from this requirement). The use of existing vegetation to satisfy this requirement is encouraged. 
2.  Landscape credits for existing trees in parking areas shall be given at a rate of one tree per each four inches DBH of existing plant preserved. 
E.  Curbing/Bioretention Options: 
1.  All parking areas and landscaped islands shall either be curbed using a vertical curb or wheel stops. Curbing may be discontinuous or perforated allowing stormwater to enter landscaped areas constructed for bioretention. Where bioretention areas are constructed, wheel stops may be used in place of curbing. Where landscaping is above grade, curbing must be continuous to prevent landscaping material from eroding into the parking area. 
2.  Bioretention Areas: Required parking lot landscaping may be substituted with one or more consolidated bioretention areas. Bioretention areas shall be located where it is most practical to capture stormwater, manage parking lot traffic and facilitate pedestrian use, including adjacent to and connecting with vegetated areas on the perimeter of a parking lot. Bioretention areas shall be designed and landscaped to trap and mitigate runoff from paved surfaces consistent with the description and intent of EPA Storm Water Technology Fact Sheet-Bioretention (EPA 832-F-99-012, September 1999;), or equivalent, including NC Cooperative Extension Bulletin, Designing Rain Gardens (Bio-Retention Areas) , 2001. These documents are included in Appendix B. 

Example of discontinuous curbing around parking lot bioretention area.
3.  Parking Dimension Bonus: A portion of the space devoted to motor vehicle parking may be landscaped instead of paved, as follows: 
a.  A landscaped area may include up to two feet of the front of the parking space as measured from a line parallel to the direction of the bumper of a vehicle using the space, as shown at right. The landscape strip shall be a minimum of six feet in width. 
b.  The landscaped area within the parking space counts toward parking lot landscaping requirements and toward any overall site landscaping requirements. 
c.  In order to utilize this parking dimension bonus, landscaping must be below grade and designed as a bio-retention area. 

Required parking landscaped areas may include up to 2 feet of the front of a parking space as measured from a line parallel to the direction of the bumper of a vehicle using the space, as shown.
F.  Responsibility of Owner: Owners shall be responsible for maintaining parking lot landscaping consistent with specifications above. 
8.12 - General Installation and Maintenance Standards 
A.  Plant Material Classifications and Standards: 
1.  Canopy (Large Shade) Trees: Canopy trees must be a locally adapted species with an expected mature height of 35 feet or greater and an expected mature crown spread of 30 feet or greater. Canopy trees, existing or planted, must be a minimum of eight feet high, and have a minimum caliper of two inches measured six inches above grade. Multi-stemmed trees shall have at least three stalks and be at least eight feet in height. 
2.  Understory (Small) Trees: Understory trees must be a minimum of six feet high and one-inch in caliper, measured six inches above grade when planted. When mature, understory trees should have an expected height of 15 to 35 feet.

g.  No trees or shrubs shall be planted within the sight distance triangle at an intersection, or driveway access point as defined by this Ordinance or NCDOT. (See Chapter 9, Section 9.3E3) 
3.  Materials permitted: The Administrator shall maintain a list of acceptable plant material, which may be used to satisfy the requirements of this ordinance. (See Acceptable Plant Material List, Appendix A.) If the applicant proposes a species which is not on the approved list, the Administrator may approve the plant material so long as it is appropriate for the local climate and meets the definition for the use for which it is intended. 
4.  Installation of Required Plant Materials: 
a.  Certificate of Occupancy: A final certificate of occupancy for commercial, industrial, multi-family, and and/or non-residential uses shall not be issued until all required landscaping is in place. Required trees for residential subdivisions should be planted upon completion of construction and will be a requirement for certificate of occupancy. 
b.  Requests for Delay: Where weather conditions or construction activity would endanger the health and survivability of required plantings, the Administrator may delay the installation. The developer shall submit a copy of signed contract for installation of the required planting areas and may be required to post a surety equal to 125 percent of the amount of the contract. The surety shall not be issued for more than 180 calendar days. For commercial, industrial, multi-family, and non-residential projects, a temporary certificate of occupancy may be issued. 
C.  Protection of Existing Vegetation During Construction: 
1.  Protective barricades shall be placed around all trees designated to be saved, prior to the start of development activities or grading. Protective barricades shall remain in place until development activities are completed. The following conditions are required:

i.  For trees ten inches or less in caliper: Place at a minimum distance of six feet from the base of each protected tree, or outside the dripline, whichever is greater. 
ii.  For trees greater than ten inches in caliper: Place at a minimum distance equal to 1.5 feet for each one inch in caliper, or outside the dripline, whichever is greater. 

2.  Construction access to a site should occur where an existing or proposed entrance/exit is located. 
3.  Land disturbance within a tree dripline is prohibited except for driveway access points, sidewalks, curb and gutter. 
4.  Where grading within a tree dripline cannot be avoided, cut and fill shall be limited to one-fourth to one-half of the area within the dripline, and tree roots must be pruned with clean cuts at the edge of the disturbed area. (No fill shall be placed within the dripline of a tree without venting to allow air and water to reach the roots.) 
5.  Storage of construction materials and any other construction activities that contribute to soil compaction should be limited to areas of the site within the limits of construction. 
D.  Irrigation: The use of irrigation is permitted in all required landscaping areas as required by this Chapter. The use of moisture metering devices and automatic timers is required. The use of water conserving practices and drip irrigation is also encouraged, unless otherwise required. 
1.  If automatic irrigation systems are permitted, moisture sensor regulators, soil moisture regulators, or drip irrigation shall be used. 
2.  Irrigation systems may connect to the main water connection for the building unless otherwise restricted and/or through other Town ordinances or policies. 
E.  Maintenance: 
1.  Maintenance: All vegetation and other screening devices shall be maintained so as to continue their effectiveness. The owner shall replace any required plantings, which die or otherwise fail to satisfy the requirements of this Chapter, within 180 calendar days with an equal or similar species and size. When plant material is severely damaged due to unusual weather conditions or other acts of God, the owner shall have up to two years to replant with submittal of a guarantee. 
2.  Inspection of Site: The Administrator may inspect the site once a year after the issuance of a permanent certificate of occupancy in order to ensure compliance with the approved site plan and to ensure that the landscape is properly maintained. The Administrator may issue a Notice of Violation to comply with the provisions of this ordinance if warranted upon an inspection under the provisions of Chapter 18 of this Ordinance. 
F.  Replacement of Disturbed and Damaged Vegetation: 
1.  The disturbance of any landscaped area or vegetation required by this Code shall constitute a violation of the site or sketch plan. All disturbed landscaped areas and vegetation shall be replanted to meet the standards of this section as well as the approved site or sketch plan. 
2.  Where the vegetation that has been disturbed or damaged existed on the site at the time the development was approved, all replacement vegetation shall meet the standards set forth in this section taking into account any unique site conditions and significant vegetation remaining within the landscaped area. Required trees, vegetation, or other landscaping that die shall be removed and replaced with new vegetation of equal or greater size. 
3.  Existing vegetation required to be preserved that has been damaged or destroyed during the course of development activity shall be subject to civil penalty and replaced in accordance with the requirements of this section. 
4.  A revegetation plan shall be submitted that takes into consideration the development condition of the site, significant vegetation remaining within landscaped areas, and the replacement plant materials. The Town of Wendell may require equal amounts of new vegetation to be installed equal to the size of the vegetation removed. 
5.  Replacement consists of one or a combination of any of the following measures: 
a.  Replant according to the requirements of this Chapter. A replanting plan denoting the proposed installation shall be submitted to the Administrator for approval. 
b.  Replace damaged or destroyed significant vegetation in both perimeter and or interior landscaped areas with an equal amount of new vegetation according to the size of vegetation removed.

ii.  Trees less than four inches DBH that are damaged or destroyed shall be replaced with a tree of an equivalent classification and variety and meeting the planting standards of this section. 
iii.  Understory plantings may also be required to restore the buffer performance criteria for the disturbed area. 
6.  A revegetation plan denoting the proposed installation shall be submitted to the Administrator for approval. The Administrator may elect to present the revegetation plan to the Tree Board for final approval. This requirement may be modified by the Administrator based upon site conditions. 
7.  For all other cases where existing vegetation is damaged or removed, the type and amount of replacement vegetation required shall be of the type and amount that is necessary to provide the type of landscaping required under this Chapter. 
8.  Replanting should be located within the vicinity of the violation. If the area is too small for sufficient growth, a more suitable location on the site may be selected as permitted by the Administrator. 
Chapter 9 - CIRCULATION AND CONNECTIVITY 

9.1 - Purpose and Intent 
    This chapter is guided by and intends to fulfill the following principle of The Town Plan of Wendell: " Ensure local and regional transportation and interconnectivity and options while also maintaining and enhancing Wendell as a walkable community." This Chapter serves to implement the policy and regulatory recommendations of the Town of Wendell Arterial and Collector Street Plan which also recognizes the importance and long-term need of new and enhanced thoroughfares throughout the community. It is the intent of this Chapter to build streets that are integral components of community design. Streets shall be detailed to complement neighborhoods and commercial centers and shall accommodate all modes of travel. 
    The purpose of this Chapter is to: 
  Support the creation of a highly connected transportation system within Wendell in order to provide choices for drivers, bicyclists and pedestrians; 
  Promote walking and bicycling; 
  Connect neighborhoods to each other and to local destinations such as schools, parks, and shopping centers; 
  Reduce vehicle miles of travel and travel time; 
  Reduce travel times and increase efficiency of public service delivery (e.g., school buses, refuse collection, mail delivery) and emergency responders; and 
  Reduce reliance on thoroughfares for short trips so that thoroughfares can better serve regional travel needs and widening beyond four lanes can be avoided; and 
  Ensure that pedestrian connections serve all citizens of Wendell by mandating that projects meet ADA requirements. 
( Ord. No. O-20-2016, § 7, 11-14-2016 ) 
9.2 - General Infrastructure Design Guidelines 
    All infrastructure shall be designed and installed in accordance with the Town's Standard Specifications and Details manual and the requirements of this chapter. 
9.3 - General Provisions for Street Design 
    New development or redevelopment with frontages on existing publicly-maintained streets shall be required to upgrade all street frontages to meet the standards of this Ordinance including sidewalks, street trees, curb and gutter, and right-of-way dedication. Payment in lieu of physical improvements may be permitted by the Board of Commissioners.

( Ord. No. O-20-2016, § 15, 11-14-2016 ) 
9.5 - Arterial and Collector Street Plan Conformity 
    This section addresses the Arterial and Collector Street Plan, which identifies a hierarchy of streets and highways to serve the long term needs of the community. The plan consists of a map indicating existing and planned highways. Roads are classified by usage and carrying capacity (i.e., arterials, collectors, locals). As new construction is proposed, more detailed impact study may be conducted to understand how the adjacent streets as well as the entire transportation network will be affected. 
A.  The location and design of streets shall be in conformance with the adopted Arterial and Collector Street Plan. 
B.  Whenever a tract of land included within any proposed development plan embraces any part of the thoroughfare network as designated on the Arterial and Collector Street Plan [see Appendix C], the Capital Area Metropolitan Planning Organization's [CAMPO] Thoroughfare Plan (also referred to as the Comprehensive Transportation Plan or Metropolitan Transportation Plan), or other adopted Transportation Plan, the development shall be required to dedicate and plat the thoroughfare right-of-way, and shall be responsible for the cost and the installation of the improvements in accordance with the Town's and NCDOT's standards for roadways. 
C.  Developments which embrace only one side of an existing or planned thoroughfare right-of-way will only be required to dedicate and plat additional right-of-way for that portion of roadway on which the development has frontage, and shall be responsible for the cost and the installation of the improvements in accordance with the Town's and NCDOT's standards for roadways. 
D.  Dedication of Right-of-Way Abutting Existing Major Thoroughfares. 
1.  If a development site abuts an existing major thoroughfare with a right-of-way width less than that recommended in the adopted Arterial and Collector Street Plan (or CAMPO's Thoroughfare Plan), then the development shall include dedication of any additional right-of-way along the development's frontage on the major thoroughfare. The dedication shall include right-of-way sufficient to widen the right-of-way to 45 feet from the centerline of the roadway unless a thoroughfare cross-section has been adopted, in which case the development shall dedicate the amount of right-of-way needed to achieve the proposed cross-section. Thoroughfare cross-sections are included in Appendix C. 
E.  Proposed New Thoroughfares. 
1.  Incorporation of Thoroughfare: If (i) an adopted Thoroughfare Plan, Collector Street Plan or Transportation Plan proposes a new major thoroughfare across part of a development site; and (ii) an alignment for the thoroughfare has been determined to a reasonable degree of certainty (for example, as a centerline alignment on a functional design plan); and (iii) the thoroughfare could appropriately serve to provide direct access to the development (for example, it would not be a freeway or other restricted-access road), then the development shall incorporate the major thoroughfare into its internal road layout by having one of the development's roads run along the proposed thoroughfare alignment. 
2.  Reservation of Future Right-of-Way: 
a.  If (i) an adopted Thoroughfare Plan, Collector Street Plan or Transportation Plan proposes a new major thoroughfare-other than one defined in subsection 1 above-across part of a development site; and (ii) an alignment for the thoroughfare has been determined to a reasonable degree of certainty (for example, as a centerline alignment on a functional design plan); and (iii) the Town's development regulations reasonably allow the developer to both realize the maximum lot density allowed by the site's zoning and physical characteristics and avoid developing that part of the site needed as future right-of-way for the proposed thoroughfare, then the development shall include reservation of the thoroughfare's future right-of-way; that is, it shall not include lots or other development within the land area needed as the thoroughfare's future right-of-way. 
b.  Land area needed as future right-of-way shall be determined from NCDOT plans where available or other by applying half the right-of-way width recommended in the Arterial and Collector Street Plan (or CAMPO's Thoroughfare Plan) along each side of the thoroughfare's proposed centerline alignment. 
3.  Exception to Applicability: If neither provision 1 or provision 2 above applies to a proposed development across which a major thoroughfare is proposed, no incorporation of the major thoroughfare or reservation of future right-of-way for the major thoroughfare shall be required. 
4.  Record Plat Notice of Future Right-of-Way: If the Arterial and Collector Street Plan (or CAMPO's Thoroughfare Plan) recommends the widening of an existing major thoroughfare abutting a development site, or proposes a new major thoroughfare across part of a development site, the record plat for the development shall include notice of such. If the land area needed for the planned widening or new thoroughfare can be ascertained with a reasonable degree of certainty, the record plat shall delineate it and label it as future right-of-way. 
F.  Collector Street Alignments: 
1.  While the Arterial and Collector Street (ACS) Plan depicts existing and future streets, this map is conceptual only and does not reflect the actual location or exact alignment of a proposed facility. Location decisions can only be made after careful consideration and evaluation of a given facility, the specific constraints related to its construction, and proposed land use changes. The map associated with the ACS Plan is intended to identify the general location of future collector streets and the recommended level of connectivity and street spacing. 
2.  The street layout in any development shall conform to the arrangement, width and location of collector streets indicated in the adopted ACS Plan. (See Arterial and Collector Street Plan Map, Appendix C). Whenever a tract of land included within any proposed development plan includes any part of the collector street system as designated on the ACS Plan, the development shall be required to dedicate and plat a collector right-of-way, and shall be responsible for the cost and the installation of the improvements in accordance with the Town's standards for roadways. 
3.  Developments which include only one side of an existing or planned collector street right-of-way will only be required to dedicate and plat the additional right-of-way along the development frontage, if necessary, and shall be responsible for one half of the cost and the installation of the improvements in accordance with the Town's standards for collector streets. 
4.  New developments will be required to construct collector streets to the outer perimeter boundaries of the development based on the criteria below. 
If the street in question meets at least two of the following criteria, then the street must be built to an appropriate collector street standard. 
a.  The street intersects directly with an arterial street and provides access to an area with an overall density of ten dwelling units per acre, or provides access to more than 150 dwelling units. 
b.  The street by its general configuration, in relationship to the existing development of the area, in effect serves a collector function. 
c.  The street extends into an undeveloped area in such a manner as to serve a future collector function. 
d.  The street serves as primary access to a significant nonresidential, institutional, or recreational land, as well as, an access to a residential area of 20 or more acres.

9.6 - Reserved. 
Editor's note- Ord. No. O-20-2016 , § 17, adopted Nov. 14, 2016, repealed § 9.6, which pertained to collector street plan. For prior history, see Code Comparative Table. 
9.7 - Street Connectivity 
    Proposed new streets in Wendell shall be extended to the boundary of the development for future connection. Improving connectivity and limiting cul-de-sacs result in improved mobility for motorists, pedestrians, and cyclists; decreased response time for emergency services and delivery costs for services such as garbage collection through improved routing options; and dispersion of motor vehicle traffic. 

A street layout showing a connectivity index of 1.44 ([11 links + 2 connections]/9 nodes). Links are shown as circles and nodes are shown as stars and connections to existing streets are shown as C's.
    A Connectivity Index shall be used to determine the adequacy of street connectivity in new developments. The index is calculated as the ratio of the number of street links in a project's street layout (road sections between intersections or stubs to adjacent property) plus connections to existing streets divided by the number of street nodes (intersections and cul-de-sac heads). 
Connectivity Index = 
(links + connections)/nodes 
    The illustration at right above illustrates a connectivity index of 1.44 (links are shown as circles, nodes are shown as stars, and connections to existing streets are shown as C's). The illustration has 11 links, two connections, and nine nodes for an index of (11+2)/9=1.44. In the illustration at right below, one cul-de-sac is converted to a full intersection. This gives the development one additional link for a connectivity index of 1.55 ([12 links + 2 connections]/9 nodes). The same number of lots is shown in both illustrations. 

A street layout showing a connectivity index of 1.55 ([12 links + 2 connections]/9 nodes). Note that one cul-de-sac from the original layout has been converted to a full intersection. The same number of lots are shown.
A.  Connectivity Index Requirement 
1.  Developments shall be required to achieve a connectivity index as shown in the following table. 
OSC RA 
M&I RR, R2, R3, R4, MH R7, NC, TND, CC, CMX, DMX CH Connectivity Index 
(Minimum Required) n/a 1.3 1.4 1.5 n/a  
2.  Variations in the connectivity requirement may be considered on a case-by-case basis by the Administrator based on the factors that follow. The Administrator may award a connectivity index bonus if it is determined that more than 60 percent of any "side" of a development (four sides total) faces impracticalities for connectivity to adjacent properties due to the presence of controlled-access highways, railroad rights-of-way, stream buffers, topographical conditions (pre-development slopes of 25 percent or greater) or existing developments that have not provided street stub-outs for connection purposes. 
B.  Street Layout: The street layout in any development shall conform to the arrangement, width and location of public streets indicated on the regulating Thoroughfare Plan and Collector Street Plan for the area. Streets not indicated on that plan shall be designed and located to: 
1.  Connect to existing and proposed streets in adjacent developments wherever possible as determined by the Administrator; 
2.  Relate to the topography; 
3.  Preserve natural features such as streams and tree growth; 
4.  Provide for adequate public safety and convenience. 
5.  Where land is subdivided into larger parcels than ordinary building lots, such parcels shall be so arranged as to allow for the opening of future streets and logical further resubdivision. 
C.  Block Length 
Zoning Districts: RR, R2, R3 R4, R7, NC, CMX, CC 
DMX, CH, TND, MH Maximum Block Length 1,200 feet 800 feet Average Block Length 800 feet (max.) 600 feet (max.)  
1.  On one-way local streets (see cross-section 9.4.D), where on-street parking is allowed, blocks shall be no longer than 300 feet or they shall provide at least every 200 feet areas of 40 feet in length where no parking is allowed. These areas are to be used for emergency access staging. 
2.  Pedestrian Path: Blocks longer than 800 feet may be required to include a pedestrian pathway across the center of the long side of the block. The path shall have at least a 20-foot easement with a minimum six-foot wide pathway. 
3.  Exceptions: OSC, RA and M&I Districts are exempt from the block length provisions of this subsection. 
D.  Required Stubs 
1.  New developments shall connect to any existing street stubs from adjacent properties. 
2.  The number of required street stubs to adjacent property is determined by calculating the cumulative linear feet of all property lines surrounding the proposed development contiguous with land that is suitable for development or redevelopment (as determined by the Administrator or an adopted land use plan); dividing by 1,200; and rounding up to the nearest whole number. 
Example (see diagram below):
675' + 750' + 950' + 985' = 3160' /1200 = 2.63 = 3 required stubs 

3.  The location of new required stub street shall be prioritized as follows: 
a.  Adjacent parcels 20 acres or greater. 
b.  Adjacent parcels that abut or are traversed by existing or proposed thoroughfares or collector streets. 
c.  Where any adopted transportation or land use plan recommends a street connection. 
d.  Landlocked properties. 
4.  Where the conditions listed in Section 9.7.E, Cul-de-Sacs (below) would prevent connections, the adjacent property shall not be included in the calculation of required stubs. 
5.  Stub streets and streets intended for extension during future phases shall be constructed to extend to the property line or as close to the line as practical. It shall be the responsibility of the second development to construct the connection to an existing stub street. Stub (or dead head) streets shall not exceed 150 feet in length without a paved turnaround (permanent or temporary). 
E.  Cul-de-Sacs 
1.  Cul-de-sacs shall not be used to avoid connection with an existing street, to avoid the extension of a thoroughfare or collector street, or to avoid connection to adjoining property. In general, cul-de-sacs shall not be used to provide access to development on the boundary of the development. 
2.  Cul-de-sacs are permitted where one or more of the following conditions offer no practical alternative for connectivity: 
a.  Topographical conditions (where pre-development slopes are 25 percent or greater) 
b.  Environmental conditions 
c.  Property shape 
d.  Property accessibility 
e.  Land use relationships 

Close-an alternative to cul-de-sacs 
3.  Where practical, a close should be used in place of a cul-de-sac. 
4.  Any permanent dead-end streets or cul-de-sac shall comply with the length limits shown in the following table. 
Measurement shall be from the point where the centerline of the cul-de-sac street intersects with the centerline of the general circulation street to the center of the turnaround of the cul-de-sac. 
OSC RA, RR, R2 R3, R4, R7, MH, NC CH, TND, CMX, CC, DMX M&I Cul-de-Sac Length (Maximum) 800' 600' 300' Not Allowed 500'  
5.  Where cul-de-sacs or dead end streets are unavoidable, developments shall incorporate provisions for pedestrian and bicycle connections to adjacent properties. 
6.  No system of multiple branching cul-de-sacs from a single access point is permitted. 
9.8 - Intersections 
A.  Streets shall be designed so as to intersect as nearly as possible at right angles. 
B.  No street shall intersect any other street at an angle of less than 60 degrees. 
C.  Streets crossing natural areas or streams shall cross at or as near to right angles as possible within limits of topographic conditions. Crossing of "blue line" channels shown on the current USGS Quad Map or USDA Soil Survey Map shall also be approved by the North Carolina Division of Water Quality. 
D.  Offset intersections are to be avoided. 
E.  Intersection Spacing: 
1.  Intersections with major thoroughfares shall be at least 800 feet apart (measured from centerline to centerline) where posted speeds are more than 35 mph; or as specified by NCDOT. 
2.  On major thoroughfares where posted speeds are 35 mph or less, intersections shall be spaced at least 400 feet. 
3.  On all other streets, a minimum intersection spacing of 200 feet shall be maintained for all other streets. 
9.9 - Access Management 
    Access management standards seek to preserve the traffic moving capacity of the Town's major streets, and in so doing, protect the investment of the taxpayer in the costs of road construction. The Town does not wish to allow unnecessary driveway cuts to neutralize the value of road construction dollars provided by Federal, State and local taxpayers. Frequent driveways allow for unpredictable stops and vehicle turning movements, causing increased congestion, and greater opportunities for traffic accidents. 
    Developments should minimize or eliminate curb cuts along arterials. Where possible, vehicular access should be shared with the adjacent properties and/or alleys or should be utilized for access. All non-residential lots, parcels, or any other division of land adjacent to an arterial roadway may be allowed driveways or street connections in accordance with the tables below. 
A.  Driveway Number and Spacing (thoroughfares only) 
Parcel Frontage (feet) Number of Driveways Allowed <500 1 501-1200 2 >1200 3  
B.  Driveway Distance from Intersections: Location guidelines for driveway access points along arterials are shown in the table below. If access to a lot, parcel, or any other lawful division of land is physically unobtainable under the provisions below, driveway access points are to be located the greatest distance possible from one another and from other public and private streets. 
Street Type Minimum Distance (feet) Major Thoroughfare 300 Collector Street/Minor Thoroughfare 150 Local 50  
C.  Median Opening Spacing: Crossovers along median divided thoroughfares should be spaced no closer than 1,200 feet. For all other streets, the spacing should be no closer than 660 feet. In general, if the left turn lane storage requirements for adjacent intersections overlap, the minimum spacing shall be increased to provide adequate left turn lane storage in both directions. 
    Where the NC DOT Driveway Manual or Median Crossover Guide conflicts, the stricter of the two standards should prevail. 
9.10 - Transportation Impact Analysis 
    The Transportation Impact Analysis (TIA) is a specialized study that evaluates the effects of a development's traffic on the surrounding transportation infrastructure. It is an essential part of the development review process to assist developers and government agencies in making land use decisions involving annexations, subdivisions, rezonings, special land uses, and other development reviews. The TIA helps identify where the development may have a significant impact on safety, traffic and transportation operations, and provides a means for the developer and government agencies to mitigate these impacts. Ultimately, the TIA can be used to evaluate whether the scale of development is appropriate for a particular site and what improvements may be necessary, on and off the site, to provide safe and efficient access and traffic flow. 

A.  A TIA shall be required for a rezoning, conditional district, subdivision plan, site plan, special use permit, certificate of zoning compliance, or preliminary plat for developments and/or their subsequent phases with an estimated trip generation of 150 peak hour trips per day or greater during an average weekday based on a five day national average as defined in the ITE Trip Generation Manual. 
B.  A traffic impact analysis report shall address the impact of projected horizon year (two years after build-out by phase or entire development as appropriate) traffic volumes. It shall identify the methodology used to evaluate the impact. The weekday peak hour impact shall be evaluated as well as the Saturday peak hour for those uses exhibiting high levels of weekend traffic generation. 
C.  Based on the findings of the analysis, if a proposed development does not meet the applicable service level standards, the applicant shall be required to upgrade the facilities in accordance with the adopted level of service program. Mitigation measures may involve strategies other than roadway construction or other physical improvements such as changes to traffic signal timing or phasing, and transportation management strategies. 
D.  Thresholds for Mitigation: The Town requires consideration of roadway and/or operational improvements when the proposed development increases the intersection Volume-to-Capacity Ratio (V/C) beyond the thresholds indicated in the table below. The Town evaluates the impacts of proposed development at intersections (primarily under existing year conditions) based on the increase in V/C ratio as a result of the projected site traffic. This increase is determined by comparing the V/C ratio under existing development conditions and proposed development conditions. For the purposes of this comparison, all non-signalized intersections are analyzed as signalized intersections. 
Existing V/C Allowable Increase in V/C By 
Development 0.00-0.60 0.10 0.61-0.70 0.07 0.71-0.80 0.05 0.81-0.90 0.03 0.91-1.00+ 0.02  
E.  A TIA will vary in range and complexity depending on the type and size of the proposed development. The procedures for a TIA are part of the Major Site Plan Review as noted in Section 15.6.B. The TIA requirements as described in Section 16.11 may be modified by the Administrator.

Chapter 10 - PARKING 

10.1 - Purpose and Intent 
    Parking lots, loading areas, and similar facilities are necessary elements in the urban environment. The purpose of this chapter is to provide for these necessary elements while: 
  Ensuring adequate parking for future commercial and residential parking. 
  Managing stormwater volume and velocity, 
  Limiting surface pollutants, 
  Reducing surface level heat and glare, 
  Increasing the efficiency of the connecting street system, and 
  Protecting the operations of the surrounding pedestrian and bicycle network. 
    To provide adequate service, the Town has enacted standards to regulate the construction, expansion, and renovation of such facilities. 
10.2 - Applicability 
    At the time of erection of any new building, permanent parking spaces shall be provided in all districts in the amount specified by this Chapter. 
10.3 - Off-Street Parking Area Design Specifications 
    Off-street parking areas should be designed to minimize breaks in the pedestrian network along public streets and create safe and comfortable passage for pedestrians. In order to accomplish this purpose, the following standards shall be met: 
A.  Permitted Off-Street Parking Locations by Building Type 


B.  Parking Area Location: Parking lots and parking structures as stand-alone uses in the NC, CMX, CC, DMX or TND districts shall not abut intersections, pedestrian-oriented (i.e, streets with ground floor commercial uses) streets, or civic buildings; be adjacent to squares or parks; or occupy lots which terminate a vista (i.e., the view at the end of a street/corridor). 
C.  Landscaping & Curbing/Bioretention: Landscaping shall be provided in accordance with Section 8.11, Parking Lot Landscaping. 
D.  Sidewalk Corridors: Parking Areas shall be designed to allow pedestrians to safely move from their vehicles to the building. Sidewalk corridors shall be provided within the parking area and/or along the perimeter to provide safe building access for pedestrians.

F.  Circulation and Maneuvering: 
1.  Off-street parking areas shall be designed to facilitate adequate movement and access by sanitation, emergency, utility, and other public service vehicles without posing a danger to pedestrians or impeding the function of the parking area. 
2.  Except for single-family dwellings with separated parking areas and driveways, parking and maneuvering areas shall be arranged to allow vehicles to enter and leave the premises or parking areas in a forward motion. When more than two required spaces are provided in a single parking area, then entering and leaving in a forward motion is required. 
G.  Encroachment: Off-street parking areas shall be designed so that parked vehicles do not encroach upon or extend onto public rights-of-way or sidewalks; or strike against or damage any wall, vegetation, utility, or other structures. 
H.  Disabled Parking: Disabled parking shall be provided in accordance with the North Carolina Accessibility Code and federal ADA standards. 
I.  Parking Area Lighting: Parking lots shall be lighted in such a manner as to provide adequate lighting per standards of Chapter 11, Lighting.

B.  Exemptions and Adjustments 
1.  DMX: Developments in the DMX District are expected to provide parking under the requirements of this Chapter or pay a fee in lieu of the required improvements. 
2.  On-Street Parking: Where parking on-street is permitted, the on-street spaces directly along a parcel's frontage for any use except a single-family dwelling may count toward the minimum parking requirement. 
3.  Housing Services for the Elderly: The Board of Commissioners may authorize a reduction in off-street parking requirements for multi-family dwellings that provide Housing Services to the Elderly (including duplexes and multi-family buildings of four or more units) to no less than three off-street parking spaces for each four dwelling units or fraction thereof: Should a change of use occur such that the building is no longer providing Housing Services for the Elderly as the primary use, parking requirements shall meet the minimum ratio for residential uses as required in the table above (Section 10.4.A). 
4.  Tree Preservation: The minimum number of parking spaces required may be adjusted by the Administrator when it has been determined that the reductions are necessary to preserve a healthy tree or trees (with a 12-inch or greater diameter at breast height) from being damaged or removed, and where the site plan provides for the retention of said tree or trees. (See Chapter 8.) 
C.  Shared/Combined Parking: The parking spaces required for one use may be used to satisfy the parking requirements for a second use on the same zoning lot, subject to certification by the Administrator that such joint usage of parking complies with the following: 
1.  The peak usage of the parking facility by one use will be at night or on Sundays (such as with theaters, assembly halls, or churches), and the peak usage of the parking facility by the second use will be at other times; or, 
2.  The second use is an accessory use to the first use, such as restaurants and meeting rooms to hotels and motels.

D.  Parking Space Dimensions 
1.  Parking space dimensions (other than those designed for the disabled) shall be a minimum of 18 feet long and nine feet wide. 
2.  Parallel parking space dimensions shall be a minimum of 20 feet by eight feet (20 by seven feet may be used in constrained conditions or on residential streets). The dimension is measured from the face of the curb and may include the gutter. 
E.  Driveway Widths for Parking Lots: Driveways for parking lots shall be a minimum of 12 feet in width for one-way traffic and 24 feet in width for two-way traffic. Driveway widths shall not exceed 24 feet, except as required by the Town of Wendell or the North Carolina Department of Transportation (NCDOT). 
F.  Bicycle Parking: Bicycle parking is required to encourage the use of bicycles for personal transportation and to provide for bicycle access to employment, retail, and other destinations in Wendell. 
1.  Required Racks: Where bicycle racks are used, "Inverted U" type racks or other racks that support the bicycle at two points on the bicycle frame are required. 

"Inverted U" bicycle rack 
2.  Rack Siting and Dimensions: 
a.  Racks shall be secured to the ground on a hard surface such as concrete, asphalt or unit pavers. 
b.  Each bicycle parking space shall provide six feet by two feet in area per bicycle plus the area needed for access.

g.  Racks should be placed along a major building approach line and clearly visible from the approach and no more than 50 feet from building entrances. Rack placement should allow for visual monitoring by people within the building and/or people entering the building. 
h.  If required bicycle parking is not visible from the street or main building entrance, a sign shall be posted at the main entrance indicating the location of the parking. 
i.  Uses with several major, actively used entrances shall locate a portion of the required bicycle parking at each entrance. 
3.  Shared Bicycle Parking: Any property owner required to have bicycle parking may elect to establish shared bicycle parking with any other property owner within the same block to meet the combined requirements. 
G.  Satellite Parking: Satellite parking may be permitted, subject to certification by the Administrator that the following requirements have been met: 
1.  The use being served by the off-site parking shall be a permitted principal use, as established in Chapter 2, in the zoning districts within which the lot containing such parking is located; 
2.  The off-site parking spaces shall be located within 500 feet walking distance, and accessible by sidewalks or other designated safe walkways, of a public entrance to the structure or zoning lot containing the use for which such spaces are required; 
3.  The continued availability of off-site parking spaces necessary to meet the requirements of this section shall be ensured by an appropriate condition that the continued validity of the zoning compliance or special use permit shall be dependent upon the permit holder's continued ability to provide the requisite number of parking spaces. 
H.  Structured Parking 
1.  Where an above-ground parking structure fronts a public street, it shall be screened in such a way that cars are not visible from the street. The ground level of a parking structure should be wrapped by retail, office or some other active use along the primary facade, at least. 
2.  Along pedestrian oriented streets, parking structure facades shall be treated with high quality materials and given vertical articulation and emphasis compatible with the principle structure. The facade shall be designed to visually screen cars. 
3.  Pedestrian entries shall be clearly visible. The vertical circulation should not be located in the center of the structure so that it is difficult to locate. 
4.  The location of off-street bicycle parking spaces in parking structures is highly encouraged. Where bicycle parking is located in a parking structure, it shall be located on the level closest to the street and/or a primary building entrance. 
I.  Use of Parking Spaces 
1.  Required parking areas shall be available for the parking of operable vehicles of residents, customers and employees, and shall not be used for the storage of vehicles or materials, or for the parking of vehicles used for loading or unloading, or in conducting the use. 
J.  Circulation Drives: A one-way circulation drive may be permitted around the front of the building but may not encroach into the front setback or any required landscape area. If provided, this drive shall be designed to be the minimal width required (not to exceed ten feet in width). See 10.4E for drive widths in parking lots. 

Circulation drives, if provided, should be minimized 
K.  Surfacing: All vehicle accommodation area surfacing shall be constructed in accordance with the following: 
1.  Porous Paving Permitted: The Administrator may permit and/or require that porous paving materials be substituted for paved surfaces in some portion of a vehicular surface area where it finds it is necessary to protect the root system of an existing tree or trees from damage or reduce the amount of impervious surface. 
2.  Overflow Parking: Off-street areas used for special event parking (to accommodate occasional overflow volumes) may be constructed of any dust-free compacted, pervious ground cover. The owner of the property shall be responsible for the maintenance of such parking areas in a clean and dust-free condition. Grass and mulch are examples of acceptable pervious ground cover. 
3.  Pervious Paving Required: When parking areas exceed the minimum parking requirements a portion of the excess spaces (as detailed in the table below) shall be constructed using a pervious technique approved by the Administrator including but not limited to pervious pavers, pervious pavement, grass block, or grass with structural supports. It is the responsibility of the owner to maintain these parking areas as pervious. This provision shall not apply to those developments which would result in a parking layout with five or less pervious paving spaces. 
Excess Parking Provided Required Pervious Paving >150-200% of minimum required parking 20% of excess spaces up to 200% >200% of minimum required parking All spaces in excess of 200% of minimum (in addition to the 20% required above)  
Example: A 60,000 square foot retail use is required to provide a minimum of two spaces per 1,000 square feet or 120 parking spaces. If the developer chooses to provide three parking spaces per 1,000 square feet or 180 spaces (150 percent of required minimum), then 36 of the spaces (20 percent) shall be constructed using a pervious paving technique. 
If the developer chooses to provide 4.5 spaces per 1,000 square feet or 270 spaces, then all of the spaces in excess of 200% of the minimum spaces (120 spaces x 200% = 240 spaces; 270-240 = 30 spaces); PLUS 20% of the spaces up to 200% (240 x 20% = 48 spaces + 30 spaces = 78 spaces) shall be constructed using a pervious paving technique. 

Pervious pavers and other pervious paving techniques allow stormwater to infiltrate into the ground below. 
4.  Exceptions to Paved Parking: The following situations are exempted from the requirements of this Section: 
a.  An overflow parking lot used only for occasional use (Use that occurs on two or fewer days per week) or is temporary in nature (not exceeding 24 months). 
b.  Whenever a proposed development involves only one of the following: 
i.  An accessory structure; or 
ii.  A change in use which will not increase the number of required parking spaces by more than 25 percent and the existing parking lot is not paved. 
c.  The Administrator may exempt up to 75 percent of the required employee parking spaces in Manufacturing and Industrial (M&I) zoning district from the paving requirements of the Section. The exemption is based upon the following criteria: if the employee parking area is not visible, either by effective buffer screening or because of the grade of the site, from any public right-of-way or a residentially or commercially zoned property. 
5.  Non-Paved Areas: Whenever a permanent parking area is exempt from the paved parking requirements or otherwise not required to be paved, the Administrator shall: 
a.  Require that landscape aisles or spatial separations be provided where the Administrator finds it is desirable to ensure that the parking spaces will be readily identifiable to the users; and 
b.  Require the perimeter of the vehicle accommodation area encompassing the parking stalls and the side of any unpaved drive or aisle leading to said stalls, to be edged with brick, pressure treated timbers, or cast in place concrete, and anchored into place. Alternate borders may be considered on a case by case basis. 
L.  Vehicle Stacking Requirements 
1.  Adequate space must be made available on-site for the stacking, storage and queuing of vehicles. 
2.  Vehicles using drive-thru facilities may not encroach on or interfere with the public use of streets, sidewalks, and crosswalks by vehicles or pedestrians. 
3.  A restaurant with drive-thru facilities must provide at least eight queuing spaces for vehicles when one drive-thru lane exists and six spaces at each drive-thru when more than one lane exists, measured from the pickup window. 
4.  Any use with gas pump islands must provide a minimum of 30 feet of stacking space from each end of the island. 
5.  Other uses utilizing drive-thru facilities must provide a minimum of three queuing spaces per drive-thru lane.

Chapter 11 - LIGHTING 

11.1 - Purpose and Intent 
    Exterior lighting shall be designed to provide the minimum lighting necessary to ensure adequate safety, night vision, and comfort and not create or cause excessive glare onto adjacent properties and public street rights-of-way. 
    Levels of illumination to achieve a certain function or desired effect should also reduce or eliminate the hazardous aspects and nuisance of glare and light spillage. All exterior lighting-with the exception of street lighting-that is used around buildings, recreation areas, parking lots, and signs, shall be designed to protect against the spillage of light to adjacent properties. 
11.2 - General Standards 
    All exterior lighting, except street lighting, shall conform to the following standards: 
A.  Unless otherwise specified in subsections below, the maximum light level shall be 0.5 maintained foot-candles at any property line in a residential district, or on a lot occupied by a dwelling, congregate care or congregate living structure, unless otherwise approved by the Administrator. 
B.  All other exterior lighting shall be designed and located such that the maximum illumination measured in foot-candles at the property line shall not exceed one foot-candle. 
C.  All floodlights shall be installed such that the fixture shall be aimed down at least 45 degrees from vertical. Flood lights and display lights shall be positioned such that any fixture located within 50 feet of a public street right-of-way is mounted and aimed perpendicular to the right-of-way, with a side-to-side horizontal aiming tolerance not to exceed 15 degrees from perpendicular to the right-of-way. 
D.  All flood lamps emitting 1,000 or more lumens shall be aimed at least 60 degrees down from horizontal or shielded such that the main beam from the light source is not visible from adjacent properties or the public street right-of-way. 
E.  All wall pack fixtures shall be cutoff fixtures. Wall packs on buildings may be used at entrances to a building to light unsafe areas. They are not intended to draw attention to the building or provide general building or site lighting. 
F.  Exterior lighting shall not shine directly into the yard or into the windows of an adjacent residence. 
G.  Exterior lighting shall be designed, located, and mounted at heights no greater than 18 feet above grade for pedestrian lights, or 37 feet above grade for street or parking area lights. 
H.  All outdoor and parking lot lighting fixtures, including: metal halide, mercury vapor, fluorescent, induction, white high-pressure sodium and color-improved high-pressure sodium lamps used in non-cutoff fixtures shall be coated with an internal white frosting inside the outer lamp envelope. 
I.  Floodlights shall be hooded or shielded so that the light source is not visible from any public right-of-way or adjacent property. 
J.  Flickering, rotating, or flashing lights, or search lights shall not be permitted. 
11.3 - Design Procedures and Illumination Levels 
A.  The maximum permitted points of illumination shall be measured from ground level in accordance to the standards expressed in this Chapter. The following standards shall be required of all exterior lighting with the exception of public street lighting which is exempt. 
B.  The quantity of fixtures to be provided shall be based upon the desired level of uniform illumination as established by the following table and current standards of the Illuminating Engineering Society of North America (IESNA). Fixture locations should be chosen to minimize the hazard of glare and to minimize conflicts with landscaping plans. 
C.  Illumination Levels: The level of illumination shall be based upon the primary activity in each area to be lighted as outlined below: 
1.  Open Parking Facilities 
a.  For lighted parking lots, the minimum light level shall be no less than 0.2 foot-candles (FC). All light levels are measured at ground level. 
b.  The minimum light level requirements vary depending on the use/task classification. The specified minimum FC value above 0.2 FC as outlined in the following table means that the lowest light level point or location in the parking lot must not exceed the minimum stated FC value in the table (i.e. 0.9 FC for large shopping centers). An average to minimum uniformity ratio of 4:1 means that the average FC to minimum FC ratio cannot be worse (higher) than 4:1. See the following table: 
Light Levels for Open Outdoor Parking Facilities Use/Task Maintained Foot-candles Avg/Min Uniformity (a) Parking, residential, multi-family: 
   Low to medium vehicular/pedestrian activity Range from 0.2 FC Min to 0.7 FC Min 4:1 (b) Parking, industrial/commercial/ institutional/municipal: 
   High activity, i.e., large shopping centers/fast food facilities, major athletic/civic cultural events 0.9 FC Min 4:1    Medium/low activity, i.e. community shopping, office parks, hospitals, commuter lots, cultural/civic/recreational events, residential neighborhood shopping, industrial employee parking, schools, church parking Range from 0.2 FC Min to 0.7 FC Min 4:1  
Source: IESNA 8th Edition Lighting Handbook with modifications 
c.  Illumination levels are horizontal on the task, e.g. at grade or area surface. 
d.  Uniformity ratios dictate that average illuminance values shall not exceed minimum values by more than the product of the minimum value and the specified ratio. For example, for commercial parking medium/low activity, the average foot-candles shall not be in excess of 2.8 (0.7 x 4). 
e.  The Administrator shall be responsible for determining the activity level of a development. Applicants may appeal this decision to the Planning Board. 
2.  Other Outdoor Areas 

11.4 - Additional Standards for Lighting in Parking Lots and Outdoor Areas 
A.  Other than flood lights and flood lamps, all outdoor area and parking lot lighting fixtures shall be cutoff fixtures or comply with subsection D below. 
B.  The mounting height of all exterior lighting, except outdoor sports field lighting and outdoor performance area lighting shall not exceed 37 feet above finished grade, unless approved by the Planning Board as having no adverse effect. 
C.  All metal halide fixtures equipped with a medium base socket must utilize either an internal refractive lens or a wide-body refractive globe as described in Chapter 19, Definitions. 
D.  Non-Cutoff fixtures: 
1.  Non-cutoff fixtures may be used when the maximum initial lumens generated by each fixture shall not exceed 9,500 initial lamp lumens per fixture. 
2.  All metal halide, mercury vapor, fluorescent, induction, white high pressure sodium and color improved high pressure sodium lamps used in non-cutoff fixtures shall be coated with an internal white frosting inside the outer lamp envelope. 
11.5 - Additional Standards for Gas Station/Convenience Store Aprons and Canopies 
    Lighting under canopies shall be designed so as not to create glare off-site. Acceptable methods include one or more of the following: 
A.  Recessed fixture incorporating a lens cover that is either recessed or flush with the bottom surface (ceiling) of the vehicular canopy that provides a cutoff or shielded light distribution. 
B.  Surface mounted fixture incorporating a flat glass that provides a cutoff or shielded light distribution. 
C.  Other method approved by the Administrator. 
D.  Lights shall not be mounted on the top or sides of the canopy and the sides of the canopy shall not be externally illuminated. 
11.6 - Additional Standards for Lighting of Outdoor Display Areas (Car Lots, etc.) 
A.  Parking lot outdoor areas shall be illuminated in accordance with the requirements for subsection 11.3 above. 
B.  All light fixtures shall meet the IESNA definition of cutoff fixtures. Forward throw fixtures (type IV light distribution, as defined by the IESNA) are required within 25 feet of any public street right-of-way. Alternatively, directional fixtures (such as floodlights) may be used provided they shall be aimed in accordance with subsections 11.2.C of this Chapter. 
C.  The mounting height of outdoor display area fixtures shall not exceed 37 feet above finished grade. 
11.7 - Lighting of Buildings and Landscaping 
A.  Lighting fixtures shall be selected, located, aimed, and shielded so that direct illumination is focused exclusively on the building facade, plantings, and other intended site feature and away from adjoining properties and the public street right-of-way. 
B.  Maximum illumination on any vertical surface or angular roof shall not exceed 5.0 foot-candles average maintained. 
C.  To the extent practical and where possible, lighting fixtures shall be directed downward rather than upward. 
D.  When upward aiming lighting is used, placing low wattage fixtures with shields as needed close to the building to graze the facade is encouraged to minimize reflected light from windows and other surfaces that would be present from a flood design. 
11.8 - Outdoor Sports Fields 
A.  The mounting height of outdoor sports field lighting fixtures shall not exceed 80 feet from finished grade unless approved by the Planning Board as having no adverse effect or approved by the Town as part of a Special Use Permit. 
B.  All outdoor sports field and outdoor performance area lighting fixtures shall be equipped with a glare control package (louvers, shields, or similar devices). 
C.  The fixtures must be aimed so that their beams are directed and fall within the primary playing or performance area. 
D.  Non-conforming fixtures lighting sports fields may be replaced or otherwise changed on an individual/small cluster basis with new non-conforming fixtures. However, when all the fixtures are upgraded or otherwise changed, the fixtures must be brought into compliance with the requirements of this Chapter. 
E.  The hours of operation for the lighting system for any game or event shall not exceed one hour after the end of the event. 
11.9 - Sign Lighting 
    Lighting fixtures illuminating signs shall be aimed and shielded so that direct illumination is focused exclusively on the sign. Top down mounting of light fixtures is required where feasible. 
11.10 - Street Lighting 
A.  Street lighting shall be placed on all streets by the developer to allow for the safe use of streets by both cars and pedestrians. All street lighting shall be placed in accordance with the following minimum design standards: 
1.  Minimum average street light spacing: 
OSC RA RR, R2, R3, R4, MH R7, TND, NC, CMX, CC, DMX CH, M&I Minimum Average Street Light Spacing n/a n/a 300 ft. 150 ft. (pedestrian-scaled) 300 ft.  
2.  Lighting shall be placed at street intersections and is preferred at street curves. 
3.  Pedestrian-scaled lighting (no taller than 18 feet) should be prioritized over automobile lighting. Lighting should be placed in a manner to limit the casting of shadows on sidewalks. 
4.  All lighting shall utilize a cutoff fixture. Where buildings are close to the street (less than 15 feet from the right-of-way), full cutoff fixtures are required to limit glare and light spillage on upper levels. 
B.  Alleys are excluded from the spacing and lighting requirements of this Chapter. 
11.11 - Walkways, Bikeways/Greenways and Parks (Sections to be lighted only) 
    Walkway, pathway or ground areas that are to be lighted shall be illuminated to a level of at least 0.2 and no more than 0.5 average horizontal maintained foot-candles. 
11.12 - Lighting Plan Requirements

No fence wrap affixed pursuant to this subsection may display any advertising other than advertising sponsored by a person directly involved in the construction project and for which monetary compensation for the advertisement is not paid or required. 
1.  If construction is not completed at the end of 24 months from the time the fence wrap was installed, the Town shall regulate the signage in the same manner as banners affixed to a building. 
( Ord. No. O-08-2017, § 1, 3-13-2017 ) 
12.3 - General Provisions 
A.  The scale of the sign(s) should be appropriate for the building on which they are placed. Signs should reflect the proportional and dimensional relationships of the structure. 
B.  Signs should not obscure building elements such as windows, cornices, or decorative details and should be integrated with the design of the building. 
C.  Any structurally unsafe sign that endangers the public safety shall be immediately removed. 
D.  In no way shall a sign hinder or obstruct visibility of the right-of-way, either at intersections or points of ingress or egress from parking lots, or be located in a sight triangle.

F.  Overhead signs shall be placed so as not to be easily reached by pedestrian traffic. The bottom of the sign shall be located a minimum of eight feet above grade immediately under the sign, if the sign is within 15 feet of the edge of the street right-of-way. 
G.  Illumination devices for signs such as, but not limited to, flood or spot lights shall be so placed and so shielded as to prevent the rays of illumination from being cast on neighboring buildings or vehicles approaching from either direction. 
H.  No non-governmental sign shall be attached to or painted on power poles, traffic signs or other objects not intended to support a sign. 
I.  No signs shall be permanently erected within the public right-of-way, except that signs for buildings permitted to have zero-foot setbacks may over hang the right-of-way with approval from NCDOT on State-maintained roads. Temporary signs, such as sandwich board signs, may be allowed in the right-of-way consistent with the regulations in this Chapter and/or approval by the Administrator. 
12.4 - Computation of Signage Area 
    The area of a sign face (which is also the sign area of a wall sign or other sign with only one face) shall be computed by means of the smallest rectangle that will encompass the extreme limits of the writing, representation, emblem or other display, together with any material or color forming an integral part of the background of the display or used to differentiate the sign from the backdrop or structure against which it is placed, but not including any supporting framework, base, bracing or decorative fence or wall when such fence or wall otherwise meets the regulations of this chapter and is clearly incidental to the display itself. 
    For a single wall on a single-occupant building, all pieces of information or other graphic representations on that wall shall be measured as though part of one sign, encompassed within one rectangle, which may not exceed the permitted total wall area to which the sign is affixed. For a single wall on a multi-occupant building, the area of signs shall be computed using these principles and each individual sign shall not exceed the permitted total wall area to which the sign(s) is affixed. 

    Where the sign faces of a double-faced sign are parallel or the interior angle formed by the faces is 60 degrees or less, only one display face shall be measured in computing sign area. If the two faces of a double-faced sign area of unequal area, the area of the sign shall be the area of the larger face. In all other cases, the areas of all faces of a multi-faced sign shall be added together to compute the area of the sign. 
12.5 - Computation of Sign Height 
    The maximum height shall be as measured from street grade or the sidewalk (where one exists), whichever is less.

Approval of Construction Plans shall entitle the subdivider to proceed with construction of subdivision improvements for the Preliminary Plan and no construction, including grading, shall proceed without such approval.

The approval of the Preliminary Plan shall become null and void within two years, unless the developer has completed required improvements (or posted the appropriate guarantee of improvements) and submitted for approval the Final Plat as required by this ordinance or shall have applied for and received an extension of time from the Administrator. The Technical Review Committee may, at its discretion, require a Preliminary Plan to adhere to any new requirements before granting this extension. If a Preliminary Plan becomes null and void, the subdivider may resubmit for an updated approval; however, the resubmitted Preliminary Plan may be subject to any new requirements for Preliminary Plans, and fees shall be paid at current standard cost rates. 
4.  Multiple Phases Not Approved: Approval of a Preliminary Plan constituting an individual phase of a multi-phase project, which has not been entirely approved, does not constitute approval by the Town of any remaining phases. For approved Preliminary Plans consisting of multiple phases, only the phase that is to be developed for sale immediately shall be submitted for Final Plat approval. 
D.  Final Plats: 
1.  Final Plat approval shall entitle the subdivider to record the Final Plat. The Final Plat shall constitute a complete phase of the approved Construction Documents. 
2.  Plats to be Recorded: Approved Final Plats shall be filed by the applicant for recording with the Register of Deeds of Wake County within 30 calendar days of the date of approval by the Administrator; otherwise, such approval shall be null and void.

15.13 - Conditional Districts 
A.  Purpose: The purpose of the Conditional Districts is to provide an alternative means of land development and an alternative zoning procedure that may be used to establish residential, commercial, and industrial Conditional Districts at appropriate locations and in accordance with the planning and development objectives of the Town. 
    A Conditional District (CD) established according to the provisions of this section may depart from the strict application of the requirements of the town's general zoning districts, as outlined in Section 2.18, Conditional Districts. The CD alternative may allow uses which are not currently defined or contemplated by the Code. A primary purpose of this section is to provide standards by which such flexibility may be achieved while maintaining and protecting the public health, safety and welfare of the citizens. 
    A second purpose of this section is to establish a more complete living and working environment through the application of enlightened and imaginative approaches to community planning and property design. A CD should provide a variety of natural features and scenic areas, efficient and economical land use, improved amenities, orderly and economical development, and the protection of existing and future adjacent development. 
B.  General Requirements: 
1.  Applicant: Conditional District classification shall only be considered upon the request of the owners and/or their representatives of all the property to be included. A CD shall consist of land under unified control which may be planned and developed as a single development or as an approved programmed series of development phases by multiple developers. "Unified control" means that all land to be included within a CD shall be owned or otherwise under the legal control of the person or legal entity which has applied for a Conditional District. Such person or entity shall be legally capable of providing a commitment to the town that the CD development will comply with all documents, plans, standards and conditions ultimately approved by the town. 
2.  Standards of District to be Met: Within an approved Conditional District, no use shall be permitted except pursuant to the conditions imposed by the applicant on the Conditional District in the approval of the rezoning. The Board of Commissioners may impose additional reasonable and appropriate conditions or safeguards to serve the purpose and intent of this Section, and to preserve public welfare, and justice. 
3.  Content of Application: 
a.  A Conditional District shall consist of the CD Master Development Plan, individually, or in combination with a CD Final Development Plan; as well as any other plans, drawings, renderings, elevations, maps and documents specifically included as development documents for approval by the Board of Commissioners. The Master Plan, as a site specific Conditional Zoning Plan, is itself a condition of the Conditional District rezoning. 
b.  Master Development Plan: The development concept of all land areas encompassed by a Conditional District shall be adequately described by a Master Development Plan comprised of scaled drawings and associated reports. At a minimum, the Master Development Plan shall adequately describe: 
i.  The overall boundary and area of the district, including underlying zoning districts; 
ii.  The general location, orientation and size of principal structures and associated parking areas; landscape and buffer areas; open space areas; the location, size and general treatment of environmentally sensitive areas; the general location and size of existing and proposed water mains and sewer trunk lines required to service the development; and general traffic routes (external and internal) to and from the development with major access points identified; 
iii.  Tabular data, including the range and scope of proposed land uses, proposed densities, floor area ratios or impervious surface ratios as applicable to development type; and land areas devoted to each type of general land use and phase of development; 
iv.  Full list of proposed uses consistent in character with the underlying zoning district; 
v.  A proposed development schedule if the project is to be phased. 
c.  Final Development Plan: All Final Development Plans shall conform to the general development concept of an approved Master Development Plan. A final plan shall consist of a detailed set of construction plans that fully demonstrate compliance with all applicable construction regulations and provisions of the Town of Wendell and with all applicable performance criteria, conditions, and other requirements of the enacting Conditional District zoning ordinance. 
d.  In addition to the Master Plan, the applicant shall provide the exact land use classifications proposed for the Conditional District. Such use classifications may be selected from any of the uses, whether permitted, by right or conditional, allowed in the general zoning district upon which the Conditional District is based. Uses not otherwise permitted within the general zoning district shall not be permitted within the Conditional District. 
4.  Fair and Reasonable Conditions: The provisions of the CD Master Plan shall replace all conflicting development regulations set forth in this Ordinance which would otherwise apply to the development site. The Planning Board may recommend and the Board of Commissioners may attach reasonable and appropriate conditions including, but not limited to, the location, nature, hours of operation, and extent of the proposed use(s). Conditions and site-specific standards shall be limited to those that address conformance of the development and use of the site to this Ordinance and officially adopted plans and those standards and conditions that address the impacts reasonably expected to be generated by the development and use of the site. The applicant will have a reasonable opportunity to consider and respond to any additional requirements proposed by either the Planning Board or the Board of Commissioners prior to final action. 
5.  Decisions: Decisions by the Board of Commissioners shall be by majority vote, unless a valid Protest Petition in accordance with Section 15.19.C has been filed, in which case, a three-fourths majority vote of eligible members shall be required for approval. 
C.  Ability to Proceed: The applicant may proceed with development only after approval of the Conditional District Master Plan by Board of Commissioners. A simple majority vote of the Board of Commissioners is required when the Conditional District Master Plan receives a favorable recommendation from the Planning Board. When the Planning Board recommends against the Conditional District Master Plan, a supermajority, or four-fifths, vote from the Board of Commissioners is required for approval. A Conditional District Final Development Plan must also be approved by the Planning Board and the applicable plat must be recorded with the Wake County Register of Deeds. The development and use of all land within the Conditional District shall be in keeping with the approved Master Plan and all applicable provisions therein. 
D.  Approval Process: 
1.  The procedure for approval of the Master Plan shall follow the procedure outlined in the table in subsection H below and in Section 15.12, Map Amendments (Rezonings). 
2.  Following approval of the Conditional District rezoning and the Master Plan by the Board of Commissioners, the applicant shall submit a Final Development Plan to the Planning Board for approval. The Final Development Plan shall implement the Master Plan with any changes, additions and conditions required and approved by the Board of Commissioners. Following Final Development Plan approval, permits for the installation of infrastructure only (streets, utilities, etc.) may be issued for development of the site. 
E.  Final Approval by Stages: If so reflected on the Master Plan, the Board of Commissioners may allow the staging of final development. Each phase of development shall adhere to all applicable provisions and standards of this section and the applicable CD Master Plan. 
F.  Substantial Changes: Any substantial change to a Master Plan as noted below shall be reviewed by the Planning Board and approved or denied by the Board of Commissioners as an amended Conditional District. 
1.  The following changes to a CD Master Plan or subsequent Final Plan shall require approval by the Board of Commissioners: 
a.  Land area being added or removed from the Conditional District. 
b.  Modification of special performance criteria, design standards, or other requirements specified by the enacting ordinance. 
c.  A change in land use or development type beyond that permitted by the approved Master Plan. 
d.  When there is introduction of a new vehicular access point to an existing street, road or thoroughfare not previously designated for access. 
e.  When there is an increase in the total number of residential dwelling units originally authorized by the approved Master Plan. 
f.  When the total floor area of a commercial or industrial classification is increased more than ten percent beyond the total floor area last approved by Board of Commissioners. 
2.  All other changes to a CD Master Plan or subsequent Final Plan shall receive approval by the Planning Board. However, if in the judgment of the Planning Board, the requested changes alter the basic development concept of the CD, the Planning Board may require concurrent approval by the Board of Commissioners. 
G.  Rescission of Conditional Districts: The Applicant shall secure a valid building or construction permit(s) within a 12-month period from date of approval of the Conditional District unless otherwise specified. If such project is not complete and a valid building or construction permit is not in place at the end of the 12-month period, the Administrator shall notify the applicant of either such finding. Within 60 calendar days of notification, the Administrator shall make a recommendation concerning the rescission of the Conditional District to the Board of Commissioners. The Board of Commissioners may then rescind the Conditional District, or extend the life of the Conditional District for a specified period of time.

15.14 - Vested Rights 
A.  General Procedures/Establishment of Vesting: 
1.  Pursuant to G.S. 160A-385.1 and not withstanding any other provision or amendment, a landowner may apply for approval of a site-specific development plan as defined in the statute that shall entitle said landowner to develop property in accordance with the previously approved plan. 
2.  The approval authority may approve a site specific development plan upon such terms and conditions as may reasonably be necessary to protect the public health, safety, and general welfare. 
3.  Approval of site specific development plan with the condition that a variance be obtained shall not confer a zoning vested right unless and until the necessary variance is obtained. 
4.  A site specific development plan shall be deemed approved upon the effective date of the approval authority's action ordinance relating thereto. 
5.  The establishment of a zoning vested right shall not preclude the application of overlay zoning that imposes additional requirements but does not affect the allowable type or intensity of use, or ordinances or regulations that are general in nature and are applicable to all property subject to land use regulation by the Town, including but not limited to, building, fire, plumbing, electrical, and mechanical codes. Otherwise, applicable new or amended regulations shall become effective with respect to property that is subject to a site specific development plan upon the expiration or termination of the vested right in accordance with this subchapter. 
6.  A zoning vested right is not a personal right, but shall attach to and run with the applicable property. After approval of a site specific development plan, all successors to the original landowner shall be entitled to exercise such right while applicable. 
B.  Approval procedures and approval authority 
1.  Except as otherwise provided in this section, an application for site specific development plan approval shall be processed in accordance with the procedure established by ordinance and shall be considered by the designated approval authority for the specific type of zoning or land use permit or approval for which the application is made. 
2.  Notwithstanding the provisions of 15.14.B.1 above, if the authority to issue a particular zoning or land use permit or approval has been delegated by ordinance to a board, committee, or administrative official other than the Board of Commissioners in order to obtain a zoning vested right, the applicant must request in writing at the time of the application that the application be considered and acted on by the Board of Commissioners following notice and a public hearing as provided in North Carolina General Statute § 160A-364. 
3.  In order for a zoning vested right to be established upon approval of a site specific development plan, the applicant must indicate at the time of application, on a form to be provided by the Town, that a zoning vested right is being sought. 
4.  The Board of Commissioners may not require the landowner to waive his vested right as a condition of development approval. 
5.  Each map, plat, site plan, or other document evidencing a site specific development plan shall contain the following notation: "Approval of this plan establishes a zoning vested right under North Carolina General Statute § 160A-385.1. Unless terminated at an earlier date, the zoning vested right shall be valid until ___________." 
6.  All requests for Vested Rights shall be accompanied by a copy of the approved Site-Specific Development Plan (Master Plan), Special Use Permit, Zoning Permit, or Subdivision Preliminary Plan that is not a phased development plan in accordance with the provisions of this Chapter. Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither a variance, a Sketch Plan, nor any other document that fails to describe with reasonable certainty the type and intensity of use for a specified parcel or parcels of property shall constitute a site-specific development plan. 
7.  Following approval or conditional approval of site specific development plan, nothing in this subchapter shall exempt such a plan from subsequent reviews and approvals to ensure compliance with the terms and conditions of the original approval, provided that such reviews and approval are not inconsistent with the original approval. 
8.  Nothing in this subchapter shall prohibit the revocation of the original approval or other remedies for failure to comply with applicable terms and conditions of the approval or the Ordinance. 
C.  Duration 
1.  A zoning right that has been vested as provided in this subchapter shall remain vested for a period of two years unless specifically and unambiguously provided otherwise pursuant to subsection C.2 below. The vesting shall not be extended by any amendments or modifications to a site specific development plan unless expressly provided by the approval authority at the time the amendment or modification is approved. 
2.  Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection C.1 above, the approval authority may provide that rights shall be vested for a period exceeding two years but not exceeding five years where warranted in light of all relevant circumstances, including, but not limited to, the size of the development, the level of investment, the need for or desirability of the development, economic cycles, and market conditions. These determinations shall be in the sound discretion of the approval authority at the time the site specific development plan is approved. 
3.  Upon issuance of a building permit, the expiration provisions of North Carolina General Statute § 160A-418 and the revocation provisions of North Carolina General Statute § 160A-422 shall apply, except that a building permit shall not expire or be revoked because of the running of time while a zoning vested right under this section is outstanding. 
D.  Termination: A zoning right that has been vested as provided in this subchapter shall terminate: 
1.  At the end of the applicable vesting period with respect to buildings and uses for which no valid building permit applications have been filed; 
2.  With the written consent of the affected landowner; 
3.  Upon findings by the Town Board of Commissioners, or by resolution after notice and a public hearing, that natural or manmade hazards on or in the immediate vicinity of the property, if uncorrected, would pose a serious threat to the public health, safety, and general welfare if the project were to proceed as contemplated in the site specific development plan; 
4.  Upon payment to the affected landowner of compensation for all costs, expenses, and other losses incurred by the landowner, including, but not limited to, all fees in consideration of financing, and all architectural, planning, marketing, legal, and other consultant's fees incurred after approval by the town, together with interest thereon at the legal rate until paid. Compensation shall not include any diminution in the value of the property which is caused by such action; 
5.  Upon findings by the Town Board of Commissioners, by ordinance after notice and a hearing that the landowner or his representative intentionally supplied inaccurate information or made material misrepresentations which made a difference in the approval by the approval authority of the site specific development plan; or 
6.  Upon the enactment or promulgation of a state or federal law or regulation that precludes development as contemplated in the site specific development plan, in which case the approval authority may modify the affected provisions, upon a finding that the change in state or federal law has fundamental effect on the plan, or by resolution after notice and hearing. 
E.  Voluntary Annexation 
1.  A petition for annexation filed with the Town under North Carolina General Statute § 160A-31 or North Carolina General Statute § 160A-58.1 shall contain a signed statement declaring whether or not any zoning vested right with respect to the properties subject to petition has been established under North Carolina General Statute § 160A-385.1 or North Carolina General Statute § 160A-344.1, or the failure to sign a statement declaring whether or not a zoning vested right has been established, shall be binding on the landowner and any such zoning vested right shall be determined. 
F.  Limitations 
1.  Nothing in this subchapter is intended or shall be deemed to create any vested right other than those established pursuant to North Carolina General Statute § 160A-385.1. 
G.  Repealer 
1.  In the event that North Carolina General Statute § 160A-385.1 is repealed, this subchapter shall be deemed repealed and the provisions hereof no longer effective.

15.15 - Special Use Permits 
A.  Purpose: Special uses are land uses that are generally compatible with the land uses permitted by right in a zoning district, but which require individual review of their location, design, and configuration so as to evaluate the potential for adverse impacts on adjacent property and uses. Special uses ensure the appropriateness of the use at a particular location within a given zoning district. 
B.  General Requirements: 
1.  Only those uses enumerated as Special Uses in a zoning district shall be authorized by the Board of Commissioners. 
2.  The evaluation and approval of the Special Use Permit shall be governed by quasi-judicial proceedings, which are based upon the sworn testimony and evidence presented at the hearing relevant to the following standards: 
a.  That the proposed use does not affect adversely the general plans for the physical development of the town as embodied in this Ordinance and in any plan or portion thereof adopted by the Board of Commissioners; 
b.  The proposed use will not be contrary to the purposes stated for these regulations; 
c.  The proposed use will not adversely affect the health and safety of residents and workers in the town; 
d.  The proposed use will not be detrimental to the use of development of adjacent properties or other neighborhood uses; 
e.  The proposed use will not be affected adversely by the existing uses; 
f.  The proposed use will be placed on a lot of sufficient size to satisfy the space requirements of the use; 
g.  The proposed use will not constitute a nuisance or hazard because of the number of persons who will attend or use the facility, vehicular movement, noise, or fume generation or type of physical activity; 
h.  The standards set forth for each particular use/project for which a permit may be granted have been met; 
i.  The Board may impose or require such additional restrictions and conditions as may be necessary to protect the health and safety of works and residents in the community, and to protect the value and use of property in the general neighborhood; 
j.  The proposed use shall be subject to the minimum area, setback, and other location requirements of the zoning district in which it will be located; and 
k.  The proposed use shall be subject to the off-street parking and service requirements of these regulations; provided, however, that an approved PUD Plan document may include modifications of such requirements. 
l.  Wherever the Board shall find, in the case of any permit granted pursuant to the provisions of this chapter, that any of the terms, conditions, or restrictions, on which such permit was granted are not being complied, the Board shall rescind and revoke the permit after giving due notice to all parties concerned and granting full opportunity for a public hearing. 
C.  Procedures: 
1.  The processing of a Special Use Permit shall be conducted by the Board of Commissioners. During the public hearing, all parties presenting testimony and evidence shall be duly sworn. Testimony both in favor and against the Special Use Permit application shall be presented and will be considered in formulating the findings-of-fact required for a decision. 
2.  The Board of Commissioners may attach reasonable and appropriate conditions on the location, nature, and extent of the proposed use. The applicant shall have up to 30 calendar days to consider and respond to any additional requirements prior to approval or denial by the Board of Commissioners. 
3.  A notice of each public hearing shall be published in a newspaper of general circulation in the town, at least one time a week for two consecutive weeks prior to the public hearing. 
D.  Effect of Approval: If an application is approved, the Special Use Permit that is established and all conditions which may have been attached to the approval are binding on the property. All subsequent development and use of the property shall be in accordance with the approved plan and conditions. The applicant shall record the approved Special Use Permit with the Register of Deeds and submit a copy to the Town. The authorization of the Board of Commissioners for a Special Use Permit and all supporting documentation shall become a part of the certificate of occupancy. 
E.  Substantial Changes: Any substantial change to a Special Use Permit that results in the increase of the intensity, density, or character of the use shall be approved or denied by the Board of Commissioners as an amended Special Use Permit. Minor field alterations or minor revisions to approved Special Use Permits may be approved by the Administrator if the Special Use still meets the intent of the standards established with the original approval. 
F.  Appeal: The determination of the Board of Commissioners shall be conclusive and final and there shall be no further appeal to the Zoning Board of Adjustment or any other administrative board or commission except the State Superior Court. A request for a review may be made in the same manner as an original request. Evidence in support of the request shall initially be limited to that which is necessary to enable the Board of Commissioners to determine whether there has been a substantial change in the facts, evidence, or conditions in the case. It shall thereupon treat the request in the same manner as the original request. Otherwise, the Board of Commissioners may terminate any further consideration of such request. The Board of Commissioners may, however, review its authorization and the conditions thereof and after such review may modify or change the conditions of the Special Use Permit or may terminate the Special Use Permit only upon agreement with one or more of the criterion set forth in 15.15.G.3, below. Any appeal for administrative review concerning the enforcement of a Special Use Permit shall be to the Board of Commissioners. 
G.  Rescission of Special Use Permits: 
1.  The applicant shall secure a valid building permit within a 12-month period from date of approval of the Special Use Permit unless otherwise specified. 
2.  If such project is not complete and a valid building permit is not in place at the end of the 12-month period, the Administrator shall notify the applicant of either such finding. Within 30 calendar days of said notification, the Administrator shall make a recommendation concerning the rescission of the Special Use Permit to the Board of Commissioners. The Board of Commissioners may then rescind or extend the Special Use Permit, for a specified period of time. 
3.  Other criterion for which a Special Use Permit may be rescinded or terminated shall be as follows: 
a.  Non-compliance with adopted conditions. 
b.  Expressed diminution of value of surrounding properties that may only be found during the evidentiary hearing and made a part of the Findings of Fact. 
c.  Expressed negative impacts related to the general safety, health, and welfare of the surrounding community, which may only be found during the evidentiary hearing and made a part of the Findings of Fact. 
d.  Recorded and repeated Code violations. 
e.  Any non-conformity created by amortization of the permitted use which would only be established as a condition of the permit. 
f.  Any zoning map amendment to a zoning district that would create a nonconformity between the district and associated permit.

15.16 - Administrative Appeals 
A.  Applicability: The Zoning Board of Adjustment shall hear and decide appeals of any order, requirement, decision, interpretation or citation made by the Administrator, or the Technical Review Committee and apply such interpretation to particular fact situations. The Board of Commissioners shall hear such cases involving nonconformities. 
B.  Applicant with Standing: An appeal may be made by any aggrieved party or by any officer, department or board of Wendell who has received a ruling from the Administrator, or the Technical Review Committee, upon the submission of a completed application. An appeal to the Zoning Board of Adjustment and/or the Board of Commissioners shall be made within 30 calendar days from written notice of a final, binding administrative decision. An appeal shall be placed on the Zoning Board of Adjustment and/or the Board of Commissioners agenda within 30 calendar days of filing. The filing of any application stays all proceedings unless the Administrator certifies that a stay in his opinion will cause imminent peril to life or property, or, that because the violation charged is transitory in nature a stay would seriously interfere with enforcement of the Ordinance. In that event, proceedings shall not be stayed except by a restraining order, which may be granted by the Zoning Board of Adjustment, the Board of Commissioners or by a judicial court of law. 
C.  Board Powers and Responsibilities: The Zoning Board of Adjustment and/or the Board of Commissioners may, after having held a public hearing on the matter, reverse or affirm, wholly or partly, or may modify the order, requirement, decision or determination appealed. The Zoning Board of Adjustment and/or the Board of Commissioners shall have all the powers of the Administrator in making any order, requirement, decision, interpretation or determination with reference to an appeal or petition. 
D.  Simple-Majority Required: The concurrent simple-majority vote of three-fifths of the voting members of the Zoning Board of Adjustment and/or the Board of Commissioners shall be necessary to make an interpretation of the Ordinance, reverse any order, requirement, or decision or determination of the Administrator. In all matters coming before the Zoning Board of Adjustment and/or the Board of Commissioners, the applicant shall have the burden of providing clear, competent and material evidence in support of the application. All decisions of the Zoning Board of Adjustment and/or the Board of Commissioners shall be in writing and filed with the Administrator. Every variance decision of the Board of Adjustment and/or the Board of Commissioners shall be subject to review by the Wake County Superior Court. Any appeal to the Wake County Superior Court shall be taken within 30 calendar days after the decision of the Board of Adjustment and/or the Board of Commissioners is filed in the office of the Administrator. The Administrator shall notify they applicant by registered mail within 30 calendar days of the Board of Adjustment's and/or the Board of Commissioners decision. 
E.  Appeals 
1.  Appeals from the enforcement and interpretation of this Ordinance, and requests for conditional uses or variances shall be filed with the Administrator, who shall transmit all such records to the Board of Adjustment and/or the Board of Commissioners. 
2.  It is the intention of this Ordinance that all questions arising in connection with the enforcement of this Ordinance shall be presented first to the Administrator. All appeals from the Administrator's decisions shall be presented to the Board of Adjustment and/or the Board of Commissioners. The Wake County Superior Court provides the next recourse from the Board of Adjustment and/or the Board of Commissioners decisions under this chapter. 
3.  The Board of Adjustment shall fix a reasonable time, not to exceed 60 calendar days for a public hearing on appeals of the decision of the Administrator. A notice of each public hearing shall be published in a newspaper of general circulation in the town, at least one time a week for two consecutive weeks prior to the public hearing. 
4.  An appeal stays all proceedings in furtherance of the action appealed from, unless the Administrator certifies to the Board of Adjustment and/or the Board of Commissioners that, based on the records of the case, a stay would cause damage to life or property, in which case proceedings shall not be stayed otherwise than by an order from the Wake County Superior Court. In those instances where enforcement is not stayed, the appellant may request an expedited hearing. If that request is made, the board must meet within 15 days to hear the appeal. 
15.17 - Variances 
A.  Applicability: When practical difficulties, special conditions or unnecessary hardships would result from carrying out the strict letter of this Ordinance, the Zoning Board of Adjustment shall have the power to vary or modify any of the regulations or provisions of this Ordinance. The Board of Commissioners shall hear such cases involving nonconformities. 
B.  Applicant with Standing: A petition for a variance may be initiated only by the owner of the affected property, an agent authorized in writing to act on the owner's behalf, or a person having a written contractual interest in the affected property upon the submission of a completed application. The filing of any application stays all proceedings unless the Administrator certifies that a stay in his opinion will cause imminent peril to life or property, or, that because the violation charged is transitory in nature a stay would seriously interfere with enforcement of the Ordinance. In that event, proceedings shall not be stayed except by a restraining order, which may be granted by the Zoning Board of Adjustment, Board of Commissioners or by a judicial court of law. 
C.  Required Findings of Fact: The Zoning Board of Adjustment and/or the Board of Commissioners may only grant a variance having first held a public hearing on the matter and having made the following determinations: 
1.  There are unnecessary hardships in the way of carrying out the strict letter of the Ordinance; and 
2.  That the variance is in harmony with the general purpose and intent of this Ordinance and preserves its spirit; and 
3.  That in the granting of the variance, the public safety and welfare have been assured and substantial justice has been done; and 
4.  That the reasons set forth in the application justify the granting of a variance, and that the variance is a minimum one that will make possible the reasonable use of land or structure; and, 
5.  The following are not cause for a variance: 
a.  The citing of other nonconforming or conforming uses of land or structures in the same or other districts. 
b.  The request for a particular use expressly, or by inference, prohibited in the district involved. 
c.  Economic hardship or the fact that property may be utilized more profitably with a variance. 
D.  Board May Apply Conditions to Motion: The Zoning Board of Adjustment and/or the Board of Commissioners, in granting a variance, may prescribe appropriate conditions and safeguards in conformity with this Ordinance. Violation of such conditions and safeguards, when made a part of the terms under which a variance is granted, shall be deemed a violation of this Ordinance and shall be punishable as prescribed in Chapter 18. 
E.

15.18 - Modification of Dimensional Standards 
A.  In keeping with the purpose of these regulations to accomplish coordinated, balanced, and harmonious development in a manner which will best promote the health, safety, and general welfare while avoiding undue and unnecessary hardships, on approval by the Town Manager, the Administrator is authorized to approve requests that deviate from required setbacks set forth in this Ordinance by up to ten percent of the required setbacks or 24 inches, whichever is greater, upon determination that one or more of the following conditions exists: 
1.  There are site or structural conditions that preclude strict adherence to the setback requirements, such as, but not limited to: the lot does not meet the dimensional standards established for the zoning district in which it is located; the lot has topographic limitations that require placement of the structure into the required setback area; or the structure is physically in line with an existing, legally established wall or walls of a principal structure already within the minimum setback area. 
2.  The part of the proposed structure that would encroach into the minimum setback area is less than 50 percent of the width of the affected building facade(s), provided the part of the structure that would encroach into a front setback shall either be open (such as a porch or screen room) or not subject to occupancy (such as a chimney). 
3.  The part of the proposed structure that encroaches into the minimum setback area is necessitated by a life-safety code, flood hazard reduction, Americans with Disabilities Act standard, or other public safety code requirements. 
4.  The proposed structure will allow the preservation of significant existing vegetation. 
5.  A good faith error was made in the location of a building foundation not exceeding one foot due to either field construction or survey error.

Required improvements under this Chapter shall not be installed or constructed until required construction plans have been approved by the Administrator and an order to proceed has been issued. The Town may, in order to serve future development, require the developer to install certain oversized improvements and/or to increase such improvements to a size and/or extent beyond that necessary for the needs created by the developer. In such cases, the Town shall enter into an agreement to reimburse the developer for the oversizing and/or extension based upon rates as agreed to by the Town. 
C.  Infrastructure Design Specifications: All infrastructure shall be designed and installed in accordance with the Wendell Standard Specifications and Details Manual and the City of Raleigh Public Utilities Department's current handbook. 
D.  Phasing: Developments may be designated to be constructed and platted in phases. Provided, however, the Administrator may not approve a phasing plan when in the Administrator's opinion such phasing will not provide for adequate public facilities to support any such phase or phases independent of the overall development plan. In approving phases the Administrator may require that additional streets, water and sewer facilities or other required public facilities be constructed as part of the phase or phases in order to ensure that sufficient public facilities will be in place to support such phase, or phases, independent of any future development. 
E.  Funds in Lieu of Construction: At the option of the developer and with the consent of the Board of Commissioners, a developer may, in lieu of the construction of the portion of a street which crosses over a water course located at the boundary of the development, deposit with the Town the sum sufficient (in the Town's determination) to construct such portion of the street. This option shall not be available when such street connects to an existing street at the boundary of the development or serves as a necessary means of access to a lot within the new development. Funds may be paid in lieu of construction of improvements for minor developments upon approval of the Board of Commissioners. 
17.2 - Street Improvements 
A.  All proposed streets shall be improved with a pavement width and storm drainage section as required for the particular classification of street specified in Chapter 9. 
B.  All grading, pavement and curb and gutter shall be designed and installed in accordance with Town standards and the approved construction plan.

1.  Any existing street segment that has not been accepted for maintenance by either the Town or the North Carolina Department of Transportation, and that is to serve one or more lots created pursuant to these regulations, shall be improved and dedicated to the public, as provided for above, in such a way that the street segment meets the standards of these regulations for the particular classification of street, including right-of-way width. Such street segment shall be directly connected to the existing public street system by way of at least one public street accepted for maintenance by either the Town or the North Carolina Department of Transportation. No development shall be permitted on any street that is an "island" not connected directly to the public street system. 
2.  Where a development fronts on any existing street segment maintained by either the Town or the North Carolina Department of Transportation and the street does not meet the minimum standards of these regulations for the classification of street, the developer shall improve the portion of street adjoining the development to meet the minimum standards including construction and width. When the development adjoins only one side of an existing street, one-half of the minimum right-of-way shall be provided, measured from the centerline of the street. 
3.  The Administrator may require pavement and widening or pavement and widening and curb and gutter and storm drainage for turning lanes along any street that forms a significant entrance to a proposed development where in the opinion of the Administrator such improvements are necessary in order to provide for safe vehicular movement into and out of the proposed development. 
4.  Required pavement and widening, curb and gutter and storm drainage for turning lanes and entrances to new construction along any major thoroughfare shall be installed in accordance with NCDOT standards. 
5.  Where a street is stubbed into adjoining property for future extension and such street serves as the frontage for one or more lots which are not corner lots, the Administrator may require the pavement of a temporary turn-around in a form similar to a cul-de-sac on such street where in the Administrator's opinion such turn-around is necessary for the public convenience, safety and service. 
6.  Streets and sidewalks shall be extended within existing rights-of-way as needed to provide publicly maintained street frontage to all newly created lots; however, construction standards may be modified to coincide with an existing publicly maintained street stub, if applicable. 
E.  Street Names: Proposed streets which are obviously in alignment with other existing streets shall bear the assigned name of the existing street. In no case shall the name for proposed streets duplicate or be phonetically similar to existing street names, irrespective of the use of the suffixes for street, avenue, boulevard, driveway, place, or court. The number of characters for street names shall not exceed 18 characters including the suffix abbreviation and the compass direction abbreviation, if any. Proposed streets names are subject to the approval of the Town prior to being forwarded to Wake County for approval. 
F.  Connection to State Streets 
1.  North Carolina General Statutes 136-102.6 "Compliance of Development Streets with Minimum Standards of the Board of Transportation Required of Developers" requires that new public streets outside the Town limits and changes to existing streets inside the Town limits that are the responsibility of NCDOT be in accordance with the Minimum Right-of-Way and Construction Standards established by the Board of Transportation for acceptance on the State highway system. It is the intent of the UDO standards and requirements, as set forth, to complement and not to conflict with the requirements of NCDOT as stated in NCGS 136-102.6. In all cases the most restrictive limitation or requirement or the requirement causing the highest standard of improvement shall govern. An approved permit is required to connect to any existing state system street.

1.  This method shall not be utilized in any development of individual lots intended for single-family detached dwellings unless the Board of Commissioners determines that floodplain and open space dedication along the watercourse is not in the public interest; that an open channel would not become a missing segment in a system of stormwater piping; and that the open channel is well removed from all anticipated house locations. In such cases the homeowner or a homeowner's association shall be established with authority to provide for maintenance of the easement. 
2.  The drainage maintenance and utility easement shall include the required drainage channel and the land between the channel and the natural 100-year flood contour as determined by the Administrator; or, in some cases, it may be reduced by modifying the drainage maintenance and utility easement topography to a typical required drainage channel section as provided for in subsection 4. However, the minimum total width of a drainage maintenance and utility easement shall be no less than specified below. 
Cubic feet per second in 
100-year storm Drainage maintenance and 
utility easement width 5-16 30 ft., centered 17-70 60 ft., centered 70+ 100 ft., plus width of channel  
The drainage maintenance and utility easement shall be centered on the typical required drainage channel section, unless the Administrator approves other drainage maintenance and utility easement alignments because of topographic conditions. 
3.  In case of severe topography, additional width may be required to assure reasonable ease of maintenance. 
4.  The drainage maintenance and utility easement topography may be modified. In such cases, the approved typical required drainage channel section shall include the necessary channel to accommodate a 100-year flood. The area outside of the required drainage channel may be filled; but any resulting slope shall be no steeper than 3:1, unless the slope is protected by masonry paving, rip rap, or other material which will meet Town specifications. 
5.  Where, in the opinion of the Administrator, suitable access to the drainage maintenance and utility easement is not otherwise provided, access shall be guaranteed by a suitably located access easement which shall be no less than 20 feet in width. 
6.  It shall be the responsibility of the owner to provide maintenance to all streams located on the property as shown on the plat. However, in the event the Board of Commissioners determines that it is in the public interest to alter the typical required drainage channel section and/or profile of the stream in order to improve flow, the Town may enter upon the property within the indicated access and/or drainage maintenance and utility easement and carry out the necessary work without any liability for damage to the property, or improvements thereon, located within the indicated access and/or drainage maintenance and utility easement. 
7.  Drainage maintenance and utility easements (excludes easements for water and sewer facilities owned, operated and maintained by CORPUD) may be utilized for any underground utility provided that: 
a.  Underground utility to be installed by any utility provider other than the Town shall be subject to approval by the Administrator.

    Failure to comply with any provision of this Ordinance is hereby declared unlawful. The following remedies and enforcement powers may be used to administer and enforce this Ordinance and one, all or a combination of the remedies authorized and prescribed by this Chapter may be used. 
A.  Civil Penalty: The Administrator may, in addition to other remedies found in this Chapter, issue civil penalties. 
1.  Penalties for Violation: 
a.  Any person determined to be in violation of any of the provisions of this Ordinance shall receive a warning citation. Such citation shall set out the nature of the violation, the section violated, the date of the violation, and shall contain an order to immediately cease the violation. The warning citation shall specify that a second citation shall incur a civil penalty, together with costs, and attorney fees. 
b.  If the violation is in the nature of an infraction for which an order of abatement would be appropriate in a civil proceeding, a reasonable period of time must be stated in which the violation must be abated. 
c.  Where the Administrator determines that the period of time stated in the original warning citation or consent agreement is not sufficient for abatement based upon the work required, the Administrator may amend the warning citation to provide for additional time. 
d.  Upon failure of the violator to obey the warning citation, a civil citation shall be issued by the Administrator and either served directly on the violator, his duly designated agent, or registered agent if a corporation, either in person or posted in the United States Postal Service by first class mail addressed to the last known address of the violator as contained in the records of the Town or County property tax records or obtained from the violator at the time of issuance of the warning citation. The violator shall be deemed to have been served upon the mailing of said citation. The citation shall direct the violator to pay the civil assessment within 15 calendar days of the date of the citation. 
e.  The violation for which the citation is issued must have been corrected by the time the citation is paid otherwise further citations shall be issued. Citations may be issued for each calendar day the offense continues until the prohibited activity is ceased or abated. 
f.  Civil penalties shall be in the amount of $100.00 for each violation and each calendar day any single violation continues shall be a separate violation. 
g.  The owner, tenant, or occupant of any building or land or part thereof or any person who participates in or acts in concert, assists, directs, creates, or maintains any condition found to be a violation shall be subject to the penalties and remedies herein provided. 
2.  Failure to Pay: If the civil penalty is not paid within 15 calendar days of the issuance of a citation, the Town may initiate a civil action in the nature of a debt collection to recover the penalty, costs, attorney fees, and such other relief as permitted by law. Such action shall be in the amount of $100.00 for each violation and each calendar day any single violation continues shall be a separate violation and shall not stop further civil penalties from accruing if the violation has not been corrected. 
3.  Civil Citations not Exclusive: Civil penalties are an additional remedy for code enforcement. In addition thereto, all remedies allowed in North Carolina General Statutes and this Ordinance may also be pursued by the Town at the same time without waiving the civil penalties authorized in this Chapter. 
4.  Appeal of determination of violation: 
a.  A person notified of a violation may appeal such determination to the Board of Adjustment. Such appeal shall be filed in writing with the Town not later than ten work days after the receipt of the first notice issued. Failure to file a timely appeal shall constitute acceptance of the determination that a violation exists. If an appeal is filed, further action by the Administrator shall be suspended until a ruling is issued by the Board of Adjustment. 
b.  The Board shall only have power in the manner of administrative review and interpretation where it is alleged that the Administrator has made an error in the application of the Ordinance, in the factual situation as it relates to the application of the Ordinance, or both. 
c.  If the Board finds that a violation exists, enforcement under this Chapter shall continue despite any further appeals by the violator. The fact that an appeal has been filed or ruled upon by the BOA shall not prevent the Town from pursuing other enforcement remedies allowed by law on the same violation.. 
B.  Criminal: Pursuant to North Carolina General Statute 14-4, any person, firm, or corporation convicted of violating the provisions of this Ordinance shall, upon conviction, be guilty of a misdemeanor and shall be fined an amount consistent with the General Statutes. 
C.  Equitable Remedy: In addition to the civil penalties set out above, any provision of this Ordinance may be enforced by an appropriate equitable remedy issuing from a court of competent jurisdiction. The Administrator may apply to a judicial court of law for any appropriate equitable remedy to enforce the provisions of this Ordinance. It is not a defense to the Administrator's application for equitable relief that there are other remedies provided under general law or this Ordinance. 
D.  Injunction: In addition to the civil penalties set out above, enforcement of the provisions of this Ordinance may also be achieved by injunction. When a violation occurs, the Administrator may, either before or after the initiation of other authorized action, apply to the appropriate division of the court for a mandatory or prohibitory injunction commanding the defendant to correct the unlawful condition or cease the unlawful use of the property. The action shall be governed in all respect by the laws and rules governing civil proceedings, including the Rules of Civil Procedure in general and Rule 65 in particular. 
E.  Order of Abatement: In addition to an injunction, the Administrator may apply for and the court may enter into an order of abatement as part of the judgment in the case. An order of abatement may direct any of the following actions: 
1.  Buildings or other structures on the property be closed, demolished, or removed; 
2.  Fixtures, furniture or other moveable property be moved or removed entirely; 
3.  Improvements alterations, modifications or repairs be made; or 
4.  Any other action be taken that is necessary to bring the property into compliance with this Ordinance. 
F.  Execution of Court Decisions: If the defendant fails or refuses to comply with an injunction or with an order of abatement within the time allowed by the court, the defendant may be cited for contempt. The Administrator may execute the order of abatement and will have a lien on the property in the nature of a mechanic's and materialman's lien for the cost of executing the order. The defendant may secure cancellation of an order of abatement by paying all costs of the proceedings and by posting a bond for compliance with the order. The bond must be given with sureties approved by the Clerk of Superior Court in an amount approved by the judge before whom the matter was heard and shall be conditioned for the defendant's full compliance with the terms of the order of abatement within the time fixed by the judge. Cancellation of an order of abatement does not suspend or cancel an injunction issued in conjunction with the order. 
G.  Stop Work Order Issuance and Revocation of Permits: Whenever a building, structure or part thereof is being constructed, demolished, renovated, altered, or repaired in material violation of any applicable provision of this Ordinance, the Administrator may order the specific part of the work that is in violation, or would be when the work is completed, to be immediately stopped. The stop work order shall be in writing, directed to the person doing the work, and shall state the specific work to be stopped, the specific reasons for cessation and the action(s) necessary to lawfully resume work. 
    The Administrator may revoke any permit (e.g., Building Certificate of Occupancy) by written notification to the permit holder when violations of this Ordinance have occurred. Permits may be revoked when false statements or misrepresentations were made in securing the permit, work is being or has been done in substantial departure from the approved application or plan, there has been a failure to comply with the requirements of this Ordinance, or a permit has been mistakenly issued in violation of this Ordinance.

For the most part, this conventional definition of zoning still applies, but recent innovations in special (or conditional) use districts and overlay districts have begun to blur some of the ordinance's neatness and clarity. 
    Zoning Districts means a section of a town designated in the zoning ordinance text and (usually) delineated on the zoning map, in which requirements for the use of land and building and development standards are prescribed. 
    Zoning Map means the map delineating the boundaries of districts which, along with the zoning text, comprises the zoning ordinance.

I. - Purpose and Legislative Intent. 
    The purpose of this Wireless Telecommunications Ordinance is to provide for the public health, safety and welfare by ensuring that residents, businesses and public safety operations in the Town of Wendell have reliable access to wireless telecommunications networks and state of the art mobile broadband communications services while also ensuring that this objective is accomplished according to the Town of Wendell's zoning, planning and design standards. To accomplish the above stated objectives and to ensure that the placement, construction or modification of wireless telecommunications facilities complies with all applicable federal laws, including without limitation Section 6409 of the federal Middle Class Tax Relief and Job Creation Act of 2012, Pub. L. No. 112-96, which, among other things, creates a national wireless emergency communications network for use by first responders that in large measure will be dependent on facilities placed on existing wireless communications support structures, the Town adopts this single, comprehensive, wireless telecommunications ordinance. 
    The Town of Wendell finds that Wireless Telecommunications Facilities may pose concerns to the health, safety, public welfare, character and environment to the Town and its inhabitants, including but not limited to adjacent and nearby property owners. The Town also recognizes that facilitating the development of wireless service technology can be an economic development asset to the Town and of significant benefit to the Town and its residents. In order to assure that the placement, construction or modification of Wireless Telecommunications Facilities is consistent with the Town's land use policies, the Town is adopting a single, comprehensive, Wireless Telecommunications Facilities application and permitting process.
