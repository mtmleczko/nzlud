PREFACE 
    This Code constitutes a recodification of the general and permanent ordinances of the City of Elmira, New York. 
    Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the 1973 Code as supplemented through January 21, 1997, and ordinances subsequently adopted by the city council. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this Code, the reader can locate any section of the 1973 Code, as supplemented, and any subsequent ordinance included herein. 
    The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order, and the various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Notes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state law have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this Code. 
Chapter and Section Numbering System 
    The chapter and section numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and local government codes. Each section number consists of two parts separated by a dash. The figure before the dash refers to the chapter number, and the figure after the dash refers to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the second section of chapter 1 is numbered 1-2, and the first section of chapter 6 is 6-1. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter, and at the same time new sections can be inserted in their proper place by using the decimal system for amendments. For example, if new material consisting of one section that would logically come between sections 6-1 and 6-2 is desired to be added, such new section would be numbered 6-1.5. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject. The next successive number shall be assigned to the new article or division. New chapters may be included by using one of the reserved chapter numbers. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. 
Page Numbering System 
    The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the volume. The number to the right of the colon represents the number of the page in that portion. In the case of a chapter of the Code, the number to the left of the colon indicates the number of the chapter. In the case of an appendix to the Code, the letter immediately to the left of the colon indicates the letter of the appendix. The following are typical parts of codes of ordinances, which may or may not appear in this Code at this time, and their corresponding prefixes:

Indexes 
    The indexes have been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the indexes themselves which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which the user is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
    A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up to date. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited, and the affected page or pages will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
    Keeping this publication up to date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. As revised pages are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
Acknowledgments 
    This publication was under the direct supervision of Alyce A. Whitson, Senior Code Attorney, and D. J. Heath, Editor, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida. Credit is gratefully given to the other members of the publisher's staff for their sincere interest and able assistance throughout the project. 
    The publisher is most grateful to John J. Ryan, Corporation Counsel, and Marisa Weisenfluh, Assistant to the Corporation Counsel, for their cooperation and assistance during the progress of the work on this publication. It is hoped that their efforts and those of the publisher have resulted in a Code of Ordinances which will make the active law of the city readily accessible to all citizens and which will be a valuable tool in the day-to-day administration of the city's affairs.

ARTICLE IV. - CITY OFFICERS; GENERAL POWERS AND DUTIES[5] 

Footnotes: 
--- (5) --- 
Editor's note- Plan "C" of the Optional City Government Law, L. 1914, ch. 444, adopted by Elmira in May, 1932, limits the powers of the mayor. It divests him of his powers of veto and appointment. However he is still titular head of the city, may bring investigations into city affairs and subpoena witnesses, retains custody of the city seal, signs all city contracts and authenticates acts of the council. The majority of executive and administrative powers of the city are vested in a city manager appointed and removable by the council. 

Sec. 31. - [Mayor; power and duties.] 
    The mayor of the City of Elmira shall be the chief executive officer thereof, and shall, when present, preside at all meetings of the common council. It shall be his duty to take care that within said city the laws of the state and ordinances and bylaws passed by the common council be faithfully executed, and to arrest or cause the arrest of all persons violating the same and to exercise a constant supervision over the conduct of all subordinate officers, to receive and examine all complaints against them for misconduct or neglect of duty, and to report the facts to the common council; to recommend to the common council, from time to time, such measures as he shall deem necessary or expedient for them to adopt; to cause to be carried out all orders, resolutions and ordinances resolved upon by the common council, and in general to maintain the peace and good order of said city. It shall be his duty to approve or disapprove all bills, orders, resolutions and ordinances or acts which shall have passed the common council; and if he approves, he shall endorse his approval thereon in writing and sign such approval, and if he disapproves, he shall return such transcript to the common council or the clerk thereof with his objections in writing, which shall be filed with the clerk, and the common council shall at its next meeting thereafter proceed to reconsider such bills, resolutions, orders, ordinances or acts thus disapproved; and if the same shall be passed by two-thirds of all members of the common council then in office, the same shall have full force and effect, notwithstanding the objection of the mayor. If any such transcript shall not be returned by the mayor to the common council or clerk within five days after the passage thereof, Sundays excepted, such ordinance, resolution, bill, order or act shall have full force and effect in like manner as if duly approved by the mayor, unless the term of office of the mayor shall expire within five days, in which case such order, resolution, bill, ordinance or act shall have no force. When a bill, order, ordinance, resolution or act for the payment of money or otherwise contains several items, or embraces more than one distinct subject the mayor may approve the provisions relating to one or more items or one or more subjects and disapprove the others. In such case those items or subjects which he shall approve become effective, and those which he shall not approve shall be reconsidered by the common council and shall only become effective if again passed by it as above provided; and the foregoing provision in reference to approval and disapproval and failure to return any ordinance or resolution within five days after the receipt of the same, shall be applicable to and govern such cases. The mayor shall have power summarily to hear, try and determine any complaint against any appointive officers of said city for misconduct or neglect of duty, and to suspend said officers until the next meeting of the common council. He shall also have power summarily to revoke any license of any hackman, cartman or for the exhibition of any show. The mayor of the city may hear in a summary way, any complaint for any violations of the laws of the state, or of the ordinances of the common council, against any person to whom a license of any description may have been granted in pursuance of this act, and may compel the attendance of witnesses on the hearing of such complaint, in the same manner as justice of the peace in the trial of civil causes, and on such hearing may annul such license or suspend the same for any certain time. Every determination on such complaint shall be forthwith filed with the city clerk, who shall serve a certified copy thereof on the person holding the license affected by such determination, either personally or by leaving the same at his or her usual place of abode or business, and from the time of such service such license shall be deemed to be annulled or suspended according to the tenor of such determination [sic], until the same shall be reversed by the common council. At least twenty-four hours' notice of the time and place of hearing such complaint shall be served on the person complained of, and such person may appeal from the determination of the mayor within forty-eight hours after the same shall have been made to the common council, by filing the appeal with the clerk and stating the grounds thereof, and said common council shall have [the] power to reverse or affirm the same, but such appeal shall not suspend or in any manner affect such determination until the decision of the common council thereon. The mayor shall sign all appointments made by the common council and all orders passed by the common council for the payment of money by the city chamberlain, and shall on behalf of the city, sign all deeds and contracts made by it, and shall cause to be affixed thereto the city seal of which he shall have the custody. The mayor shall have authority at all times to examine the books and papers of any officer, employee or department of the city, and as often as he may deem proper, to appoint one or more competent persons to examine, without notice, the accounts of any city officer or department, and the money, securities and property belonging to the city in the possession or charge of any officer or department, and to report the result of such examination; and he may administer oaths to witnesses and take affidavits in all cases relating to the affairs of the city. The mayor shall have power to employ an attorney to aid him in the discharge of his duties, whenever, in his opinion, the interests of the city require it, who shall be paid a reasonable compensation. He shall have power to appoint a mayor's clerk and prescribe his duties, and fix his compensation. He may call special meetings of the common council, and shall appoint all standing committees of the common council. He is also empowered to enter any house or building which he has cause to suspect to be a gambling house, or to be inhabited by persons of ill fame, or to which persons of dissolute, idle or disorderly character resort, and disperse the same, or arrest such persons, and hold them until they can be dealt with before some proper magistrate according to [the] law. He shall have power to administer oaths and take affidavits, and to take proof and acknowledgment of deeds within said city and receive therefor the same fees that are allowed justices of the peace for the same services. In case the mayor shall be unable to perform the duties of his office, in consequence of sickness, disability or continued absence from the city, or if there shall be a vacancy in the office, the common council shall, except as otherwise provided in this act, appoint, by ballot, one of their number, to preside at their meetings, and the presiding officer thus chosen shall be vested with all the powers and perform all the duties of the mayor of the city, until the mayor shall resume his office, or the vacancy shall be supplied according to law, but it shall not be lawful for the presiding officer thus chosen, when acting as mayor, to nominate or appoint any person to office unless the sickness, disability or absence of the mayor shall have continued at least sixty days. The mayor of the City of Elmira shall possess all the power and authority conferred upon mayors of cities by any general statute of the state; he shall have power to apprehend and arrest any person who shall within his view in said city, be guilty of any criminal act, or of any violation of the laws or statutes of this state; he may also upon complaint being made to him under oath, issue a warrant to the chief of police or any police officer of the City of Elmira to arrest any person charged with crime or misdemeanor, or with any violation of any of the laws or statutes of said state within said city and bring such person for examination or trial either before him, the said mayor, or before the recorder or acting recorder. Any such warrant may be executed by any officer to whom it is directed at any place within the state. If such process shall be made returnable before the recorder, such officer, upon the same being returned to him, or the prisoner arrested by virtue thereof, being brought before him, shall take and acquire jurisdiction of the subject matter and proceed with the case to the same extent and in the same manner in all respects as if such process had been originally issued by him. Whenever any person shall be arrested by the mayor of said city for an offense committed within his view, or by process originally returnable before him, he may, by an order in writing, transfer the case to the recorder, who shall thereupon take and acquire jurisdiction and proceed with such case in the same manner and to the same extent as if such person had been arrested on such process originally issued by him, or the said mayor may in such case proceed to examine such person and commit him for trial to answer the charge against him or discharge him according to law. If the offense charged is by law triable in a court of special sessions of the peace, the mayor may proceed to hold a mayor's court of special sessions to try such person or persons, and all provisions of law applicable to courts of special sessions shall extend and apply to such mayor's court. All process for the summoning of jurors or witnesses in such court may be served or executed by the chief of police, or any constable or police officer of said city. The mayor shall receive the sum of five thousand dollars per year for his services.

Editor's note- Plan "C" of the Optional City Government Law, L. 1914, ch. 444, adopted by Elmira in May 1932, vests all the powers and duties of the assessors in the council; providing however, that the council may by ordinance, provide for an assessor or assessors who shall succeed to and perform such duties in place of the council. 

Sec. 49. - Powers and duties of assessor. 
a.  The assessor appointed in the City of Elmira shall perform all the duties herein specified in relation to the assessment of property within said city, for the purpose of levying the taxes imposed by the Board of Legislators of the County of Chemung, by the council of said city and by the Elmira City School District. The assessor shall receive for compensation for services rendered under this act, or pursuant to any statute, an annual salary to be fixed by the council. The said assessor shall possess all the powers and authority of town assessors and shall prepare an assessment roll of all property within the city. In the assessment of any real property in said city for any purpose, it shall be sufficient to state the name of one of the owners of said land, last known owner or reputed owner, together with such description of said land as shall identify the parcel of land assessed together with the assessed value of such real property; and in case the name of an owner cannot after reasonable inquiry be found, it shall be sufficient to write in the first column the name of the last known owner. No mistake in the name of an owner or occupant shall invalidate the assessment. No assessment hereafter made by said assessor shall be invalid because the same may be made out in terms against an owner, or against a company, or firm name or against a person in whom is the record title, though not the actual title, of the property, or for any cause arising through ignorance or mistake as to the name of the owner or owners of the property assessed, whether individual or a corporation, provided that such property is sufficiently described on the assessment-roll to identify and indicate the particular property which it was intended to assess. 
    The assessor shall file a copy of each published official notice, which the assessor is by law required to give or publish and shall keep the same at all times properly indexed. Every subdivision map within the city, showing a subdivision of such lands into blocks or lots for residential, commercial or industrial development purposes shall, before it is filed in the office of the clerk of the County of Chemung, or in any City office, be presented to said assessor and a copy thereof filed in the office of the assessor and the said original map or plot shall be stamped by the assessor. During the time fixed for reviewing the assessment roll, the assessor may add to or insert therein any property liable to taxation and the assessment thereof which may have been omitted or wrongfully assessed in the first preparation of the roll after giving three days' personal notice to the owner or his/her agent, and may make such other corrections as may be proper on application of any person aggrieved. 
b.  The notice required by section 506 of the real property tax law shall be given as provided herein, and the notice shall be posted in accordance with said section 506 and shall be published in the official newspaper of the city and shall designate a public office as the place where the assessor and/or his/her representative will sit to review the assessment and where said tax roll may be seen and examined. Such notice shall also state the time and place of the first meeting of the board of assessment appeals which shall be on the third Tuesday of July in the office of the city manager, at city hall. The taxable status date shall be June first and the tentative completion of the tax roll shall be on or before July first. 
    A board of assessment appeals is hereby constituted to consist of not less than three nor more than five members appointed by the city council. The appointed members shall have a knowledge of property values in the city and neither the assessor nor any member of that staff may be appointed to the board. The city manager shall appoint a secretary to take minutes of the board meetings. The appointed members shall serve for a term of five years. Each member shall be compensated, in the amount of fifty dollars per day for attendance at meetings. 
    The board shall attend and set at the time and place designated in the notice pursuant to section 506, for the purpose of reviewing all unresolved written complaints filed under oath with the assessor at any time prior to the hearing of the board of assessment appeals or with the board of assessment appeals at such hearing. Complaints may not be filed with the board of assessment appeals at any adjourned hearing it may conduct. 
    The board may require the person whose property is assessed, or his agent or his representative or any other person to appear before the board and be examined concerning such complaint and produce any papers relating to such assessment. If the person whose real property is assessed or his agent or his representative shall willfully neglect or refuse to attend and be so examined or to answer any material questions put to him, such person shall not be entitled to any reduction in assessment subject to the complaint. 
    The secretary shall take minutes of the examination of every person upon the hearing of a complaint and same shall be filed in the assessor's office. 
    The board shall determine after hearing a grievance the particular assessment and same shall be determined by a majority vote which must be entered on the record. The assessor must forthwith make such corrections or changes in such rolls as may be directed by the resolution adopted by a majority vote of the board. 
    Following the final completion and correction of such rolls, the assessor shall verify the same according to law and the rolls shall be filed on or before August tenth and notice must be published in the official newspaper of the city; a copy of the assessment roll shall remain on file in the office of the city clerk until the first day of October.

Sec. 50. - [Correction of assessment-roll by council.] 
    The common council is vested hereby with the exclusive power to correct the assessment-roll of said city in respect to taxes imposed by virtue of this act in the same manner as a board of supervisors may by law correct the town rolls of their county, and shall have and possess all the powers in relation to the correction or otherwise of such city assessment-rolls that boards of supervisors have or may have by statute in the case of town assessment-rolls and town or county taxes. The chief assessor shall correct all clerical errors in the description or valuation of property in said roll under the direction of the common council and make an exact and correct copy of the assessment-roll so made and corrected as aforesaid, and certify the same to be correct, and deliver the same to one of the supervisors of the said city on or before the fifteenth day of November in each year, which shall be presented and delivered by him to the board of supervisors of Chemung county, as and for the town roll of said city. Nothing in this section contained shall be construed to prevent the said board of supervisors from exercising in respect to the assessment-roll of said city so delivered to them, or the taxes imposed by them thereby, the same powers as are vested in boards of supervisors in respect to town assessment-rolls and town and county taxes, or any correction thereof. 
a.  Whenever it shall appear to the assessors of said city that any land or property of any kind liable to taxation therein has been omitted, stricken, erased or taken from the assessment-roll of said city of the next preceding year by reason of mistake or accident, it shall be the duty of the said assessors to assess and enter the said land or property in the assessment-roll of the current year as [ sic ] its value the said preceding year, as such value may be determined by them in a separate column from the valuation of the current year. 
b.  The common council, upon the petition of one or more of said assessors, stating that such land or property was omitted or taken from any assessment-roll of said year by reason of mistake or accident, shall enter and insert the same in the assessment-roll of the current year, and shall proceed to levy a tax upon the same at the rate per centum of the tax imposed on such property in said city in said preceding year, and shall, upon a like petition stating that any such land or property has been omitted, stricken, erased or taken from the assessment-roll of the current year by reason of mistake or accident, enter and insert the same in the said assessment-roll, and correct the same accordingly at its proper value as may be determined by them, and tax the same at the rate per centum of the said current year. The common council may perform the like acts upon any proper proof authorizing the same in the absence of such petition. The whole tax levied upon such land or property omitted or taken from the tax levy of the preceding year as aforesaid, shall be deducted from the aggregate of taxation to be levied upon said city for the current year before such tax is levied, and the same shall be collected in the same manner as the other taxes imposed in said city for the current year are collected. The common council of said city, or the mayor thereof, for the purpose aforesaid, and the said assessors for the purpose of the assessment of property, shall have the power and it shall be their duty to ask and demand of and from any bank or other corporation in said city in which the shares of stock thereof are liable to taxation, a true statement in writing, signed by one of the officers thereof, stating the amount of the capital stock thereof, the number of shares held by each person, naming them, and the amount and the value thereof respectively. The said bank or other corporation shall, within three days thereafter, furnish and deliver to the said common council or mayor and assessors the statement aforesaid, and in case of their neglect or refusal so to do within the time aforesaid, shall each so refusing by neglecting be liable to a penalty therefor of fifty dollars, and the further penalty of twenty-five dollars for each and every day so neglecting or refusing. 
c.  Whenever by the final judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction it appears to the common council that any property heretofore or hereafter liable to taxation in any year was erroneously or illegally assessed, and that by reason of such erroneous or illegal assessment such property did not become subject to taxation for such year or years, the common council shall place the same on the roll of the current year at the valuation thereof, if any, fixed by the assessors for the year or years respectively when such property was erroneously or illegally assessed; and in case no valuation was fixed by the assessors, such property shall be assessed by the common council at such a valuation as they may determine for such year or years. Before fixing such valuation the common council shall give to the owners of such property, at the time of the assessment by the common council, a notice of at least five days and an opportunity to be heard, and on such hearing the board shall have, as to such property, all the powers of the assessors of a tax district in reviewing and correcting an assessment roll. Such property shall be taxed at the rate per centum of such preceding year or years. The whole amount of tax on property levied in pursuance of this section shall be deducted from the aggregate of taxation to be levied on the tax district for the current year, before such tax is levied.

The presence in the budget as finally adopted of an item or items that may be adjudged by a court of competent jurisdiction to be illegal shall not vitiate the remaining portions of the budget or any tax levied in pursuance thereof.

They may summon or cause to be summoned any person in said city to appear and testify as a witness in such proceedings before them. Such summons may be subscribed by such commissioners or either of them and served in the same manner as subpoenas in criminal cases. Such witnesses shall not be entitled to fees, and for a refusal to appear and testify shall be liable to be attached and to be punished as for a contempt, by the court appointing such commissioners. They shall give public notice by a notice published daily for five days in one of the daily papers published in said city of the time when, and the place where, they will meet to enter upon their duties.

    The court must, upon the application of the plaintiff, grant a second or subsequent adjournment of the trial of the action, upon proof, by his own oath or otherwise, to the satisfaction of the court, that he cannot safely proceed, for want of some material testimony or witness, and that he has used due diligence to obtain the testimony or witness. But the court may, as a condition of granting such adjournment, require that the plaintiff pay to the defendant the legal fees of defendant's witnesses duly subpoenaed for that day, and not exceeding two dollars in addition thereto, or such part of such additional sum as may be just.

Sec. 117. - [Pleadings, verification, how made.] 
    The complaint may be verified in the manner provided by the code of civil procedure for the verification of pleadings in courts of record, and in an action commenced by summons may, at the option of the plaintiff or his attorney, be served therewith. When the complaint is so verified, the subsequent pleadings excepting a demurrer, shall be likewise verified in all cases in which such pleading would require to be verified in a court of record in default whereof they shall be disregarded. Where the complaint is so verified and a copy of the same is served with the summons, and the defendant fails to answer said complaint as hereinbefore provided, at the time of the return of said summons, he shall be deemed to have admitted the allegations of the complaint as true, and the court shall, upon filing the summons and complaint, with due proof of the service thereof, enter judgment for the said plaintiff and against the defendant, for the amount demanded in such complaint, with costs, without further proof. The city judge may, by general rule or otherwise, require any pleading made orally to be reduced to writing, and every pleading in writing shall be subscribed by the party making the same or his attorney, and shall be filed forthwith, or within such time as the said city judge may designate.

Sec. 120. - [Defaults.] 
    In actions in said court the city judge shall have power to open defaults and set aside judgments rendered and entered therein, and executions issued thereon, upon such terms as may be just, in a case where either party shall fail to appear on the return day of the process, or on any adjourned day, and the party in default satisfactorily excuses his default, but no greater terms shall be imposed than the payment of the costs included in the judgment, and the sum of three dollars for opposing the motion. The application therefor shall be founded upon affidavits, and shall be made within twenty days from the entry of such judgment. Upon presentation of such application, the city judge shall issue an order returnable in not less than five days nor more than eight days requiring the party in whose favor judgment was rendered to show cause, if any, why said judgment should not be set aside. A copy of said order and of the papers upon which the same is granted, shall be served upon the party in whose favor judgment was rendered, or his attorney, if one shall have appeared in the action, not less than three days prior to the return day thereof. Pending such application and the determination thereof, the city judge may stay proceedings upon such judgment or any execution which shall have been issued. When a judgment shall be set aside, the action shall proceed as though no judgment had been rendered. The judgment, or an execution issued thereon by the city judge, and levy made thereunder, may, in the discretion of the city judge, be allowed to stand as a security for the satisfaction of any judgment the plaintiff may finally recover. Parties moving in the county court to open default or to obtain a new trial in said city court, in cases where a motion might have been made in said city court, as in this section provided, shall show that no such application was made in said court.

(L. 1906, ch. 477, § 124) 
Sec. 125. - [Additional allowance in certain action.] 
    In an action in which a trial is had and judgment rendered for two hundred and fifty dollars or more, the city judge may, in his discretion, grant to the successful party an additional allowance of costs, not exceeding ten dollars. All costs and disbursements allowed to be taxed in any action or proceeding before justices of the peace in towns up to but not exceeding fifteen dollars, shall be included in the judgment as disbursements in addition to the costs hereinbefore provided, but in actions within the jurisdiction of justices of the peace of towns such disbursements shall not exceed the limits prescribed by section thirty hundred and seventy-six of the code of civil procedure for justices.

And no such service shall be rendered by either of them until such fee shall have been paid therefor. In the case provided for in section thirty hundred and eighty-one of the code of civil procedure recovery shall be had from the City of Elmira instead of the city judge.

Editor's note- Plan "C" of the Optional City Government Law, L. 1914, ch. 444, adopted by Elmira in May 1932, provides that judicial officers, if elective, are so continued, but if under the city Charter they are appointive, their appointment shall be by the council. Pursuant to article 6, section 17, of the New York State Constitution, recorder's court is now part of the New York State Unified Court System. 

Sec. 136. - [Recorder, oath, bond, salary, vacation.] 
    Each recorder and acting recorder of said city before entering upon the duties of his office, shall take and file with the city clerk the oath of office prescribed by law for judicial officers, and a bond in such penalty and with such sureties as the common council of said city shall decide and approve, for the faithful discharge of his duties as recorder, or acting recorder, according to the provisions of this act. The common council shall provide a suitable office for the recorder of said city. It shall be the duty of the recorder to attend at such office between the hours of nine o'clock in the forenoon and twelve o'clock at noon, and between the hours of two o'clock and five o'clock in the afternoon of each day, except Sundays, legal holidays, and the period of his vacation, and to hear such matters, issue such processes and institute such proceedings as the proper administration of justice requires, in accordance with the powers and jurisdiction hereinafter conferred upon him. The recorder of said city hereafter elected shall be an attorney and counselor at law of the supreme court of the State of New York, and shall receive an annual salary of twenty-four hundred dollars, less such deductions as shall be made by the common council therefrom as hereinafter provided, which shall be paid to him in equal monthly installments by the city chamberlain of said city upon the first day of each month upon written orders signed by the mayor and city clerk. There shall be allowed to the said recorder a vacation of thirty days in each year of his term, for which number of days no deduction shall be made in his salary. Such vacation may be taken in consecutive days or otherwise at different times during the year, as the recorder may elect, and it shall be his duty to specify in his monthly report to the common council whether any day or days on which he has failed to perform the duties of his office in the preceding month were taken by him either as a whole or any part of said vacation; but nothing in this section shall be construed as allowing to the said recorder more than thirty days' vacation in any year of his term by reason of his failure to take the full number of thirty days in any preceding year thereof. With the exception of the time herein allowed as a vacation, the recorder shall not be paid for such time as he fails to perform the duties of his office as hereinafter provided, and the ratable proportion shall be deducted from his salary because of any such failure to perform his duties, and such deductions shall be paid by the city chamberlain upon written orders signed by the mayor and city clerk to the acting recorder, hereafter provided for, who acted during such period. The recorder and acting recorder shall each report to the common council at the first regular meeting thereof in each month, the time, if any, during which the recorder shall have failed in the next preceding month to attend to the duties of his office, as aforesaid, and the time, if any, during which the acting recorder shall have acted in the place of the recorder, as hereinafter provided in the next preceding month. The recorder may be removed from office in the same manner as a justice of the peace, as provided by title two of part three of the code of criminal procedure, and the constitution of the State of New York.

Sec. 137. - [Jurisdiction and powers of recorder.] 
    The recorder of said city shall in all criminal actions and proceedings and special proceedings of a criminal nature for or on account of offenses committed or charged to have been committed within said city, have all the jurisdiction and the authority which a justice of the peace of any town would have, if such an offense were committed or charged to have been committed in such town, except in proceedings respecting bastards, exclusive of any other officer except the mayor of said city and judges and justices of the courts of record, and such other jurisdiction as is hereinafter granted. The said recorder shall have power to let to bail all persons charged with crime before him in all cases of felony, when imprisonment in the state prison, on conviction for such felony cannot exceed five years, and shall also have the power to take bail as is conferred upon sergeants and captains of police by section five hundred and fifty-four of the code of criminal procedure by the deposit of money or personal property, as is in that section provided. He shall also have the power and authority as a justice of the peace within the county of Chemung, to administer oaths and take affidavits and acknowledgments. The said recorder shall have jurisdiction and authority to hear, try and determine summarily and without a jury all charges and complaints against persons for disorderly conduct in said city, as defined by this act, or of such conduct in said city as constitutes such persons, tramps, vagrants or disorderly persons as defined either by this act or by the statutes of this state. Whenever any person shall be brought before said recorder, either with or without warrant, charged with being such a tramp, if said recorder is satisfied by the confession of such person or by competent evidence upon such summary trial that such person is such tramp, the said recorder shall thereupon have jurisdiction and authority to render judgment convicting such person thereof and imposing such sentence therefor as is provided by law. Whenever any person is brought before such recorder, either with or without warrant, charged with such disorderly conduct, or with being either such tramp, such vagrant or such disorderly person, if said recorder shall be satisfied by the confession of such person or by competent evidence, upon such summary trial, that such person has been guilty of such disorderly conduct, or is such vagrant or disorderly person, the said recorder may thereupon take such further proceedings thereon, as a magistrate is authorized by the code of criminal procedure to take in such case; or the said recorder may, instead, render judgment convicting such person of disorderly conduct or of being a vagrant or disorderly person as the case may be, and that he pay a fine not exceeding fifty dollars or be imprisoned not exceeding six months, or both, as the case may require, which judgment shall be enforced in the same manner in all respects as judgments of courts of special sessions are enforced. 
(L. 1906, ch. 477, § 137) 
Sec. 138. - [Courts of special sessions.] 
    The recorder is hereby empowered to hold courts of special sessions in said city. Subject to the powers of removal provided for in sections fifty-seven and fifty-eight of the code of criminal procedure, courts of special sessions held by said recorder shall have, in the first instance, exclusive jurisdiction to hear, try and determine all charges of misdemeanor committed within said city, and also all charges of misdemeanors committed by violations of the charter of the City of Elmira, or by violation of the ordinances or regulations promulgated pursuant to this act. Courts of special sessions held by said recorder shall also (subject to removal as provided by sections fifty-seven and fifty-eight of the code of criminal procedure) have jurisdiction to hear, try and determine charges of misdemeanor committed as follows: Committed partly within and partly without said city, or when the acts, omissions or effects thereof, which constitute or are requisite to the consummation of such misdemeanor, occur partly within and partly without said city; committed in this state, in or on board of any railway engine, train or car making a passage or trip on or over any railway in this state, or in respect to any portion of the lading or freightage of any such railway engine, train or car in case such railway engine, train or car passes or has passed in the course of the same passage or trip through said city, or any part thereof, or where such passage or trip terminates in said city, or would terminate in said city if completed. Otherwise than as hereinbefore provided, courts of special sessions held by said recorder shall not have jurisdiction to hear, try or determine charges of misdemeanor not committed within said city. When a person shall be convicted by a court of special sessions, held by said recorder, of any misdemeanor of which such court has jurisdiction, the court of special sessions held by said recorder may render such judgment, imposing such sentence therefor as a court of sessions might lawfully render and impose in case a conviction of such crime were had in a court of sessions. Except as hereinbefore provided, courts of special sessions held by said recorder shall have all the powers and jurisdiction conferred upon courts of special sessions by the code of criminal procedure, and shall be subject to all the provisions of said code relating to courts of special sessions. 
(L. 1906, ch. 477, § 138) 
Sec. 139. - [Acting recorder; powers of; appointment.] 
    In case of sickness, absence from the city, disability or inability of the recorder to act, his powers and duties are hereby conferred and imposed upon the acting recorder. It shall be the duty of the mayor and common council on the first Monday in January in each year to appoint, by resolution, some person who shall be an elector of the City of Elmira and an attorney and counselor at law of the supreme court of this state, who shall act in such cases for the year commencing on the day following such designation, instead of the recorder, and who shall in all such cases have power to hold all courts which said recorder may hold, in all respects as if held by said recorder, and he shall be designated and known as "acting recorder." In case any warrant issued by the said recorder shall be returned during his absence from the city, or during his inability to attend to the duties of his office, any further proceedings may be had on such warrant before such acting recorder, who, after having once obtained jurisdiction over any matter in any criminal action or proceeding, or special proceeding of a criminal nature by virtue of the provisions of this act, may retain such jurisdiction and proceed to the determination of such action or proceeding. All processes and mandates issued by the recorder or the acting recorder requiring service shall be served by the city policemen, or by officers authorized by the laws of the state to serve such processes and mandates, and the same may be served in any county in this state without being endorsed by any other magistrate. All processes, mandates, orders, commitments or other documents made or issued by the recorder shall be signed in addition to his name "recorder of the City of Elmira"; when made or issued by the acting recorder, the same shall be signed, in addition to his name, "acting recorder of the City of Elmira." The recorder and acting recorder shall keep a docket of all business done by them, with full items and dates, and with a proper and convenient index; such docket shall contain a record or brief statement of all convictions, acquittals and judgments before either of them, and the same shall be open during office hours to public inspection when not in use.

All such costs and fees, and all fines and penalties, or other money collected by either of them during any month, shall be paid to the city chamberlain before the next regular meeting of the common council in the next succeeding month; and any failure or omission to pay over such fine, penalty or other moneys, shall be sufficient cause for removal of such recorder or acting recorder from office; the recorder and acting recorder shall each file with the city clerk, prior to the time of the first regular meeting of the common council in each month, a complete and detailed statement, verified by his oath to be true, of all moneys payable to the city chamberlain by virtue of the provisions of this act which were received by said recorder or acting recorder during the next preceding month, with the written receipt of said chamberlain of the payment of said moneys to him attached to said statement; the recorder and acting recorder shall each keep an account of all such fees and fines, and of all criminal business done by him, which shall be a county charge, and shall annually, at the time for the presentation of claims against the county of Chemung, present in the name of said city said account, properly made and verified, to the board of supervisors of said county, and said board shall audit said account to the city of Elmira and levy the same in the same manner as other county charges.

Sec. 141. - [Recorder's clerk; appointment; powers.] 
    The recorder may appoint a clerk for the recorder's court, who shall be the official stenographer thereof, and who may be removed by him whenever he may deem it advisable.

The clerk and each acting clerk, during the period of his employment as such, shall be an officer of the court, and shall, before entering upon the discharge of his duties as such, subscribe and take the oath of office as prescribed by the constitution of this state, and file the same with the city clerk. It shall be the duty of such clerk to take accurately in shorthand the testimony of all proceedings on the trial of cases in the recorder's court, and to furnish a typewritten copy of the testimony and other proceedings so taken by him in any case in which such testimony and proceedings shall have to be returned to the county court or county judge, which typewritten copy shall be a part of the return; and to take down and write out such other matters pertaining to the business of said court as the recorder may direct. The clerk of the recorder's court shall be a stenographer and shall attend upon said court during the time it is by law required to be kept open for business and shall keep the dockets and books of account thereof, and make up under the direction of the recorder the returns on appeal to the county court, and the return in any other matters in which testimony and proceedings shall be required by law to be returned to the county court or judge thereof, or filed in county clerk's office.

All property remaining unclaimed, except money, shall be sold by said recorder, or by someone under his direction. If any goods, wares, merchandise or chattels of a perishable nature, or which shall be expensive to keep, shall at any time remain unclaimed in said recorder's office, it shall be lawful for said recorder to sell the same at public auction at such time and after such notice as to him and the mayor shall seem proper.

The remaining installments shall be payable each successive year thereafter in the same manner as above with interest on the amount of the unpaid portion at the rate of six per centum per annum. 
    The first assessment shall be for the first installment only, and each successive assessment shall be for the installment or installments then due, together with interest as above provided. The person assessed shall have the privilege to pay the entire assessment on the first installment or to pay all unpaid assessments, together with interest thereon, on any installment date thereafter. 
    Such amount shall be in a separate column from the general city tax to be levied for the current fiscal year, and the entire amount shall be collected as hereinbefore provided in reference to general city taxes; and if such amount is not paid, the land or property assessed shall be sold therefor as hereinbefore provided in sections fifty-six and fifty-seven, and said sale and the effect thereof and the rights thereunder shall be controlled by the provision hereinbefore relative to the sale of lands for general city taxes insofar as the same may be applicable thereto.

Within ten days from the service of said notice such corporation so served shall give written notice to the city manager stating whether or not it elects to make the service connections which the city manager may thereafter direct to be made upon such street. In case such a corporation so elects to make such service connections the city manager shall give notice to such corporation requiring it to make such connections to such mains or conduits as the city manager may direct.

Before any street in which a sewer has been placed shall be paved or macadamized, the city manager shall give notice to the owner or owners of the property adjacent to such sewer requiring them to make such connections with said sewer as said city manager may direct.

The said city manager may by his order require that pavements or macadam torn up or displaced or disturbed by any water, gas, telephone, telegraph, street surface railway or other company, shall be repaired or replaced by the city manager only, in which event the expense of such replacing shall be paid by the company necessitating such repairing and may be recovered in an action at law in the name of the city against said company, or may be collected in the same manner as the expense of repairing a sidewalk as hereinbefore provided. 
(L. 1906, ch. 477, § 163; L. 1910, ch. 662; L. 1915, ch. 377; L.L. No. 1950-4)

Orders special in their character shall take effect upon the service thereof personally or by mail upon the person or persons affected thereby, unless a different time be specified in such order. The city manager shall determine whether improvements herein authorized to be made by him shall be by advertisements for bids and lettings by contracts or by direct employment, and shall determine the details of such improvements. Whenever the city manager contemplates expending by contract a sum exceeding twenty-five hundred dollars for any one piece of pavement or sewer, it shall be the duty of the said city manager to advertise for bids for such work, and to let such piece of pavement or sewer to the lowest responsible bidder. At the time advertised all bids shall be opened by the city manager or by the city clerk, in the presence of the bidders and newspaper reporters there present, and an abstract of all of them, with prices and security offered, shall be immediately copied in a book kept for that purpose without any change, correction or addition whatever.

(1)  Regulate uses which are dangerous to health, safety and property due to water or erosion hazards, or which result in damaging increases in erosion or in flood heights or velocities; 
(2)  Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction; 
(3)  Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural protective barriers which are involved in the accommodation of flood waters; 
(4)  Control filling, grading, dredging and other development which may increase erosion or flood damages; 
(5)  Regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert flood waters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands, and; 
(6)  Qualify and maintain for participation in the National Flood Insurance Program. 
1.3  Objectives. The objectives of this local law are: 
(1)  To protect human life and health;

(1)  Generally, variances may be issued for new construction and substantial improvements to be erected on a lot of one-half acre or less in size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed below the base flood level, providing items (i-xii) in section 6.1(4) have been fully considered. As the lot size increases beyond the one-half acre, the technical justification required for issuing the variance increases. 
(2)  Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic structures upon determination that: 
(i)  The proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a "historic structure." 
(ii)  The variance is the minimum necessary to preserve the historic character and design of the structure. 
(3)  Variances may be issued by a community for new construction and substantial improvements and for other development necessary for the conduct of a functionally dependent use provided that: 
(i)  The criteria of subparagraphs 1, 4, 5, and 6 of this section are met; 
(ii)  Te structure or other development is protected by methods that minimize flood damages during the base flood and create no additional threat to public safety. 
(4)  Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result. 
(5)  Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief. 
(6)  Variances shall only be issued upon receiving written justification of: 
(i)  A showing of good and sufficient cause; 
(ii)  A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship to the applicant; and 
(iii)  A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create nuisances, cause fraud on or victimization of the public or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances. 
(7)  Any applicant to whom a variance is granted for a building with the lowest floor below the base flood elevation shall be given written notice over the signature of a community official that the cost of flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from lowest floor elevation.

ARTICLE XVII. - LOCAL LAW NO. 4 OF 1989-NOTIFICATION TO POLICE AND FIRE DEPARTMENT OF DERAILMENTS 
    A local law of the City of Elmira, New York, authorizing the City of Elmira to mandate that the operators of all rail lines passing through the City of Elmira notify the Department of Police and the Department of Fire of any derailment occurring within the corporate boundaries of the City of Elmira within fifteen (15) minutes of any such derailment. 
    Be it enacted by the council of the City of Elmira, New York, as follows: 
    Section 1. The Charter of the City of Elmira is hereby amended to add Local Law No. Four of 1989 [L.L. No. 1989-4], as follows: 

Sec. 1. - Purpose and intent. 
    Derailments within the corporate boundaries of the City of Elmira have been marked by the failure of the affected rail line to notify the City of Elmira departments of fire and police. In certain cases these derailments have involved trains carrying toxic and/or combustible materials. The rail lines' failure to notify the city has slowed the city's response time and presents a threat to the health, safety, and welfare of the residents of the City of Elmira. This threat to the residents of the City of Elmira requires that legislation be adopted to mandate rail lines to notify the City of Elmira of all derailments within the corporate boundaries of the city. 
(L.L. No. 1989-4, § 1(1)) 
Sec. 2. - Notice required. 
    Rail lines passing through the City of Elmira shall notify the City of Elmira department of police and department of fire of any derailment involving said rail line within the corporate boundary of the City of Elmira no later than fifteen (15) minutes after said derailment. 
(L.L. No. 1989-4, § 1(2))

    The Commissioners of the Elmira Water Board shall determine whether to pay the cost of the additional retirement benefits either in one lump sum or in five (5) annual installments. The amount of the lump sum or the annual payment in each of the five (5) years shall be determined by the New York State Employees' Retirement System, and the lump sum or the installments shall be paid by the Elmira Water Board for each employee who receives the retirement benefits under this local law.

ARTICLE XXXVIII. - LOCAL LAW NO. 2 OF 2014-TO AUTHORIZE "BEST VALUE PURCHASING." 

Sec. 1. - Name of Resolution. 
    This local law shall be known as "City of Elmira, New York Best Value Contract Award Local Law". 
(L.L. 2014-2, § 1) 
Sec. 2. - Finding and Intent. 
    The State Legislature and Governor amended General Municipal Law, section 103, on January 27, 2012 to provide local government's greater flexibility in awarding contracts by authorizing the award of purchase contracts, including contracts for service work on the basis of best value. The state legislation requires municipalities with a population of less than one million to authorize by local law the use of the best value award process. 
    Enactment of this legislation provides additional procurement options to localities that may expedite the procurement process and result in cost savings. The "best value" standard for selecting goods and services vendors, including janitorial and security contracts, is critical to efforts to use strategic sourcing principles to modernize the supply chain and ensure that taxpayers obtain the highest quality goods and services at the lowest potential cost, while also ensuring fairness to all competitors. 
    The federal government, approximately half of the states, and many localities have added best value selection processes to their procurement options, in recognition of these advantages. With the increased complexity of the goods and services that municipalities must obtain in order to serve taxpayers, it is critical to consider selection and evaluation criteria that measure factors other than cost in the strictest sense. 
    Taxpayers are not well served when a public procurement results in low unit costs at the outset, but ultimately engenders cost escalations due to factors such as inferior quality, poor reliability and difficulty of maintenance. Best value procurement links the procurement process directly to the municipality's performance requirements, incorporating selection factors such as useful lifespan, quality and options for more timely performance and/or additional services. 
    Even if the initial expenditure is higher, considering the total value over the life of the procurement may result in a better value and long-term investment of public funds. Best value procurement also encourages competition and, in turn, often results in better pricing, quality and customer service. Fostering healthy competition ensures that bidders will continue to strive for the participation of small, minority and women-owned businesses, and the development of environmentally-preferable goods and service delivery methods. Best value procurement will provide much-needed flexibility in obtaining important goods and services at favorable prices, and will reduce the time to procure such goods and services. 
(L.L. 2014-2, § 2) 
Sec. 3. - Definition. 
    "Best value" means the basis for awarding contracts for services to the offerer who optimizes quality, cost and efficiency, among responsive and responsible offerers. Such basis shall reflect, wherever possible, objective and quantifiable analysis. Such basis may also identify a quantitative factor for offerers that are small businesses or certified minority- or women-owned business enterprises as defined in subdivisions one, seven, fifteen and twenty of section three hundred ten of the executive law to be used in evaluation of offers for awarding of contracts for services. 
(L.L. 2014-2, § 3) 
Sec. 4. - Requirements. 
    Where the basis for award is the best value offer, the Director of Purchasing shall document, in the procurement record and in advance of the initial receipt of offers, the determination of the evaluation criteria, which whenever possible, shall be quantifiable, and the process to be used in the determination of best value and the manner in which the evaluation process and selection shall be conducted. 
    The Director of Purchasing shall select a formal competitive procurement process in accordance with guidelines established by the City Procurement Policy and document its determination in the procurement record. The process shall include, but is not limited to, a clear statement of need; a description of the required specifications governing performance and related factors; a reasonable process for ensuring a competitive field; a fair and equal opportunity for offerers to submit responsive offers; and a balanced and fair method of award. Where the basis for the award is best value, documentation in the procurement record shall, where practicable, include a quantification of the application of the criteria to the rating of proposals and the evaluation results, or, where not practicable, such other justification which demonstrates that best value will be achieved. 
    The solicitation shall prescribe the minimum specifications or requirements that must be met in order to be considered responsive and shall describe and disclose the general manner in which the evaluation and selection shall be conducted. Where appropriate, the solicitation shall identify the relative importance and/or weight of cost and the overall technical criterion to be considered by the City in its determination of best value. 
    The Director of Purchasing shall develop procedures that will govern the award of contracts on the basis of best value. These procedures shall be included in the City's Procurement Policy and reviewed annually by the City Council in conjunction with its annual review and approval of the City's Procurement Policy.

Such request shall contain an explanation of why the deadline was missed, and shall be accompanied by a renewal application, reflecting the facts and circumstances as they existed on the taxable status date.

ARTICLE XLVI. - LOCAL LAW NO. 2 OF 2017-AUTHORIZING THE CREATION OF A COMMUNITY CHOICE AGGREGATION PROGRAM, AND ADOPTING CERTAIN PROVISIONS TO FACILITATE PROGRAM IMPLEMENTATION 

Section 1. - Purpose and intent. 
    It is the intent of the City of Elmira, New York to establish a Community Choice Aggregation ("CCA") Program to aggregate the energy supply needs of residents and "small commercial customers" as defined by the State Public Services Commission in its Order authorizing CCA Programs, and to negotiate and enter into, or authorize its agent to negotiate and enter into, Energy Supply Agreements ("ESAs") with Energy Service Companies ("ESCOs") on behalf of eligible citizens to obtain stable, lower-cost energy prices, as well as environmental benefits and/or a community-based solution to meeting our collective energy needs. The purpose of this Local Law is two-fold: to establish a CCA Program in the City of Elmira and to adopt certain provisions relating to the creation and implementation of the CCA Program. 
(L.L. 2017-2, § 1) 
Section 2. - Findings. 
(a)  New York State's energy industry is in the midst of a significant transition; a shift away from the old top-down, utility-centered model toward a cleaner, more affordable, more resilient system in which consumers and communities will have a substantial role to play. The State's ongoing Reforming the Energy Vision ("REV") initiative emphasizes the importance of reliability and grid-resilience, distributed energy resources, increased renewable generation, and greater opportunity for citizens to take an active role in helping the State reach its energy goals and in making more informed energy choices in their homes, businesses and communities. 
(b)  As part of this REV initiative, the New York State Public Service Commission ("NYSPSC"), on April 21, 2016, adopted an Order authorizing cities, towns and villages within the State to create Community Choice Aggregation Programs, by themselves or in concert with other municipalities (hereinafter "NYSPSC Order Authorizing CCAs"), and/or to retain a CCA Administrator to implement the program and negotiate ESAs. 
(c)  CCA Programs allow communities to take control of their energy supply through an open, transparent and competitive electric and/or gas supply procurement process driven by the consumers themselves. 
(d)  A successful CCA Program offers citizens cost savings, more stable energy prices, deterrence of deceptive marketing practices by unscrupulous ESCOs, fair contracts negotiated directly with energy suppliers, and/or the opportunity to pursue goals and initiatives important to the community, such as reliability, grid resiliency, supporting renewable energy generation, cutting greenhouse gas emissions, protecting the State's natural resources, and improving energy efficiency. 
(e)  The City of Elmira has explored the CCA policy and background, and believes it would provide numerous benefits in this community, enhancing the public welfare and making energy more affordable and costs more predictable for our residents. 
(f)  Therefore, the City of Elmira authorizes the creation of an opt-out CCA Program pursuant to rules of the NYSPSC in this community for the provision of [electric and/or natural gas] supply service, as well as other high priority energy related value-added services as may be determined to meet the community's goals. 
(L.L. 2017-2, § 2) 
Section 3. - Authority. 
    The NYSPSC Order Authorizing CCAs expressly empowers cities, towns and villages in this state to create CCA Programs. Further, the New York Municipal Home Rule Law, Article 2, Section 10, authorizes a municipality to adopt general laws relating to its property, affairs and government, the protection and enhancement of its physical and visual environment, the protection and well-being of persons within the municipality, and for other authorized purposes. 
(L.L. 2017-2, § 3) 
Section 4. - Definitions. 
    Automatically eligible customers: shall mean customers' accounts in those utility service classes eligible for inclusion in the CCA Program on an opt-out basis, as set forth in the NYSPSC Order Authorizing CCAs, Appendix C, or as otherwise specified by the Commission. Generally, these classes of customers include those receiving residential electric or gas supply service, including those in multi-family housing, certain types of institutions, and some small commercial customers covered by "small general service" class designations.* Automatically Eligible Customers shall not include customers' accounts that have already been enrolled in service through an ESCO, enrolled in utility programs which require them to take supply service from their current utility, or that have a block on their utility account at the time of CCA formation; those customers' accounts shall be eligible to participate on an opt-in basis, if they so desire. 
Editor's note- * Municipalities may wish to clarify this section by including the eligible service classes for the specific utility currently providing service to its customers. 
Editor's note-  Except customers participating in the Affordability Assistance Program ("APP"), who may have blocks on their accounts with their existing utility, but who are still eligible to participate. 
    Eligible customers: shall mean all automatically eligible customers plus those utility customers eligible for inclusion in the CCA Program on an opt-in basis, as set forth in the NYSPSC Order Authorizing CCAs or otherwise authorized by the Commission. Those customers eligible to participate in the CCA Program on an opt-in basis currently include: those customers already enrolled in service through an ESCO at the time of CCA formation, customers in large commercial, institutional, or industrial utility service classes that cannot be automatically enrolled in the CCA on an opt-out basis, and all other customers not considered "automatically eligible customers." References to the broader class of "eligible customers" shall signify the entire pool of customers participating in the aggregation, either because they have been automatically enrolled on an opt-out basis, or because they have affirmatively opted in. 
    CCA administrator: An agent of the municipality charged with overseeing creation, implementation and operation of a CCA Program, as well as competitively procuring and negotiating Energy Supply Agreements with ESCOs. The CCA Administrator shall be retained by the municipality via a separate CCA Administration Agreement, adopted by Resolution of the municipality's governing board. 
    City : The City of Elmira, New York. 
    Community choice aggregation (CCA)/CCA program: A Program authorized by the New York State Public Service Commission (NYSPSC) to aggregate residential and commercial electric and/or natural gas supply and/or energy related value-added products and services within a given municipality, and/or among multiple municipalities, in order to leverage that energy demand to negotiate favorable Energy Supply Agreements directly with ESCOs. Customers within a CCA Program would no longer purchase their energy supply directly from their utility. However, the utility would continue to deliver energy to these customers, to charge for that delivery, and will retain its transmission and distribution network. The energy supply portion of a customer's energy service is provided by an ESCO or ESCOs, pursuant to an Energy Supply Agreement competitively procured and negotiated for the CCA Program at large, then delivered to customers via the local utility. 
    Energy supply agreement (ESA): An agreement between an energy customer and an Energy Services Company (ESCO) to provide electricity or gas service to the customer for a fixed or variable price. For purposes of this Local Law, the CCA Administrator would conduct a competitive procurement on behalf of all eligible customers, and would enter into an Energy Service Agreement(s) with an ESCO to provide power to all such customers in the community. 
    Energy services company (ESCO): A third-party energy supplier eligible to sell electricity, natural gas and/or energy related value added services to customers in New York State, utilizing the transmission and distribution systems of existing utilities. ESCOs are regulated by the New York State Department of Public Service and the New York State Public Service Commission, and must comply with the New York State Public Service Law. 
    Municipality: Reference to these terms throughout this Local Law indicate the City, unless otherwise noted. 
    Utility: This term refers to traditional electric and/or natural gas utilities regulated by the New York State Department of Public Service and the New York State Public Service Commission and permitted to provide electric and/or gas supply, transmission and distribution services to all customers within their designated service territory. For purposes of this Local Law, the term Utility will refer to New York State Electric & Gas (NYSEG). 
(L.L. 2017-2, § 4) 
Section 5. - Establishing community choice aggregation. 
    The City hereby establishes a CCA Program for aggregation of [electric and/or natural gas] supply to serve all eligible customers in its jurisdiction. All automatically eligible customers shall be included in the CCA Program on an opt-out basis, and shall be afforded the opportunity to opt-out of the CCA Program, within a specified period, at no cost. All customers who are not automatically eligible to be included in the CCA Program on an opt-out basis shall be permitted to affirmatively opt into the program in accordance with the terms of the ESA and/or the NYSPSC Order Authorizing CCAs. 
(L.L. 2017-2, § 5) 
Section 6. - Provisions for implementing CCA program. 
(a)  Implementation Plan. 
(1)  The City, with support from its CCA Administrator, will create and follow a CCA Implementation Plan which shall outline the details of how the CCA Program will be created and operated, including how public outreach and education will occur, what rules will apply to the Program, how the procurement process will be implemented, how energy contracts will be selected, and how responsibilities will be divided amongst CCA Administrator, municipality, and eligible customers. 
(2)  In accordance with the NYSPSC Order Authorizing CCAs, the CCA Implementation Plan will be reviewed and approved by the Public Service Commission. Such review may involve NYSPSC approval of a generic CCA Implementation Plan, with the understanding that community-specific Appendices would be submitted later and would outline appropriately tailored local education and outreach efforts. 
(3)  Where a generic CCA Implementation Plan will be used, the City and the CCA Administrator will make community-specific revisions to the Plan's Appendices to ensure the Plan is properly tailored to the needs of the City's residents. Therefore, prior to or in conjunction with the enactment of this Local Law, and thereafter from time to time, the City, with support from the CCA Administrator, will create and update a CCA Program Opt-Out Letter, as well as an Education and Outreach Plan, as provided in the Implementation Plan Appendix for this community. 
(4)  The City Opt-Out Letter and Education and Outreach Plan shall conform to those requirements for public outreach, education, and opt-out procedures set forth in the NYSPSC Order Authorizing CCAs, and in any other applicable laws or regulations, and shall ensure that the City and its CCA Administrator engage in a robust effort to educate and inform the community about the CCA Program and their options for participating or opting out. 
(5)  Opt-out letters will be provided to all automatically eligible customers no less than 30 days prior to the time at which those customers would be automatically enrolled in the CCA Program. The letters will be printed on the City letterhead, in official City envelopes. The logo of the CCA Administrator and selected ESCO may also be included on these letters, so long as it is clear that the letter is official correspondence from the City. 
(b)  Public Outreach and Education. 
(1)  The City, together with its CCA Administrator, will provide public notices, presentations, information sheets, and other forms of outreach, as outlined in the Appendix of the Implementation Plan, to ensure residents are informed about the CCA Program and their options for participating or opting out. 
(2)  Once the CCA Program is operating, the City and its CCA Administrator will continue to engage in public outreach to keep CCA customers informed about any changes to the CCA Program; opportunities for new products or services available through the CCA Program, such as renewable energy buying options; important terms and durations of ESAs; information about the selected ESCOs; and any other matters related to the CCA Program. 
(c)  Customers Moving into or out of the Community After CCA Adoption. Residents [and small commercial customers] who establish utility accounts in this community after the effective date of this Local Law shall be afforded the opportunity to join the CCA Program within a reasonable time after their utility account is established, in accordance with contractual agreements between the CCA Administrator any ESCO(s) providing service to the Program. 
(d)  Customer Data Protection. The City, or its CCA Administrator, will create and follow a Customer Data Protection Plan which ensures that any confidential or sensitive personal customer information provided by the utility to the City, its CCA Administrator, and/or the selected ESCO(s), will be given all privacy protections required by law and regulation, and protected from unauthorized release or use to the greatest extent possible. This Customer Data Protection Plan will ensure that the CCA Program and any selected ESCO(s) handle all confidential or sensitive customer data in keeping those customer data protections already afforded by NYSEG prior to the enactment of this Local Law. This Plan will also ensure that CCA customer data, such as contact information, is not used for inappropriate purposes, such as solicitation of business unrelated to the CCA Program, its goals and objectives. 
(L.L. 2017-2, § 6) 
Section 7. - Cca administrator. 
(a)  CCA Administration Agreement. The City will enter into a CCA Administration Agreement with its CCA Administrator. Such agreement will set forth the various rights and responsibilities of the parties, and will govern the manner in which the CCA Program is run. This Agreement shall also authorize the CCA Administrator to act as the City's agent for the purpose of procuring energy supply or other energy related value-added services for CCA Program eligible customers. 
(b)  Customer Service, Complaints. The CCA Administrator will provide the City with clear, up-to-date contact information for customer questions, concerns or complaints. The CCA Administrator shall, from time to time, and/or at the request of the City and its City Council, report to the City regarding customer service matters. 
(L.L. 2017-2, § 7) 
Section 8. - Compliance with public service law and regulations. 
    In accordance with the NYSPSC Order Authorizing CCAs, it shall be the responsibility of the City, supported by any CCA Administrator that may be under contract, to ensure the CCA Program is operated in compliance with all applicable provisions of the New York State Public Service Law, regulations of the New York State Public Service Commission and/or the New York State Department of Public Service, the Uniform Business Practices (to the extent applicable), the NYSPSC Order Authorizing CCAs and any other relevant laws or regulations. This provision applies regardless of whether a CCA Administrator is retained to organize and implement the City's CCA Program. This shall include, but not be limited to, compliance with any reporting requirements related to the CCA Program. 
(L.L. 2017-2, § 8) 
Section 9. - Review and/or dissolution of the CCA program. 
(a)  The City will, from time to time, review the CCA Program and its progress to determine how the program is faring, confirm it is affording benefits to the community, and provide information to the public thereon. 
(b)  As the expiration of its ESA(s) approaches, or in the event an ESCO provides notice of its intention to terminate an ESA (where authorized by the terms of that ESA), the City may consider whether it wishes to discontinue the CCA Program. Dissolution of the CCA Program will require (1) enactment of a Local Law amending or repealing this Local Law, (2) lawful termination of ESAs in accordance with their terms, (3) lawful termination of the CCA Administration Agreement, in accordance with its terms, and (4) at least 60 days' notice to customers that their energy services will be automatically returned to NYSEG, an effective date upon which such a change would occur, and information on what other options may be available to those customers, if applicable. 
(L.L. 2017-2, § 9) 
Section 10. - Conflicts. 
    In the event the New York State Public Service Commission, the State Legislature, or other State agency, enacts laws or regulations regarding the operation of CCAs which are in conflict with this Local Law, the state provisions shall govern. 
(L.L. 2017-2, § 10) 
Section 11. - Liability. 
    Nothing in this Local Law shall be read to create liability on the part of the City/Town/Village related to the provision of electric and/or natural gas service to customers. The ESCO selected to provide such service will be ultimately responsible for compliance with all applicable laws, rules and regulations governing retail energy services, and will assume any liability stemming from the provision of such service to retail customers, including any potential liability associated with the service itself, customer data and information, and any other matters which would traditionally fall under the purview of a merchant utility providing the same service to customers prior to the formation of the CCA. This Local Law is meant merely to facilitate the creation of an aggregation program in this community. The City/Town/Village will not assume the role of ESCO or utility in the sale or delivery of energy services. 
(L.L. 2017-2, § 11) 
Section 12. - Severability. 
    Each provision of this Law is severable from the others, so that if any provision is held to be illegal or invalid for any reason whatsoever, such illegal or invalid provision shall be severed from this Law, which shall nonetheless remain in full force and effect. 
(L.L. 2017-2, § 12) 
Section 13. - Effective date. 
    This Local Law shall take effect upon the filing with the Secretary of State.

(b)  The city recognizes that individuals who are appointed or hired by the city and who, at the time of such employment, live outside the county, may incur additional financial expenses in relocating in order to accept such employment.

The city shall reimburse the employee for moving expenses of household goods in an amount as authorized by the city council, provided the employee submits to the personnel director three separate written estimates of the moving expenses. The city shall have the right to substitute a reasonable alternative amount in lieu of any estimates of actual costs incurred by the employee. An employee who has received reimbursement for moving expenses of household goods shall pay to the city the amount of the reimbursement payment if the employee voluntarily terminates his employment with the city prior to the completion of one year of service. 
(e)  To be eligible for reimbursement, the employee shall complete a request for relocation reimbursement to be issued by the personnel department, together with three estimates of moving expenses of the employee's household goods. Upon receipt of the request, the personnel director shall forward it to the city manager, who shall forward it to the city council for its authorization. Upon the city council's authorization, the city chamberlain shall issue a check to the employee. 
(f)  The reimbursement procedures are as follows:

(3)  Any authorized payment shall be made solely and directly to the employee and to no other person or entity. 
(4)  The city shall not enter into any contract with a moving company for moving services for a relocating employee nor shall the city guarantee payment of such expenses.

If the owner fails to comply with said provisions, the owner shall pay the annual vacant fee which would have been due pursuant to section 8-30(c)(8)c. had it not been initially waived. In no event shall more than two years of the annual vacant fee be waived.

Sec. 16-3. - Outdoor furnaces. 
(a)  Definitions. The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this section, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this subsection, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning: 
    Outdoor furnace means any equipment, device or apparatus, or any part thereof, which is installed, affixed or situated outdoors for the primary purpose of combustion of fuel to produce heat or energy used as a component of a heating system providing heat for an interior space. 
(b)  Legislative intent. Certain manufacturers and retailers of outdoor furnaces contend that such devices may provide an economical alternative to conventional heating systems. Concerns have been raised regarding the safety and environmental impacts of these heating devices. State health and environmental agencies have received an increasing number of complaints from owners and tenants that these heating devices produce smoke that permeates buildings and homes causing not only a nuisance, but also environmental degradation and health problems. Given the density and proximity of residential units to other adjoining residential and commercial units within the city, the city council hereby finds that the existence of outdoor furnaces would create a nuisance and cause environmental degradation and health problems. 
(c)  Prohibitions. No person shall install, affix, situate or operate an outdoor furnace in the city. 
(d)  Exemptions; restrictions. Any outdoor furnace installed and operated prior to the effective date of the ordinance from which this section is derived, may not be extended or enlarged. No person shall cause, allow, maintain the use of, or operate an outdoor furnace installed or in operation prior to the effective date of this ordinance after October 31, 2006. Any person maintaining or operating an outdoor furnace in operation prior to the effective date of the ordinance from which this section is derived, shall comply with all laws and all ordinances and local laws of the city. 
(e)  Penalties. Any person found to be in violation of this section shall be subject to the penalties set forth in section 1-14.

In the event that no special manhole has been required, the control manhole shall be considered to be the nearest downstream manhole in the public sewer to the point at which the building sewer is connected. Sampling shall be carried out by customarily accepted methods to reflect the effect of constituents upon the sewerage works and to determine the existence of hazards to life, limb and property. The particular analyses involved will determine whether a 24-hour composite of all outfalls of a premises is appropriate or whether a grab sample or samples should be taken. Normally, but not always, biochemical oxygen demand and suspended solids analyses are obtained from 24-hour composites of all outfalls, whereas pHs are determined from periodic grab samples. All samplings will be made by the city or its authorized representative and any fee for such services is the sole responsibility of the property owner.

Sec. 29-92. - Findings of fact. 
    The city council finds that uncontrolled stormwater drainage, runoff, erosion, and sedimentation associated with land development have a significant impact upon the health safety and welfare of the community. Specifically the following: 
(1)  Land development activities and associated increases in site impervious cover often alter the hydrologic response of local watersheds and increase stormwater runoff rates and volumes, flooding, stream channel erosion, or sediment transport and deposition; 
(2)  This stormwater runoff contributes to increased quantities of waterborne pollutants, including siltation of aquatic habitat for fish and other desirable species; 
(3)  Clearing and grading during construction tends to increase soil erosion and add to the loss of native vegetation necessary for terrestrial and aquatic habitat; 
(4)  Improper design and construction of stormwater management practices can increase the velocity of stormwater runoff thereby increasing stream bank erosion and sedimentation; 
(5)  Impervious surfaces allow less water to percolate into the soil, thereby decreasing groundwater recharge and stream base flow; 
(6)  Substantial economic losses can result from these adverse impacts on the waters of the city; 
(7)  Stormwater runoff, soil erosion and nonpoint source pollution can be controlled and minimized through the regulation of stormwater runoff from land development activities; 
(8)  The regulation of stormwater runoff discharges from land development activities in order to control and minimize increases in stormwater runoff rates and volumes, soil erosion, stream channel erosion, and nonpoint source pollution associated with stormwater runoff is in the public interest and will minimize threats to public health and safety; 
(9)  Regulation of land development activities by means of performance standards governing stormwater management and site design will produce development compatible with the natural functions of a particular site or an entire watershed and thereby mitigate the adverse effects of erosion and sedimentation from development. 
(L.L. 2008-2, § 1(32-2), 1-7-2008)

(1)  Meet the requirements of minimum measures 4 and 5 of the state pollutant discharge elimination system general permit for stormwater discharges from municipal separate stormwater sewer systems (MS4s), permit No. GP-02-02 or as amended or revised; 
(2)  Require land development activities to conform to the substantive requirements of the state department of environmental conservation state pollutant discharge elimination system (SPDES) general permit for construction activities GP-02-01 or as amended or revised; 
(3)  Minimize increases in stormwater runoff from land development activities in order to reduce flooding, siltation, increases in stream temperature, and streambank erosion and maintain the integrity of stream channels; 
(4)  Minimize increases in pollution caused by stormwater runoff from land development activities which would otherwise degrade local water quality; 
(5)  Minimize the total annual volume of stormwater runoff which flows from any specific site during and following development to the maximum extent practicable; and 
(6)  Reduce stormwater runoff rates and volumes, soil erosion and nonpoint source pollution, wherever possible, through stormwater management practices and to ensure that these management practices are properly maintained and eliminate threats to public safety.

240.5  The regulations appearing in this article and in the schedule are subject to the bulk and density regulations (article III) and supplementary district regulations (article IV ) in addition to the other provisions of this ordinance. 
Sec. 250. - District intents. 
250.1  Residence AA District [One-Family, Large Lot], intent. This district is intended to create, preserve and enhance areas of the City composed entirely of single family residences on large lots at low densities with a spacious, landscaped appearance and quiet streets. This district would be free of disrupting influences and would have only those functions in the district that are necessary and desirable to serve a single-family residential neighborhood of this character. 
250.2  Residence A District [One-Family], intent. This district is intended to create, preserve and enhance areas of the city composed primarily of single-family residences built at low or medium densities on quiet streets, but which were developed at a period of time in the past when lot sizes were somewhat smaller than those of more recently developed single-family neighborhoods. These areas are still stable and essentially in sound condition and should be protected from the intrusion of uses and activities incompatible with the character of a single-family area. Because of the older and more modest character of this type of neighborhood, a limited amount of uses not of the single family type may have found a place in the district in the past. 
250.3  Residence B District [One-Two Family], intent. This district is intended to create, preserve and enhance areas of the city that are primarily residential in character, but which are composed primarily of one- and two-family dwellings on lots large enough to provide parking and open space. These districts most often serve as a buffer between Residence A and Residence C Districts. 
250.4  Residence C District [One-Four Family], intent. This district is intended to create, preserve and enhance areas of the city that are primarily residential in character but built at a more medium density than any of the previous districts. It is expected that these areas would have more traffic on the streets and be convenient to transportation lines; would be more densely built up, but still have adequate light and space around the buildings, and be well landscaped with mature trees and shrubbery. These areas would have been built up in the past years and have undergone some change in use and character with the passage of time, and area likely to be located near the central business district or in the vicinity of business subcenters. 
250.5  Residence D District [Multifamily], intent. This district is intended to create, preserve and enhance areas of the city that are primarily residential in character but built to higher densities than any of the previous districts. They may be older areas or newer developed or redeveloped areas where the plan of the city determines that it is feasible and desirable to develop certain areas with medium to high concentrations of population due to the availability of adequate public facilities and utilities, due to the adequacy of the road and transportation system, and where the environment in and around the area is suitable for such type of development. It is also the intent of this ordinance that some nonresidential uses would be permitted in this area if they are not incompatible with the character of a higher density residential area, but are instead, complementary and would enhance the livability of such a neighborhood. 
250.6  Business A District [Neighborhood Commercial], intent. This district is intended to create, preserve and enhance business areas of the city that will serve residential neighborhoods. This is intended to be a limited business category which has the main purpose of providing day-to-day convenient retail needs of nearby residents. This district occurs most often at limited corner intersections of main thoroughfares. They will generally be areas which will contain several small-scale retail establishments in small clustered groupings serving frequently recurring needs in locations convenient to residences. Since these districts immediately abut neighboring residential properties, emphasis on buffering, landscaping, scale and size of businesses is essential. 
250.6.1  Business A-I [Neighborhood Commercial-I], intent. The intent of this district is the same as the intent and description set forth under section 250.6, Business A [District], except bars, taverns, nightclubs, restaurants and restaurants-fast food shall not be permitted. 
250.7  Business B District [Central Business District], intent. This district is intended to create, preserve and enhance the Elmira Central Business District as a regional center of shopping; employment; offices; hotels and motels; government; banking, investment and financial services; entertainment; and culture. 
250.8  Business C District [Specialized Commercial], intent. This district, located along Maple Avenue on the south side of Elmira, is intended to recognize the unique mixture of historically significant large homes and structures in the district. The district is intended to provide an alternative to sole residential use of these properties by allowing a viable blend of small commercial enterprises on premises also containing residential units. Such uses are specifically intended to include small retail specialty shops that fulfill a specific function in the marketplace. Care should be taken to protect the unique aesthetic value of the area from typical commercial or suburban-like development. 
250.9  Business D District [Historic Commercial], intent. This district, located along West Church Street on the north side of Elmira, is intended to recognize the unique role which the historic district has played in the formation, growth and life of the City of Elmira. Due to the location along a major transportation route in the city, the area has evolved into a mixed use service/residential area that is close in, but functions secondary to the central business district. Because this area is within an historic district many of the structures have remained intact and green landscaping has taken priority over parking lots. The intent is to preserve the use, function, and appearance that exists as of the date of this ordinance. 
250.10  Business E District [General Commercial], intent. This district is intended to create, preserve and enhance business areas devoted to general commercial services and wholesaling activities. Such areas would include a variety of commercial enterprises which are essential to the economy of the city, but which are frequently incompatible with residential areas and with the operations of a retail shopping or office area, or other types of business areas, but are typically appropriate to centralized areas near major arterials, industrial concentrations, or in the vicinity of transportation lines or transportation terminal points. 
250.11  Business G District [Gateway Commercial], intent. This district is intended to protect and enhance the primary gateways into the City of Elmira from NYS Route 17 along East Church and East Water Streets. It is characterized by its location along a major thoroughfare and proximity to commercial, cultural and employment centers. In permitting mixed uses, this district will maximize the benefits of location and existing infrastructure such as public transportation, sewer and water. The traffic and activity of this area lessens the desirability for single family living, while the accessibility and exposure provide an environment suitable for certain professional and business offices which can exist in close proximity to dwellings without adversely affecting the residential environment. The location of commercial and office uses in this district should not necessarily be related to retail trade. Rather, the commercial and office uses should complement and provide basic services to the residential use. All development within this district should maintain a high quality of development so as to enhance, through landscape plantings and minimal curb-cuts along East Church Street, the city's primary gateway. 
250.12  HA District [Hospital], intent. The provisions of this section are intended to create, preserve, and enhance integrated and unified hospital areas devoted to medical, surgical and other therapeutic establishments within attractive, well-landscaped settings, with good transportation services and adequate amounts of parking. 
250.13  HED District [Higher Educational], intent. This district is intended to recognize and manage the orderly development of institutions of higher education and their attendant uses; to promote compatibility with adjacent, noneducational zoning districts; and provide for the effective utilization of land located within the district. 
250.14  Industrial A District [Light Industrial], intent. This district is intended to create, preserve and enhance industrial areas devoted primarily to manufacturing establishments, research establishments and other nonresidential and nonbusiness types of activities which have limited external impact on surrounding areas because of their appearance, their method of operation, and their use of public facilities and utilities. Such operations ordinarily have little influence on the neighborhood in the way of emission of smoke, noise, vibrations, etc. 
250.15  Industrial B District [General Industrial], intent. This district is intended to create, preserve and enhance industrial areas devoted to manufacturing and other nonbusiness and nonresidential uses which are potentially incompatible with most other activities, and are typically appropriate to areas of the city which are somewhat distant from residential areas which have access to suitable and adequate railroad, highway or other transportation and shipping facilities. It is the expectation that such manufacturing or other nonresidential uses would have operating characteristics that are considered more obnoxious or unpleasant than those in Industrial A Districts, but would not be so obnoxious nor unpleasant that they would be detrimental to surrounding properties or to any other part of the city. 
250.16  Conservation District [Floodplains, Hilly Slopes], intent. This district is intended to create, preserve and enhance areas of the city for the protection of floodplains, natural water basins and steep lands abutting limited access highways where uncontrolled development would be adverse to community values and adverse to the public health, safety and general welfare of the city. 
250.17  Residence P District [Planned Residential], intent. This district is intended to permit and encourage the development of well-planned, high-density, residential neighborhoods or groups of residences on sites larger than normal building lots. To give the site planner more freedom, more intensive use of land may be permitted and the coverage, height, setback and other requirements may be varied if certain requirements are met which will ensure a more imaginative use of a building site than can be achieved under the other regulations of this ordinance. It is the intent of this section to stimulate the construction of multiple-family developments that will be a continuing asset to the City of Elmira and will promote a stable, healthy and safe environment. It is likely that these areas would be found adjacent to, or near, the Central Business District, in older established areas of the city and around existing business subcenters, or in the vicinity of activities employing a large number of people. 
250.18  Residence P-AA District [Planned Low-Density Residential], intent. This district is intended to permit and encourage the development of well-planned low density, residential neighborhoods or groups of dwelling units on sites larger than normal building lots. This type of development is characterized primarily as a home of ownership area, including the condominium form of ownership of residential units. To give the architect and site planner adequate flexibility to permit more creative and imaginative building and site design than can be achieved under the other regulations of this ordinance governing Residence AA Districts, more intensive uses of land are permitted, and the coverage, height, setback and other requirements are varied if certain additional requirements for such districts are met. Such developments are conceived of as being planned in their entirety to allow the development to make the most efficient use of the land and of existing buildings. These developments would be designed and built so that careful attention is given to the placement and interrelationships of buildings, parking spaces, landscaping, and other features of development to each other as well to neighboring properties. Developments of this type also are expected to be characterized by a high degree of sensitivity to the protection and enhancement of existing historic structures and natural features of the site. 
250.19  Industrial P District [Planned Industrial], intent. This district is intended to create, preserve and enhance integrated and unified industrial parks devoted to industrial, manufacturing and research establishments within attractive, well landscaped settings with good transportation service and adequate amounts of off-street parking. Such industrial parks are typically appropriate to locations near major thoroughfares and near good shipping and receiving facilities for supplies and goods. Because such industrial parks are likely to cover a relatively large area of land, they would ordinarily be located in undeveloped or underdeveloped parts of the city separated from residential communities, or in blighted, built-up areas that would be redeveloped for such use.

Sec. 350. - Hospital zone. 
350.1.  Definition. [The term] A "hospital" shall [mean] be a facility primarily engaged in providing, by or under the continuous supervision of licensed health care providers, to inpatients and outpatients, diagnostic and therapeutic services for diagnosis, treatment, and care of persons. The term "hospital" shall also mean one or more buildings or structures which provide facilities and services of a type customarily provided by a hospital including, but not limited to, any services and facilities in support of or in any way related to the hospital's activities including nursing homes, convalescent homes, long term skilled nursing facilities and a school of nursing conducted within the hospital facility. 
350.2.  Permitted uses. In addition to those applicable regulations as set forth in table 260, the following shall apply: 
(a)  Hospital, nursing and convalescent homes and medically related professional offices and such uses as described in section 350.1 above shall be allowed. Such buildings constructed for said purposes may be occupied only by the patients, visitors, staff, employees and other incidental users of such facilities. 
(b)  Support uses which are owned, operated, or leased by or otherwise controlled by the hospital. The burden of proof is on the hospital to show the support use is consistent with the mission of the hospital. 
350.3.  Permitted accessory uses and buildings. In addition to uses and buildings customarily incidental and subordinate to the principal uses and buildings as described in [sub]sections 350.1 and 350.2, permitted accessory uses and buildings shall include any and all uses or buildings in support of or for the use or convenience of the hospital, patients, patient's families, visitors, hospital employees and staff. 
350.4.  Uses requiring special notifications. Any use or storage of radioactive or explosive material shall require the notification of the city fire marshal and any other agency with regulatory jurisdiction. 
350.5  Performance standards apply. No use shall be permitted which normally causes or emits objectionable odors, fumes, dirt, vibrations, glare, electrical interference or noise beyond the immediate sides of the building or buildings in which such uses are conducted.

Sec. 457. - Sexually oriented businesses. 
457.1  Purpose and intent. 
(a)  Recognition of need. It is hereby specifically recognized that sexually oriented businesses have promoted serious adverse secondary effects in many of the municipalities in which they operate; including, but not necessarily limited to: increases in prostitution, pandering, child endangerment, violent crimes against persons and property, as well as increases in other types of serious crimes and criminal enterprises; the increased proliferation of sexually transmitted diseases, as well as other serious communicable diseases such as hepatitis and the like; the spread of urban blight and commensurate decrease in property values, and the general degradation of the quality of urban life. In addition, that these adverse secondary effects precipitate a deleterious impact on sensitive areas of the community, such as churches, synagogues and other places of worship, schools, child care centers, adult care facilities and the like, as well as promote the spread of urban blight which decreases property values and hinders economic vitality generally. As a result of said adverse secondary effects associated with sexually oriented businesses, said sexually oriented businesses require heightened supervision from public health and safety agencies in order to protect the health, safety and welfare of the patrons of such businesses, as well as the residents of the City of Elmira. Furthermore, the city council recognizes that licensing, zoning, and other traditional municipal regulations are legitimate, reasonable means of accountability to insure compliance with this ordinance so as to control and minimize the adverse secondary effects associated with sexually oriented businesses. 
(b)  Due diligence. The city council in and for the City of Elmira has carefully and meticulously reviewed: numerous case studies which relate the existence and impact of these adverse secondary effects on various municipalities; evidence of the existence of said secondary effects and their impact on the City of Elmira; implications regarding the introduction and expansion of such secondary effects within the City of Elmira and the potential impact thereof; various United States Supreme Court and New York court decisions relating to the regulation of sexually oriented businesses; as well as the various and balanced comments and concerns advanced by the citizens of the City of Elmira and community-at-large. 
(c)  Nonprejudiced representation. The city council in and for the City of Elmira is charged with, and dutifully respects and adheres to, the mandate to effectively govern without bias for, nor prejudice against any entity residing or doing business within the City of Elmira. 
(d)  Proactive government. In furtherance of this charge, the city council in and for the City of Elmira, specifically recognizes that it need not remain quiescent and thereby risk the expansion of, or influx of, said adverse secondary effects, but rather may pro-actively govern in order to manage and reduce the secondary effects that currently do exist as well as effectively manage and control future secondary effects, including, but not limited to the legitimate concern of the city council to protect the health and safety of its citizens, all of which therefore, compels the implementation of reasonable regulation of sexually oriented businesses. 
(e)  Need for distance buffer zones. In drafting and passing this ordinance, the city council in and for the City of Elmira has carefully considered, among other issues, the need to protect sensitive areas and uses of land within the City of Elmira, by establishing minimum distances buffering said sensitive areas and uses from sexually oriented businesses thereby reducing the potential for impact by the secondary effects associated with said sexually oriented businesses. These sensitive areas are generally and normally associated with a decreased need to be on the alert for, and defend against, the heretofore mentioned adverse secondary effects associated with sexually oriented businesses, or represent areas which are generally and normally used by, or associated with, certain segments of the population at-large, who because of age or mental capacity are unable to defend against said adverse secondary effects. Such considerations include, but are not necessarily limited to, the following: 
(1)  In order to protect children from the dangers of the heretofore referenced adverse secondary effects associated with sexually oriented businesses, areas within the vicinity of single and multiple family dwellings, as well as uses normally associated with the care, education or housing of children, should be free of said sexually oriented businesses; 
(2)  In order to protect the serene quality of certain areas normally associated with a decreased level of a need to be on heightened alert for the heretofore mentioned adverse secondary effects associated with sexually oriented businesses, areas within the vicinity of churches, public parks, schools, places of public assembly and residential uses should be free of said sexually oriented businesses; and 
(3)  That no evidence has been presented to demonstrate that the location of sexually oriented businesses within the City of Elmira, in violation of the provisions of this ordinance will improve the commercial viability or quality of life in the community. 
(f)  Need for additional regulations. In addition, the city council in and for the City of Elmira, has determined that the distance buffer zone criteria alone does not adequately protect the health, safety and general welfare of the people of the City of Elmira and that therefore, certain additional regulations with respect to the ownership, management and operation of sexually oriented businesses is in the public interest. Therefore, this ordinance is enacted to more effectively manage, control, minimize and abate said harmful secondary effects that do exist; reduce the possibility of a future increase in said secondary effects; protect the health, safety and general welfare of the residents of the City of Elmira; promote, preserve and protect the distinguished character of the City of Elmira and quality of urban life, and to further the revitalization of the city's industrial, commercial and residential tax base and overall economic vitality. 
(g)  Noncontent based regulation. It is neither the purpose, intent, nor effect in enacting this ordinance to impose any limitations or restrictions on the content of any expressive material, including sexually oriented material; nor to impede or hinder the free exchange of ideas, expressions and/or communications based on the content thereof; nor to restrict or deny the community-at-large legal access to said sexually oriented materials, ideas, expressions, and communications as protected by the First Amendments of the U.S. Constitution and the New York State Constitution or any other applicable legal precedence; nor to deny lawful access by the distributors and retailers of sexually oriented material to their intended market. Rather, it is the good-faith determination of the city council in and for the City of Elmira that in enacting this ordinance, it is furthering the important and substantial governmental interest of reducing and controlling the objectionable secondary effects that are, or may be in the future, precipitated by sexually oriented businesses upon the residents of the City of Elmira, in a manner no more restrictive than is necessary. 
(h)  Condemnation of obscene materials. Furthermore, it is not the intent, in enacting this ordinance, to in any way condone or legitimize the distribution of obscene materials, ideas, expressions or communications not protected by the First Amendments of the U.S. Constitution or New York State Constitution or any other applicable legal precedent, and the city council recognizes that state and federal law prohibits the distribution of obscene materials and expects and encourages the proper law enforcement entities to enforce said laws.

1010.5  Powers and duties of the board. The board of appeals shall have all the powers and duties prescribed by law and by this ordinance, but its powers are limited only to those powers prescribed by law and by this ordinance and the board shall exercise no others. These powers are more particularly specified as follows: 
(a)  Interpretation. Upon appeal from a decision by an administrative official, the board may decide any question involving the interpretation of any provision of this ordinance, including determination of the exact location of any district boundary if there is uncertainty with respect thereto. 
(b)  Review of actions. An appeal may also be taken to the board by an aggrieved person for any refusal of a building permit or certificate of occupancy by the superintendent of buildings, or for a review of any order or decision of said superintendent, where such order or decision is based upon the requirements in this ordinance. The board may confirm, reverse, or modify any action, order, issuance of permit or determination by said officer, according to the terms of this ordinance. 
(c)  Special permits. The board may grant or deny a special permit for any of the specific uses for which this ordinance requires the obtaining of such permits from the board of appeals. Such specified uses are listed in article II, district regulations, and the procedures and standards for the issuance of special permits for specific uses are set forth in article VII. In granting or denying a special permit, the board shall conform to the procedures, standards and other requirements specified in the above-mentioned articles of this ordinance and to no others. 
(d)  Variances. The board shall have the power to grant use variances and area variances. 
(1)  [The term] "use variance" shall mean the authorization by the board for the use of land for a purpose which is otherwise not allowed or is prohibited by the regulations of this ordinance. No such use variance shall be granted by the board without a showing by the applicant that applicable zoning regulations and restrictions have caused unnecessary hardship. To prove such unnecessary hardship the applicant shall demonstrate to the board that for each and every permitted use under these zoning regulations for the particular district where the property is located: 
(i)  The applicant cannot realize a reasonable return, provided that the lack of return is substantial as demonstrated by competent financial evidence; 
(ii)  The alleged hardship relating to the property in question is unique, and does not apply to a substantial portion of the district or neighborhood; 
(iii)  The requested use variance, if granted, will not alter the essential character of the neighborhood; and 
(iv)  The alleged hardship has not been self-created. 
(2)  [The term] "area variance" shall mean the authorization by the board for the use of land in a manner which is not allowed by the dimensional or physical requirements under these zoning regulations. In making its determination, the board shall take into consideration, the benefit to the applicant if the variance is granted, as weighed against the detriment to the health, safety and welfare of the neighborhood or community by such granting. In making such determination, the board shall also consider: 
(i)  Whether an undesirable change will be produced in the character of the neighborhood or a detriment to nearby properties will be created by the granting of the area variance; 
(ii)  Whether the benefit sought by the applicant can be achieved by some method feasible for the applicant to pursue, other than an area variance; 
(iii)  Whether the requested area variance is substantial; 
(iv)  Whether the proposed variance will have an adverse effect or impact on the physical or environmental conditions in the neighborhood or district; and 
(v)  Whether the alleged difficulty was self created, which consideration shall be relevant to the board's discussion but shall not necessarily preclude the granting of the area variance. 
(3)  The board, in the granting of use variances, shall grant the minimum variance that it shall deem necessary and adequate to address the unnecessary hardship proven by the applicant and at the same time preserve and protect the character of the neighborhood and the health, safety and welfare of the community. 
(4)  The board, in the grant of area variances, shall grant the minimum variance that it shall deem necessary and adequate and at the same time preserve and protect the character of the neighborhood and the health, safety and welfare of the community. 
(5)  The board, in granting use and area variances and certificates of appropriateness, shall have the authority to impose such reasonable conditions and restrictions as are directly related to and incidental to the proposed use of the property. 
[(e)]  [Conditions for granting variances.] The board may grant a variance from the regulations of this ordinance where the strict application of its provisions would result in practical difficulties or unnecessary hardship. In reaching a decision or determination of practical difficulties or unnecessary hardship, the board of appeals shall find the following conditions are present before granting a variance to the regulations of this ordinance: 
(1)  That the strict application of the provisions of this ordinance would deprive the applicant of any reasonable use of land or building for any of the permitted uses in the district, that the granting of the variance is necessary for the reasonable use of such property, and that the variance granted by the board is the minimum variance that will accomplish this purpose; and 
(2)  That there are special circumstances or unique conditions, fully described in the findings of the board, applying to such land or buildings and not applying generally to land or buildings in the neighborhood, which would prevent said land or buildings from yielding a reasonable return if used for any permitted use. The board shall find, among other things, that the lot in question has peculiar topographic or other physical characteristics unlike those of surrounding properties, that the variance will not increase the dwelling unit densities stipulated by the ordinance in the district in which said lot is located, and that the variance will not add substantially to the traffic congestion or off-street parking problems of the area in which said lot is located; and 
(3)  That the special circumstances or unique conditions have not resulted from any act of the applicant subsequent to the adoption of this ordinance; and 
(4)  That the granting of the variance will be in harmony with the general purposes and intent of this ordinance and will not be injurious to the neighborhood, will not alter the essential character of the locality, will not otherwise be detrimental to the public welfare, and that the public safety and welfare will be secured and substantial justice be done. 
In granting a variance, the board of appeals may prescribe appropriate conditions or safeguards that are necessary or desirable to protect the neighborhood and preserve the spirit and intent of this ordinance. Any violation of such conditions or safeguards may result in the rescission of the variance.

(e)  Content of application. Every appeal or application for relief shall set forth the interpretation that is claimed, or the use for which a special permit is sought, or the details of the variance applied for and the grounds for which it is claimed that the variance should be granted, as the case may be. In requesting consideration for a special permit, the applicant shall follow the procedures and satisfy the requirements as specified in article VII. In requesting consideration of a variance, the appellant shall provide a dimensioned drawing showing the site layout proposed and including a sketch drawing of the main elevation of the structure indicating proposed building materials and landscaping treatment. Any significant change in the plan and elevation drawing originally submitted must be reapproved by the board. 
(f)  Reapplication. No parcel of property, or part thereof, may be the subject of an application for a zoning variance, special use permit, or an interpretation of the zoning ordinance within six months after the zoning board of appeals has heard and decided an application concerning the same parcel unless such application shall show a substantial change of fact from the previous application, or seek substantially different relief than that sought in the previous application. It shall be the zoning board of appeals which decides whether the applicant has shown a substantial change of fact from the previous application, or whether the applicant is seeking a substantially different relief than that sought in the previous application.
