which municipalities are not entitled to modify by or pursuant to Charter.  If
this Charter or the Council, by ordinance or resolution, does not prescribe the
procedure for the exercise of a power in such cases in which it has a right to
prescribe such procedure, it shall be presumed to be the intention of the
Council that the procedure shall be as provided by the general law of the State
of Ohio until the Council otherwise provides.

within the corporate limits and regulate construction therein.

Municipality and to be qualified to be a candidate for such office shall have
been a registered elector of the Municipality, and in the case of a member from
a district, a registered elector of such district, qualified to vote at the
next preceding general election.  To qualify for election or appointment to
fill a vacancy in Council, a person must have all of the foregoing
qualifications as of the effective date of his appointment.  No member of
Council shall hold any other public office except that of notary public or
member of the State militia or National Guard, except as may be otherwise
provided by the Charter, and no member of Council may be interested in any
contract with the Municipality or holder of any employment with the
Municipality.  Any member of Council who ceases to possess any of the aforesaid
qualifications or who moves his actual residence from the Municipality shall

(Approved by electors 11-4-75)

   5.   Vacancies.  Any vacancy in Council shall be filled by the favorable
vote of a majority of the remaining members of Council within thirty (30) days

office until a successor is elected and qualified at the next general municipal
election by the electors of the Municipality.  If the vacancy occurs less than
one hundred twenty (120) days from the next general municipal election, then
the interim Councilperson elected by Council shall hold office until a
successor is elected and qualified at the next succeeding general municipal

vacant, the interim Councilperson elected by Council must have the residence
and registration qualifications of a candidate for Council from that district
at the last general municipal election and all conditions for the unexpired
term at the next general municipal election shall have the qualifications of
candidates for full Council terms. Any such successor shall be elected by the
electors at large for the balance of the unexpired term if the vacancy is in an
at large seat, and by the electors of the d`istrict for the balance of the
unexpired term if the vacancy is in a district seat.
   In the event that the remaining members of Council do not, for any reason,
elect an interim Councilperson to fill a vacancy as required above, within
thirty (30) days from the creation of such vacancy, then the Mayor shall, at
the next succeeding regular Council meeting appoint such interim successor who
shall hold office until a successor is elected by the electors at large for the
balance of the unexpired term, if the vacancy is in an at large seat, and by
the electors of the district for the balance of the unexpired term if the
vacancy is in a district seat.  (II.C.5. in its entirety approved by electors

three (3) members of Council upon at least twelve (12) hours written notice to
each member served personally or left at the usual place of residence.  The
purpose of a special meeting shall be stated in the notice, but Council shall
not be limited to consideration of or action upon the subject stated in the
notice but may, with the assent of a majority of the membership of Council,
consider and act upon any business properly presented to it. Any member of

regular and special, of Council, and committees of Council, shall be open to
the public at all times. Public bodies of the City of Springdale may meet in
executive sessions after a majority of a quorum of the public body determines,
by roll call vote, to hold an executive session at any regular or special
meeting for the sole consideration of any of the matters provided by Ohio
Revised Code § 121.22(G), and as the same may be amended or recodified, and
also for consideration of any economic development issues or to permit the
participation of Council members at seminars, retreats or training sessions
without prior public notice. The manner by which executive sessions are called
and conducted shall be as set out in the Codified Ordinances of the City of
Springdale. Each journal and other records of the Council shall be open to the
public at all reasonable times. 
(II.D.1. in its entirety approved by electors 11-5-96)
   2.   Rules.  The Council may, by ordinance, adopt rules for its proceedings
where procedures are not otherwise provided for by this Charter, and may, from
time to time, amend or revise such rules.  Until such time as Council adopts
rules of procedure, and upon any point of procedure not otherwise covered by
such rules or by the provisions of this Charter, Robert's Rules of Order, as
from time to time revised, shall govern the proceedings of the Council.
   3.   Ordinances and Resolutions.
      a.   General.  The action of Council shall be by ordinance or
resolution.  Actions of a special or temporary nature, actions not involving
the imposition of penalties, the granting of variances from the requirements of
the zoning or building codes, actions not involving the expenditure of public
funds, the levying of taxes, the appropriation of funds, the creation of
Municipal indebtedness, or the approval of Municipal contracts, shall be by
resolution.  All other action shall be by ordinance.
      b.   Form.  Each proposed ordinance and resolution shall be introduced in

ordinance contains a clause declaring the necessity of its immediately going
into effect by reason of a stated emergency, in which cases, such ordinance may
be read once and passed on the day of such reading as provided in subparagraph
(d). If an ordinance does not contain an emergency clause, Council may, by a
vote of not less than five (5) of its members, dispense with the requirement
that the ordinance be read on two (2) separate days, and authorize the adoption
of the ordinance or resolution upon its first reading. Furthermore, Council
may, by a vote of not less than five (5) of its members, dispense with the

or second reading or for both its first and second reading, and authorize it to

occasion if copies of the proposed ordinance are available in council chambers
for public inspection during the Council meeting.  No ordinance shall be passed

call of the members and the vote of each member entered upon the journal of the

and every resolution shall be certified by the signature of the President of

shall not in any way affect the validity of the legislation or delay its going
into effect. Immediately upon passage, all ordinances and resolutions shall be
submitted by the Clerk of Council/Finance Director to the Mayor for signature.

it may designate such ordinance as an emergency ordinance and, upon the
affirmative vote of at least five (5) members of Council, it shall go into
immediate effect upon its adoption. An emergency ordinance shall contain a
separate section in which is set forth the reason for the determination of the

incorporated code by the promulgating agency shall also, without further action
by Council, be deemed an amendment to the enacting ordinance.  Publication in

the time for and hold a public hearing on the question of the proposed

of the initiative powers of the electors shall be as determined by the Revised
Code of the State of Ohio.
      Referendum.  Any ordinance, except such ordinances as, by this Charter,
go into immediate effect, shall be subject to the referendum.  When a petition,
signed by ten percent (10%) of the total number of electors who voted in the
preceding general election, is filed with the Clerk of Council/Finance Director
within thirty (30) days after any ordinance subject to the referendum is
adopted by the Council, or in case the Mayor has vetoed the ordinance and
returned it to Council, within thirty (30) days after Council has passed the
ordinance over his veto, ordering that such ordinance be submitted to the
electors of the Municipality for their approval or rejection, such Clerk of
Council/Finance Director shall, after determining the validity of said
petition, certify the content thereof to the Council at its next regular
meeting.  Thereupon, Council shall establish the time of and hold a public
hearing on the question of the repeal of the ordinance as called for by the
petition, at the next succeeding regular Council meeting.  Upon said public
hearing, the Council shall either repeal the ordinance which is the subject of
the referendum petition or provide for its submission to the electors at the
next succeeding primary or general election.  All other matters relating to the
question of the exercise of the powers of referendum shall be regulated by the
provisions of the Revised Code of Ohio relating to referendum petitions.  The
ordinance which is the subject of the referendum petition shall not go into
effect until the Board of Elections certifies that the ordinance has been
approved by a majority of the electors, whereupon, the ordinance shall go into
effect immediately.
   Whenever the Council of the municipal corporation is required to pass more
than one (1) ordinance or other measure to  complete the legislation necessary

(Approved by electors 11-5-85; 11-4-86)
ARTICLE VII - FINANCIAL
A.   TAXATION.
   1.   Annual Levy.  The Council may, by legislation in the form prescribed by
the County Auditor, by a vote of at least four (4) members thereof, annually
levy a tax upon all property, real and personal, which under the law of the
State of Ohio may be taxed according to value, for the current operating
expenses of the Municipality, including three-tenths (3/10) of one (1) mill
each for the police and fireman's relief and pension funds of the Municipality,
the rate of which tax shall not exceed three and nine one-hundredths (3.09)
mills.  The foregoing limitation upon the general property tax rate within the
Municipality is established by this Charter pursuant to the authority of said
Article XII, Section 2 of the constitution and Section 5705.18 of the Revised
Code of Ohio.  The Council shall annually levy outside of the limitations
herein provided in this Charter a sum sufficient to pay interest and bond
retirement charges on all bonds and notes of the Municipality of Springdale,
lawfully issued, rents due on perpetual leaseholds of the corporation not
payable from a special fund, and the expenses incident to the management of
bond retirement fund, which entire levy shall be placed before and in
preference to all other levies.  Amounts certified under the laws of the State
as necessary for such purposes shall not be subject to change by the Council.
   2.   Extra Levy.  The Council may, at any time during any year, by ordinance
adopted by at least five (5) of the members of Council, declare that the amount
of money which may be raised by taxation within the limitations imposed by
paragraph 1 hereof will be insufficient for the requirements of the
Municipality and that it is necessary to levy additional taxes for any
Municipal purpose, lawful under this Charter, the general law, or the
constitution, and may require the submission of the question of levying such
additional tax to the electors of the Municipality at a primary, general, or
special election.  Such ordinance shall determine whether the proposed
additional levy shall apply to the current tax duplicate and shall specify the
purpose thereof and the number of years during which such levy shall have
effect, which shall not exceed five (5) years.  Such ordinance shall take
effect immediately upon its adoption and shall be certified to the Board of
Elections within five (5) days from its passage.  Such ordinance shall not be
subject to the veto of the Mayor but shall be published as all other
ordinances.  The ordinance shall specify the date of holding the election on
the question of the extra levy which shall not be earlier than ninety (90) days
after the adoption of the ordinance nor later than one hundred twenty-five
(125) days thereafter.  If a general or primary election falls in the period of
ninety (90) to one hundred twenty-five (125) days from the date of passage of
the ordinance, then the submission of the question shall be at such general or
primary election.  The ballot shall be in the form and the procedures shall be
as prescribed by the general election laws.
   The question covered by such ordinance shall be submitted as a separate
proposition, but at a general or primary election may be printed on the same
ballot with any other proposition, question or issue, submitted at the same
election.  If the requisite majority of those voting thereon at the election,
whether it be at a general, a primary or a special election, vote for the
approval of the levy, it shall be passed, and Council shall, as soon as
practicable thereafter, make such levy or such part thereof as it finds
necessary, and certify the same to the County Auditor to be placed on the tax
list and collected as other taxes.
   No such extra levy, for the same general purpose, shall be submitted to the
voters at more than one (1) special election in any one (1) calendar year.
   3.   The limitations of this Charter upon the power of Council to levy taxes
shall not operate as a limitation upon the power of Council to levy taxes upon
such other subjects and for such other purposes as may be lawful under the
constitution and general laws of the State of Ohio.
   4.   Uniform Rule.  The uniform rule requirement of Article XII, Section 2
of the constitution of Ohio, regarding the taxation of land and improvements
thereon according to value, shall be strictly observed in the levying of taxes,
but shall not be construed so as to prevent the levying, within the territorial
limits of the municipal corporation, as existing at the time, nor within the
limits of territory added to said existing municipal territory of the maximum
Municipal levy allowed by this Charter, because of the addition, by statutory
procedures of territory which lies within taxing districts which have pre-
empted more of the millage within the ten (10) mill limitation for other than
Municipal purposes than has been pre-empted by those taxing districts, other
than Municipal, within the territory of the Municipality as constituted prior
to the time of such addition of territory.
B.   BORROWING.
   The Council of the Municipality may borrow money for any Municipal purpose
valid under the constitution of Ohio or this Charter to the extent of the
maximum debt limitations imposed by this Charter and the constitution, and may
create debt in any form and under any procedure not in conflict with any
express prohibition of the constitution and laws of Ohio and/or of this
Charter.
C.   DEBT LIMITATION.
   The net indebtedness created or incurred by the municipal corporation
without a vote of the electors shall never exceed three and one-half percent
(3-1/2%) of the total value of all property in the City as listed and assessed
for taxation.
   The total net indebtedness created or incurred by the municipal corporation
shall never exceed ten percent (10%) of the total value of all property in the
City as listed and assessed for taxation.
   In ascertaining the limitations prescribed by this section, the bonds or
other evidences of indebtedness excepted in Section 133.02 and Section 133.03
of the Revised Code of Ohio, as presently enacted or in their amended or
substituted versions, shall not be considered.
(VII.C. in its entirety approved by electors 11-2-71)
D.   BUDGET.
   In each fiscal year, which shall be the calendar year from January 1 through
December 31, the Mayor, the City Administrator, and the Clerk of Council/
Finance Director shall prepare and submit to Council a tax budget for the
following fiscal year.  The tax budget shall be submitted to Council at a
meeting prior to the date that the tax budget is required to be submitted to
the County Budget Commission.  It shall include an estimate of all expenditures
which will be necessary for the operation of the Municipality during the
following fiscal year and an estimate of revenues which will be received for
that period.  Any disagreement between the Mayor and the Clerk of Council/
Finance Director as to either expenditures or revenue shall be clearly noted
upon the budget as submitted.  The Council shall approve or amend the tax
budget as submitted, and shall adopt same, by resolution, after a public
hearing of which at least ten (10) days notice is given in the manner
prescribed for the publication of ordinances.  The tax budget shall be in the
form prescribed by the office of inspection and supervision of public offices
of the State of Ohio, except to the extent that modification is required by any
provision of this Charter, and all proceedings regarding the adoption of an
annual budget, not specifically provided for in this section, shall be in
accordance with the provisions of the Ohio Revised Code.
(Approved by electors 11-8-77; 11-4-86; 11-3-09)
E.   APPROPRIATIONS.
   An annual appropriation ordinance shall be prepared by the Clerk of Council/
Finance Director of the municipal corporation, in the form prescribed by the
general law, based upon the revised budget as approved by the Hamilton County
Budget Commission and the official certificate of estimated resources or
amendments thereof as issued by the County Auditor.  The proposed appropriation
ordinance shall be submitted to the Council as soon as practicable after the
issuance of such certificate of estimated resources.  On or about the first day
of each year, the Council shall pass an appropriation ordinance based upon such
proposed appropriation ordinance submitted by the Clerk of Council/Finance
Director, amended or revised as it sees fit.  If it desires to postpone the
passage of the annual appropriation ordinance until an amended certificate is
received from the County Auditor, based on the actual balances, Council may
pass a temporary appropriation ordinance for meeting the ordinary expenses of
the Municipality until not later than the first day of April of the current
year, and the appropriations made therein shall be chargeable to appropriations
in the annual appropriation ordinance for that fiscal year when passed.  For
the purpose of meeting the actual requirements of the Municipality as they
appear as the fiscal year progresses, Council may pass such supplemental
appropriation ordinances as it deems necessary, adjusting the appropriations
between the various appropriation funds.  The total amount appropriated for any
fiscal year shall not exceed the total balances carried over from the previous
fiscal year plus the estimated revenue for the current fiscal year, as both of
such sums appear upon the latest issued certificate of resources.
   No amending or supplemental appropriation ordinance shall be required to be
published.  Such ordinances shall be effective immediately, and shall not be
subject to veto by the Mayor.
   No money shall be drawn from the treasury of the municipal corporation
except in pursuance of appropriations made by the Council, and no expenditure
shall exceed any balance of any appropriation fund account for the fiscal year,
said balance being determined by reducing the initial or amended appropriation
amount by the total expenditures validly drawn against such account plus any
other encumbrances or obligations against such account which have not actually
been paid.
   The authorization of a bond issue shall be deemed to be an appropriation of
the proceeds of the same for the purpose for which such bonds were issued.  In
the case of an improvement, the cost of which is to be paid in full or part by
special assessments, a contract may be executed without an appropriation or
certificate for that portion of the cost derived from special assessments,
provided that an ordinance authorizing such an assessment and the bonds or
notes to be issued in anticipation thereof has been lawfully passed, or that
such contract is for the provision of engineering, legal, or other necessary
professional services in connection with such improvement. 
(VII.E. in its entirety approved by electors 11-4-86)
F.   CONTRACTS AND EXPENDITURES.
   No expenditure of municipal funds shall be made except by a proper warrant
drawn against an appropriate fund, which warrant shall show, upon its face, the
appropriation in pursuance of which such expenditure is made and the fund
against which the warrant is drawn. All such warrants shall be signed by the
Clerk of Council/Finance Director.
(Approved by electors 11-4-86)
   No contract involving the expenditure of money or purchase order shall be
made unless there is attached thereto the certificate of the Clerk of Council/
Finance Director that the amount required to meet the obligation of such
contract or purchase order, or in the case of a continuing contract to be
performed in whole, or in part, in an ensuing fiscal year, the amount required
to meet the same in the fiscal year in which the contract is made, has been
lawfully appropriated for such purpose and is in the treasury or in the process
of collection to the credit of appropriate fund free from any previous
encumbrances. Every such contract or purchase order made without such a
certification shall be void and no warrant shall be issued in payment of any
amount due thereon. If no certificate is furnished as required, upon receipt by
Council of a certificate of the Clerk of Council/Finance Director stating that
there was at the time of the making of such contract or purchase order and at
the time of the execution of said certificate a sufficient sum appropriated for
the purpose of such contract or purchase order and in the treasury or in the
process of collection to the credit of an appropriate fund free from any
previous encumbrances, the Council may authorize the issuance of a warrant in
payment of amounts due upon such contract or purchase order by ordinance, but
such ordinance shall be passed within thirty (30) days from the receipt of such
certificate of the Clerk of Council/Finance Director; provided that if the
amount involved is less than five hundred dollars ($500) the Clerk of Council/
Finance Director may authorize it to be paid without such approval of the
Council, if such expenditure is otherwise valid. 
(Approved by electors 11-5-85; 11-4-86)
   The foregoing provisions notwithstanding, the Clerk of Council/Finance
Director may establish petty cash funds, any of which individual fund shall
never contain in excess of an amount established by Council or the Ohio Revised
Code for reimbursement of valid expenditures for day-to-day operation of the
municipality.  No individual purchase shall exceed an amount established by
Council.  These accounts shall be replenished from time-to-time.  At the time
of replenishment all expenditures made from such fund shall be audited in
accordance with established accounting practices. Additionally, Council may, on
an annual basis, adopt a resolution exempting municipal purchases up to a
dollar figure to be determined by them from the certification requirements of
this section but no more than that allowed by the Ohio Revised Code. The
resolution shall state the dollar amount that is exempted from the
certification requirement and whether the exemption applies to all purchases,
to one or more specific classes of purchases or to the purchase of one or more
specific items.  (Approved by electors 11-5-85; 11-4-86; 11-3-09)
   Upon certification by the Clerk of Council/Finance Director that a certain
sum of money, not in excess of the limits imposed under Ohio Revised Code
Section 5705.41, and as the same may be amended and/or recodified, has been
lawfully appropriated, authorized, or directed for a certain purpose and is in
the treasury or in the process of collection to the credit of a certain fund
free from previous and then outstanding obligations or certification, then for
said purpose and from said fund, over a period not exceeding three (3) months
and not extending beyond the end of the fiscal year, expenditures may be made,
purchase orders may be issued, and contracts or obligations calling for or
requiring the payment of money may be paid, provided that the aggregate sum of
money included in and called for such expenditures, orders, and contracts shall
not exceed the sum so certified. An itemized statement of obligations incurred
and expenditures made under such certificate shall be rendered by the
department head to the Clerk of Council/Finance Director before another such
certificate may be issued, and not more than one such certificate shall be
outstanding at a time. 
(Approved by electors 11-4-86; 11-3-09)
   In addition to providing the certification for expenditures as set forth in
the previous paragraph, the City also may make expenditures, issue orders for
payment, and make contracts or obligations calling for or requiring the payment
of money made and assumed for specified permitted purposes from a specific
line-item appropriation account in a specified fund for a sum of money
exceeding five thousand dollars ($5,000)  upon the certification by the Clerk
of Council/Finance Director of the City that this sum of money has been
lawfully appropriated, authorized, or directed for a permitted purpose and is
in the treasury or in the process of collection to the credit of the specific
line-item appropriation account in the specified fund free from previous and
then-outstanding obligations or certifications; provided that the aggregate sum
of money included in and called for by the expenditures, orders, and
obligations shall not exceed the certified sum. The purposes for which the City
may lawfully appropriate, authorize, or issue such a certificate are the
services of an accountant, architect, attorney at law, physician, professional
engineer, construction project manager, consultant, surveyor or appraiser by or
on behalf of the City or contracting authority; fuel oil, gasoline, food items,
roadway materials, and utilities; and any purchases exempt from competitive
bidding under section 125.04 of the Ohio Revised Code and any other specific
expenditure that is a recurring and reasonably predictable operating expense.
Such an expenditure shall not extend beyond the end of the fiscal year. Such a
certificate shall be signed by the Clerk of Council/Finance Director and may,
but need not, be limited to a specific vendor. An itemized statement of
obligations made under such a certificate shall be rendered to the Clerk of
Council/Finance Director for each certificate issued. More than one (1) such
certificate may be outstanding at any time.
   In any case in which a contract is entered into upon a per unit basis, the
head of the department, board, or commission for whose benefit the contract is
made shall make an estimate of the total amount to become due upon such
contract, which estimate shall be certified, in writing, to the Clerk of
Council/Finance Director. Such a contract may be entered into if the
appropriation covers such an estimate or so much thereof may be due during the
current year. In such a case, the certificate of the Clerk of Council/Finance
Director, based upon the estimate, shall be a sufficient compliance with the
law requiring a certificate. 
(Approved by electors 11-4-86)
   Any certificate of the Clerk of Council/Finance Director attached to a
contract shall be binding upon the municipality as to the facts set forth
therein. Upon request of any person, firm or corporation receiving an order or
entering into a contract with the municipality, the certificate of the Clerk of
Council/Finance Director shall be attached to such order or contract.
"Contract" as used in this section excludes current payrolls of regular
employees and officers. Taxes and other revenue in process of collection, or
the proceeds to be derived from authorized bonds, notes, or certificates of
indebtedness sold and in process of delivery shall, for the purpose of this
Charter, be deemed in the treasury or in the process of collection and in the
appropriate fund. 
(Approved by electors 11-4-86)
   Expenditures for the payment of current payrolls upon the authority of a
proper appropriation for such purpose, provided that the position of such
employees and their compensation had been determined prior thereto by
ordinance, or in any other matter provided by law, may be made without the
express certification of the Clerk of Council/Finance Director herein provided
for. 
(Approved by electors 11-4-86)
   All contracts or purchase orders involving the expenditure of funds in the
amount for which advertising and bidding on public contracts is required in
Ohio Revised Code Section 735.05, and as the same may be amended and/or
recodified, may be entered only after advertisement for bids has been made at
least once in a newspaper of general circulation in the municipality at least
ten (10) days and not more than twenty (20) days prior to the final day of
receipt of such bids; shall bear the certification of the Clerk of Council/
Finance Director as to the availability of funds; shall be in writing and
executed by the Mayor and the Clerk of Council/Finance Director; and may be
entered only after the necessary expenditures are authorized by ordinance of
Council. All bids must be accompanied by a bond conditioned upon entering into
a proper contract in accordance with the terms of the advertisement. Said bid
bonds, or certified check in lieu thereof, shall be in the amount of ten
percent (10%) of the consideration stated in the bid. The adequacy of the bid
bond shall be determined by Council. Additionally, each contract for one (1)
year or less shall be secured by a performance bond, the sufficiency of which
shall be determined by the Mayor, in an amount equal to one hundred percent
(100%) of the consideration of the contract. Each multi-year contract shall be
secured by a performance bond, the sufficiency of which shall be determined by
the Mayor, in an amount at least equal to one hundred percent (100%) of the
consideration for the performance of the first year of the contract. This
performance bond shall be renewed for subsequent years at least fifteen (15)
days prior to the expiration of each year of the contract. The renewal shall be
in an amount at least equal to one hundred percent (100%) of the consideration
for the performance of the next year of the contract. The contract or purchase
order may be entered only with the best bidder, as determined by Council in its
absolute discretion. Contracts for professional or expert personal services
should be excluded from the foregoing provisions for advertising and bonds, and
shall be secured by Council upon such terms as it is able to negotiate.
However, any contract for such services shall be in writing if the total
consideration thereon is in the amount for which advertising and bidding on
public contracts is required in Ohio Revised Code Section 735.05, and as the
same may be amended and/or recodified. Such contracts may be in the form of an
ordinance, setting forth the terms thereof, which shall be binding upon the
municipality and other party either upon acceptance by the other party in
writing or by the commencement of the services called for by such ordinance.
(Approved by electors 11-2-82; 11-8- 83; 11-4-86)
   All contracts and purchase orders for an expenditure less than the amount
for which advertising and bidding on public contracts is required in Ohio
Revised Code Section 735.05 and as the same may be amended and/or recodified,
need not be advertised, bid or authorized by Council but shall be in the form
of a written requisition signed by the Mayor. The Mayor may delegate any part
of his authority to the City Administrator, in which event such contract may be
signed by the City Administrator to the extent of the authority so delegated.
Such written requisition shall bear the certification of the Clerk of Council/
Finance Director as to the availability of funds for validation. 
(Approved by electors 11-8-77; 11-2-82; 11-4-86)
   All contracts properly made by the City shall be administered by the Mayor.
The Mayor may delegate any part of such duty to the City Administrator, in
which event, such contracts shall be administered by the City Administrator to
the extent so delegated. 
(Approved by electors 11-8-77)
   The requirements for competitive bidding and for authorization by Council,
in the case of contracts or purchase orders, the consideration of which is in
the amount for which advertising and bidding on public contracts is required in
Ohio Revised Code Section 735.05, and as the same may be amended and/or
recodified, may be waived in the case of emergency, provided that the Mayor
secures the approval of the Council in any such situation where a meeting of
Council is to be held in time to deal with the emergency or, in the absence of
such sufficient time for such meeting, the Mayor secures the informal written
approval of five (5) Council members. For the waiver of such requirements, the
emergency must be such as to make it imperative that immediate action be taken
in order to maintain the essential operations of the municipal government or
preserve the public peace, health, or safety. 
(Approved by electors 11-2-82)
   Whenever equipment is being purchased by contract, purchase order or
requisition, a condition of transaction may be the trade-in or sale of other
equipment, the property of the municipality, declared by Council to be not
needed in municipal purposes, the value of the unneeded equipment, as
determined by the best bid or offer, being credited on the purchase price of
the equipment purchased.

ARTICLE VIII - PROCEDURES
A.   EMINENT DOMAIN.
   The municipal corporation may appropriate, enter upon, and hold real estate
within and without its corporate limits, for any valid municipal purpose,
including, but not limited to, those purposes set out expressly in the general
law regarding appropriation of property by municipal corporations.
   When the Council deems it necessary to appropriate a property for municipal
purposes it shall initiate the proceedings by the passage of an ordinance
declaring the intent to appropriate the specific property, defining the purpose
for which the property will be used, and setting forth a pertinent description
of the land and the estate or interest therein desired to be appropriated. 
Such ordinance shall declare the necessity for the appropriation and the
determination of the Council as to the necessity of the appropriation for the
purposes of the Municipality shall be final.  Such ordinance shall also contain
a section wherein the act of appropriation is effectual, subject only to the
determination of reasonable compensation to the owner of the property, either
by negotiation or by the verdict of a jury.
      The Clerk of Council/Finance Director of the Municipality shall be
responsible for effecting actual notice of the adoption of the appropriation
ordinance, either by personally serving said owner or his agent authorized for
such purposes with a copy of such ordinance or by mailing, by certified or
registered mail, such copy to the owner or his authorized agent.  Actual notice
upon the property owner by one of the foregoing means is jurisdictional and the
Municipality cannot acquire title to any interest in any property which it
intends to appropriate without such notice.  A return receipt from the United
States postal authorities in the usual course of business or the certificate of
the Clerk of Council/Finance Director that he has personally served the owner
or the owner's authorized agent, shall be prima facie proof of notice.
(Approved by electors 11-4-86)
   If a satisfactory settlement of the question of compensation has not been
made between the owner and Council, and the transfer of title or a valid
written contract to transfer title of such agreed compensation has not been
consummated or entered into not later than thirty (30) days from the date of
notice actually served upon the property owner as aforesaid, then the
Municipality shall file its petition in the court of common pleas in the county
in which the property in question lies, praying that a jury be impaneled to
determine just compensation for the property appropriated.  Proceedings shall
then be had in accordance with the general law and the rules of the court of
common pleas.
   If the owner or authorized agent of the owner cannot be found within the
county in which the property to be appropriated lies, or if ownership of the
property cannot be determined with reasonable application and diligence, then
service of the notice shall be by publication once each week on the same day of
two (2) consecutive weeks in a newspaper of general circulation in the
municipal corporation.
   All provisions of the general law applicable to appropriation of property,
not otherwise herein provided for, shall apply to the appropriation of property
by the Municipality.
B.   PUBLIC IMPROVEMENTS BY SPECIAL ASSESSMENTS.
   1.   General.  The Council shall have power by ordinance to provide for the
construction, reconstruction, repair, and maintenance of all things in the
nature of public improvements as provided by general law and to provide for the
payment of any part or all of the cost of any such improvement by levying and
collecting special assessments upon abutting, adjacent and contiguous or other
specially benefited property.  The amount assessed against the property
especially benefited to pay for such improvements shall not exceed the amount
of the benefits accruing to such property.  Any cost for such improvement in
excess of any sum assessed therefor shall be paid by the municipality.  Such
improvement may be by contract or directly by the employment of labor, in the
discretion of Council, provided however, if directly by the employment of
labor, the amount to be assessed shall not exceed the preliminary estimate of
the Engineer hereinafter provided for.
   2.  Methods of Special Assessments.  Special assessments upon property
deemed benefited by a public improvement shall be by any one or any combination
of the following methods:
      a.   In proportion to the benefits which may result from the improvement;
      b.   By a percentage of the tax value of property assessed;
      c.   By the front footage of the property bounding and abutting upon the
improvement.
   3.   Plans and Specifications.  When it is deemed necessary to make a public
improvement to be paid for in whole or part by special assessment, the Council
shall provide for the services of an engineer who shall submit to the Council
preliminary plans, specifications, profiles and estimates of the costs of such
improvement, along with an apportionment of said costs, as he deems reasonable,
upon each of the aforementioned methods of special assessments, upon each
parcel or lot of land which could reasonably be expected to be benefited by the
improvement.
   4.   Resolution of Necessity.  If, upon consideration of such preliminary
plans, specifications, profiles, estimates and apportionment of costs,
submitted to it by the Engineer, the Council deems it in the public interest to
proceed further with the proposed improvement, it shall adopt an ordinance
declaring the necessity therefor, and such ordinance shall contain a statement
of the portion of the total cost to be assessed, the method of assessment, the
mode of payment and the number of annual or semi-annual installments in which
the assessment shall be paid, the period of said installment not exceeding the
number of years over which the maximum maturity of bonds issued for the purpose
could be extended under the uniform bond law, shall describe the properties or
the area to be benefited by the improvement and shall require that notice of
the adoption of the resolution and the apportionment of the estimated cost of
the improvement be served upon all owners of property who may be assessed any
part of the cost of the improvement.  Such notice shall be served personally by
the Clerk of Council/Finance Director or person designated by him or by the
mailing of a registered or certified letter containing same, on or to the owner
of the premises to be benefited, or his agent. The certificate of the Clerk of
Council/Finance Director or the return receipt of the postal authorities shall
be prima facie evidence of service.  If no address can be found with reasonable
diligence for a property owner or his agent, service may be had by publishing
the notice once in a daily or weekly newspaper of general circulation in the
Municipality.  The Council may provide compensation for the Clerk of Council/
Finance Director or person designated by him, for the service of such notices,
which shall be included as a cost of the improvement.  (Approved by electors
11-4-86)
   5.   Owner May File Objection.  The owner of any property to be assessed,
who objects to the tentative apportionment of the cost of the improvement to
his property, may file, in writing, with the Clerk of Council/Finance Director
such objection.  Such written objections shall be filed not later than a date
specified in the resolution of necessity, which date shall not be earlier than
fourteen (14) days nor later than thirty (30) days from the service of the last
notice, personally or by mail, or the date of publication as aforesaid,
whichever is later, the objection shall contain an address to which notice of
the hearing provided for hereinafter may be mailed.
(Approved by electors 11-4-86)
   6.   Equalization Board.  In the event any written objection to the
tentative apportionment of costs is filed, the Council shall appoint an
assessment Equalization Board composed of three (3) disinterested freeholders
of the Municipality who shall hold a hearing within twenty (20) days after
appointment.  First class mail notice to the objectors shall be mailed at least
fourteen (14) days before the hearing, to the addresses specified in the
written objections.  The power and duties of the Equalization Board shall be
outlined in Section 727.17 of the Revised Code of Ohio.  Compensation of the
Equalization Board shall be as provided by Council.
   7.   Ordinance Determining to Proceed with the Public Improvement.  After
the expiration of the time for filing objections to the tentative apportionment
of the assessment, or, in the event objections have been filed, after the
report of the Assessment Equalization Board has been approved by Council,
Council shall determine whether or not it will proceed with proposed
improvement.  In the event the Council determines to proceed with the
improvement it shall pass an ordinance reciting such determination, adopt the
estimated assessment, either as filed by the Engineer or as an approved report
of the Assessment Equalization Board, and shall by such ordinance direct the
Engineer to proceed with the completion of detailed working plans,
specifications, and profiles, and shall either direct the Clerk of Council/
Finance Director to advertise for bids for the construction of said
improvement, in accordance with the general law or direct the Mayor to proceed
by the direct employment of labor upon completion of said plans, specifications
and profiles.
(Approved by electors 11-4-86)
   8.   Procedure When Low Bid Exceeds Estimates.  In the event that the lowest
and best bid for the construction of the public improvement exceeds by more
than fifteen percent (15%) the total estimated cost as filed by the Engineer
with the Council prior to the resolution declaring the necessity for the
improvement, then no contract shall be entered into until Council makes a
redetermination by ordinance to proceed with the improvement, after a public
hearing, ten (10) days written notice of which has been given to all of the
persons entitled to notice of the passage of the resolution of necessity, in
the same manner in which notice of the passage of such resolution was given. 
If after such hearing, the Council determines by such ordinance that the
improvement should be made, a contract may be let for the construction of such
improvement on the basis of the lowest and the best bid, or the Mayor may be
directed to make said improvement by the direct employment of labor as herein
provided.
   9.   Assessing Ordinance.  After completion of a public improvement to be
constructed upon an assessment basis and after the actual cost has been
ascertained, the Council shall by ordinance assess, in the manner provided in
resolution of necessity, upon the property designated therein, that portion of
the total cost of the improvement to be paid for by special assessments, and
the assessment on each property shall be increased or decreased in the same
proportion to the estimated assessment on each property as the actual cost of
the improvement bears to the total estimated cost of the improvement upon which
the estimated assessment was based. Such assessment shall be payable as
provided in the resolution of necessity and shall be final upon the adoption of
the ordinance provided for in this subsection.  No publication of the ordinance
provided for in this subsection need be made under the provisions of this
Charter.
   The expenses which may be included in determining the total cost of a public
improvement to be paid for by assessment are as provided in Section 727.08 of
the Revised Code of Ohio. The damages referred to in said section shall be
deemed to be the obvious damage which will result from any improvement referred
to in Chapter 727 R.C., for which it shall be the duty of Council to provide
adequate compensation prior to the final determination and levying of the
assessments for the improvement either by negotiation without formal claim or
procedure or by the determination of a jury.  Nothing herein contained shall
deprive the owner of property of his right to compensation for damage resulting
from the negligent acts of the Municipality or its agents, without the owners
fault.
   There shall be no limitation on the power of the Council to assess the cost
of public improvements other than that the amount of any assessment against any
property shall not exceed the increase in value of property, its highest and
best use considered, as result of the particular improvement to which the
assessment relates, and no other limitation provided by the general law shall
apply under this Charter.  No part of the cost of any improvement made on an
assessment basis shall be required to be paid by the Municipality, but the
Council may determine that such portion as it deems just shall be paid by the
Municipality out of any available appropriate fund.
   Unless the owners of the majority of the footage of property abutting upon a
public improvement or of the area to be assessed for same request such
improvement in the form of a written petition therefor, the resolution
declaring the necessity for such improvement shall require the concurrence of
five (5) members of Council.
   10.   Improvements, other than those for which procedures are provided by
Chapter 729 of the Ohio Revised Code, the construction cost of which does not
exceed one thousand dollars ($1,000), may, by ordinance, be ordered constructed
by contract or by the labor forces of the Municipality, after a joint meeting
of the property owner or owners, the City Engineer, and a majority of the
members of the appropriate committee of Council, of which ten (10) days written
notice is given, by personal service or first class mail.  The total cost of
such improvement may be paid out of any appropriate fund or by the issuance of
notes or bonds of the City authorized by Council, which fund shall be
reimbursed or notes or bonds retired by the levying of assessments,
proportioned to the benefits, upon the specially benefited properties, extended
no longer than ten (10) semi-annual installments.  An improvement, which by its
nature or scope requires its construction as a single project and an
expenditure of more than one thousand dollars ($1,000), may not be divided into
parts so as to bring each part within the purview of this subsection. 
(Approved by electors 5-6-86)
   All other matters relating to public improvements paid for by assessments
shall be governed to the extent applicable by Sections 727.09, 727.10, 727.28

   2.   Vacation.  Property previously dedicated and accepted for Municipal
purposes shall be vacated only by an ordinance for the purpose, adopted by a

notice has been given to all persons in the municipality by advertisement in a
newspaper of general circulation in the Municipality once each week on the same
day of three (3) consecutive weeks, and said hearing shall be not earlier than
thirty (30) days after the last such publication.  Such vacation proceedings
may be instituted upon formal or informal petition or upon Council's own
initiative.
   3.   Purchase, Sale and Lease.  Except as is otherwise provided in this
Charter for the procedures for the purchase of goods and chattels, there shall
be no restriction upon the authority of the Council in the purchase, sale and
lease of, real and personal property.  By ordinance, the Council shall declare
the need for such property as it deems is necessary for Municipal purposes, and
prescribe the terms of the purchase or lease of same, or declare that property
is no longer needed for Municipal purposes or useful as such, absolutely or
temporary, and prescribe the terms of the its sale or lease.  Property valued
by the Clerk of Council/Finance Director at less than five hundred dollars

property is no longer needed for Municipal purposes.
(Approved by electors 11-4-86)
D.   ZONING.
   The Council shall prescribe procedures for the regulation of the use of all

statutory provisions for such zoning shall remain in effect.
   The lawful use of any dwelling, building, or structure and any land or
premises, as existing and lawful at the time of enacting a zoning regulation or
amendment thereto, may be continued, although such use does not conform with
the provisions of such regulations or amendments but if any such nonconforming
use ceases for one (1) year or more, any future use of such land shall be in
conformity with the zoning regulation.  The Council shall provide in any zoning
regulation for the completion, restoration, reconstruction, extension, or
substitution of nonconforming uses upon such reasonable terms as are set forth
in the zoning ordinance.

that Council may hold an executive session at a regular or special meeting by
either placing the item on the agenda or by motion of Council and consent of a

121.22, for the sole purpose of considering any of the following matters:
      (1)   To consider the appointment, employment, dismissal, discipline,
promotion, demotion, or compensation of a public employee or official, or the

Except as otherwise provided by law, Council shall not hold an Executive

performance of his official duties or for his removal from office.

for the sale of property at competitive bidding, if premature disclosure of
information would give an unfair competitive or bargaining advantage to a
person whose personal or private interest is adverse to the general public
interest. No public employee or official shall use this division as a
subterfuge for providing covert information to prospective buyers or sellers. A
purchase or sale of public property is void if the seller or buyer of the
public property has received covert information from a member that has not been
disclosed to the general public in sufficient time for other prospective buyers
and sellers to prepare and submit offers.
         (b)   If the minutes of Council show that all meetings and
deliberations of Council have been conducted in compliance with this section,
any instrument executed by Council purporting to convey, lease, or otherwise

insofar as title or other interest of any bona fide purchasers, lessees, or
transferees of the property is concerned.

involving the city that are the subject of pending, possible, or imminent court
action.

      (5)   Matters required to be kept confidential by federal law or rules or
state statutes.
      (6)   Specialized details of security arrangements where disclosure of
the matters discussed might reveal information that could be used for the
purpose of committing, or avoiding prosecution for, a violation of the law.
      (7)   Conference involving matters pertaining to future development of
the community, including meetings with the Planning Commission or the Community
Improvement Corporation and outside consultants, if premature disclosure of
information could give an unfair competitive or bargaining advantage to any
person.
   (K)   An ordinance or resolution is invalid unless adopted in an open
meeting of the public body. An ordinance or resolution adopted in an open
meeting that results from deliberations in a meeting not open to the public is
invalid unless the deliberations were for a purpose specifically authorized in
division (J) of this section and conducted at an Executive Session held in
compliance with that section.
(Ord. 13-2011, passed 4-20-11)
§ 30.051 CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION.
   (A)   No Councilmember shall disclose or use, without appropriate
authorization, any information acquired in the course of his or her official
duties which has been clearly designated by the presiding officer of the
meeting to him or her as confidential when such confidential designation is
warranted because of the status of the proceedings or the circumstances under
which the information was received, and preserving its confidentiality is
necessary to the proper conduct of government business.
   (B)   Councilmembers who violate this rule shall be subject to expulsion by
a vote of five members of Council, after receiving notice of the charge and an
opportunity to be heard.
(Ord. 13-2011, passed 4-20-11)
§ 30.052  EXECUTIVE SESSIONS - COMMITTEE OF THE WHOLE.
   (A)   The City Council may conduct Executive Sessions of Council, or as they
are referred to in the Charter “Council meeting as a Committee of the Whole”
according to the terms of the Charter and the Council Rules of Procedure.
Although the subject matter of Committee of the Whole meetings or Executive
Sessions is not limited by the Charter, the Council has chosen to limit the
subject matter as set out in §
30.05(J) of the Council Rules of Procedure.
   (B)   The following officials who have traditionally been present at
executive sessions shall continue to be present: the Mayor, Clerk of Council/
Finance Director, City Administrator, Assistant City Administrator and all
Council members. In addition, the Law Director and City Engineer will be in
attendance unless excused. Also members of City Commissions and Boards,
individuals working as consultants for Council and/or other persons required
for discussion on a specific topic may be requested to attend if approved by a
majority of the Council members.
   (C)   There are some instances where individuals may choose to excuse
themselves from an Executive Session. In other instances, it may be desirable
to excuse certain non-elected and contract employees:
      (1)   If there is a conflict of interest or the possibility of a conflict
of interest, any individual participant should request to withdraw from said
Executive Session of Council. If a majority of the Council members feel that
any participant, other than the Council members themselves and the Mayor or
Clerk of Council/Finance Director, should be excluded from any particular
Executive Session of Council for a valid reason, said issue shall be resolved
by a majority vote of the Council members present and voting after an informal
discussion about the potential conflict of interest. A valid reason shall
include, but not be limited to, a conflict of interest as set forth in division
(C)(1) of this section, in addition to those items set forth below in divisions
(C)(2) and (C)(3).
      (2)   In the event that a discussion is scheduled pertaining to job
performance, salary, professional contract or other matters of a personal
nature involving any contract employee or other non-elected official who
normally attends Executive Sessions (for example, Law Director, City Engineer,
City Administrator, Assistant City Administrator), then that individual will be
excused from that portion of the session.
      (3)   In the event that it is determined prior to an Executive Session
that the subject to be discussed does not involve a particular contract
employee or other non-elected official (for example, Law Director, City
Engineer, City Administrator, Assistant City Administrator), then that
individual will be excused prior to the meeting.
   (D)   All subjects discussed in Executive Sessions are considered
confidential unless the President of Council or the person chairing the
Executive Session or Committee of the Whole meeting releases from said
confidentiality. Once confidentiality has been released as provided for in this
section, all those in attendance shall be released from any confidentiality
requirements.
   (E)   Council members who are not present at an Executive Session of Council
may be informed of the content of the Executive Session on a confidential basis
by any other member of Council, provided that the absent Council member is not
precluded from having the information due to conflict that might otherwise
exclude that Council member from participating in the executive session.
(Ord. 13-2011, passed 4-20-11)
§ 30.053  PRE-ELECTION MEETINGS AND MAILINGS.
   Although special meetings called by an elected official and mailings
relative to city business can be paid for at city expense, no such meetings or
mailings shall take place within 75 days prior to any municipal election. It is
the intent of Council that such meetings and mailings not appear to give an
advantage to an elected official over a new candidate. However, any elected
official may call meetings and provide mailings at his or her own expense at
any time. Further, the 75-day limitation shall not apply to special meetings
called by the City Council as a Whole, or to publications or mailings related
to Charter amendment.
(Ord. 13-2011, passed 4-20-11)
§ 30.06  PARLIAMENTARY AUTHORITY.

they are not inconsistent with the Charter or this chapter.

compensatory hours an employee may accumulate; and may require that overtime be
compensated in cash rather than in compensatory time off.
   (G)   Non-Duplication.

on December 1 of each year.  If an employee resigns, retires or dies before
December 1 of any year, his longevity pay shall be prorated for the calendar
year in which he or she resigns, retires or dies. For employees subject to the
Fair Labor Standards Act an annual overtime pay adjustment will be made to
reflect inclusion of longevity pay in the regular hourly rate of such employees
to the extent required by the Fair Labor Standards Act. The amount of the
adjustment, if any, shall be paid at the time of the last regular pay in
December.

the day off.  In recognition of the ten holidays listed above, the maximum
holiday hours available in a calendar year shall be 80 hours, with the
exception of those employees regularly assigned to 8½ hour workdays.  Their

separates from city service prior to the employee's birthday, or Christmas,
shall have his final paycheck reduced by the dollar value of the day or days
used.

each calendar month of service, provided that in each such calendar month, 135
hours are worked.  The maximum sick leave which may be accumulated and carried

has exceeded the maximum of 1,600 hours accrued sick leave shall be entitled to
convert sick leave hours to cash at the rate of two sick leave hours for one
hour of pay for accrued hours in excess of 1,600.  Calculation and payment of

full-time municipal employee who has one year of continuous service as of June
28, 1967, shall be entitled to 120 hours sick leave, and shall accumulate
additional sick leave at the aforesaid rate.  The Mayor may, when in his
absolute discretion he determines that a hardship exists, grant sick leave in
addition to the total accumulated sick leave of any permanent municipal
employee.  Any sick leave over three scheduled work days in length must be
substantiated by a doctor's certificate, acceptable to the city, stating the
exact diagnosis of the employee's condition.  The city also reserves the right
to require a doctor's certificate for sick leave taken immediately prior to or
immediately after a paid holiday or vacation leave.  In addition to the
foregoing, any permanent municipal employee may be granted up to three
scheduled work days paid sick leave at the discretion of the Mayor, in the
event of serious sickness or disability in the employee's immediate family. 
Immediate family means, grandfather, grandmother, father, mother, sister,
brother, sister-in-law, brother-in-law, spouse, child or stepchild of the
employee, the grandfather and grandmother of the employee's spouse, and mother-
in-law and father- in-law of the employee.  However, in the event of a
catastrophic illness of a municipal employee’s spouse, child, stepchild, mother
or father, the Mayor shall have the right to allow the municipal employee who
is assigned to work the following schedules the following amounts of sick
leave. Full-time permanent employees assigned to an 8-hour workday may be
granted use of his/her sick leave up to 480 hours.  Employees assigned to work
an 8.5-hour workday may be granted use up to 477 sick leave hours. Employees
assigned to the 24/48-hour work shift may be granted use up to 510 hours.
Catastrophic illness is defined as a situation where the doctor has indicated
that the individual’s illness is potentially fatal and irreversible, or where
the individual has experienced a physical trauma that is life threatening.  Any
sick leave allowed due to the catastrophic illness of a municipal employee’s
spouse, child, stepchild, father or mother that is requested for more than
three scheduled work days in length shall be subject to periodic review of the
individual’s ongoing medical condition.

been separated from the public service of another governmental agency of the
State of Ohio shall be placed to such employee's credit on employment by the
city, provided such employment by the city takes place within ten years of the
date on which such employee was last terminated from public service with any
other governmental agency in the state. An employee who is entitled to such
credit shall be credited with the unused balance of his accumulated sick leave
up to the maximum of the sick leave accumulation permitted by the city. The
Mayor shall require such employee to furnish a satisfactory written, signed
statement from the prior employer to establish his right to such sick leave
credit.

recommendation of the city's physician, the Mayor may defer granting the injury
leave with pay until after the Bureau of Workers' Compensation has ruled on the
employee's claim. During this period, the employee may draw against his
accumulated sick leave to cover the lost time. In the event that the Bureau of
Workers' Compensation rules in favor of the employee's claim, all such sick
leave hours charged against the employee during the interim period will be
credited back to his accumulated total and the injury leave with pay benefits
will be granted.

related injury, he shall be paid for the remaining hours of that work day, or
shift, at his regular rate. Such time shall not be charged to leave of any

§ 32.18  TUITION REIMBURSEMENT.
   (A)   Each permanent, full-time employee shall be eligible for reimbursement
of tuition.  Tuition must be for courses of instruction taken towards a job-
related degree or job-related courses not necessarily within the degree program
at an accredited school, college or university.  Tuition will be reimbursed up
to three thousand dollars ($3,000) per calendar year per covered employee.
   (B)   All courses must be taken during non-working hours.  All scheduled
hours of courses must be filed and approved by the Department Head and Mayor. 
Any situation which, in the discretion of the Department Head and Mayor would
require an employee's presence on the job, shall take complete and final
precedence over any times scheduled for courses.
   (C)   Financial assistance from governmental or private agencies available
to a covered employee, whether applied for and regardless of when assistance
may have been received, shall be deducted in the entire amount from the total
tuition.  When the employee's tuition is fully covered by another governmental
or private agency, the employee is not entitled to reimbursement.

by the appropriate department head and Mayor.  An employee shall make
application for approval of reimbursement at least 15 days before the start of
the course of study.

§ 32.19  LEAVE OF ABSENCE/FMLA POLICY.
   (A)   Unpaid Leave of Absence.  Leaves of absence are disruptive and
expensive to the city and are not encouraged.  Leaves of absence will be
granted in cases of bona fide necessity, emergency, or when required by
applicable law.  The rules for leaves of absence will be strictly enforced.
   (B)   Unpaid leave of absence for new child care, immediate family invalid
care, and employee illness.  To be eligible for a leave of absence under this
section, an employee must have worked for the city for at least 12 consecutive
months prior to requesting leave and, during those 12 consecutive months, the
employee must have worked no less than 1,250 hours including vacation leave, 
compensatory time and paid holidays.  Sick leave will not count as hours worked
for determining eligibility.  This division (B) applies only to unpaid leaves
of absence for the following reasons:
      (1)   To care for the son or daughter of the employee during the child's
first year of life.
      (2)   Because of the placement with the employee of a son or daughter for
adoption or foster care when the son or daughter is under 18 years of age or,
if over 18 years of age, is incapable of self-care because of disability.
      (3)   In order to care for the spouse, son, daughter, or parent of the
employee, if such spouse, son, daughter, or parent has an illness, injury,
impairment, or physical or mental condition that involves inpatient care in a
hospital, hospice, or residential medical facility, or that involves
significant continuing treatment by a licensed medical doctor, osteopathic
physician or other legitimate provider of recognized efficacious medical
treatment.
      (4)   Because of the inability of the employee to perform the functions
of his or her position due to the employee's illness, injury, impairment or a
physical or mental condition involving inpatient care in a hospital, hospice or
residential medical care facility or that involves continuing treatment by a
medical doctor, osteopathic physician, or other bona fide legitimate provider
of recognized efficacious medical care.
   An employee who meets the service eligibility requirements of this
subsection and who submits a written leave request accompanied by appropriate
documentation of the need for leave for any of the reasons enumerated in
division (B)(1) through (4) shall be entitled to an unpaid leave of absence up
to a total of 12 work weeks of leave during the 12-month period immediately
following the occurrence or onset of the event for which leave is requested
under this division.
   Leave for the reasons stated in items (B)(1) and (B)(2) above concerning
child care may not be taken intermittently. Leave for reasons listed in items
(B)(3) or (B)(4) above concerning invalid care and employee illness may be
taken intermittently when medically necessary.
   The 12-week period of unpaid leave will automatically begin after the
employee uses 15 days of paid leave.  From that point forward and during the
12-week period of leave the employee must use any available paid leave,
including but not limited to, injury-on-duty leave.
   Employees are required to submit leave of absence requests as far in advance
as possible.  In case of leave-causing events which are foreseeable, the
employee must provide the city with a request for leave not less than 30 days
in advance of the foreseeable event or occurrence.
   In the event that two employees of the city are husband and wife and are
both eligible employees of the city, the aggregate number of work weeks of
leave to which both may be entitled will be limited to 12 work weeks during any
12-month period if leave is taken for child care under items (B)(1) or (B) (2)
above or for invalid care of a sick parent under item (B)(3) above.
      (5)   When leave is requested for invalid care or employee illness as
defined in items (B)(3) or (B)(4) above, the city will require, as a condition
of granting leave, adequate documentation of the medical facts claimed by the
employee as the basis for requesting leave.  The employee shall provide to the
city a legible report which provides:
         (a)   The identity, specialty, address, telephone number, and state
professional license number of the health care provider signing the report.
         (b)   The exact medical diagnosis of the condition for which the leave
of absence is requested.
         (c)   The date of onset, progress summary of the condition, and the
probable duration of the condition to the best of the physician' s knowledge
with reasonable medical certainty.
         (d)   Medical facts of the condition, including the objective and
subjective signs and
symptoms, test results, and/or X-ray findings which form the basis of the
diagnosis and prognosis, the specific cognitive and functional limitations
imposed by the medical condition, and, in the case of illness of the employee,
a description of the specific job functions of the employee which would be
impaired by the medical condition.
         (e)   A competent opinion describing the nature of, frequency of and
duration of the time required of the employee to provide necessary care for the
invalid subject of the leave request.
         (f)   If the leave request involves intermittent leave for planned
medical treatment, an opinion setting forth the nature of the treatment, the
dates upon which it will be rendered, the duration of the treatment, and the
probable convalescent time after the treatment.
   In the event that the employee is unable to obtain the above information
within ten days after the date of submission of the leave request, the employee
may be granted leave temporarily upon execution by the employee of an
authorization in favor of the city to obtain directly from the medical
providers involved the information set forth above.
   (C)   If, upon receipt of the information set forth above, the city has
reason to doubt the validity or competency of the information provided, the
city may require the employee to submit to an independent examination by a
health care provider designated by the city and paid by the city.  In the event
of disagreement between the employee's health care provider and the health care
provider designated by the city, the city may require review by a third health
care provider designated or approved jointly by the city and the employee.  The
cost of the third opinion will be borne by the city, and the third opinion will
be final as to the facts known at the time of the review.  The city may require
subsequent evaluation on a reasonable basis as the medical condition progresses
or develops.
   (D)   An eligible employee who takes leave of absence under division (B) of
this section for the reasons stated in division (B) of this section will be
entitled, on return from such leave, and having complied with the requirements
of the city as conditions of the leave, to be restored to the position held by
the employee at the beginning of the unpaid leave or an equivalent position
with equivalent benefits and pay. Seniority and vacation do not accrue during
the period of leave.  However, during the period of leave under division (B) of
this section, the city shall maintain the employee's group health insurance
coverage under the terms, conditions, contributions, and costs that would have
applied had the employee not taken the leave of absence.  In the event that the
city changes insurance companies or plans during the period of leave, the
employee on leave will be treated in the same manner as an employee actively at
work having the same medical conditions and dependents.
   (E)   In the event that an employee fails to return from leave after the
period of leave to which the employee is entitled has expired and fails to
return for a reason other than the continuation, recurrence or onset of a
serious health condition entitling the employee to leave under items (B)(3) and
(B)(4), or for circumstances clearly beyond the control of the employee, the
employer may recover the premium paid by the employer for maintaining health
coverage for the employee during the period of unpaid leave.
   (F)   The city will ordinarily require, in the case of an employee returning
from leave due to his or her own illness, appropriate documentation from the
employee's physician certifying that the employee is in fact capable of
returning to full performance of the essential functions of his or her job.

§ 32.20  TAX DEFERRED SERVICE CREDIT PURCHASE PLAN.
   (A)   The city hereby adopts a plan, as set forth in division (F) of this
section, to allow employees and elected officials who are members of the Public
Employees Retirement System to purchase additional service credit and/or to
redeposit withdrawn contributions on a tax deferred basis as permitted by
Internal Revenue Code Section 414(h)(2), R.C. Chapter 145 and Rule 145-9-08 of
the Ohio Administration Code.
   (B)   A contribution made under this plan, although designated as an
employee contribution, is picked up by the city and is paid by the city as an
employer contribution.
   (C)   A member electing to make contributions under this plan shall not have
the option of receiving the money directly instead of having it paid by the
employer to the pension plan.
   (D)   The plan in an addition to any other plan that may exist allowing for
the purchase of service credit in a public employee retirement system.
   (E)   The Clerk of Council/Finance Director is hereby authorized to
implement this plan in accordance with directives of the Public Employees
Retirement System.
   (F)   Tax deferred service credit purchase plan.
      (1)   Effective June 1, 1998 employees and elective officials of the city
who are contributing members of the Public Employees Retirement System of the
State of Ohio, may purchase additional service credit pursuant to sections R.C.
§§ 145.20, 145.201, 145.28, 145.29, 145.291, 145.293, 145.294, 145.301,
145.302, 145.31 or 145.42 on a tax deferred basis, and the city shall withhold
from the gross pay of each person electing to purchase service credit the
appropriate installment payment as a payroll deduction and shall "pick-up"
(meaning assume and pay) such deduction, and pay to the Public Employees
Retirement System such same deduction as a picked up contribution so as to be
treated as an employer contribution pursuant to Internal Revenue Code section
414(h)(2). A person electing this "pick-up" deduction shall not have the option
of choosing to receive the payroll deduction directly instead of having this
deduction picked up by the city.
      (2)   An election to purchase service credit pursuant to this tax
deferred plan is irrevocable.  Members who elect to participate in this plan
cannot increase, decrease or terminate the amount of the picked-up deduction
until the repayment or purchase is completed in full, or until employment is
terminated. All terminology used in this plan shall have the same meaning as
encompassed in Ohio Administrative Code rule 145-7-02 and any other rule of the
OAC or the Ohio Revised Code where such section, rule, or definition is
essential to accomplish the purchase of service credit on a tax deferred basis.
      (3)   The Clerk of Council/Finance Director shall not accept an election
to purchase service credit by payroll deduction for more than one type of
service credit at the same time, nor for service credit which is being
purchased by a lump sum payment defined in Rule 145-7-02 of the Ohio
Administrative Code.
      (4)   The Clerk of Council/Finance Director shall implement the
provisions of this plan in coordination with the Public Employees Retirement
System. The Clerk of Council/Finance Director shall report to the Public
Employees Retirement System all members who have authorized payroll deductions
pursuant to this tax deferred plan.
      (5)   This plan is a tax deferred plan which means that Federal Income
taxes will not be paid by the employee, or withheld by the employer, on the
amounts deducted for the purchase of service credit. Taxes shall be paid on
such amounts at the time of retirement or refund of such amounts from the
Public Employees Retirement System.

§ 32.21  FIELD TRAINING OFFICER.

Employees in the division who are not on call shall be not entitled to the on-
call compensation.
(Ord. 18-2006, passed 3-15-06)
§ 32.23  SICK LEAVE DONATION PROGRAM.
   Employees shall be permitted to donate accrued but unused sick leave to a
fellow employee who is otherwise eligible to accrue and use sick leave.  The
intent of the sick leave donation program is to allow employees to voluntarily
provide assistance to their co-workers who are in critical need of leave due to
the serious illness or injury of the employee.
   (A)   At the sole discretion of the Mayor or his or her designee, an
employee may receive donated sick leave, up to the number of hours the employee
is scheduled to work each pay period, if the employee who is to receive donated
leave:
      (1)   Has a serious illness or injury as determined by the Mayor or his
or her designee;
      (2)   Has no unused sick leave;
      (3)   Has exhausted or does not qualify for any other form of paid leave
recognized by the City of Springdale; and
      (4)   Has not demonstrated a history of excessive sick leave occurrences.
   (B)   Employees may donate accrued but unused sick leave if the donating
employee:
      (1)   Voluntarily elects to donate sick leave and does so with the
understanding that donated sick leave may not be returned;
      (2)   Donates a minimum of 8 hours; and
      (3)   Retains a sick leave balance of at least 400 hours.
   (C)   The sick leave donation program shall be administered on a pay period
by pay period basis. Employees using donated sick leave shall be considered in
active pay status and shall accrue vacation and holiday hours and be entitled
to any benefits to which they would otherwise be eligible (health insurance,
life insurance, longevity pay, seniority). The employee shall not accrue sick
leave while using donated sick leave. Donated sick leave shall not count toward
the probationary period of an employee.
   (D)   Employees who wish to donate sick leave shall certify:
      (1)   The name of the employee for whom the donated sick leave is
intended;
      (2)   The number of hours to be donated;
      (3)   That the employee will have a minimum sick leave balance of at
least 400 hours; and
      (4)   That the sick leave is donated voluntarily, and the employee
understands that the donated sick leave will not be returned, if used by the
recipient. Any donated but unused sick leave will be returned to the donor upon
the recipient returning to work full-time or his or her resignation/retirement.
   (E)   The City shall ensure that no employees are forced to donate sick
leave. The City shall respect an employee's right to privacy; however, the City
may, with the permission of the employee who is in need of sick leave or a
member of the employee's immediate family, inform employees of their co-
worker's critical need for sick leave. The City shall not directly solicit sick
leave donations from employees. The donation of leave shall occur on a strictly
voluntary basis.
   (F)   Once an employee has been approved to receive donated sick leave, all
records of hours donated and hours used shall be recorded and maintained by the
Finance Department. The names of all donors to an employee's account shall be
held in confidence.

   (A)   A permanent voluntary work furlough program is hereby implemented for

guidelines to implement the program.

SPRINGDALE EXECUTIVE RE-EMPLOYMENT PROGRAM (SERP)
§ 32.30  PURPOSE.
   The purpose of this subchapter is to provide an opportunity for the city to
retain and take advantage of the skills, knowledge, and experience of city
department directors through a re-employment program following their retirement
from the Ohio Public Employee Retirement System (OPERS).
(Ord. 4-2017, passed 1-18-17)
§ 32.31  GENERAL PROVISIONS.
   (A)   An employee serving in the full-time position of a department director
with the city shall be eligible to participate in SERP. The employee must have
attained the required age and service levels of the Traditional Pension Plan as
defined by OPERS. In addition, the employee must have been a full-time city
employee for at least 15 years, with the last five years serving as a
department director.
   (B)   Employees participating or eligible to participate in other retirement
programs such as the Deferred Retirement Option Plan (DROP) are ineligible to
participate in SERP.
   (C)   The Mayor and/or his/her designee shall have the final determination
as to which department directors may be permitted to participate in SERP. It is
with the clear understanding there is nothing that obligates the Mayor or his/
her designee to re-employ an employee who has opted to retire from OPERS. In
other words, the program may not be offered to all department directors.
   (D)   Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, the employee agrees and
understands when participating in SERP, his/her employment will be that of an
at-will employee, meaning he/she may be terminated by the city at the will of
the city, with or without cause, and without recourse to appeal or contest the
termination.
   (E)   SERP employees are exempt from the Fair Labor Standards Act and shall
be paid a salary which compensates them for all hours worked. The SERP employee
shall be considered a full-time employee and shall work a minimum of 40 hours
per week. The SERP employee will not be entitled to receive any additional
compensation for hours worked in excess of their normal work day, work week, or
work period.
   (F)   When retiring under OPERS, the employee is required to no longer be
employed in a position covered by one of the State of Ohio's public employment
retirement systems for a period of two months. If the employee wishes to
continue working in a public employment capacity, the employee will forfeit the
first two months of his/her retirement benefits. It is the city's preference
for the employee to continue his/her employment without a two-month break in
service. In recognition of this preference and upon entering the program, the
employee will be paid the rate he/she was receiving at the time of retirement
(retirement pay rate) for the first two months of the program. At the beginning
of the third month, the employee's compensation shall be calculated at a rate
of 75% of his/her retirement pay rate (SERP pay rate). For example, if the
employee's salary (retirement pay rate) is $85,000 per year at the time he/she
retires and enters the program, the employee will receive compensation at his/
her retirement pay rate for the first two months of the program. Beginning the
third month of the program, the employee's compensation will be adjusted to 75%
of the retirement pay rate, resulting in a SERP pay rate of $63,750.
   (G)   The SERP employee will be eligible for but not entitled to or
guaranteed a cost-of-living wage adjustment if City Council provides one for
other employees of the organization. In addition, if the City Administrator
feels it is warranted, he/she may provide the employee with a merit pay
adjustment, as long as the adjustment falls within the authorized salary range
for the position.
   (H)   A SERP employee shall be entitled to all benefits as provided in the
City of Springdale Policies and Procedures, unless such benefits are defined
within the SERP policy. The following benefits under SERP will be implemented
as follows:
      (1)   Sick leave.
         (a)   The SERP employee will continue to earn and use sick leave as
defined in the city's Sick Leave Policy (No. 203). No sick leave, based upon
the city's "Conversion of Sick Leave at Retirement" policy, shall be paid out
at the time of retirement to the employee entering SERP. The employee's
existing bank of sick leave hours shall remain in place. These sick leave hours
shall serve as the maximum amount the employee will be paid at his/her
retirement pay rate at the conclusion of the program. For example, if the
employee has a balance of 1,300 sick leave hours at retirement, that amount is
the limit in which the employee will be paid at the retirement pay rate when
he/she leaves the program. In addition, if the employee's balance falls
hypothetically to 1,100, the maximum amount of hours eligible to be paid at the
retirement rate is 1,100. Once entering the program, the sick leave hours
eligible for compensation at the retirement rate may decrease, however, will
not increase. Any and all hours accrued after entering the program will be
compensated at the employee's SERP pay rate.
         (b)   In the case of annual conversion of sick leave, the employee's
SERP pay rate will become effective beginning the month he/she enters the
program.
      (2)   Life insurance. The amount will continue to be one times the
employee's salary and will be adjusted to the SERP pay rate during the third
month of the program.
   (I)   Employees wanting to participate in SERP shall provide the City
Administrator with a written notice of their intent to retire and submit a
completed SERP Request to Participate Form. The employee's retirement must not
be contingent upon the employee's ability to participate in SERP.
   (J)   Employees entering SERP will be permitted to participate in the
program up to three years initially. The city may, at its sole discretion,
extend the opportunity to the employee to continue in the program for
additional one-year terms. Each year will be evaluated independently.
   (K)   The SERP program is subject to all provisions of R.C. Chapter 145. The
aforementioned chapter establishes the conditions under which a member of OPERS
may retire from service and subsequently continue working or become re-employed
in a position covered by one of the State of Ohio's public employment
retirement systems.

basis as permitted by Internal Revenue Code Section 414(h)(2).

§ 39.03  DEPOSITORIES.
   (A)   The Clerk of Council/Finance Director shall determine the amount of
public moneys which shall be available in active deposits to:
      (1)   Provide the needed cash flow to pay warrants and checks issued and
outstanding, and to provide for a reasonable surplus in addition to the amount
needed to pay such warrants and checks; and
      (2)   Maximize the interest received on public moneys of the City.
Interest on active deposits shall be paid or credited by the City's designated
eligible depositories at least quarterly and when funds are withdrawn,

the City not deposited in active deposits shall be invested pursuant to Section
39.05 of this chapter.
   (B)   The Finance Committee of Council shall, by a writing filed with the
Council, designate one or more eligible depositories as the depository or
depositories of the City's active deposits.  In making such designation the
Finance Committee of Council shall consider the following:
      (1)   The convenience of the location of the depository's offices;
      (2)   The rate or rates of interest, if any, which the depository will
pay on the active deposits; and
      (3)   Any other terms or conditions with respect to the depository's
acceptance of the City's active deposits.
   (C)   Designation of the eligible depository or depositories for active
deposits shall be subject to confirmation by Council.
   (D)   The initial designation of depositories for the City's active deposits
shall be for a period not to exceed two years plus any designated option
period, the total of which initial designation period and option period shall
not exceed five years.  Said designation period and option period may be made
without giving the notice hereinafter provided for.  Subsequent designations of
depositories for the City's active deposits shall be:
      (1)   For a period specified in the Finance Committee of Council's
written designation of depositories pursuant to division (B) of this section,
which period shall not be less than six months nor longer than two years, plus
any designated option period, the total of which initial designation period and
option period shall not exceed five years, and
      (2)   Shall be made after the Clerk of Council/Finance Director has
provided notice by publication in a newspaper of general circulation once at
least forty-five (45) days prior to the date of the action of the Finance
Committee of Council designating depositories for the City's active deposits. 
Such notice shall:
         (a)   Provide an estimate of the maximum amount of such active
deposits at any time during the period of designation, and the proposed period

         (b)   Request such depositories to apply in writing for all or part of
the City's active deposits on or before a date and time specified in the

willingness to accept without a service charge, other terms or conditions with
respect to the depository's acceptance of all or part of the City's active
deposits and the location of its offices in the City, or if none are located in
the City, the location of its nearest offices; and
         (d)   Include or request any other information to or from such
depositories which the Finance Committee of Council deems relevant.  The
request for written applications or their receipt does not constitute a bidding
procedure. Rather such request and application are intended to provide relevant
information to the Finance Committee of Council for its designation pursuant to
division (B) of this section and to provide notice to eligible depositories
that the City will receive applications and proposals for its active deposits.
   (E)   The Mayor and Clerk of Council/Finance Director shall enter into a
contract, approved as to form and content by the Law Director, with such
depositories for the appropriate period determined pursuant to division (D) of
this section.  Such contract shall establish the service charges, if any, the
depository may make for its services, and other terms or conditions of the
depository's acceptance of the City's active deposits.

on deposit with eligible depositories as set forth in the Uniform Depository
Act shall apply under this chapter.

§ 39.04  SECURITY FOR REPAYMENT OF DEPOSITS.
   (A)   The Clerk of Council/Finance Director, before making the initial
deposit in a public depository pursuant to an award made under Section 39.03 or
pursuant to an investment in a certificate of deposit under Section 39.05 (B)
(7) shall require the institution designated as the depository to pledge to and
deposit with him, as security for the repayment of all public moneys to be
deposited in the depository during the period of designation pursuant to the

amount of public moneys to be at the time so deposited, over and above such
portion or amount of such moneys as are at such time insured by the Federal
Deposit Insurance Corporation or by any other agency or instrumentality of the
Federal government or of the State of Ohio as may be approved by Council.  The
Clerk of Council/Finance Director may require such institution to deposit with
him surety company bonds or other insurance policies approved by Council which,
when executed, shall be for an amount equal to such excess amount.  In the case
of any deposit other than the initial deposit made during the period of
designation, the amount of the aggregate market value of securities required to
be pledged and deposited, or of the surety company bonds required to be
deposited or the other insurance coverage required, shall be equal to the
difference between the amount of public moneys on deposit in such public
depository plus the amount to be so deposited, minus such portion or amount of
the aggregate as is at the time insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance
Corporation or any other instrumentality of the Federal government or of the
State of Ohio as may be approved by Council.  Council may require additional
eligible securities to be deposited to provide for any depreciation which may
occur in the market value of any of the securities so deposited.
   (B)   The following securities shall be eligible for the purposes of this
section:
      (1)   Bonds, notes, or other obligations of the United States; or bonds,
notes, or other obligations guaranteed as to principal and interest by the
United States or those for which the faith of the United States is pledged for
the payment of principal and interest thereon, by language appearing in the
instrument specifically providing such guarantee or pledge and not merely by
interpretation or otherwise;
      (2)   Bonds, notes, debentures, or other obligations or securities issued
by any Federal government agency, or the export-import bank of Washington;
bonds, notes, or other obligations guaranteed as to principal and interest by
the United States or those for which the faith of the United States is pledged
for the payment of principal and interest thereon, by interpretation or
otherwise and not by language appearing in the instrument specifically
providing such guarantee or pledge;
      (3)   Bonds and other obligations of this state;
      (4)   Bonds and other obligations of any county, township, school
district, municipal corporation, including the City, or other legally
constituted taxing subdivision of this state, which is not at the time of such
deposit, in default in the payment of the principal or interest on any of its
bonds or other obligations, for which the full faith and credit of the issuing
subdivisions is pledged;
      (5)   Bonds of other states of the United States which have not during
the ten years immediately preceding the time of such deposit defaulted in
payments of either interest or principal on any of their bonds;
      (6)   Obligations guaranteed as to principal and interest by the Ohio
student loan commission.
   (C)   If the depository fails to pay over any part of the deposit made
therein as provided by law, the Clerk of Council/Finance Director shall sell at
public sale any of the bonds or other securities deposited with him pursuant to
this section or R.C. Section 131.09.  Thirty (30) days' notice of such sale
shall be given in a newspaper of general circulation at the county seat of the
county in which the office of the Clerk of Council/Finance Director is
located.  Pursuant to division (C) of R.C. Section 135.18, when a sale of bonds
or other securities has been so made and upon payment to the Clerk of Council/
Finance Director of the purchase money, the Clerk of Council/Finance Director
shall transfer such bonds or securities whereupon the absolute ownership of
such bonds or securities shall pass to the purchasers, and any surplus
remaining after deducting the amount due the state or subdivision and expenses
of sale shall be paid to the depository.
   (D)   An institution designated as a depository may, by written notice to
the Clerk of Council/Finance Director, designate a qualified trustee and
deposit the eligible securities required by this section with the trustee for
safekeeping for the account of the Clerk of Council/Finance Director and the
institution as a depository, as their respective rights to and interest in such
securities under this section may appear and be asserted by written notice to
or demand upon the trustee pursuant to division (D) of R.C. Section 135.18.  In
such case, the Clerk of Council/Finance Director shall accept the written
receipt of the trustee describing the securities which have been deposited with
the trustee by the depository, a copy of which shall also be delivered to the
depository.  Thereupon all such securities so deposited with the trustee are,
pursuant to division (D) of R.C. Section 135.18, deemed to be pledged with the
Clerk of Council/Finance Director and to be deposited with him, for all the
purposes of this section.
   (E)   The Clerk of Council/Finance Director may make provisions for the
exchange and release of securities and the substitution of other eligible
securities therefor except where the depository has deposited eligible
securities with a trustee for safekeeping as provided in this section.
   (F)   When the depository has deposited eligible securities described in
division (B)(1) of this section with a trustee for safekeeping, the depository
may at any time substitute or exchange eligible securities described in
division (B)(1) of this section having a current market value equal to or
greater than the current market value of the securities then on deposit and for
which they are to be substituted or exchanged, without specific authorization
from the City's Council or Clerk of Counci1/Finance Director of such
substitution or exchange.
   (G)   When the depository has deposited eligible securities described in
divisions (B)(2) to (6) of this section with a trustee for safekeeping, the
depository may at any time substitute or exchange eligible securities having a
current market value equal to or greater than the current market value of the
securities then on deposit and for which they are to be substituted or
exchanged without specific authorization of the Council or the Clerk of
Counci1/Finance Director of any such substitution or exchange only if:
      (1)   The Clerk of Counci1/Finance Director has authorized the depository
to make such substitution or exchange on a continuing basis during a specific
period without prior approval of each substitution or exchange.  Such
authorization may be effected by the Clerk of Counci1/Finance Director sending
to the trustee a written notice stating that substitution may be effected on a
continuing basis during a specified period which shall not extend beyond the
end of the period of designation during which the notice is given.  The trustee
may rely upon such notice and upon the period of authorization stated therein
and upon the period of designation stated therein; or
      (2)   No continuing authorization for substitution has been given by the
Clerk of Counci1/Finance Director, the depository notifies the Clerk of
Counci1/Finance Director and the trustee of an intended substitution or
exchange, and the Clerk of Counci1/Finance Director fails to object to the
trustee as to the eligibility or market value of the securities being
substituted within ten (10) calendar days after the date appearing on the
notice of proposed substitution.  The notice to the Clerk of Counci1/Finance
Director and to the trustee shall be given in writing and delivered personally
or by certified or registered mail with a return receipt requested. The trustee
may assume in any case that the notice has been delivered to the Clerk of
Counci1/Finance Director.  In order for objections of the Clerk of Counci1/
Finance Director to be effective, receipt of the objections must be
acknowledged in writing by the trustee; or
      (3)   The Clerk of Counci1/Finance Director gives written authorization
for a substitution or exchange of specific securities.
   (H)   The depository shall notify the Clerk of Counci1/Finance Director of
any such substitution or exchange under division (G)(1) or (2) of this
section.  Upon request from the Clerk of Counci1/Finance Director, the trustee
shall furnish a statement of the securities pledged against such public
deposits.
   (I)   Any federal reserve bank or branch thereof located in this state,
without compliance with R.C. Sections 1109.03, 1109.04, 1109.17 and 1109.18,
and without becoming subject to R.C. Section 1109.15, or any other law of Ohio
relative to the exercise by corporations of trust powers generally, is
qualified to act as trustee for the safekeeping of securities, under this
section.  Any institution mentioned in R.C. Section 135.03 which holds a
certificate of qualification issued by the superintendent of banks or any
institution complying with R.C. Sections 1109.03, 1109.04, 1109.17 and 1109.18,
is qualified to act as trustee for the safekeeping of securities, other than
those belonging to itself, under this section.  Pursuant to R.C. Section
135.18, upon application to him in writing by any such institution, the
Superintendent of Banks shall investigate the applicant and ascertain whether
or not it has been authorized to execute and accept trusts in Ohio and has safe
and adequate vaults and efficient supervision thereof for the storage and
safekeeping within Ohio of such securities.  If the Superintendent finds that
the applicant has been so authorized and does have such vaults and supervision
thereof, he shall, pursuant to R.C. Section 135.18, approve the application and
issue a certificate to that effect, the original or any certified copy of which
shall be conclusive evidence that the institution therein named is qualified to
act as trustee for the purposes of this section with respect to securities
other than those belonging to itself.
   (J)   Notwithstanding the fact that a depository is required to pledge
eligible securities in certain amounts to secure deposits of public moneys, a
trustee shall have no duty or obligation to determine the eligibility, market
value, or face value of any securities deposited with the trustee by a
depository.  This applies in all situations including, without limitation, a
substitution or exchange of securities.
   (K)   Any charges or compensation of a designated trustee for acting as such
under this section shall be paid by the depository and in no event shall be
chargeable to the City or to the Clerk of Counci1/Finance Director or to any
officer of the City.  Such charges or compensation shall not be a lien or
charge upon the securities deposited for safekeeping prior or superior to the
rights to and interests in such securities of the City or of the Clerk of
Counci1/Finance Director.  The Clerk of Counci1/Finance Director and his
bondsmen or security shall be relived from any liability to the City or to the
depository for the loss or destruction of any securities deposited with a
qualified trustee pursuant to this section.
(Ord. 73-1988,  passed 12-7-88)
§ 39.041  POOLING OF SECURITIES.
   (A)   In lieu of the pledging requirements prescribed in Section 39.04, a
depository, with the consent of the Clerk of Counci1/Finance Director, may
pledge a single pool of eligible securities to secure the repayment of public
moneys deposited in the depository and not otherwise secured pursuant to law,
provided that at all times the total value of the securities so pledged, based
on the valuations prescribed in division (B) of this section, is at least equal
to one hundred ten percent (110%) of the total amount of all public deposits to
be secured by the pooled securities, including the portion of such deposits
covered by any Federal deposit insurance.  Each such depository shall carry in
its accounting records at all times a general ledger or other appropriate
account of the total amount of all public deposits to be secured by the pool,
as determined at the opening of business each day, and the total value of
securities pledged to secure such deposits.
   (B)   The following securities, at the specified valuations, shall be
eligible as collateral for the purposes of division (A) of this section,
provided no such securities pledged as collateral are at any time in default as
to either principal or interest:
      (1)   Obligations of, or fully insured or fully guaranteed by, the United
States or any Federal
government agency:  at face value;
      (2)   Obligations partially insured or partially guaranteed by any
Federal government agency:  at face value;
      (3)   Obligations of, or fully guaranteed by, the Federal national
mortgage association or the federal home loan mortgage corporation:  at face
value;
      (4)   Obligations of any state, county, municipal corporation or other
legally constituted authority of any state or any instrumentality of any state,
county, municipal corporation or other authority, which are secured as to the
payment of principal and interest by the holding in escrow of obligations of
the United States for which the full faith and credit of the United States is
pledged:  at face value;
      (5)   Obligations of the State of Ohio or any county or other legally

of Ohio or such county or other authority:  at face value;
      (6)   Obligations of any other state:  at ninety percent (90%) of face

constituted authority of any other state or any instrumentality of such county,
municipal corporation or other authority:  at eighty percent (80%) of face
value;

attend eligible institutions of education and to their parents, and insured or
guaranteed by the United States or any agency, department or other
instrumentality thereof, or guaranteed by the Ohio student loan commission
pursuant to R.C. Sections 3351.05 to 3351.14:  at face value;
      (9)   Any other obligations the Clerk approves:  at the percentage of
face value he prescribes.
   (C)   The City shall have an undivided security interest in the pool of
securities pledged by a depository pursuant to division (A) of this section in
the proportion that the total amount of the City's public moneys secured by the
pool bears to the total amount of public deposits so secured.
   (D)   A depository pledging pooled securities shall designate a qualified
trustee and deposit with the trustee for safekeeping the eligible securities
pledged pursuant to division (A) of this section.  The depository shall give
written notice of the qualified trustee to the Clerk of Counci1/Finance
Director.  The Clerk of Counci1/Finance Director shall accept the written
receipt of the trustee describing the pool of securities so deposited by the
depository, a copy of which also shall be delivered to the depository.
   (E)   Any federal reserve bank or branch thereof located in the State of
Ohio, without compliance with R.C. Sections 1109.03, 1109.04, 1109.17 and
1109.18, and without becoming subject to R.C. Section 1109.15 or any other law
of the State of Ohio relative to the exercise by corporations of trust powers
generally, is qualified to act as trustee for the safekeeping of securities,
under this section.  Any institution mentioned in division (A) of R.C. Section
135.03 or division (A) of R.C. Section 135.32 which holds a certificate of
qualification issued by the Superintendent of Banks, or any institution
complying with R.C. Sections 1109.03, 1109.04, 1109.17 and 1109.18 is qualified
to act as trustee for the safekeeping of securities under this section, other
than those belonging to itself or to an affiliate as defined in division (A) of
R.C. Section 1101.01.  Pursuant to R.C. Section 135.181, upon application to
him in writing by any such institution, the Superintendent of Banks shall
investigate the applicant and ascertain whether or not it has been authorized
to execute and accept trusts in Ohio and has safe and adequate vaults and
efficient supervision thereof for the storage and safekeeping within Ohio of
such securities.  If the Superintendent finds that the applicant has been so
authorized and does have such vaults and supervision thereof, he shall,
pursuant to R.C. Section 135.181, approve the application and issue a
certificate to that effect, the original of any certified copy of which shall
be conclusive evidence that the institution therein named is qualified to act
as trustee for the purposes of this section with respect to securities other
than those belonging to itself.
   (F)   The depository at any time may substitute, exchange or release
eligible securities deposited with a qualified trustee pursuant to this
section, provided that such substitution, exchange or release does not reduce
the total value of the securities, based on the valuations prescribed in
division (B) of this section, to an amount that is less than one hundred ten
percent (110%) of the total amount of public deposits as determined pursuant to
division (A) of this section.
   (G)   Notwithstanding the fact that a depository is required to pledge
eligible securities in certain amounts to secure deposits of public moneys, a
trustee shall have no duty or obligation to determine the eligibility, market
value or face value of any securities deposited with the trustee by a
depository.  This applies in all situations including, but not limited to, a
substitution or exchange of securities, but excluding those situations
effectuated by division (H) of this section in which the trustee is required to
determine face and market value.
   (H)   If the depository fails to pay over any part of the public moneys made
therein as provided by law and secured pursuant to division (A) of this
section, the Clerk of Counci1/Finance Director shall give written notice of
this failure to the qualified trustee holding the pool of securities pledged
against public moneys deposited in the depository, and at the same time shall
send a copy of this notice to the depository. Upon receipt of such notice the
trustee shall transfer to the Clerk of Counci1/Finance Director for public sale
such of the pooled securities as may be necessary to produce an amount equal to
the deposits made by the Clerk of Counci1/Finance Director, less the portion of
such deposits covered by any federal deposit insurance, plus any accrued
interest due on such deposits. The Clerk of Counci1/Finance Director shall sell
at public sale any of the bonds or other securities 80 transferred.  Thirty
(30) days' notice of such sale shall be given in a newspaper of general
circulation in the City.  When a sale of bonds or other securities has been so
made and upon payment to the Clerk of Counci1/Finance Director of the purchase
money, the Clerk of Counci1/Finance Director shall transfer such bonds or
securities whereupon the absolute ownership of such bonds or securities shall
pass to the purchasers.  Any surplus after deducting the amount due the City
and expenses of sale shall be paid to the depository.
   (I)   Any charges or compensation of a designated trustee for acting as such
under this section shall be paid by the depository and in no event shall be
chargeable to the City or Clerk of Counci1/Finance Director. Such charges or
compensation shall not be a lien or charge upon the securities deposited for
safekeeping prior or superior to the rights to and interests in such securities
of the City or Clerk of Counci1/Finance Director. The Clerk of Counci1/Finance
Director and his bondsmen or surety shall be relieved from any liability to the
City or to the depository for the loss or destruction of any securities
deposited with a qualified trustee pursuant to this section.
   (J)   In lieu of placing its unqualified endorsement on each security, a
depository pledging securities pursuant to division (A) of this section that
are not negotiable without its endorsement or assignment may furnish to the
qualified trustee holding the securities an appropriate resolution and
irrevocable power of attorney authorizing the trustee to assign the
securities.  The resolution and power of attorney shall conform to such terms
and conditions as the trustee prescribes.
   (K)   Upon request of the Clerk of Counci1/Finance Director, a depository
shall report the amount of public moneys deposited by the Clerk of Counci1/
Finance Director and secured pursuant to division (A) of this section, and the
total value, based on the valuations prescribed in division (B) of this
section, of the pool of securities pledged to secure public deposits held by
the depository, including those deposited by the Clerk of Counci1/Finance
Director. Upon request of the Clerk of Counci1/Finance Director, a qualified
trustee shall report such total value of the pool of securities deposited with
it by the depository and shall provide an itemized list of the securities in
the pool. These reports shall be made as of the date the Clerk of Counci1/
Finance Director specifies.

§ 71.06 (4511.65)  THROUGH STREETS; STOP AND YIELD RIGHT-OF-WAY SIGNS.
   (A)   All state routes are hereby designated as through highways, provided
that stop signs, yield signs, or traffic-control signals shall be erected at
all intersections with such through highways by the Department of
Transportation as to highways under its jurisdiction and by local authorities
as to highways under their jurisdiction, except as otherwise provided in this
section. Where two or more state routes that are through highways intersect,
and no traffic-control signal is in operation, stop signs or yield signs shall
be erected at one or more entrances thereto by the Department or by local
authorities having jurisdiction, except as otherwise provided in this section.
Whenever the Director of Transportation determines on the basis of an
engineering and traffic investigation that stop signs are necessary to stop
traffic on a through highway for safe and efficient operation, nothing in this
section shall be construed to prevent such installations. When circumstances
warrant, the Director also may omit stop signs on roadways intersecting through
highways under his or her jurisdiction. Before the Director either installs or
removes a stop sign under this division, he or she shall give notice, in
writing, of that proposed action to the affected local authority at least 30
days before installing or removing the stop sign.
   (B)   Other streets or highways, or portions thereof, are hereby designated
as through highways if they are within the municipality, if they have a
continuous length of more than one mile between the limits of the street or
highway or portion thereof, and if they have stop or yield signs or traffic-
control signals at the entrances of the majority of intersecting streets or
highways. For purposes of this section, the limits of the street or highway, or
portion thereof, shall be the municipal corporation line, the physical terminus
of the street or highway, or any point on the streets or highway at which
vehicular traffic thereon is required by regulatory signs to stop or yield to
traffic on the intersecting street, provided, that in residence districts, the
municipality may by ordinance designate such street or highway, or portion
thereof, not to be a through highway and thereafter the affected residence
district shall be indicated by official traffic-control devices. Where two or
more through highways designated under this division intersect and no traffic-
control signal is in operation, stop signs or yield signs shall be erected at
one or more entrances thereto by the Department or by local authorities having
jurisdiction, except as otherwise provided in this section.
   (C)   The Department or local authorities having jurisdiction need not erect
stop signs at intersections they find to be so constructed as to permit traffic
to safely enter a through highway without coming to a stop. Signs shall be
erected at such intersections indicating that the operator of a vehicle shall
yield the right-of-way to or merge with all traffic proceeding on the through
highway.
   (D)   Local authorities, with reference to highways under their
jurisdiction, may designate additional through highways, and shall erect stop
signs, yield signs, or traffic-control signals at all streets and highways
intersecting such through highways, or may designate any intersection as a stop
or yield intersection, and shall erect like signs at one or more entrances to
the intersection.

§ 71.07 (4511.13)  SIGNAL LIGHTS.
   Highway traffic signal indications for vehicles and pedestrians shall have
the following meanings:
   (A)   Steady green signal indication.
      (1)   (a)   Vehicular traffic facing a circular green signal indication
is permitted to proceed straight through or turn right or left or make a u-turn
movement except as such movement is modified by a lane-use sign, turn
prohibition sign, lane marking, roadway design, separate turn signal
indication, or other traffic control device. Such vehicular traffic, including
vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn movement, shall yield the
right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         (b)   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn
movement to the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching
from the opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard
during the time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the
intersection.
      (2)   Vehicular traffic facing a green arrow signal indication, displayed
alone or in combination with another signal indication, is permitted to
cautiously enter the intersection only to make the movement indicated by such
arrow, or such other movement as is permitted by other indications displayed at
the same time. Such vehicular traffic, including vehicles turning right or left
or making a u-turn movement, shall yield the right-of-way to both of the
following:
         (a)   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
         (b)   Other traffic lawfully using the intersection.
      (3)   (a)   Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication,
as provided in R.C. § 4511.14, pedestrians facing a circular green signal
indication are permitted to proceed across the roadway within any marked or
unmarked associated crosswalk. The pedestrian shall yield the right-of-way to
vehicles lawfully within the intersection or so close as to create an immediate
hazard at the time that the green signal indication is first displayed.
         (b)   Pedestrians facing a green arrow signal indication, unless
otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or other traffic control
device, shall not cross the roadway.
   (B)   Steady yellow signal indication.
      (1)   Vehicular traffic facing a steady circular yellow signal indication
is thereby warned that the related green movement or the related flashing arrow
movement is being terminated or that a steady red signal indication will be
exhibited immediately thereafter when vehicular traffic shall not enter the
intersection. The provisions governing vehicular operation under the movement
being terminated shall continue to apply while the steady circular yellow
signal indication is displayed.
      (2)   Vehicular traffic facing a steady yellow arrow signal indication is
thereby warned that the related green arrow movement or the related flashing
arrow movement is being terminated. The provisions governing vehicular
operation under the movement being terminated shall continue to apply while the
steady yellow arrow signal indication is displayed.
      (3)   Pedestrians facing a steady circular yellow or yellow arrow signal
indication, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication as
provided in R.C. § 4511.14 or other traffic control device, shall not start to
cross the roadway.
   (C)   Steady red signal indication.
      (1)   (a)   Vehicular traffic facing a steady circular red signal
indication, unless entering the intersection to make another movement permitted
by another signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop line; but if
there is no stop line, traffic shall stop before entering the crosswalk on the
near side of the intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, then before
entering the intersection; and shall remain stopped until a signal indication
to proceed is displayed except as provided in divisions (C)(1), (C)(2), and (C)
(3) of this section.
         (b)   Except when a traffic control device is in place prohibiting a
turn on red or a steady red arrow signal indication is displayed, vehicular
traffic facing a steady circular red signal indication is permitted, after
stopping, to enter the intersection to turn right, or to turn left from a one-
way street into a one-way street. The right to proceed with the turn shall be
subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a stop at a stop
sign.
      (2)   (a)   Vehicular traffic facing a steady red arrow signal indication
shall not enter the intersection to make the movement indicated by the arrow
and, unless entering the intersection to make another movement permitted by
another signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop line; but if
there is no stop line, before entering the crosswalk on the near side of the
intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, then before entering the
intersection; and shall remain stopped until a signal indication or other
traffic control device permitting the movement indicated by such red arrow is
displayed.
         (b)   When a traffic control device is in place permitting a turn on a
steady red arrow signal indication, vehicular traffic facing a steady red arrow
indication is permitted, after stopping, to enter the intersection to turn
right, or to turn left from a one-way street into a one-way street. The right
to proceed with the turn shall be limited to the direction indicated by the
arrow and shall be subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a
stop at a stop sign.
      (3)   Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication as
provided in R.C. § 4511.14 or other traffic control device, pedestrians facing
a steady circular red or steady red arrow signal indication shall not enter the
roadway.
      (4)   Local authorities by ordinance, or the Director of Transportation
on state highways, may prohibit a right or a left turn against a steady red
signal at any intersection, which shall be effective when signs giving notice
thereof are posted at the intersection.
   (D)   Flashing green signal indication. A flashing green signal indication
has no meaning and shall not be used.
   (E)   Flashing yellow signal indication.
      (1)   (a)   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing
a flashing circular yellow signal indication, is permitted to cautiously enter
the intersection to proceed straight through or turn right or left or make a u-
turn movement except as such movement is modified by lane-use signs, turn
prohibition signs, lane markings, roadway design, separate turn signal
indications, or other traffic control devices. Such vehicular traffic,
including vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn movement, shall
yield the right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         (b)   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn
to the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching from the
opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard during the
time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the intersection.
      (2)   (a)   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing
a flashing yellow arrow signal indication, displayed alone or in combination
with another signal indication, is permitted to cautiously enter the
intersection only to make the movement indicated by such arrow, or other such
movement as is permitted by other signal indications displayed at the same
time. Such vehicular traffic, including vehicles turning right or left or
making a u-turn, shall yield the right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         (b)   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn
to the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching from the
opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard during the
time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the intersection.
      (3)   Pedestrians facing any flashing yellow signal indication at an
intersection, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or
other traffic control device, are permitted to proceed across the roadway
within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk. Pedestrians shall yield the
right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the
flashing yellow signal indication is first displayed.
      (4)   When a flashing circular yellow signal indication is displayed as a
beacon to supplement another traffic control device, road users are notified
that there is a need to pay additional attention to the message contained
thereon or that the regulatory or warning requirements of the other traffic
control device, which might not be applicable at all times, are currently
applicable.
   (F)   Flashing red signal indication.
      (1)   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing circular red signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop
line; but if there is no stop line, before entering the crosswalk on the near
side of the intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, at the point nearest the
intersecting roadway where the driver has a view of approaching traffic on the
intersecting roadway before entering the intersection. The right to proceed
shall be subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a stop at a
stop sign.
      (2)   Pedestrians facing any flashing red signal indication at an
intersection, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or
other traffic control device, are permitted to proceed across the roadway
within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk. Pedestrians shall yield the
right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the
flashing red signal indication is first displayed.
      (3)   When a flashing circular red signal indication is displayed as a
beacon to supplement another traffic control device, road users are notified
that there is a need to pay additional attention to the message contained
thereon or that the regulatory requirements of the other traffic control
device, which might not be applicable at all times, are currently applicable.
Use of this signal indication shall be limited to supplementing stop, do not
enter, or wrong way signs, and to applications where compliance with the
supplemented traffic control device requires a stop at a designated point.
   (G)   In the event an official traffic-control signal is erected and
maintained at a place other than an intersection, the provisions of this
section shall be applicable except as to those provisions which by their nature
can have no application. Any stop required shall be made at a sign or marking
on the pavement indicating where the stop shall be made, but in the absence of
any such sign or marking the stop shall be made at the signal.
   (H)   This section does not apply at railroad grade crossings. Conduct of
drivers of vehicles approaching railroad grade crossings shall be governed by
R.C. §§ 4511.61 and 4511.62.

§ 71.08 (4511.131)  SIGNALS OVER REVERSIBLE LANES.
   The meanings of lane-use control signal indications are as follows:
   (A)   A steady downward green arrow. A road user is permitted to drive in
the lane over which the arrow signal indication is located.
   (B)   A steady yellow “X”. A road user is to prepare to vacate the lane over
which the signal indication is located because a lane control change is being
made to a steady red “X” signal indication.
   (C)   A steady white two-way left-turn arrow. A road user is permitted to
use a lane over which the signal indication is located for a left turn, but not
for through travel, with the understanding that common use of the lane by
oncoming road users for left turns also is permitted.
   (D)   A steady white one-way left-turn arrow. A road user is permitted to
use a lane over which the signal indication is located for a left turn, without
opposing turns in the same lane, but not for through travel.
   (E)   A steady red “X”. A road user is not permitted to use the lane over
which the signal indication is located and that this signal indication shall
modify accordingly the meaning of other traffic controls present.

   Whenever special pedestrian-control signals exhibiting the words “walk” or
“don’t walk”, or the symbol of a walking person or an upraised palm are in
place, these signals shall indicate the following instructions:
   (A)   A steady walking person signal indication, which symbolizes “walk”,
means that a pedestrian facing the signal indication is permitted to start to
cross the roadway in the direction of the signal indication, possibly in
conflict with turning vehicles. The pedestrian shall yield the right-of-way to
vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the walking person
signal indication is first shown.
   (B)   A flashing upraised hand signal indication, which symbolizes “don't
walk”, means that a pedestrian shall not start to cross the roadway in the
direction of the signal indication, but that any pedestrian who has already
started to cross on a steady walking person signal indication shall proceed to
the far side of the traveled way of the street or highway, unless otherwise

section or for an equivalent offense that is vehicle-related, if there was at
the time the bodily substance was withdrawn a concentration of less than the
applicable concentration of alcohol specified in divisions (A)(1)(b), (A)(1)
(c), (A)(1)(d) and (A)(1)(e) of this section or less than the applicable
concentration of a listed controlled substance or a listed metabolite of a
controlled substance specified for a violation of division (A)(1)(j) of this
section, that fact may be considered with other competent evidence in
determining the guilt or innocence of the defendant. This division does not
limit or affect a criminal prosecution for a violation of division (B) of this
section.
      (3)   Upon the request of the person who was tested, the results of the
chemical test shall be made available to the person or the person’s attorney,
immediately upon the completion of the chemical test analysis. If the chemical
test was obtained pursuant to division (D)(1)(b) of this section, the person
tested may have a physician, a registered nurse, or a qualified technician,
chemist, or phlebotomist of the person’s own choosing administer a chemical
test or tests, at the person’s expense, in addition to any administered at the
request of a law enforcement officer. If the person was under arrest as
described in R.C. § 4511.191(A)(5), the arresting officer shall advise the
person at the time of the arrest that the person may have an independent
chemical test taken at the person’s own expense. If the person was under arrest
other than described in R.C. § 4511.191(A)(5), the form to be read to the
person to be tested, as required under R.C. § 4511.192, shall state that the
person may have an independent test performed at the person’s expense. The
failure or inability to obtain an additional chemical test by a person shall
not preclude the admission of evidence relating to the chemical test or tests
taken at the request of a law enforcement officer.

violation of division (A) or (B) of this section, of a municipal ordinance
relating to operating a vehicle while under the influence of alcohol, a drug of
abuse, or alcohol and a drug of abuse, or of a municipal ordinance relating to
operating a vehicle with a prohibited concentration of alcohol, a controlled
substance, or a metabolite of a controlled substance in the whole blood, blood
serum or plasma, breath, or urine, if a law enforcement officer has
administered a field sobriety test to the operator of the vehicle involved in
the violation and if it is shown by clear and convincing evidence that the
officer administered the test in substantial compliance with the testing
standards for any reliable, credible, and generally accepted field sobriety
tests that were in effect at the time the tests were administered, including,
but not limited to, any testing standards then in effect that were set by the
National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, all of the following apply:

admissible under the Rules of Evidence, the court shall admit the testimony or
evidence and the trier of fact shall give it whatever weight the trier of fact
considers to be appropriate.
         (c)   Division (D)(4)(b) of this section does not limit or preclude a
court, in its determination of whether the arrest of a person was supported by
probable cause or its determination of any other matter in a criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding of a type described in that division,
from considering evidence or testimony that is not otherwise disallowed by
division (D)(4)(b) of this section.

      (2)   Notwithstanding any other provision of law regarding the admission
of evidence, a report of the type described in division (E)(1) of this section
is not admissible against the defendant to whom it pertains in any proceeding,
other than a preliminary hearing or a grand jury proceeding, unless the
prosecutor has served a copy of the report on the defendant’s attorney or, if
the defendant has no attorney, on the defendant.
      (3)   A report of the type described in division (E)(1) of this section

ordered unless the court is presented with current proof of financial
responsibility with respect to that vehicle.

that are issued in accordance with this division, except upon renewal as
specified in R.C. § 4503.10, when the regular fee is provided in R.C. § 4503.04

circumventing the provisions of this section, it may certify its consent to the
owner and to the registrar of motor vehicles who shall enter notice of the
transfer of the title of the motor vehicle in the vehicle registration record.

was convicted of or pleaded guilty to two or more violations of division (B)(1)

has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to any violation of this section or a
substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the offense is a misdemeanor of

any recommendations of the physician or chiropractor as noted on the affidavit.
   (I)   Nothing in this section shall be construed to require any person to
carry with the person the birth certificate of a child to prove the age of the
child, but the production of a valid birth certificate for a child showing that
the child was not of an age to which this section applies is a defense against
any ticket, citation, or summons issued for violating this section.

the failure of a person to ensure that each minor who is a passenger of an
automobile being operated by that person is wearing all of the available
elements of a properly adjusted occupant restraining device in violation of
division (B)(2) of this section shall not be considered or used by the trier of
fact in a tort action as evidence of negligence or contributory negligence.
But, the trier of fact may determine based on evidence admitted consistent with
the Ohio Rules of Evidence that the failure contributed to the harm alleged in
the tort action and may diminish a recovery of compensatory damages that
represents non-economic loss, as defined in R.C. § 2307.011, in a tort action
that could have been recovered but for the plaintiff’s failure to wear all of
the available elements of a properly adjusted occupant restraining device.
Evidence of that failure shall not be used as a basis for a criminal
prosecution of the person other than a prosecution for a violation of this
section; and shall not be admissible as evidence in a criminal action involving
the person other than a prosecution for a violation of this section.

with occupant restraining devices, any occupant of the passenger car who
sustained injury or death was not wearing an available occupant restraining
device, was not wearing all of the available elements of such a device, or was
not wearing such a device as properly adjusted, then, consistent with the Rules
of Evidence, the fact that the occupant was not wearing the available occupant
restraining device, was not wearing all of the available elements of such a
device, or was not wearing such a device as properly adjusted is admissible in
evidence in relation to any claim for relief in a tort action to the extent
that the claim for relief satisfies all of the following:
         (a)   It seeks to recover damages for injury or death to the occupant;
         (b)   The defendant in question is the manufacturer, designer,
distributor, or seller of the passenger car;
         (c)   The claim for relief against the defendant in question is that
the injury or death sustained by the occupant was enhanced or aggravated by
some design defect in the passenger car or that the passenger car was not
crashworthy.

R.C. §§ 4513.01 to 4513.37.
         (b)   Upon any highway under the jurisdiction of municipality except
those highways with a condition insufficient to bear the weight of the vehicle
or combination of vehicles as stated in the application.
         (c)   Issuance of a special regional heavy hauling permit is subject
to the payment of a fee established by the municipality in accordance with this
section.
      (2)   In circumstances where a person is not eligible to receive a permit
under division (A)(1) of this section, the municipality, with respect to
highways under its jurisdiction, upon application in writing and for good cause
shown, may issue a special permit in writing authorizing the applicant to
operate or move a vehicle or combination of vehicles of a size or weight of
vehicle or load exceeding the maximum specified in R.C. §§ 5577.01 through
5577.09, or otherwise not in conformity with R.C. §§ 4513.01 through 4513.37,

vehicle or combination of vehicles described in the permit on any highway that
is a part of the state highway system, when the movement is partly within and
partly without the corporate limits of the municipality.  No local authority
shall require any other permit or license or charge any license fee or other
charge against the holder of a permit for the movement of a vehicle or
combination of vehicles on any highway which is a part of the state highway
system.  The Director shall not require the holder of a permit issued by the
municipality to obtain a special permit for the movement of vehicles or
combination of vehicles on highways within the jurisdiction of the
municipality.  Permits may be issued for any period of time not to exceed one
year, as the local authority in its discretion determines advisable, or for the
duration of any public construction project.
   (C)   (1)   The application for a permit issued under this section shall be
in the form that the municipality prescribes. The municipality may prescribe a
permit fee to be imposed and collected when any permit described in this
section is issued. The permit fee may be in an amount sufficient to reimburse
the municipality for the administrative costs incurred in issuing the permit,
and also to cover the cost of normal and expected damage caused to the roadway
or a street or highway structure as the result of the operation of the
nonconforming vehicle or combination of vehicles.
      (2)   For the purposes of this section and of rules adopted by the

under R.C. § 4513.34, three or fewer aluminum coils, transported by a vehicle,
are deemed a nondivisible load. The Director shall adopt rules establishing

permit specified in division (A)(2) of this section.  If a permit is to be
issued, the municipality may limit or prescribe conditions of operation for the
vehicle, and may require the posting of a bond or other security conditioned
upon the sufficiency of the permit fee to compensate for damage caused to the
roadway or a street or highway structure.  In addition, the municipality, as a
condition of issuance of an overweight permit, may require the applicant to
develop and enter into a mutual agreement with the municipality to compensate
for or to repair excess damage caused to the roadway by travel under the
permit.
   (E)   Every permit issued under this section shall be carried in the vehicle

for a special permit under this section upon a finding based on a reasonable
belief that the applicant has done any of the actions specified in R.C. §
4513.34(F).
   (G)   Notice and procedures for debarment shall be as provided in R.C. §
4513.34(G).

section that relate to an approved route except upon order of a law enforcement
officer or authorized agent of the issuing authority.
   (I)   A permit issued by the municipality under this section for the
operation of a vehicle or combination of vehicles is valid for the purposes of
the vehicle operation in accordance with the conditions and limitations
specified on the permit. Such a permit is voidable by law enforcement only for
operation of a vehicle or combination of vehicles in violation of the weight,
dimension, or route provisions of the permit. However, a permit is not voidable
for operation in violation of a route provision of a permit if the operation is
upon the order of a law enforcement officer.
(R.C. § 4513.34) (Rev. eff. with 2020 S-22)
   (J)   Local permit and conditions.
      (1)   Upon application and for good cause, the police chief may issue a

such vehicle or combination of vehicles by designating the route, hours, speed
or such other restrictions as may be necessary for the preservation of the
public peace, property, health and safety. The police chief may require the
posting of bond or other security necessary to compensate for any damage to a
roadway or road structure.
      (4)   For each such permit, the police chief shall charge $2 and for each
hour of time or any part thereof spent by the police department in supervising
the movement of such vehicle, the applicant shall pay the sum of $5.

posted with signs indicating "no thru trucks - gross weight 5 tons" or words of
similar import to apprise drivers of the limitations imposed by this section.
No driver shall disobey the instructions indicated on any such sign.
      (6)   Violation of any of the limitations, terms or conditions of the
permit granted by the police chief shall be cause for immediate revocation or
suspension of such permit and denial of request for any future permit.

§ 90.01  RUNNING AT LARGE PROHIBITED.
   (A)   The purpose of this section is to protect the health, safety and
welfare of the citizens of Springdale. This section is intended to prevent
animals from causing personal injury and property damage, spreading disease,
and from creating the perceived threat of harm within close proximity to public

   (B)   An animal “running at large” as used in this section shall mean any
animal which is free to roam without any visible form of control or not within
the physical control of its owner. Some visible forms of control are leashes,
chains, fences and cages. An animal shall not be deemed to comply with this
section when it is regulated by an electronic dog containment system.
   (C)   No person, being the owner of any animal, or harboring or having
charge or control of the same, shall permit the animal to run at large in any
street, lane, alley, or on public grounds of the city, or within six feet of a
public right-of-way, even if the animal is constrained by an electronic dog
containment system. Nor shall said person permit the animal to go on or enter
any private yard, lot, or enclosure of another.

control of the same to demonstrate and prove that the animal was under a
visible form of control or within the physical control of its owner.  The owner
shall be strictly liable and it shall not be a defense that they did not
knowingly allow the animal to run at large.
   (E)   The running at large of any animal in or on any of the places
mentioned in this section is prima facie evidence that it is running at large
in violation of this section.
   (F)   It shall be the duty of the members of the Police Department to

sidewalks, yards and all areas of the city; and lack of intent is not a defense
to a violation thereof.
   (F)   The city shall have the authority to determine if a dog qualifies as a
vicious dog. The city shall give the dog owner written notice of such
determination by regular mail or personal service. The notice shall include the
reasons for the determination as a vicious dog. If the owner denies that the
dog is a vicious dog, the owner may appeal the city's decision to a hearing
officer by filing with a written request for a hearing with the Police
Department within ten days of the date that the notice was mailed to the owner
by regular mail or from when the owner was personally served with the notice.
   (G)   The hearing officer shall hold a hearing within a reasonable period of
time on any appeal from the city's determination that a dog is a vicious dog.
The owner, the city or its agent, and any other persons having relevant

After the closing of the hearing, the hearing officer shall issue an order
containing his or her determination, which shall be final.
   (H)   Once the owner has received notice of the city's determination, the
owner shall comply with the restrictions specified in this chapter until such
time as the city's determination is reversed on appeal. Failure to comply with
the specified restrictions pending the completion of all appeals shall be a
violation of this chapter, for which a fine can be imposed pursuant to division
90.15(I) of this section.
   (I)   (1)   Whoever violates this section shall be fined not more than
$1,000, or imprisoned for not more than 60 days, or both.
      (2)   When any person is found guilty of a second offense of this
section, such person may be imprisoned for not more than 60 days, and shall be
fined $1,000, which fine shall be mandatory, and shall not be suspended or
remitted.
      (3)   Additionally, the court may order the offender to obtain liability
insurance pursuant to division (C) of this section.
      (4)   In addition, any vicious dog which attacks a human being or another
domestic animal may be ordered destroyed when, in the court's judgment, such
vicious dog represents a continuing threat of serious harm to human beings, or
other domestic animals. Any person found guilty of violating §
90.15 shall pay all expenses, including shelter, food, veterinary expenses for
identification or certification of the breed of the animal or boarding and
veterinary expenses necessitated by the seizure of any dog for the protection
of the public, and such other expenses as may be required for the destruction

excuse a permit holder or an agent or employee of a permit holder from
exercising reasonable diligence to determine, the following:

order to have the authority to impose, enforce, administer and collect a
municipal income tax.
   (B)   As mandated by H.B. 5, municipal income tax Ordinance 26-2015,

state's contact period test or bright-line test and resulting determination
have no bearing on municipal residency or domicile.
   (C)   All applicable factors are provided in R.C. § 718.012.
94.043  EXEMPTION FOR MEMBER OR EMPLOYEE OF GENERAL ASSEMBLY AND CERTAIN
JUDGES.
   (A)   Only the municipal corporation of residence shall be permitted to levy

   (A)   (1)   Each employer, agent of an employer, or other payer located or
doing business in the municipality shall withhold from each employee an amount
equal to the qualifying wages of the employee earned by the employee in the
municipality multiplied by the applicable rate of the municipality's income
tax, except for qualifying wages for which withholding is not required under
Section 94.052 of this chapter or division (D) or (F) of this section.  An
employer, agent of an employer, or other payer shall deduct and withhold the
tax from qualifying wages on the date that the employer, agent, or other payer
directly, indirectly, or constructively pays the qualifying wages to, or
credits the qualifying wages to the benefit of, the employee.
      (2)   In addition to withholding the amounts required under division (A)
(1) of this section, an employer, agent of an employer, or other payer may also
deduct and withhold, on the request of an employee, taxes for the municipal
corporation in which the employee is a resident.
   (B)   (1)   An employer, agent of an employer, or other payer shall remit to
the Tax Administrator of the municipality the greater of the income taxes
deducted and withheld or the income taxes required to be deducted and withheld

not later than the 15th day of the month following the end of each calendar
quarter.
         (b)   Taxes required to be deducted and withheld shall be remitted
monthly to the Tax Administrator if the total taxes deducted and withheld or
required to be deducted and withheld by the employer, agent, or other payer on
behalf of the municipal corporation in the preceding calendar year exceeded
$2,399, or if the total amount of taxes deducted and withheld or required to be
deducted and withheld on behalf of the municipality in any month of the
preceding calendar quarter exceeded $200. Payment under division (B)(1)(b) of
this section shall be made so that the payment is received by the Tax
Administrator not later than 15 days after the last day of each month.
   (C)   An employer, agent of an employer, or other payer shall make and file
a return showing the amount of tax withheld by the employer, agent, or other
payer from the qualifying wages of each employee and remitted to the Tax
Administrator.  A return filed by an employer, agent, or other payer under this
division shall be accepted by the municipality as the return required of an
employee whose sole income subject to the tax under this chapter is the

other payer, unless the  municipality requires all resident individual
taxpayers to file a tax return under Section 94.091 of this chapter.
   (D)   An employer, agent of an employer, or other payer is not required to

respect to whose stock the option has been issued or of such corporation's
successor entity.
   (E)   (1)   An employee is not relieved from liability for a tax by the
failure of the employer, agent of an employer, or other payer to withhold the
tax as required under this chapter or by the employer's, agent's, or other
payer's exemption from the requirement to withhold the tax.
      (2)   The failure of an employer, agent of an employer, or other payer to
remit to the municipality the tax withheld relieves the employee from liability
for that tax unless the employee colluded with the employer, agent, or other
payer in connection with the failure to remit the tax withheld.
   (F)   Compensation deferred before June 26, 2003, is not subject to any
municipal corporation income tax or municipal income tax withholding
requirement to the extent the deferred compensation does not constitute
qualifying wages at the time the deferred compensation is paid or distributed.
   (G)   Each employer, agent of an employer, or other payer required to
withhold taxes is liable for the payment of that amount required to be
withheld, whether or not such taxes have been withheld, and such amount shall
be deemed to be held in trust for the municipality until such time as the
withheld amount is remitted to the Tax Administrator.
   (H)   On or before the last day of February of each year, an employer shall
file a Withholding Reconciliation Return with the Tax Administrator listing the

municipality during the preceding calendar year, the amount of tax withheld, if
any, from each such employee's qualifying wage, the total amount of qualifying
wages paid to such employee during the preceding calendar year, the name of

other payer with control or direct supervision of or charged with the
responsibility for withholding the tax or filing the reports and making
payments as required by this section, shall be personally liable for a failure
to file a report or pay the tax due as required by this section. The
dissolution of an employer, agent of an employer, or other payer does not
discharge the officer's or employee's liability for a failure of the employer,
agent of an employer, or other payer to file returns or pay any tax due.
   (J)   An employer is required to deduct and withhold municipal income tax on
tips and gratuities received by the employer's employees and constituting

corporations. The allocation shall be made using any fair and reasonable
method, including, but not limited to, an equal allocation among such municipal
corporations or an allocation based upon the time spent or sales made by the
employee in each such municipal corporation. A municipal corporation to which
qualifying wages are allocated under this division shall be the employee's
"principal place of work" with respect to those qualifying wages for the
purposes of this section.
   For the purposes of this division, the location at which an employee spends
a particular day shall be deemed in accordance with division (B)(2) of this
section, except that "location" shall be substituted for "municipal
corporation" wherever "municipal corporation" appears in that division.
   (B)   (1)   Subject to divisions (C), (E), (F), and (G) of this section, an

at the location for more than 20 days.
         (c)   The employee is a resident of the municipality and has requested
that the employer withhold tax from the employee's qualifying wages as provided
in Section 94.051 of this chapter.
         (d)   The employee is a professional athlete, professional
entertainer, or public figure, and the qualifying wages are paid for the
performance of services in the employee's capacity as a professional athlete,
professional entertainer, or public figure within the municipality.
      (2)   For the purposes of division (B)(1) of this section, an employee
shall be considered to have spent a day performing services in a municipal
corporation only if the employee spent more time performing services for or on
behalf of the employer in that municipal corporation than in any other
municipal corporation on that day.  For the purposes of determining the amount
of time an employee spent in a particular location, the time spent performing
one or more of the following activities shall be considered to have been spent
at the employee's principal place of work:
         (a)   Traveling to the location at which the employee will first
perform services for the employer for the day;
         (b)   Traveling from a location at which the employee was performing
services for the employer to any other location;
         (c)   Traveling from any location to another location in order to pick
up or load, for the purpose of transportation or delivery, property that has

         (e)   Traveling from the location at which the employee makes the
employee's final delivery or pick-up for the day to either the employee's
principal place of work or a location at which the employee will not perform
services for the employer.
   (C)   If the principal place of work of an employee is located in a
municipal corporation that imposes an income tax in accordance with this
chapter, the exception from withholding requirements described in division (B)
(1) of this section shall apply only if, with respect to the employee's
qualifying wages described in that division, the employer withholds and remits
tax on such qualifying wages to the municipal corporation in which the
employee's principal place of work is located.
   (D)   (1)   Except as provided in division (D)(2) of this section, if,
during a calendar year, the number of days an employee spends performing
personal services in a municipal corporation exceeds the 20-day threshold
described in division (B)(1) of this section, the employer shall withhold and
remit tax to that municipal corporation for any subsequent days in that
calendar year on which the employer pays qualifying wages to the employee for
personal services performed in that municipal corporation.
      (2)   An employer required to begin withholding tax for a municipal
corporation under division (D)(1) of this section may elect to withhold tax for
that municipal corporation for the first 20 days on which the employer paid
qualifying wages to the employee for personal services performed in that
municipal corporation.
      (3)   If an employer makes the election described in division (D)(2) of
this section, the taxes withheld and paid by such an employer during those
first 20 days to the municipal corporation in which the employee's principal
place of work is located are refundable to the employee.
   (E)   Without regard to the number of days in a calendar year on which an
employee performs personal services in any municipal corporation, an employer
shall withhold municipal income tax on all of the employee's qualifying wages
for a taxable year and remit that tax only to the municipal corporation in
which the employer's fixed location is located if the employer qualifies as a
small employer as defined in §
94.03 of this chapter. To determine whether an employer qualifies as a small
employer for a taxable year, a Tax Administrator may require the employer to
provide the Tax Administrator with the employer's federal income tax return for
the preceding taxable year.
   (F)   Divisions (B)(1) and (D) of this section shall not apply to the extent
that a Tax Administrator and an employer enter into an agreement regarding the
manner in which the employer shall comply with the requirements of Section
94.051 of this chapter.

the winnings from which each such amount was withheld, the type of casino
gaming that resulted in such winnings, and any other information required by
the Tax Administrator. With this return, the casino operator shall remit
electronically to the municipality all amounts deducted and withheld during the
preceding month.
      (2)   Annually, on or before the 31st day of January, a casino operator

withheld.
      (5)   If a casino operator sells the casino facility or otherwise quits
the casino business, the amounts deducted and withheld along with any penalties

         (a)   A receipt from the Tax Administrator showing that the amounts
deducted and withheld and penalties and interest thereon have been paid;
         (b)   A certificate from the Tax Administrator indicating that no

successor is personally liable for the payment of the amounts deducted and
withheld and penalties and interest thereon.
      (6)   The failure of a casino operator to deduct and withhold the
required amount from a person's winnings does not relieve that person from
liability for the municipal income tax with respect to those winnings.
   (D)   If a person's prize award from a video lottery terminal is an amount
for which reporting to the internal revenue service is required by § 6041 of
the Internal Revenue Code, as amended, the video lottery sales agent shall
deduct and withhold municipal income tax from the person's prize award at the
rate of the tax imposed by the municipal corporation in which the video lottery

other information required by the Tax Administrator. With the return, the video
lottery sales agent shall remit electronically to the Tax Administrator all
amounts deducted and withheld during the preceding month.
      (3)   A video lottery sales agent shall maintain a record of all receipts
issued under division (E) of this section and shall make those records
available to the Tax Administrator upon request. Such records shall be

remitted. If the name, address, or social security number of a person or the
amount deducted and withheld with respect to that person was omitted on a
monthly return for that reporting period, that information shall be indicated
on the annual return.
      (5)   Annually, on or before the 31st day of January, a video lottery
sales agent shall issue an information return to each person with respect to
whom an amount has been deducted and withheld during the preceding calendar
year. The information return shall show the total amount of municipal income
tax deducted and withheld from the person's prize award by the video lottery
sales agent during the preceding year. A video lottery sales agent shall
provide to the Tax Administrator of the municipal corporation a copy of each
information return issued under this division.  Tax Administrator may require
that such copies be transmitted electronically.
      (6)   A video lottery sales agent who fails to file a return and remit
the amounts deducted and withheld is personally liable for the amount deducted

and interest imposed for the late filing of a return or the late payment of tax
deducted and withheld.
   (F)   If a video lottery sales agent ceases to operate video lottery
terminals, the amounts deducted and withheld along with any penalties and
interest thereon are immediately due and payable. The successor of the video
lottery sales agent that purchases the video lottery terminals from the agent

the amounts deducted and withheld and any penalties and interest thereon until
the predecessor video lottery sales agent operator produces either of the
following:
      (1)   A receipt from the Tax Administrator showing that the amounts

are due. If the successor fails to withhold purchase money, the successor is
personally liable for the payment of the amounts deducted and withheld and
penalties and interest thereon.
   (G)   The failure of a video lottery sales agent to deduct and withhold the
required amount from a person's prize award does not relieve that person from
liability for the municipal income tax with respect to that prize award.
   (H)   If a casino operator or lottery sales agent files a return late, fails
to file a return, remits amounts deducted and withheld late, or fails to remit
amounts deducted and withheld as required under this section, the Tax

   (A)   "Income" reduced by "exempt income" to the extent otherwise included
in income, multiplied by apportionment, further reduced by any "pre-2017 net
operating loss carry-forward" equals "municipal taxable income".
      (1)   "Income" for a taxpayer that is not an individual means the "net
profit" of the taxpayer. 
         (i)   "Net profit" for a person other than an individual is defined in
§
94.03(23).
         (ii)   "Adjusted federal taxable income" is defined in §

personal property owned or used by the taxpayer in the business or profession
in the municipality during the taxable period to the average original cost of
all of the real and tangible personal property owned or used by the taxpayer in

property rented or leased by the taxpayer and the value of such property shall
be determined by multiplying the annual rental thereon by eight;
      (2)   Wages, salaries, and other compensation paid during the taxable
period to individuals employed in the business or profession for services
performed in the municipality to wages, salaries, and other compensation paid
during the same period to individuals employed in the business or profession,

which taxes are not required to be withheld under Section 94.052 of this
chapter;
      (3)   Total gross receipts of the business or profession from sales and

portion of the income of the taxpayer, an alternative apportionment method
involving one or more of the following:
         (a)   Separate accounting;
         (b)   The exclusion of one or more of the factors;
         (c)   The inclusion of one or more additional factors that would
provide for a more fair apportionment of the income of the taxpayer to the
municipality;
         (d)   A modification of one or more of the factors.
      (2)   A taxpayer request to use an alternative apportionment method shall
be in writing and shall accompany a tax return, timely filed appeal of an
assessment, or timely filed amended tax return. The taxpayer may use the
requested alternative method unless the Tax Administrator denies the request in
an assessment issued within the period prescribed by §
94.19(A) of this chapter.
      (3)   A Tax Administrator may require a taxpayer to use an alternative
apportionment method as described in division (B)(1) of this section only by

inquiry, review, court-martial, or similar administrative, judicial, or
legislative matter or proceeding is being conducted, provided that the
compensation is paid for services performed for, or on behalf of, the employer
or that the employee's presence at the location directly or indirectly benefits
the employer;
      (3)   Any other location, if the Tax Administrator determines that the
employer directed the employee to perform the services at the other location in
lieu of a location described in division (C)(1) or (2) of this section solely
in order to avoid or reduce the employer's municipal income tax liability. If a
Tax Administrator makes such a determination, the employer may dispute the
determination by establishing, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the Tax
Administrator's determination was unreasonable.

corporation from a stock of goods located within the municipal corporation.
         (b)   The property is delivered within the municipal corporation from

corporation to purchasers outside the municipal corporation, provided that the
taxpayer is not, through its own employees, regularly engaged in the

      (2)   Gross receipts from the sale of services shall be sitused to the
municipal corporation to the extent that such services are performed in the
municipal corporation.
      (3)   To the extent included in income, gross receipts from the sale of
real property located in the municipal corporation shall be sitused to the
municipal corporation.
      (4)   To the extent included in income, gross receipts from rents and
royalties from real property located in the municipal corporation shall be
sitused to the municipal corporation.
      (5)   Gross receipts from rents and royalties from tangible personal
property shall be sitused to the municipal corporation based upon the extent to
which the tangible personal property is used in the municipal corporation.
   (E)   The net profit received by an individual taxpayer from the rental of
real estate owned directly by the individual or by a disregarded entity owned
by the individual shall be subject to tax only by the municipal corporation in

separate accounting for the purpose of calculating net profit sitused under
this division to the municipal corporation in which the property is located.
   (F)   (1)   Except as provided in division (F)(2) of this section,
commissions received by a real estate agent or broker relating to the sale,
purchase, or lease of real estate shall be sitused to the municipal corporation

ratio of the commissions the agent or broker received from the sale, purchase,
or lease of real estate located in the municipal corporation to the commissions
received from the sale, purchase, or lease of real estate everywhere in the
taxable year.
      (2)   An individual who is a resident of a municipal corporation that
imposes a municipal income tax shall report the individual's net profit from
all real estate activity on the individual's annual tax return for that
municipal corporation. The individual may claim a credit for taxes the
individual paid on such net profit to another municipal corporation to the
extent that such credit is allowed under Section 94.081 of this chapter.
   (G)   If, in computing a taxpayer's adjusted federal taxable income, the
taxpayer deducted any amount with respect to a stock option granted to an
employee, and if the employee is not required to include in the employee's
income any such amount or a portion thereof because it is exempted from
taxation under divisions (11)(L) and (34)(A)(iv) of §
94.03 of this chapter, by a municipal corporation to which the taxpayer has
apportioned a portion of its net profit, the taxpayer shall add the amount that
is exempt from taxation to the taxpayer's net profit that was apportioned to
that municipal corporation.  In no case shall a taxpayer be required to add to
its net profit that was apportioned to that municipal corporation any amount
other than the amount upon which the employee would be required to pay tax were
the amount related to the stock option not exempted from taxation.  This
division applies solely for the purpose of making an adjustment to the amount
of a taxpayer's net profit that was apportioned to a municipal corporation
under this section.

         (a)   The election is binding for a five-year period beginning with
the first taxable year of the initial election unless a change in the reporting
method is required under federal law;
         (b)   The election continues to be binding for each subsequent five-
year period unless the taxpayer elects to discontinue filing consolidated
municipal income tax returns under division (B)(2) of this section; or
         (c)   A taxpayer receives permission from the Tax Administrator. The
Tax Administrator shall approve such a request for good cause shown.
      (2)   An election to discontinue filing consolidated municipal income tax
returns under this section must be made in the first year following the last
year of a five-year consolidated municipal income tax return election period in
effect under division (B)(1) of this section. The election to discontinue
filing a consolidated municipal income tax return is binding for a five-year
period beginning with the first taxable year of the election.
      (3)   An election made under division (B)(1) or (2) of this section is
binding on all members of the affiliated group of corporations subject to a
municipal income tax.
   (C)   A taxpayer that is a member of an affiliated group of corporations
that filed a consolidated federal income tax return for a taxable year shall
file a consolidated municipal income tax return for that taxable year if the
Tax Administrator determines, by a preponderance of the evidence, that
intercompany transactions have not been conducted at arm's length and that
there has been a distortive shifting of income or expenses with regard to
allocation of net profits to the municipal corporation. A taxpayer that is
required to file a consolidated municipal income tax return for a taxable year
shall file a consolidated municipal income tax return for all subsequent
taxable years unless the taxpayer requests and receives written permission from
the Tax Administrator to file a separate return or a taxpayer has experienced a
change in circumstances.
   (D)   A taxpayer shall prepare a consolidated municipal income tax return in
the same manner as is required under the United States Department of Treasury
regulations that prescribe procedures for the preparation of the consolidated
federal income tax return required to be filed by the common parent of the
affiliated group of which the taxpayer is a member.
   (E)   (1)   Except as otherwise provided in divisions (E)(2), (3), and (4)
of this section, corporations that file a consolidated municipal income tax
return shall compute adjusted federal taxable income, as defined in §
94.03(1) of this chapter, by substituting "consolidated federal taxable income"
for "federal taxable income" wherever "federal taxable income" appears in that
division and by substituting "an affiliated group of corporation's" for "a C
corporation's" wherever "a C corporation's" appears in that division.
      (2)   No corporation filing a consolidated municipal income tax return
shall make any adjustment otherwise required under division (1) of §
94.03 of this chapter to the extent that the item of income or deduction
otherwise subject to the adjustment has been eliminated or consolidated in the
computation of consolidated federal taxable income.
      (3)   If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having at least
80% of the value of its ownership interest owned or controlled, directly or
indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is included in that
affiliated group's consolidated federal taxable income for a taxable year, the
corporation filing a consolidated municipal income tax return shall do one of
the following with respect to that pass-through entity's net profit or loss for
that taxable year:
         (a)   Exclude the pass-through entity's net profit or loss from the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purpose of making the computations required in Section 94.062 of this chapter,
exclude the property, payroll, and gross receipts of the pass-through entity in
the computation of the affiliated group's net profit sitused to a municipal
corporation. If the entity's net profit or loss is so excluded, the entity
shall be subject to taxation as a separate taxpayer on the basis of the
entity's net profits that would otherwise be included in the consolidated
federal taxable income of the affiliated group.
         (b)   Include the pass-through entity's net profit or loss in the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purpose of making the computations required in Section 94.062 of this chapter,
include the property, payroll, and gross receipts of the pass-through entity in
the computation of the affiliated group's net profit sitused to a municipal
corporation. If the entity's net profit or loss is so included, the entity
shall not be subject to taxation as a separate taxpayer on the basis of the
entity's net profits that are included in the consolidated federal taxable
income of the affiliated group.
      (4)   If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having less than
80% of the value of its ownership interest owned or controlled, directly or
indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is included in that
affiliated group's consolidated federal taxable income for a taxable year, all
of the following shall apply:
         (a)   The corporation filing the consolidated municipal income tax
return shall exclude the pass-through entity's net profit or loss from the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purposes of making the computations required in Section 94.062 of this chapter,
exclude the property, payroll, and gross receipts of the pass-through entity in
the computation of the affiliated group's net profit sitused to a municipal
corporation;
         (b)   The pass-through entity shall be subject to municipal income
taxation as a separate taxpayer in accordance with this chapter on the basis of
the entity's net profits that would otherwise be included in the consolidated
federal taxable income of the affiliated group.
   (F)   Corporations filing a consolidated municipal income tax return shall
make the computations required under Section 94.062 of this chapter by
substituting "consolidated federal taxable income attributable to" for "net
profit from" wherever "net profit from" appears in that section and by
substituting "affiliated group of corporations" for "taxpayer" wherever
"taxpayer" appears in that section.
   (G)   Each corporation filing a consolidated municipal income tax return is
jointly and severally liable for any tax, interest, penalties, fines, charges,
or other amounts imposed by a municipal corporation in accordance with this
chapter on the corporation, an affiliated group of which the corporation is a
member for any portion of the taxable year, or any one or more members of such
an affiliated group.
   (H)   Corporations and their affiliates that made an election or entered
into an agreement with a municipal corporation before January 1, 2016, to file
a consolidated or combined tax return with such municipal corporation may
continue to file consolidated or combined tax returns in accordance with such
election or agreement for taxable years beginning on and after January 1, 2016.
94.064  TAX CREDIT FOR BUSINESSES THAT FOSTER NEW JOBS IN OHIO.
   The municipality, by ordinance, may grant a refundable or nonrefundable
credit against its tax on income to a taxpayer to foster job creation in the

as a percentage of the new income tax revenue the municipality derives from new
employees of the taxpayer and shall be for a term not exceeding 15 years.
Before the municipality passes an ordinance granting a credit, the municipality
and the taxpayer shall enter into an agreement specifying all the conditions of
the credit.
94.065  TAX CREDITS TO FOSTER JOB RETENTION.
   The municipality, by ordinance, may grant a refundable or nonrefundable

§ 94.07  DECLARATION OF ESTIMATED TAX.
   (A)   As used in this section:

the current taxable year, on the form prescribed by the Tax Administrator, if
the amount payable as estimated taxes is at least $200. For the purposes of
this section:
         (a)   Taxes withheld from qualifying wages shall be considered as paid
to the municipal corporation for which the taxes were withheld in equal amounts
on each payment date. If the taxpayer establishes the dates on which all
amounts were actually withheld, the amounts withheld shall be considered as
paid on the dates on which the amounts were actually withheld.
         (b)   An overpayment of tax applied as a credit to a subsequent

"date of the postmark" means, in the event there is more than one date on the

estimated taxes.
      (3)   The declaration of estimated taxes shall be filed on or before the
date prescribed for the filing of municipal income tax returns under division

fourth month of the first taxable year after the taxpayer becomes subject to
tax for the first time.
      (4)   Taxpayers reporting on a fiscal year basis shall file a declaration
on or before the 15th day of the fourth month after the beginning of each
fiscal year or period.
      (5)   The original declaration or any subsequent amendment may be
increased or decreased on or before any subsequent quarterly payment day as
provided in this section.
   (C)   (1)   The required portion of the tax liability for the taxable year
that shall be paid through estimated taxes made payable to the municipality or
Tax Administrator, including the application of tax refunds to estimated taxes
and withholding on or before the applicable payment date, shall be as follows:
         (a)   On or before the 15th day of the fourth month after the
beginning of the taxable year, 22.5% of the tax liability for the taxable year;
         (b)   On or before the 15th day of the sixth month after the beginning
of the taxable year, 45% of the tax liability for the taxable year;
         (c)   On or before the 15th day of the ninth month after the beginning
of the taxable year, 67.5% of the tax liability for the taxable year;
         (d)   On or before the 15th day of the 12th month of the taxable year,

      (2)   A taxpayer may amend a declaration under rules prescribed by the

balance shown due on the amended declaration shall be paid in equal
installments on or before the remaining payment dates.  The amended declaration
must be filed on the next applicable due date as outlined in (C)(1)(a) through
(d) of this section.
      (3)   On or before the 15th day of the fourth month of the year following
that for which the declaration or amended declaration was filed, an annual
return shall be filed and any balance which may be due shall be paid with the
return in accordance with Section 94.091 of this chapter.
         (a)   For taxpayers who are individuals, or who are not individuals
and are reporting and filing on a calendar year basis, the annual tax return is
due on the same date as the filing of the federal tax return, unless extended
pursuant to R.C. § 5747.08(G).
         (b)   For taxpayers who are not individuals, and are reporting and
filing on a fiscal year basis or any period other than a calendar year, the
annual return is due on the 15th day of the fourth month following the end of
the taxable year or period.
      (4)   An amended declaration is required whenever the taxpayer's
estimated tax liability changes during the taxable year.  A change in estimated
tax liability may either increase or decrease the estimated tax liability for
the taxable year.
   (D)   (1)   In the case of any underpayment of any portion of a tax
liability, penalty and interest may be imposed pursuant to §
94.10 of this chapter  upon  the  amount  of  underpayment  for  the  period 
of underpayment, unless the underpayment is due to reasonable cause as
described in division (E) of this section. The amount of the underpayment shall
be determined as follows:

tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by the date prescribed for that
payment;
         (d)   For the fourth payment of estimated taxes each year, 90% of the
tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by the date prescribed for that
payment.
      (2)   The period of the underpayment shall run from the day the estimated
payment was required to be made to the date on which the payment is made. For
purposes of this section, a payment of estimated taxes on or before any payment
due date shall be considered a payment of any previous underpayment only to the
extent the payment of estimated taxes exceeds the amount of the payment
presently required to be paid to avoid any penalty.
   (E)   An underpayment of any portion of tax liability determined under
division (D) of this section shall be due to reasonable cause and the penalty
imposed by this section shall not be added to the taxes for the taxable year if
any of the following apply:
      (1)   The amount of estimated taxes that were paid equals at least 90% of
the tax liability for the current taxable year, determined by annualizing the
income received during the year up to the end of the month immediately
preceding the month in which the payment is due.
      (2)   The amount of estimated taxes that were paid equals at least 100%
of the tax liability shown on the return of the taxpayer for the preceding
taxable year, provided that the immediately preceding taxable year reflected a
period of 12 months and the taxpayer filed a return with the municipal
corporation under Section 94.091 of this chapter for that year.
      (3)   The  taxpayer  is  an  individual  who  resides  in  the
municipality  but was not domiciled there on the first day of January of the
calendar year that includes the first day of the taxable year.
   (F)   A Tax Administrator may waive the requirement for filing a declaration
of estimated taxes for any class of taxpayers after finding that the waiver is
reasonable and proper in view of administrative costs and other factors.

§ 94.08  CREDIT FOR TAX PAID.
94.081
   (A)   Where a resident of this municipality is subject to a municipal income
tax in another municipality and/or county, they shall not pay a total municipal
income tax on that portion of income taxed by another municipality and/or
county greater than the tax imposed at the higher rate.
   (B)   Income taxable under this chapter that is subject to an earnings tax
in another municipality and/or county shall be allowed a credit (subject to the
provisions of division (C) below) against the tax imposed by this chapter. The
credit shall be the amount of tax assessed by the other municipality and/or
county and paid by or on behalf of the taxpayer to such other municipality and/
or county. The credit shall not exceed the tax assessed by this chapter on that
portion of income earned in such other municipality and/or county where such
tax is paid.
   (C)   Credit will be given for municipal and/or county taxes only to the
extent that the tax is used for the general operating and capital expenditures
of a municipality and/or county and is the equivalent of the earnings tax
levied by this city. Credit will not given for municipal and/or county taxes
specifically dedicated for mental health, schools, and the like.
   (D)   No claim for credit or refund shall be allowed unless the taxpayer
provides employer documentation identifying each municipality and/or county for
which tax was withheld from the taxpayer's wages, salaries, commissions and/or
all other compensation for other municipalities and/or counties.

   (A)   As used in this section:
      (1)   "Nonqualified deferred compensation plan" means a compensation plan
described in § 3121(v)(2)(C) of the Internal Revenue Code.
      (2)   (a)   Except as provided in division (A)(2)(b) of this section,
"qualifying loss" means the excess, if any, of the total amount of compensation
the payment of which is deferred pursuant to a nonqualified deferred
compensation plan over the total amount of income the taxpayer has recognized
for federal income tax purposes for all taxable years on a cumulative basis as
compensation with respect to the taxpayer's receipt of money and property
attributable to distributions in connection with the nonqualified deferred
compensation plan.
         (b)   If, for one or more taxable years, the taxpayer has not paid to
one or more municipal corporations income tax imposed on the entire amount of
compensation the payment of which is deferred pursuant to a nonqualified
deferred compensation plan, then the "qualifying loss" is the product of the
amount resulting from the calculation described in division (A)(2)(a) of this
section computed without regard to division (A)(2)(b) of this section and a
fraction the numerator of which is the portion of such compensation on which
the taxpayer has paid income tax to one or more municipal corporations and the
denominator of which is the total amount of compensation the payment of which
is deferred pursuant to a nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
         (c)   With respect to a nonqualified deferred compensation plan, the
taxpayer sustains a qualifying loss only in the taxable year in which the
taxpayer receives the final distribution of money and property pursuant to that
nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
      (3)   "Qualifying tax rate" means the applicable tax rate for the taxable
year for which the taxpayer paid income tax to a municipal corporation with
respect to any portion of the total amount of compensation the payment of which
is deferred pursuant to a nonqualified deferred compensation plan. If different
tax rates applied for different taxable years, then the "qualifying tax rate"
is a weighted average of those different tax rates. The weighted average shall
be based upon the tax paid to the municipal corporation each year with respect
to the nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
   (B)   (1)   Except as provided in division (D) of this section, a refundable
credit shall be allowed against the income tax imposed by a municipal
corporation for each qualifying loss sustained by a taxpayer during the taxable
year. The amount of the credit shall be equal to the product of the qualifying
loss and the qualifying tax rate.
      (2)   A taxpayer shall claim the credit allowed under this section from
each municipal corporation to which the taxpayer paid municipal income tax with
respect to the nonqualified deferred compensation plan in one or more taxable
years.
      (3)   If a taxpayer has paid tax to more than one municipal corporation
with respect to the nonqualified deferred compensation plan, the amount of the
credit that a taxpayer may claim from each municipal corporation shall be
calculated on the basis of each municipal corporation's proportionate share of
the total municipal corporation income tax paid by the taxpayer to all
municipal corporations with respect to the nonqualified deferred compensation
plan.
      (4)   In no case shall the amount of the credit allowed under this
section exceed the cumulative income tax that a taxpayer has paid to a
municipal corporation for all taxable years with respect to the nonqualified
deferred compensation plan.
   (C)   (1)   For purposes of this section, municipal corporation income tax
that has been withheld with respect to a nonqualified deferred compensation
plan shall be considered to have been paid by the taxpayer with respect to the
nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
      (2)   Any municipal income tax that has been refunded or otherwise
credited for the benefit of the taxpayer with respect to a nonqualified
deferred compensation plan shall not be considered to have been paid to the
municipal corporation by the taxpayer.
   (D)   The credit allowed under this section is allowed only to the extent
the taxpayer's qualifying loss is attributable to:
      (1)   The insolvency or bankruptcy of the employer who had established
the nonqualified deferred compensation plan; or
      (2)   The employee's failure or inability to satisfy all of the
employer's terms and conditions necessary to receive the nonqualified deferred
compensation.
94.083  CREDIT FOR PERSON WORKING IN JOINT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT DISTRICT OR
ZONE.
   A municipality shall grant a credit against its tax on income to a resident
of the municipality who works in a joint economic development zone created
under R.C. § 715.691 or a joint economic development district created under
R.C. §§ 715.70, 715.71, or 715.72 to the same extent that it grants a credit
against its tax on income to its residents who are employed in another
municipal corporation, pursuant to Section 94.081 of this chapter.
94.084  CREDIT FOR TAX BEYOND STATUTE FOR OBTAINING REFUND.
   (A)   Income tax that has been deposited or paid to the municipality, but
should have been deposited or paid to another municipal corporation, is
allowable by the municipality as a refund, but is subject to the three-year
limitation on refunds as provided in Section 94.096 of this chapter.
   (B)   Income tax that should have been deposited or paid to the
municipality, but was deposited or paid to another municipal corporation, shall
be subject to collection and recovery by the municipality.  To the extent a
refund of such tax or withholding is barred by the limitation on refunds as
provided in Section 94.096, the municipality will allow a non-refundable credit
equal to the tax or withholding paid to the other municipality against the
income tax the municipality claims is due. If the municipality's tax rate is
higher, the tax representing the net difference of the tax rates is also
subject to collection by the municipality, along with any penalty and interest
accruing during the period of nonpayment.
   (C)   No carry-forward of credit will be permitted when the overpayment is
beyond the three-year limitation for refunding of same as provided in Section
94.096 of this chapter.
   (D)   Nothing in this section requires a municipality to allow credit for
tax paid to another municipal corporation if the municipality has reduced
credit for tax paid to another municipal corporation.  Section 94.081 of this
chapter regarding any limitation on credit shall prevail.

chapter, the Tax Administrator may require taxpayers to file returns and make
payments other than as provided in this section, including taxpayers not
otherwise required to file annual returns.
      (3)   With respect to taxpayers to whom Section 94.092 of this chapter
applies, to the extent that any provision in this division conflicts with any
provision in Section 94.092 of this chapter, the provision in Section 94.092 of
this chapter prevails.
   (H)   (1)   For taxable years beginning after 2015, the municipality shall
not require a taxpayer to remit tax with respect to net profits if the amount
due is $10 or less.
      (2)   Any taxpayer not required to remit tax to the municipality for a
taxable year pursuant to division (H)(1) of this section shall file with the
municipality an annual net profit return under division (F)(3) and (4) of this
section.
   (I)   This division shall not apply to payments required to be made under
division (B)(1)(b) of Section 94.051 of this chapter.
      (1)   If any report, claim, statement, or other document required to be
filed, or any payment required to be made, within a prescribed period or on or
before a prescribed date under this chapter is delivered after that period or
that to the Tax Administrator or other municipal official with which the
report, claim, statement, or other document is required to be filed, or to
which the payment is required to be made, the date of the postmark stamped on
the cover in which the report, claim, statement, or other document, or payment
is mailed shall be deemed to be the date of delivery or the date of payment.
"The date of postmark" means, in the event there is more than one date on the
cover, the earliest date imprinted on the cover by the postal service.
      (2)   If a payment is required to be made by electronic funds transfer,
the payment is considered to be made when the payment is credited to an account
designated by the Tax Administrator for the receipt of tax payments, except
that, when a payment made by electronic funds transfer is delayed due to
circumstances not under the control of the taxpayer, the payment is considered
to be made when the taxpayer submitted the payment.  For purposes of this
section, "submitted the payment" means the date which the taxpayer has
designated for the delivery of payment, which may or may  not  be the same date
as the date the payment was initiated by the taxpayer.
   (J)   The amounts withheld for the municipality by an employer, the agent of
an employer, or other payer as described in section 94.051 of this chapter
shall be allowed to the recipient of the compensation as credits against
payment of the tax imposed on the recipient unless the amounts withheld were
not remitted to the municipality and the recipient colluded with the employer,
agent, or other payer in connection with the failure to remit the amounts
withheld.
   (K)   Each return required by the municipality to be filed in accordance
with this section shall include a box that the taxpayer may check to authorize
another person, including a tax return preparer who prepared the return, to
communicate with the Tax Administrator about matters pertaining to the return.
The return or instructions accompanying the return shall indicate that by
checking the box the taxpayer authorizes the Tax Administrator to contact the
preparer or other person concerning questions that arise during the examination
or other review of the return and authorizes the preparer or other person only
to provide the Tax Administrator with information that is missing from the
return, to contact the Tax Administrator for information about the examination
or other review of the return or the status of the taxpayer's refund or
payments, and to respond to notices about mathematical errors, offsets, or
return preparation that the taxpayer has received from the Tax Administrator
and has shown to the preparer or other person. Authorization by the taxpayer of
another person to communicate with the Tax Administrator about matters
pertaining to the return does not preclude the Tax Administrator from
contacting the taxpayer regarding such matters.
   (L)   The Tax Administrator of the municipality shall accept for filing a
generic form of any income tax return, report, or document required by the
municipality in accordance with this chapter, provided that the generic form,
once completed and filed, contains all of the information required by
ordinances, resolutions, or rules adopted by the municipality or Tax
Administrator, and provided that the taxpayer or tax return preparer filing the
generic form otherwise complies with the provisions of this chapter and of the
municipality's ordinance or resolution governing the filing of returns,
reports, or documents.
   (M)   When income tax returns, reports, or other documents require the
signature of a tax return preparer, the Tax Administrator shall accept a
facsimile of such a signature in lieu of a manual signature.
   (N)   (1)   As used in this division, "worksite location" has the same
meaning as in Section 94.052 of this chapter.
      (2)   A person may notify a Tax Administrator that the person does not
expect to be a taxpayer with respect to the municipal corporation for a taxable
year if both of the following conditions apply:
         (a)   The person was required to file a tax return with the municipal
corporation for the immediately preceding taxable year because the person
performed services at a worksite location within the municipal corporation, and
the person has filed all appropriate and required returns and remitted all
applicable income tax and withholding payments as provided by this chapter. 
The Tax Administrator is not required to accept an affidavit from a taxpayer
who has not complied with the provisions of this chapter.
         (b)   The person no longer provides services in the municipal
corporation, and does not expect to be subject to the municipal corporation's
income tax for the taxable year.
The person shall provide the notice in a signed affidavit that briefly explains
the person's circumstances, including the location of the previous worksite
location and the last date on which the person performed services or made any
sales within the municipal corporation.  The affidavit also shall include the
following statement:  "The affiant has no plans to perform any services within
the municipal corporation, make any sales in the municipal corporation, or
otherwise become subject to the tax levied by the municipal corporation during
the taxable year.  If the affiant does become subject to the tax levied by the
municipal corporation for the taxable year, the affiant agrees to be considered
a taxpayer and to properly register as a taxpayer with the municipal
corporation, if such a registration is required by the municipal corporation's
resolutions, ordinances, or rules."  The person shall sign the affidavit under
penalty of perjury.
         (c)   If a person submits an affidavit described in division (N)(2) of
this section, the Tax Administrator shall not require the person to file any
tax return for the taxable year unless the Tax Administrator possesses
information that conflicts with the affidavit or if the circumstances described
in the affidavit change, or the taxpayer has engaged in activity which results
in work being performed, services provided, sales made, or other activity that
results in municipal taxable income reportable to the municipality in the
taxable year.  It shall be the responsibility of the taxpayer to comply with
the provisions of this chapter relating to the reporting and filing of
municipal taxable income on an annual municipal income tax return, even if an
affidavit has been filed with the tax administrator for the taxable year. 
Nothing in division (N) of this section prohibits the Tax Administrator from
performing an audit of the person.
94.092   RETURN AND PAYMENT OF TAX; INDIVIDUALS SERVING IN COMBAT ZONE.
   (A)   Each member of the national guard of any state and each member of a
reserve component of the armed forces of the United States called to active
duty pursuant to an executive order issued by the President of the United
States or an act of the Congress of the United States, and each civilian
serving as support personnel in a combat zone or contingency operation in
support of the armed forces, may apply to the Tax Administrator of the
municipality for both an extension of time for filing of the return and an
extension of time for payment of taxes required by the municipality in
accordance with this chapter during the period of the member's or civilian's
duty service and for 180 days thereafter. The application shall be filed on or
before the 180th day after the member's or civilian's duty terminates. An
applicant shall provide such evidence as the Tax Administrator considers
necessary to demonstrate eligibility for the extension.
   (B)   (1)   If the Tax Administrator ascertains that an applicant is
qualified for an extension under this section, the Tax Administrator shall
enter into a contract with the applicant for the payment of the tax in
installments that begin on the 181st day after the applicant's active duty or
service terminates. Except as provided in division (B)(3) of this section, the
Tax Administrator may prescribe such contract terms as the Tax Administrator
considers appropriate.
      (2)   If the Tax Administrator ascertains that an applicant is qualified
for an extension under this section, the applicant shall neither be required to
file any return, report, or other tax document nor be required to pay any tax
otherwise due to the municipality before the 181st day after the applicant's
active duty or service terminates.
      (3)   Taxes paid pursuant to a contract entered into under division (B)
(1) of this section are not delinquent. The Tax Administrator shall not require
any payments of penalties or interest in connection with those taxes for the
extension period.
   (C)   (1)   Nothing in this division denies to any person described in this
division the application of divisions (A) and (B) of this section.
      (2)   (a)   A qualifying taxpayer who is eligible for an extension under
the Internal Revenue Code shall receive both an extension of time in which to
file any return, report, or other tax document and an extension of time in
which to make any payment of taxes required by the municipality in accordance
with this chapter. The length of any extension granted under division (C)(2)(a)
of this section shall be equal to the length of the corresponding extension
that the taxpayer receives under the Internal Revenue Code. As used in this
section, "qualifying taxpayer" means a member of the national guard or a member
of a reserve component of the armed forces of the United States called to
active duty pursuant to either an executive order issued by the President of
the United States or an act of the Congress of the United States, or a civilian
serving as support personnel in a combat zone or contingency operation in
support of the armed forces.
         (b)   Taxes the payment of which is extended in accordance with
division (C)(2)(a) of this section are not delinquent during the extension
period. Such taxes become delinquent on the first day after the expiration of
the extension period if the taxes are not paid prior to that date. The Tax
Administrator shall not require any payment of penalties or interest in
connection with those taxes for the extension period. The Tax Administrator
shall not include any period of extension granted under division (C)(2)(a) of
this section in calculating the penalty or interest due on any unpaid tax.
   (D)   For each taxable year to which division (A), (B), or (C) of this
section applies to a taxpayer, the provisions of divisions (B)(2) and (3) or
(C) of this section, as applicable, apply to the spouse of that taxpayer if the
filing status of the spouse and the taxpayer is married filing jointly for that
year.
94.093  USE OF OHIO BUSINESS GATEWAY; TYPES OF FILINGS AUTHORIZED.
   (A)   Any taxpayer subject to municipal income taxation with respect to the
taxpayer's net profit from a business or profession may file any municipal
income tax return or, estimated municipal income tax return, or extension for
filing a municipal income tax return, and may make payment of amounts shown to
be due on such returns, by using the Ohio Business Gateway.
   (B)   Any employer, agent of an employer, or other payer may report the
amount of municipal income tax withheld from qualifying wages, and may make
remittance of such amounts, by using the Ohio Business Gateway.
   (C)   Nothing in this section affects the due dates for filing employer
withholding tax returns or deposit of any required tax.
   (D)   The use of the Ohio Business Gateway by municipal corporations,
taxpayers, or other persons does not affect the legal rights of municipalities
or taxpayers as otherwise permitted by law. The State of Ohio shall not be a
party to the administration of municipal income taxes or to an appeal of a
municipal income tax matter, except as otherwise specifically provided by law.
   (E)   Nothing in this section shall be construed as limiting or removing the
authority of any municipal corporation to administer, audit, and enforce the
provisions of its municipal income tax.
94.094  EXTENSION OF TIME TO FILE.
   (A)   Any taxpayer that has duly requested an automatic six-month extension
for filing the taxpayer's federal income tax return shall automatically receive
an extension for the filing of a municipal income tax return.  The extended due
date of the municipal income tax return shall be the 15th day of the tenth
month after the last day of the taxable year to which the return relates.
   (B)   Any taxpayer that qualifies for an automatic federal extension for a
period other than six-months for filing the taxpayer's federal income tax
return shall automatically receive an extension for the filing of a municipal
income tax return.  The extended due date of the municipal income tax return
shall be the same as that of the extended federal income tax return.
   (C)   A taxpayer that has not requested or received a six-month extension
for filing the taxpayer's federal income tax return may request that the Tax
Administrator grant the taxpayer a six-month extension of the date for filing
the taxpayer's municipal income tax return.  If the request is received by the
Tax Administrator on or before the date the municipal income tax return is due,
the Tax Administrator shall grant the taxpayer's requested extension.
   (D)   An extension of time to file under this chapter is not an extension of
the time to pay any tax due unless the Tax Administrator grants an extension of
that date.
   (E)   If the State Tax Commissioner extends for all taxpayers the date for
filing state income tax returns under R.C. § 5747.08(G), a taxpayer shall
automatically receive an extension for the filing of a municipal income tax
return.  The extended due date of the municipal income tax return shall be the
same as the extended due date of the state income tax return.
94.095  AMENDED RETURNS.
   (A)   (1)   A taxpayer shall file an amended return with the Tax
Administrator in such form as the Tax Administrator requires if any of the
facts, figures, computations, or attachments required in the taxpayer's annual
return to determine the tax due levied by the municipality in accordance with
this chapter must be altered.
      (2)   Within 60 days after the final determination of any federal or
state tax liability affecting the taxpayer's municipal tax liability, that
taxpayer shall make and file an amended municipal return showing income subject
to the municipal income tax based upon such final determination of federal or
state tax liability, and pay any additional municipal income tax shown due
thereon or make a claim for refund of any overpayment, unless the tax or
overpayment is $10 or less.
      (3)   If a taxpayer intends to file an amended consolidated municipal
income tax return, or to amend its type of return from a separate return to a
consolidated return, based on the taxpayer's consolidated federal income tax
return, the taxpayer shall notify the Tax Administrator before filing the
amended return.
   (B)   (1)   In the case of an underpayment, the amended return shall be
accompanied by payment of any combined additional tax due together with any
penalty and interest thereon. If the combined tax shown to be due is $10 or
less, such amount need not accompany the amended return. Except as provided
under division (B)(2) of this section, the amended return shall not reopen
those facts, figures, computations, or attachments from a previously filed
return that are not affected, either directly or indirectly, by the adjustment
to the taxpayer's federal or state income tax return unless the applicable
statute of limitations for civil actions or prosecutions under §
94.19 of this chapter has not expired for a previously filed return.
      (2)   The additional tax to be paid shall not exceed the amount of tax
that would be due if all facts, figures, computations, and attachments were
reopened.
   (C)   (1)   In the case of an overpayment, a request for refund may be filed
under this division within the period prescribed by division (A)(2) of this
section for filing the amended return even if it is filed beyond the period
prescribed in that division if it otherwise conforms to the requirements of
that division. If the amount of the refund is $10 or less, no refund need be
paid by the municipality to the taxpayer. Except as set forth in division (C)
(2) of this section, a request filed under this division shall claim refund of
overpayments resulting from alterations to only those facts, figures,
computations, or attachments required in the taxpayer's annual return that are
affected, either directly or indirectly, by the adjustment to the taxpayer's
federal or state income tax return unless it is also filed within the time
prescribed in section 94.096 of this chapter. Except as set forth in division
(C)(2) of this section, the request shall not reopen those facts, figures,
computations, or attachments that are not affected, either directly or
indirectly, by the adjustment to the taxpayer's federal or state income tax
return.
      (2)   The amount to be refunded shall not exceed the amount of refund
that would be due if all facts, figures, computations, and attachments were
reopened.
94.096  REFUNDS.
   (A)   Upon receipt of a request for a refund, the Tax Administrator of the
municipality, in accordance with this section, shall refund to employers,
agents of employers, other payers, or taxpayers, with respect to any income or
withholding tax levied by the municipality:
      (1)   Overpayments of more than $10;
      (2)   Amounts paid erroneously if the refund requested exceeds $10.
   (B)   (1)   Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, returns setting
forth a request for refund shall be filed with the Tax Administrator, within
three years after the tax was due or paid, whichever is later. Any
documentation that substantiates the taxpayer's claim for a refund must be
included with the return filing.  Failure to remit all documentation, including
schedules, other municipal income tax returns, or other supporting
documentation necessary to verify credits, income, losses or other pertinent
factors on the return will cause delay in processing, and/or disallowance of
undocumented credits or losses.
      (2)   On filing of the refund request, the Tax Administrator shall
determine the amount of refund due and certify such amount to the appropriate
municipal corporation official for payment. Except as provided in division (B)
(3) of this section, the Administrator shall issue an assessment to any
taxpayer whose request for refund is fully or partially denied. The assessment
shall state the amount of the refund that was denied, the reasons for the
denial, and instructions for appealing the assessment.
      (3)   If a Tax Administrator denies in whole or in part a refund request
included within the taxpayer's originally filed annual income tax return, the
Tax Administrator shall notify the taxpayer, in writing, of the amount of the
refund that was denied, the reasons for the denial, and instructions for
requesting an assessment that may be appealed under §
94.18 of this chapter.
   (C)   A request for a refund that is received after the last day for filing
specified in division (B) of this section shall be considered to have been
filed in a timely manner if any of the following situations exist:
      (1)   The request is delivered by the postal service, and the earliest
postal service postmark on the cover in which the request is enclosed is not
later than the last day for filing the request.
      (2)   The request is delivered by the postal service, the only postmark
on the cover in which the request is enclosed was affixed by a private postal
meter, the date of that postmark is not later than the last day for filing the
request, and the request is received within seven days of such last day.
      (3)   The request is delivered by the postal service, no postmark date
was affixed to the cover in which the request is enclosed or the date of the
postmark so affixed is not legible, and the request is received within seven
days of the last day for making the request.
   (D)   Interest shall be allowed and paid on any overpayment by a taxpayer of
any municipal income tax obligation from the date of the overpayment until the
date of the refund of the overpayment, except that if any overpayment is
refunded within 90 days after the final filing date of the annual return or 90
days after the completed return is filed, whichever is later, no interest shall
be allowed on the refund. For the purpose of computing the payment of interest
on amounts overpaid, no amount of tax for any taxable year shall be considered
to have been paid before the date on which the return on which the tax is
reported is due, without regard to any extension of time for filing that
return. Interest shall be paid at the interest rate described in §
94.10(A)(4) of this chapter.
   (E)   As used in this section, "withholding tax" has the same meaning as in
§
94.10 of this chapter.

94.132  AUTHORITY OF TAX ADMINISTRATOR; COMPROMISE OF CLAIM AND PAYMENT OVER
TIME.
   (A)   As used in this section, "claim" means a claim for an amount payable
to the municipality that arises pursuant to the municipal income tax imposed in
accordance with this chapter.
   (B)   The Tax Administrator may do either of the following if such action is
in the best interests of the municipality:
      (1)   Compromise a claim;
      (2)   Extend for a reasonable period the time for payment of a claim by
agreeing to accept monthly or other periodic payments, upon such terms and
conditions as the Tax Administrator may require.
   (C)   The Tax Administrator's rejection of a compromise or payment-over-time
agreement proposed by a person with respect to a claim shall not be appealable.
   (D)   A compromise or payment-over-time agreement with respect to a claim
shall be binding upon and shall inure to the benefit of only the parties to the
compromise or agreement, and shall not extinguish or otherwise affect the
liability of any other person.
   (E)   (1)   A compromise or payment-over-time agreement with respect to a
claim shall be void if the taxpayer defaults under the compromise or agreement
or if the compromise or agreement was obtained by fraud or by misrepresentation
of a material fact. Any amount that was due before the compromise or agreement
and that is unpaid shall remain due, and any penalties or interest that would
have accrued in the absence of the compromise or agreement shall continue to
accrue and be due.
      (2)   The Tax Administrator shall have sole discretion to determine
whether or not penalty, interest, charges or applicable fees will be assessed
through the duration of any compromise or payment-over-time agreement.
   (F)   The Tax Administrator may require that the taxpayer provide detailed
financial documentation and information, in order to determine whether or not a
payment-over-time agreement will be authorized.  The taxpayer's failure to
provide the necessary and required information by the Tax Administrator shall
preclude consideration of a  payment-over-time agreement.
94.133  AUTHORITY OF TAX ADMINISTRATOR; RIGHT TO EXAMINE.
   (A)   The Tax Administrator, or any authorized agent or employee thereof may
examine the books, papers, records, and federal and state income tax returns of
any employer, taxpayer, or other person that is subject to, or that the Tax
Administrator believes is subject to, the provisions of this chapter for the
purpose of verifying the accuracy of any return made or, if no return was
filed, to ascertain the tax due under this chapter. Upon written request by the
Tax Administrator or a duly authorized agent or employee thereof, every
employer, taxpayer, or other person subject to this section is required to
furnish the opportunity for the Tax Administrator, authorized agent, or
employee to investigate and examine such books, papers, records, and federal
and state income tax returns at a reasonable time and place designated in the
request.
   (B)   The records and other documents of any taxpayer, employer, or other
person that is subject to, or that a Tax Administrator believes is subject to,
the provisions of this chapter shall be open to the Tax Administrator's
inspection during business hours and shall be preserved for a period of six
years following the end of the taxable year to which the records or documents
relate, unless the Tax Administrator, in writing, consents to their destruction
within that period, or by order requires that they be kept longer. The Tax
Administrator of a municipal corporation may require any person, by notice
served on that person, to keep such records as the Tax Administrator determines
necessary to show whether or not that person is liable, and the extent of such
liability, for the income tax levied by the municipality or for the withholding
of such tax.
   (C)   The Tax Administrator may examine under oath any person that the Tax
Administrator reasonably believes has knowledge concerning any income that was
or would have been returned for taxation or any transaction tending to affect
such income. The Tax Administrator may, for this purpose, compel any such
person to attend a hearing or examination and to produce any books, papers,
records, and federal and state income tax returns in such person's possession
or control. The person may be assisted or represented by an attorney,
accountant, bookkeeper, or other tax practitioner at any such hearing or
examination. This division does not authorize the practice of law by a person
who is not an attorney.
   (D)   No person issued written notice by the Tax Administrator compelling
attendance at a hearing or examination or the production of books, papers,
records, or federal and state income tax returns under this section shall fail
to comply.
94.134  AUTHORITY OF TAX ADMINISTRATOR; REQUIRING IDENTIFYING INFORMATION.
   (A)   The Tax Administrator may require any person filing a tax document
with the Tax Administrator to provide identifying information, which may
include the person's social security number, federal employer identification
number, or other identification number requested by the Tax Administrator. A
person required by the Tax Administrator to provide identifying information
that has experienced any change with respect to that information shall notify
the Tax Administrator of the change before, or upon, filing the next tax
document requiring the identifying information.
   (B)   (1)   If the Tax Administrator makes a request for identifying
information and the Tax Administrator does not receive valid identifying
information within 30 days of making the request, nothing in this chapter
prohibits the Tax Administrator from imposing a penalty upon the person to whom
the request was directed pursuant to §
94.10 of this chapter, in addition to any applicable penalty described in §
94.99 of this chapter.
      (2)   If a person required by the Tax Administrator to provide
identifying information does not notify the Tax Administrator of a change with
respect to that information as required under division (A) of this section
within 30 days after filing the next tax document requiring such identifying
information, nothing in this chapter prohibits the Tax Administrator from
imposing a penalty pursuant to §
94.10 of this chapter.
      (3)   The penalties provided for under divisions (B)(1) and (2) of this
section may be billed and imposed in the same manner as the tax or fee with
respect to which the identifying information is sought and are in addition to
any applicable criminal penalties described in §
94.99 of this chapter for a violation of §
94.15 of this chapter, and any other penalties that may be imposed by the Tax
Administrator by law.

§ 94.16  OPINION OF THE TAX ADMINISTRATOR.
   (A)   An "opinion of the Tax Administrator" means an opinion issued under
this section with respect to prospective municipal income tax liability. It
does not include ordinary correspondence of the Tax Administrator.
   (B)   A taxpayer may submit a written request for an opinion of the Tax
Administrator as to whether or how certain income, source of income, or a
certain activity or transaction will be taxed. The written response of the Tax
Administrator shall be an "opinion of the Tax Administrator" and shall bind the
Tax Administrator, in accordance with divisions (C), (G), and (H) of this
section, provided all of the following conditions are satisfied:
      (1)   The taxpayer's request fully and accurately describes the specific
facts or circumstances relevant to a determination of the taxability of the
income, source of income, activity, or transaction, and, if an activity or
transaction, all parties involved in the activity or transaction are clearly
identified by name, location, or other pertinent facts.
      (2)   The request relates to a tax imposed by the municipality in
accordance with this chapter.
      (3)   The Tax Administrator's response is signed by the Tax Administrator
and designated as an "opinion of the Tax Administrator."
   (C)   An opinion of the Tax Administrator shall remain in effect and shall
protect the taxpayer for whom the opinion was prepared and who reasonably
relies on it from liability for any taxes, penalty, or interest otherwise
chargeable on the activity or transaction specifically held by the Tax
Administrator's opinion to be taxable in a particular manner or not to be
subject to taxation for any taxable years that may be specified in the opinion,
or until the earliest of the following dates:
      (1)   The effective date of a written revocation by the Tax Administrator
sent to the taxpayer by certified mail, return receipt requested. The effective
date of the revocation shall be the taxpayer's date of receipt or one year
after the issuance of the opinion, whichever is later;
      (2)   The effective date of any amendment or enactment of a relevant
section of the Ohio Revised Code, uncodified state law, or the municipality's
income tax ordinance that would substantially change the analysis and
conclusion of the opinion of the Tax Administrator;
      (3)   The date on which a court issues an opinion establishing or
changing relevant case law with respect to the Ohio Revised Code, uncodified
state law, or the municipality's income tax ordinance;
      (4)   If the opinion of the Tax Administrator was based on the
interpretation of federal law, the effective date of any change in the relevant
federal statutes or regulations, or the date on which a court issues an opinion
establishing or changing relevant case law with respect to federal statutes or
regulations;
      (5)   The effective date of any change in the taxpayer's material facts
or circumstances;
      (6)   The effective date of the expiration of the opinion, if specified
in the opinion.
   (D)   (1)   A taxpayer is not relieved of tax liability for any activity or
transaction related to a request for an opinion that contained any
misrepresentation or omission of one or more material facts.
      (2)   If the taxpayer knowingly has misrepresented the pertinent facts or
omitted material facts with intent to defraud the municipality in order to
obtain a more favorable opinion, the taxpayer may be in violation of §
94.15 of this chapter.
   (E)   If a Tax Administrator provides written advice under this section, the
opinion shall include a statement that:
      (1)   The tax consequences stated in the opinion may be subject to change
for any of the reasons stated in division (C) of this section;
      (2)   It is the duty of the taxpayer to be aware of such changes.
   (F)   A Tax Administrator may refuse to offer an opinion on any request
received under this section.
   (G)   This section binds a Tax Administrator only with respect to opinions
of the Tax Administrator issued on or after January 1, 2016.
   (H)   An opinion of a Tax Administrator binds that Tax Administrator only
with respect to the taxpayer for whom the opinion was prepared and does not
bind the Tax Administrator of any other municipal corporation.
   (I)   A Tax Administrator shall make available the text of all opinions
issued under this section, except those opinions prepared for a taxpayer who
has requested that the text of the opinion remain confidential. In no event
shall the text of an opinion be made available until the Tax Administrator has
removed all information that identifies the taxpayer and any other parties
involved in the activity or transaction.
   (J)   An opinion of the Tax Administrator issued under this section or a
refusal to offer an opinion under subsection (F) may not be appealed.

   Request for opinion of the Tax Administrator, see R.C. § 718.38
§ 94.17  ASSESSMENT; APPEAL BASED ON PRESUMPTION OF DELIVERY.
   (A)   (1)   The Tax Administrator shall serve an assessment either by
personal service, by certified mail, or by a delivery service authorized under
R.C. § 5703.056.
      (2)   The Tax Administrator may deliver the assessment through
alternative means as provided in this section, including, but not limited to,
delivery by secure electronic mail. Such alternative delivery method must be
authorized by the person subject to the assessment.
      (3)   Once service of the assessment has been made by the Tax
Administrator or other municipal official, or the designee of either, the
person to whom the assessment is directed may protest the ruling of that
assessment by filing an appeal with the Local Board of Tax Review within 60
days after the receipt of service. The delivery of an assessment of the Tax
Administrator as prescribed in R.C. § 718.18 is prima facie evidence that
delivery is complete and that the assessment is served.
   (B)   (1)   A person may challenge the presumption of delivery and service
as set forth in this division.  A person disputing the presumption of delivery
and service under this section bears the burden of proving by a preponderance
of the evidence that the address to which the assessment was sent was not an
address with which the person was associated at the time the Tax Administrator
originally mailed the assessment by certified mail. For the purposes of this
section, a person is associated with an address at the time the Tax
Administrator originally mailed the assessment if, at that time, the person was
residing, receiving legal documents, or conducting business at the address; or
if, before that time, the person had conducted business at the address and,
when the assessment was mailed, the person's agent or the person's affiliate
was conducting business at the address. For the purposes of this section, a
person's affiliate is any other person that, at the time the assessment was
mailed, owned or controlled at least 20%, as determined by voting rights, of
the addressee's business.
      (2)   If a person elects to appeal an assessment on the basis described
in division (B)(1) of this section, and if that assessment is subject to
collection and is not otherwise appealable, the person must do so within 60
days after the initial contact by the Tax Administrator or other municipal
official, or the designee of either, with the person. Nothing in this division
prevents the Tax Administrator or other official from entering into a
compromise with the person if the person does not actually file such an appeal
with the Local Board of Tax Review.

municipality.
Two members shall be appointed by the legislative authority of the
municipality, and may not be employees, elected officials, or contractors with
the municipality at any time during their term or in the five years immediately
preceding the date of appointment. One member shall be appointed by the top
administrative official of the municipality. This member may be an employee of
the municipality, but may not be the director of finance or equivalent officer,
or the Tax Administrator or other similar official or an employee directly
involved in municipal tax matters, or any direct subordinate thereof.
      (3)   The term for members of the Local Board of Tax Review appointed by
the legislative authority of the municipality shall be two years. There is no
limit on the number of terms that a member may serve should the member be
reappointed by the legislative authority. The Board member appointed by the top
administrative official of the municipality shall serve at the discretion of
the administrative official.
      (4)   Members of the board of tax review appointed by the legislative
authority may be removed by the legislative authority as set forth in R.C. §
718.11(A)(4).
      (5)   A member of the Board who, for any reason, ceases to meet the
qualifications for the position prescribed by this section shall resign
immediately by operation of law.
      (6)   A vacancy in an unexpired term shall be filled in the same manner
as the original appointment within 60 days of when the vacancy was created. Any
member appointed to fill a vacancy occurring prior to the expiration of the
term for which the member's predecessor was appointed shall hold office for the
remainder of such term. No vacancy on the Board shall impair the power and
authority of the remaining members to exercise all the powers of the Board.
      (7)   If a member is temporarily unable to serve on the Board due to a
conflict of interest, illness, absence, or similar reason, the legislative
authority or top administrative official that appointed the member shall
appoint another individual to temporarily serve on the Board in the member's
place.  This appointment shall be subject to the same requirements and
limitations as are applicable to the appointment of the member temporarily
unable to serve.
   (B)   Whenever a Tax Administrator issues an assessment, the Tax
Administrator shall notify the taxpayer in writing at the same time of the
taxpayer's right to appeal the assessment, the manner in which the taxpayer may
appeal the assessment, and the address to which the appeal should be directed,
and to whom the appeal should be directed.
   (C)   Any person who has been issued an assessment may appeal the assessment
to the Board by filing a request with the Board. The request shall be in
writing, shall specify the reason or reasons why the assessment should be
deemed incorrect or unlawful, and shall be filed within 60 days after the
taxpayer receives the assessment.
   (D)   The Local Board of Tax Review shall schedule a hearing to be held
within 60 days after receiving an appeal of an assessment under division (C) of
this section, unless the taxpayer requests additional time to prepare or waives
a hearing. If the taxpayer does not waive the hearing, the taxpayer may appear
before the Board and/or may be represented by an attorney at law, certified
public accountant, or other representative. The Board may allow a hearing to be
continued as jointly agreed to by the parties. In such a case, the hearing must
be completed within 120 days after the first day of the hearing unless the
parties agree otherwise.
   (E)   The Board may affirm, reverse, or modify the Tax Administrator's
assessment or any part of that assessment. The Board shall issue a final
determination on the appeal within 90 days after the Board's final hearing on
the appeal, and send a copy of its final determination by ordinary mail to all
of the parties to the appeal within 15 days after issuing the final
determination.  The taxpayer or the Tax Administrator may appeal the board's
final determination as provided in R.C. § 5717.011.
   (F)   The Local Board of Tax Review created pursuant to this section shall
adopt rules governing its procedures, including a schedule of related costs,
and shall keep a record of its transactions. The rules governing the Local
Board of Tax Review procedures shall be in writing, and may be amended as
needed by the Local Board of Tax Review.  Such records are not public records
available for inspection under R.C. § 149.43.  For this reason, any
documentation, copies of returns or reports, final determinations, or working
papers for each case must be maintained in a secure location under the control
of the Tax Administrator. No member of the Local Board of Tax Review may remove
such documentation, copies of returns or reports, final determinations, or
working papers from the hearing.  Hearings requested by a taxpayer before a
Local Board of Tax Review created pursuant to this section are not meetings of
a public body subject to R.C. § 121.22.  For this reason, such hearings shall
not be open to the public, and only those parties to the case may be present
during the hearing.

penalties and interest on municipal income taxes shall be brought within the
latter of:
            (i)   Three years after the tax was due or the return was filed,
whichever is later; or
            (ii)   One year after the conclusion of the qualifying deferral

         (b)   The time limit described in division (A)(1)(a) of this section
may be extended at any time if both the Tax Administrator and the employer,
agent of the employer, other payer, or taxpayer consent in writing to the
extension. Any extension shall also extend for the same period of time the time
limit described in division (C) of this section.
      (2)   As used in this section, "qualifying deferral period" means a
period of time beginning and ending as follows:
         (a)   Beginning on the date a person who is aggrieved by an assessment
files with a Local Board of Tax Review the request described in §
94.18 of this chapter.  That date shall not be affected by any subsequent
decision, finding, or holding by any administrative body or court that the
Local Board of Tax Review with which the aggrieved person filed the request did
not have jurisdiction to affirm, reverse, or modify the assessment or any part
of that assessment.
         (b)   Ending the later of the 60th day after the date on which the
final determination of the Local Board of Tax Review becomes final or, if any
party appeals from the determination of the Local Board of Tax Review, the 60th
day after the date on which the final determination of the Local Board of Tax
Review is either ultimately affirmed in whole or in part or ultimately reversed

94.096 of this chapter.
   (D)   (1)   Notwithstanding the fact that an appeal is pending, the
petitioner may pay all or a portion of the assessment that is the subject of
the appeal.  The acceptance of a payment by the municipality does not prejudice
any claim for refund upon final determination of the appeal.
      (2)   If upon final determination of the appeal an error in the
assessment is corrected by the Tax Administrator, upon an appeal so filed or
pursuant to a final determination of the Local Board of Tax Review created
under §
94.18 of this chapter, of the Ohio Board of Tax Appeals, or any court to which
the decision of the Ohio Board of Tax Appeals has been appealed, so that the
amount due from the party assessed under the corrected assessment is less than
the amount paid, there shall be issued to the appellant or to the appellant's
assigns or legal representative a refund in the amount of the overpayment as
provided by Section
94.096 of this chapter, with interest on that amount as provided by division
(D) of this section.

imposition of that tax or interest or those penalties;
      (2)   The period during which an appeal related to the imposition of that
tax or interest or those penalties is pending.

offset the profits of another entity for purposes of arriving at overall net
profits, except any portion of a loss reportable for municipal income tax

(Ord. 21-1996, passed 7-17-96)
§ 95.03  ILLEGAL DISCHARGES AND ILLICIT CONNECTIONS.
   (A)   Statement of purpose. This section establishes methods for controlling
the introduction of pollutants into the Municipal Separate Storm Sewer System
(MS4) in order to comply with requirements of the National Pollutant Discharge
Elimination System (NPDES) permit process. The objectives of this section are:
      (1)   To regulate the contribution of pollutants to the MS4 by storm
water discharges by any user:
      (2)   To prohibit illicit connections and discharges to the MS4;
      (3)   To establish legal authority to perform all inspection,
surveillance and monitoring procedures necessary to ensure compliance with this
section;
      (4)   To establish penalties for making illicit/illegal connections and
creating/allowing illicit discharges.
   (B)   Applicability.  This section shall apply to all water entering the MS4
generated on any developed or undeveloped lands unless explicitly exempted by
this section.
   (C)   Responsibility for administration.  The Mayor or designee is
responsible for the administration of the Illicit Discharge Ordinance.
   (D)   Ultimate responsibility. The standards set forth in this section are
minimum standards. Compliance with these provisions does not allow any person
to otherwise cause contamination, pollution, or unauthorized discharge of
pollutants. Compliance with these provisions does not relieve any person, firm
or other entity from complying with any state and/or federal regulation(s) that
address illicit discharges, hazardous spills, and/or other pollutant
discharges.
   (E)   Discharge prohibitions.
      (1)   No person shall discharge or cause to be discharged into the MS4 or
into a watercourse, any pollutants or waters containing any pollutants other
than storm water. For purposes of this section, watercourse shall have the same
definition as in §
151.01 of the Springdale Codified Ordinances.
      (2)   The commencement, conduct or continuance of any illegal discharge
to the MS4 is prohibited except as described as follows:
         (a)   The following discharges are exempt from discharge prohibitions
established by this section: water line flushing or other potable water
sources, landscape irrigation or lawn watering, diverted stream flows, rising
groundwater, groundwater infiltration to storm drains, uncontaminated pumped
groundwater, foundation or footing drains (not including active groundwater
dewatering systems), crawl space pumps, air conditioning condensation, springs,
noncommercial washing of  vehicles, natural riparian habitat or wetland flows,
swimming pools (if meeting requirements articulated in division (H) of this
section), fire fighting activities, and any other water source not containing
pollutants.
         (b)   Discharges specified in writing by the city as being necessary
to protect public health and safety and/or otherwise specified elsewhere in
this section.
         (c)   Dye testing is an allowable discharge, but requires a documented
notification to the Springdale Health Department prior to the time of the test.
         (d)   The prohibition shall not apply to any non-storm water discharge
permitted under a NPDES permit, waiver, or waste discharge order issued to the
discharger and administered under the authority of the United States
Environmental Protection Agency, provided that the discharger is in full
compliance with all requirements of the permit, waiver, or order and other
applicable laws and regulations, and provided that written approval has been
granted for any discharge to the storm drain system.
      (3)   The commencement, conduct or continuance of any illicit connection
to the MS4 is prohibited as follows, aside from the exceptions previously
articulated in this section:
         (a)   The construction, use, maintenance or continued existence of
illicit connections to the MS4 is prohibited.
         (b)   This prohibition expressly includes, without limitation, illicit
connections made in the past, regardless of whether the connection was
permissible under law or practices applicable or prevailing at the time of
connection.
         (c)   A person is considered to be in violation of this section if the
person connects a line conveying sewage to the MS4, or allows such a connection
to continue after the effective date of this section.
   (F)   Monitoring of discharges. The city or designee shall be permitted to
enter and inspect facilities subject to regulation under this section as often
as may be necessary to determine compliance with this section. If a discharger
has security measures in place, which requires proper identification and
clearance before entry into its premises, the discharger shall make the
necessary arrangements to allow access to representatives of the city. Facility
operators shall allow the city ready access to all parts of the premises for
the purposes of inspection, sampling, examination and copying of records that
must be kept under the conditions of the NPDES permit to discharge storm water,
and the performance of any additional duties as defined by federal, state and
local law.
      (1)   Any temporary or permanent obstruction to safe and easy access to
the facility to be inspected and/or sampled shall be promptly removed by the
operator at the written or oral request of the city and shall not be replaced.
The costs of clearing such access shall be borne by the owner or operator of
the premises.
      (2)   Unreasonable delays in allowing the city access to the premises are
a violation of this section. A person is in violation of this regulation if the
person denies the city reasonable access to the premises for the purpose of
conducting any activity authorized or required by this section.
      (3)   If the city has been refused access to any part of the premises
from which storm water or non-storm water is discharged, and it is able to
demonstrate probable cause to believe that there may be a violation of this
section, or that there is a need to inspect and/or sample as part of a routine
inspection and sampling program designed to verify compliance with this section
or any order issued hereunder, or to protect the overall public health, safety,
and welfare of the city, then the city may seek issuance of a search warrant
from any court of competent jurisdiction.
   (G)   Notification of spills. Notwithstanding other requirements of law, as
soon as any person responsible for a premises, or responsible for emergency
response to a premises has information of any known or suspected, illegal
discharges discharging into, the MS4, or water of the U.S. said person shall
take all necessary steps to ensure the discovery, containment, and cleanup of
such discharges. In the event of a discharge of hazardous materials, said
person shall immediately notify emergency response agencies of the occurrence
via emergency dispatch services. In the event of a release of non-hazardous
materials, said person shall notify the city in person or by calling the City
of Springdale Illegal Dumping Hotline at (513) 346-5535 as soon as possible.
Notifications in person or by phone shall be confirmed by written notice
addressed and mailed to the city within three working days of the phone notice.
If the discharge of prohibited materials emanates from a commercial or
industrial establishment, the owner or operator of such establishment shall
also retain an on-site written record of the discharge and the actions taken to
prevent its recurrence. Such records shall be retained for the duration
required under the Ohio records retention law.
   (H)   Swimming pool discharges.  For private residential swimming pools,
backwash water, resulting from cleaning of the swimming pool filtration medium
and/or elements, should be discharged to the sanitary sewer. All discharges to
sanitary sewers must be permitted prior to discharge and must comply with the
rules and regulations of the Metropolitan Sewer District of Greater Cincinnati.
Discharges of pool water from private swimming pools into the MS4 must comply
with state Water Quality Criteria for the protection of aquatic life, contained
in Ohio Administrative Code 3745-1-07. Chlorinated pool water must sit for at
least two days (48 hours) after the addition of chlorine, or until the chlorine
level is below 0.1 milligrams per liter (mg/L). Chlorine can be tested using a
standard pool chlorine test kit. The pH of the pool water, which is a measure
of acidity, must neither be less than 6.5 nor greater than 8.5 prior to or
during discharge.
   (I)   Enforcement.
      (1)   Whenever the city finds that a person has violated a prohibition or
failed to meet a requirement of this section, the city may order compliance by
written notice of violation to the responsible person. Such notice may require
without limitation:
         (a)   The performance of monitoring, analyses, and reporting,
         (b)   The elimination of illicit connections or discharges,
         (c)   That violating discharges, practices, or operations shall cease
and desist,
         (d)   The abatement or remediation of illicit discharge or
contamination hazards, and the restoration of any affected property, and
         (e)   Payment of a fine to cover administrative and remediation costs,
and
         (f)   The implementation of control measures required by the city.
      (2)   If abatement of a violation and/or restoration of affected property
is/are required, the notice shall set forth a deadline, based on the scope of
the problem that requires correction, within which such remediation or
restoration must be completed. Said notice shall further advise that, should
the violator fail to remediate or restore within the established deadline, the
work will be accomplished by the city or a contractor and the expense thereof
shall be charged to the violator.
   (J)   Appeal of notice of a violation. Any person receiving a notice of
violation may appeal the determination of the issuing department. The notice of
appeal must be received within ten working days from the date of the notice of
violation. Hearing on the appeal before the Springdale Board of Health or their
designee shall take place within 15 working days from the date of receipt of
the notice of appeal. The decision of the Springdale Board of Health shall be a
final decision and may be appealed to the Hamilton County Court of Common Pleas
pursuant to R.C. Chapters 2505 and 2506.
   (K)   Enforcement measures after appeal. If the violation has not been
corrected pursuant to the requirements set forth in the notice of violation, or
in the event of an appeal, within 30 working days of the decision of the
Springdale Board of Health, upholding the notice, then representatives of the
city shall enter upon the subject premises and are authorized to take any and
all measures necessary to abate the violation and/or restore the property. It
shall be unlawful for any person, owner, agent or person in possession of any
premises to refuse to allow the local authorized enforcement agency to enter
upon the premises for the purposes set forth above.
   (L)   Cost of abatement of the violation. Within ten working days after
abatement of the violation, the owner of the premises will be notified of the
cost of abatement, including administrative costs. The property owner may file
a written protest objecting to the amount of the assessment within 10 days. If
the amount due is not paid within a timely manner as determined by the decision
of the Springdale Board of Health or within 30 days of invoice, if no appeal is
filed, or by the expiration of the time in which to file an appeal, the charges
shall become a special assessment against the property and shall constitute a
lien on the property for the amount of the assessment.
   (M)   Injunctive relief. It shall be unlawful for any person to violate any
provision or fail to comply with any of the requirements of this section. If a
person has violated or continues to violate the provision of this section, the
city may petition for a preliminary or permanent injunction restraining the
person from activities which would create further violations or compelling the
person to perform abatement or remediation of the violation.
   (N)   Violations deemed a public nuisance. In addition to the enforcement
processes and penalties provided, any condition caused or permitted to exist in
violation of any of the provisions of this section is a threat to public
health, safety, and welfare, and is declared and deemed a nuisance, and may be
summarily abated or restored by the city at the violator's expense, and/or a
civil action to abate, enjoin, or otherwise compel the cessation of such
nuisance may be taken.
   (O)   Penalty. Whoever violates or fails to comply with any provision of
this section is guilty of a misdemeanor of the fourth degree and shall be fined
not more than $250 or imprisoned not more than 30 days or both. Each day of a
continuing violation shall constitute a separate offense.
   (P)   Remedies not exclusive. The remedies listed in this section are not
exclusive of any other remedies available under any applicable federal, state,
or local law and it is within the discretion of the city to seek cumulative
remedies.
(Ord. 68-2006, passed 10-4-06)

§ 96.04  TAX TO BE SEPARATELY STATED AND CHARGED.
   (A)   The tax to be collected shall be stated and charged separately from
the rent and shown separately on any record thereof, at the time when the
occupancy is arranged or contracted and charged for, and upon every evidence of
occupancy or any bill or statement or charge made for the occupancy issued or
delivered by the operator.  The tax shall be paid by the occupant to the
operator as trustee for and on account of the city, and the operator shall be
liable for the collection thereof and for the tax.
   (B)   No operator of a hotel shall advertise or state in any manner, whether

person named on the face hereof has fulfilled the requirements of the Transient

purpose of collecting from transient guests the Transient Occupancy Tax and
remitting said tax to the tax commissioner.  This certificate does not
constitute a permit.” 
(Ord. 24-1978, passed 6-21-78)
§ 96.06  REPORTING AND REMITTING.
   (A)   Each operator shall, on or before the last day of the month following
the close of each calendar quarter, or at the close of any shorter reporting
period which may be established by the tax commissioner, make a return to the
tax commissioner, on forms obtainable from him, of the total rents charged and
received and the amount of tax collected for transient occupancies.  All claims
for exemption from tax filed by occupants with the operator during the
reporting period shall be filed with the report.  At the time the return is
filed, the full amount of the tax collected shall be remitted to the tax
commissioner.  The tax commissioner may establish shorter reporting periods for
any certificate holder if he deems it necessary in order to insure collection
of the tax and he may require further information in the return if the
information is pertinent to the collection of the tax.  Returns and payments
are due immediately upon cessation of business for any reason.  All taxes
collected by operators pursuant to this chapter shall be held in trust for the

confidential by the tax commissioner and shall not be released by him except
upon order of a court of competent jurisdiction or to an officer or agent of
the United States, the State of Ohio, the County of Hamilton, or the City of
Springdale for official use only.  The nonavailability or failure to obtain
forms shall not relieve an operator from the timely paying of the tax.
   (B)   No person, including any officer of a corporation or employee of a
corporation having control or supervision of or charged with the responsibility
of filing returns, shall fail to file any return or report required to be filed
by this chapter, or file or cause to be filed any incomplete, false, or
fraudulent return, report, or statement, or aid or abet another in the filing
of any false or fraudulent return, report, or statement.
   (C)   If any operator required to file quarterly returns under this chapter
fails, on 2 consecutive quarters within a 12-month period, to file the returns
when due or to pay the tax thereon, or if any operator authorized by the tax
commissioner to file returns at less frequent intervals, fails on 2 or more
occasions within a 24-month period, to file the returns when due or to pay the
tax due thereon, the tax commissioner may require the operator to furnish
security in an amount equal to the average tax liability of the operator for a
period of one year, as determined by the tax commissioner from a review of
returns or other information pertaining to the operator, which amount shall in
no event be less than $100. This security may be in the form of an advance tax
payment to be applied to pay the tax due on subsequent returns, or a corporate
surety bond, satisfactory to the tax commissioner, conditioned upon payment of
the tax due with the returns from the operator.  This security must be filed
within 10 days following the operator's receipt of the notice from the tax
commissioner of its requirements. A corporate surety bond filed under this
section shall be returned to the operator if, for a period of 12 consecutive
months following the date the bond was filed, the operator has filed all
returns and remitted payment therewith within the time prescribed in this
chapter.
   (D)   If any operator required to file returns and to remit tax due to the
city under the provisions of this chapter, fails for any reason to make the
filing or payment, any of its officers or employees having control or
supervision of or charged with the responsibility of filing returns and making
payments, shall be personally liable for the failure.  The dissolution of a
corporation shall not discharge an officer's or employee's liability for a
prior failure of the corporation to file returns or remit tax due. The sum due
for this liability may be collected by assessment in the manner provided in
this chapter. 
(Ord. 24-1978, passed 6-21-78)
§ 96.07  PENALTIES AND INTEREST.
   (A)   Original delinquency.  Any operator who fails to remit any tax imposed
by this chapter within the time required shall pay a penalty equal to 10% of
the amount of the tax, in addition to the tax.
   (B)   Continued delinquency.  Any operator who fails to remit any delinquent
remittance on or before a period of 30 days following the date on which the
remittance first became delinquent shall pay a second delinquency penalty equal
to 10% of the amount of the tax and previous penalty in addition to the tax and
the 10% penalty first imposed.  An additional penalty equal to 10% of the total
tax and penalty of the previous 30-day period shall be added for each
successive 30-day period that the account remains delinquent.
   (C)   Fraud.  If the tax commissioner determines that the non- payment of
any remittance due under this chapter is due to fraud, a penalty equal to 25%
of the amount of the tax shall be added thereto in addition to the penalties
stated in divisions (A) and (B).
   (D)   Interest.  In addition to the penalties imposed, any operator who
fails to remit any tax imposed by this chapter shall pay interest at the rate
of 1% per month, or fraction thereof, on the amount of the tax, exclusive of
penalties, from the date on which the remittance first became delinquent until
paid.
   (E)   Penalties during pendency of hearing or appeal.  No penalty provided
under the terms of this chapter shall be imposed during the pendency of any
hearing provided for in §
96.08 nor during the pendency of any appeal to the tax commissioner provided

§ 96.08  FAILURE TO COLLECT AND REPORT TAX, DETERMINATION OF TAX BY TAX
COMMISSIONER.
   (A)   If any operator shall fail or refuse to collect the tax and to make,
within the time provided in this chapter, any report and remittance of the tax
or any portion thereof required by this chapter, the tax commissioner shall
proceed in such manner as he may deem best to obtain facts and information on
which to base his estimate of the tax due.  As soon as the tax commissioner
procures whatever facts and information that he is able to obtain upon which to
base the assessment of any tax imposed by this chapter and payable by any
operator who has failed or refused to collect the same and to make such report
and remittance, he shall proceed to determine and assess against the operator
the tax, interest, and penalties provided for by this chapter.  In case this
determination is made, the tax commissioner shall give a notice of the amount
so assessed by serving it personally or by depositing it in the United States
mail, postage prepaid, addressed to the operator so assessed at his last known
address.
   (B)   The operator may within 10 days after the serving or mailing of the
notice make application in writing to the tax commissioner for a hearing on the
amount assessed.  If application by the operator for a hearing is not made
within the time prescribed, the tax, interest, and penalties, if any,
determined by the tax commissioner shall become final and conclusive and
immediately due and payable.
   (C)   If the application is made, the tax commissioner shall give not less
than 5 days' written notice in the manner prescribed herein to the operator to
show cause at a time and place fixed in the notice why the amount specified
therein should not be fixed for such tax, interest, and penalties.
   (D)   At the hearing, the operator may appear and offer evidence why the
specified tax, interest, and penalties should not be so fixed.
   (E)   After the hearing, the tax commissioner shall determine the proper tax
to be remitted and shall thereafter give written notice to the person in the
manner prescribed herein of the determination and the amount of the tax,
interest, and penalty.  The amount determined to be due shall be payable after
30 days unless an appeal is taken as provided in §
96.09.  Subject to the policies laid down by the board of review, the tax
commissioner shall have the power to compromise any assessment of interest and
penalties.
(Ord. 24-1978, passed 6-21-78)
§ 96.09  APPEAL.
   Any operator aggrieved by any decision of the tax commissioner with respect
to the amount of tax, interest, and penalties, if any, may appeal to the board
of review as created and constituted under §
94.18 by filing a notice of appeal with the board of review within 30 days of
the serving or mailing of the determination of tax due. The board of review
shall fix a time and place for hearing the appeal, and shall give notice in
writing to the operator at his last known resident address.  The findings of
the board of review shall be final and conclusive and shall be served upon the
appellant in the manner prescribed above for service of notice of hearing.  Any
amount found to be due shall be immediately due and payable upon the service of
notice.
(Ord. 24-1978, passed 6-21-78)
§ 96.10  RECORDS.
   (A)   it shall be the duty of every operator liable for the collection and
payment to the city of any tax imposed by this chapter to keep and preserve all
records that may be necessary to determine the amount of the tax that he may
have been liable for the collection of, and payment to, the city.  If the
operator furnishes lodging not subject to the tax, the operator's records shall
show the identity of the transient guest, if the sale was exempted by reason of
such identity, or the nature of the transaction if exempted for any other
reason.
   (B)   All such records and other documents shall be open during business
hours to the inspection of the tax commissioner and shall be preserved for a
period of 4 years, unless the tax commissioner, in writing, consents to their
destruction within that period, or by order requires that they be kept longer. 
(Ord. 24-1978, passed 6-21-78)
§ 96.11  REFUNDS.
   (A)   Whenever the amount of any tax, interest, or penalty has been overpaid
or paid more than once or has been erroneously or illegally collected or
received by the city under this chapter, it may be refunded as provided in
divisions (B) and (C) provided a claim  in writing therefor, stating under
penalty of perjury the specific grounds upon which the claim is founded, is
filed with the tax commissioner within 3 years of the date of payment.  The
claim shall be on forms furnished by the tax commissioner.
   (B)   An operator may claim a refund or take as credit against taxes
collected and remitted the amount overpaid, paid more than once, or erroneously

furnish security in an amount equal to the average tax liability of the
operator for a period of one year, as determined by the Tax Commissioner from a
review of returns or other information pertaining to such operator, which
amount shall in no event be less than $100. Such security may be in the form of
an advance tax payment to be applied to pay the tax due on subsequent returns

on payment of the tax due with the returns from the operator.  Such security
must be filed within ten days following the operator's receipt of the notice
from the Tax Commissioner of its requirements.  A corporate surety bond filed
under this section shall be returned to the operator if, for a period of 12
consecutive months following the date the bond was filed, the operator has
filed all returns and remitted payment therewith within the time prescribed in
this chapter.

prior failure of the corporation to file returns or remit tax due.  The sum due

which to base his estimate of the tax due.  As soon as the Tax Commissioner
shall procure such facts and information as he is able to obtain on which to
base the assessment of any tax imposed by this chapter payable by any operator
who has failed or refused to collect the same and to make such report and
remittance, he shall proceed to determine and assess against such operator the
tax, interest, and penalties provided for by this chapter.  In case such
determination is made, the Tax Commissioner shall give a notice of the amount
so assessed by serving it personally or by depositing it in the United States
mail, postage prepaid, addressed to the operator so assessed at his last known
address.  Such operator may, within ten days after the serving or mailing of
such notice, make application in writing to the Tax Commissioner for a hearing
on the amount assessed.  If application by the operator for a hearing is not
made within the time prescribed, the tax, interest, and penalties.  If any,

immediately due and payable.
   (B)   If such application is made, the Tax Commissioner shall give not less
than five days written notice in the manner prescribed herein to the operator
to show cause at a time and place fixed in such notice why the amount specified
therein should not be fixed for such tax, interest, and penalties.  At such
hearing, the operator may appear and offer evidence why such specified tax,
interest, and penalties should not be so fixed.  After such hearing, the Tax
Commissioner shall determine the proper tax to be remitted, and shall
thereafter give written notice to the person in the manner prescribed herein of
the determination and the amount of such tax, interest, and penalty.  The
amount determined to be due shall be payable after 30 days unless an appeal is
taken as provided in §
97.09.  Subject to the policies laid down by the Board of Review, the Tax

the serving or mailing of the determination of tax due.  The Board of Review
shall fix a time and place for hearing such appeal, and shall give notice in
writing to such operator at his last known resident address.  The findings of
the Board of Review shall be final and conclusive, and shall be served on the
appellant in the manner prescribed above for service of notice of hearing.  Any
amount found to be due shall be immediately due and payable on service of the
notice.

transaction.

hours to the inspection of the Tax Commissioner and shall be preserved for a
period of 4 years, unless the Tax Commissioner consents in writing to their

   (D)   On approval of the application and payment of any license fee or fees
therein required, the Clerk-Treasurer shall grant and issue to each applicant,
unless withheld for cause, a permanent or temporary entertainment admission
license for each entertainment location within this City set forth in his
application.
   (E)   An entertainment admission license shall be valid only for the person
in whose name it is issued and for the operation of an entertainment location
at the place designated therein, and shall not be assignable. It shall be
conspicuously displayed at the place for which issued during the period of
ticket sale and operation of the entertainment location. All licenses for
permanent entertainment locations shall be for a period of 12 months following
the date on which the year issued, unless sooner surrendered by the licensee or
suspended or revoked for cause by the Clerk-Treasurer. Licenses for temporary
entertainment locations shall expire at the time specified therein.
   (F)   Licenses issued for permanent entertainment location under the
provisions of this chapter may be renewed annually on application made to the
Clerk-Treasurer and the payment of a renewal fee of $5.00.
   (G)   The Clerk-Treasurer may suspend or after hearing revoke an
entertainment admission license whenever he finds that the holder thereof has
failed to comply with any of the provisions of this chapter. On suspending or
revoking any entertainment admission license, the Clerk-Treasurer shall require
the holder thereof to surrender to him immediately all licenses or duplicates
thereof issued to such holder, and the holder shall surrender promptly all such
licenses to the Clerk-Treasurer as required. Whenever the Clerk-Treasurer
suspends an entertainment admission license, he shall notify the holder
immediately and afford him a hearing, if no hearing has already been afforded
and one is desired. After such hearing the Clerk-Treasurer shall either rescind
his order of suspension or, on good cause appearing therefor, continue the
suspension or revoke the license.
   (H)   No owner, lessee or custodian of the premises on which an
entertainment is to be operated shall lease or permit the same to be used by
any person who is not the owner of a license duly issued by the Clerk-Treasurer
hereunder. Any such owner, lessee or custodian who leases to or permits such
premises to be used for such purpose by a person who is not the owner of a
license duly issued hereunder shall be liable for the amount of taxes levied
under the provisions of this chapter in connection with any entertainment so
conducted on such premises, and such taxes shall be a lien on such premises.
   (I)   When an exemption from the payment of the entertainment admission tax
is granted by the Clerk-Treasurer for a given organization in accordance with
the provision of §
98.03, such exemption shall be considered as the equivalent of the license
herein provided for.
(Ord. 49-1984, passed 6-27-84)
§ 98.06  REPORTING AND REMITTING.
   (A)   Each operator shall, on or before the last day of the month following
the close of each calendar quarter, or at the close of any shorter reporting
period which may be established by the Tax Commissioner, make a return to the
Tax Commissioner, on forms obtainable from him, of the total admissions charged
and received and the amount of tax collected for the same. Claims for exemption
from the tax shall be filed with the report.  At the time the return is filed,
the full amount of the tax collected shall be remitted to the Tax Commissioner.
The Tax Commissioner may establish shorter reporting periods for any licensee
if he deems it necessary in order to insure collection of the tax, and he may
require further information in the return if such information is pertinent to
the collection of the tax. All taxes collected by operators pursuant to this
chapter shall be held in trust for the account of the City until payment
thereof is made to the Tax Commissioner. All returns and payments submitted by
each operator shall be treated as confidential by the Tax Commissioner, and
shall not be released by him except on order of a court of competent
jurisdiction or to an officer or agent of the United States, the State of Ohio,
the County of Hamilton, or the City for official use only. The nonavailability
or failure to obtain forms shall not relieve an operator from timely paying
such tax.
   (B)   No person, including any officer of a corporation or employee of a
corporation having control or supervision of or charged with the responsibility
of filing returns, shall fail to file or cause to be filed any incomplete,
false or fraudulent return, report or statement, or aid or abet another in the
filing of any false or fraudulent return, report or statement.
   (C)   If any operator required to file quarterly returns under this chapter
fails on two consecutive quarters within a 12-month period, to file such
returns when due or to pay the tax thereon, or if any operator authorized by
the Tax Commissioner to file returns at less frequent intervals, fails on two
or more occasions within a 24-month period to file such returns when due or to
pay the tax due thereon, the Tax Commissioner may require such operator to
furnish security in an amount equal to the average tax liability of the
operator for a period of one year, as determined by the Tax Commissioner from a
review of returns or other information pertaining to such operator, which
amount shall in no event be less than $100.00. Such security may be in the form
of an advance tax payment to be applied to pay the tax due on subsequent
returns or a corporate surety bond, satisfactory to the Tax Commissioner,
conditioned on payment of the tax due with the returns from the operator. Such
security must be filed within ten days following the operator's receipt of the
notice from the Tax Commissioner of its requirements. A corporate surety bond
filed under this section shall be returned to the operator if, for a period of
12 consecutive months following the date the bond was filed, the operator has
filed all returns and remitted payment therewith within the time prescribed in
this chapter.
   (D)   If any operator required to file returns and to remit tax due to the
City under the provisions of this chapter fails for any reason to make such
filing or payment, any of its officers or employees having control or
supervision of or charged with the responsibility of filing returns and making
payments shall be personally liable for such failure. The dissolution of a
corporation shall not discharge an officer's or employee's liability for a
prior failure of the corporation to file returns or remit tax due. The sum due
for such liability may be collected by assessment in the manner provided in
this chapter.
(Ord. 49-1984. Passed 6-27-84)
§ 98.07  PENALTIES AND INTEREST.
   (A)   Original delinquency. Any operator who fails to remit any tax imposed
by this chapter within the time required shall pay a penalty equal to ten
percent (10%) of the amount of the tax, in addition to the tax.
   (B)   Continued delinquency. Any operator who fails to remit any delinquent
remittance on or before a period of 30 days following the date on which the
remittance first became delinquent shall pay a second delinquency penalty equal
to ten percent (10%) of the amount of the tax and previous penalty in addition
to the tax and the ten percent (10%) penalty first imposed. An additional
penalty equal to ten percent (10%) of the total tax and penalty of the previous
30-day period shall be added for each successive 30-day period that the account
remains delinquent.
   (C)   Fraud. If the Tax Commissioner determines that the nonpayment of any
remittance due under this chapter is due to fraud, a penalty equal to twenty-
five percent (25%) of the amount of the tax shall be added thereto in addition
to the penalties stated in divisions (A) and (B) above.
   (D)   Interest. In addition to the penalties imposed, any operator who fails
to remit any tax imposed by this chapter shall pay interest at the rate of one
percent (1%) per month or fraction thereof, on the amount of the tax, exclusive
of penalties, from the date on which the remittance first became delinquent
until paid.
   (E)   Penalties during pendency of hearing or appeal. No penalty provided
under the terms of this chapter shall be imposed during the pendency of any
hearing provided for in §
98.08, nor during the pendency of any appeal to the Tax Commissioner provided
for in §
98.09.
(Ord. 49-1984, passed 6-27-84)
§ 98.08  FAILURE TO COLLECT AND REPORT TAX; DETERMINATION OF TAX BY TAX
COMMISSIONER.
   (A)   If any operator shall fail or refuse to collect tax and to make,
within the time provided in this chapter, any report and remittance of the tax
or any portion thereof required by this chapter, the Tax Commissioner shall
proceed in such manner as he may deem best to obtain facts and information on
which to base his estimate of tax due. As soon as the Tax Commissioner shall
procure such facts and information as he is able to obtain on which to base the
assessment of any tax imposed by this chapter payable by any operator who has
failed or refused to collect the same and to make such report and remittance he
shall proceed to determine and assess against such operator the tax, interest,
and penalties provided for by this chapter. In case such determination is made,
the Tax Commissioner shall give a notice of the amount so assessed by serving
it personally or by depositing it in the United States mail, postage prepaid,
addressed to the operator so assessed at his last known address. Such operator
may, within ten days after the serving or mailing of such notice, make
application in writing to the Tax Commissioner for a hearing on the amount
assessed. If application by the operator for a hearing is not made within the
time prescribed, the tax, interest and penalties, if any, determined by the Tax
Commissioner shall become final and conclusive and immediately due and payable.
   (B)   If such application is made, the Tax Commissioner shall give not less
than five days written notice in the manner prescribed herein to the operator
to show cause at a time and place fixed in such notice why the amount specified
therein should not be fixed for such tax, interest, and penalties. At such
hearing, the operator may appear and offer evidence why such specified tax,
interest and penalties should not be so fixed. After such hearing, the Tax
Commissioner shall determine the proper tax to be remitted, and shall
thereafter give written notice to the person in the manner prescribed herein of
the determination and the amount of such tax, interest and penalty. The amount
determined to be due shall be payable after 30 days unless an appeal is taken
as provided in §
98.09. Subject to the policies laid down by the Board of Review, the Tax
Commissioner shall have the power to compromise any assessment of interest and
penalties.
(Ord. 49-1984, passed 6-27-84)
§ 98.09  APPEAL.
   Any operator aggrieved by any decision of the Tax Commissioner with respect
to the amount of such tax, interest and penalties, if any, may appeal to the
Board of Review as created and constituted under §
94.18 by filing a notice of appeal with the Board of Review within 30 days of
the serving or mailing of the determination of tax due.  The Board of Review
shall fix a time and place for hearing such appeal, and shall give notice in
writing to such operator at his last known resident address. The findings of
the Board of Review shall be final and conclusive, and shall be served on the
appellant in the manner prescribed above for service of notice of hearing. Any
amount found to be due shall be immediately due and payable on service of the
notice.
(Ord. 49-1984, passed 6-27-84)
§ 98.10  RECORDS.
   (A)   It shall be the duty of every operator liable for the collection and
payment to the City of any tax imposed by this chapter to keep and preserve
such records or receipts, issuance of complimentary tickets, and otherwise,
together with the ticket stubs and other pertinent documents in such form as
the Clerk- Treasurer may require. If the operator furnishes admissions not
subject to the tax, the operator's records shall show the nature of the
transaction.
   (B)   All such records and other documents shall be open during business
hours to the inspection of the Tax Commissioner and shall be preserve for a
period of four years, unless the Tax Commissioner consents in writing to their
destruction within that period, or by order requires that they be kept longer.
(Ord. 49-1984, passed 6-27-84)
§ 98.11  REFUNDS.
   (A)   Whenever the amount of any tax, interest, or penalty has been overpaid
or paid more than once, or has been erroneously or illegally collected or
received by the City under this chapter, it may be refunded, provided a claim
in writing therefor, stating under penalty of perjury the specific grounds on
which the claim is founded, is filed with the Tax Commissioner within three
years of the date of payment. The claim shall be on forms furnished by the Tax
Commissioner. The Tax Commissioner may determine the amount of any such
erroneous or over payment.
   (B)   No refund shall be paid under the provisions of this section unless
the claimant establishes his right thereto by written records showing
entitlement thereto, and such refund exceeds $1.00. 
(Ord. 49-1984, passed 6-27-84)
§ 98.12  TAXES MADE A LIEN.
   (A)   The taxes imposed by this chapter shall be a lien on all of the
property of any person required to collect and pay or to pay the same. If he
shall sell his business or shall quit business, such person shall be required
to make out the return provided for under this chapter within 30 days after the
date of sale of such business or retirement therefrom, and his successor in
business shall be required to withhold a sufficient amount of the purchase
money to cover the amount of such taxes so collected and unpaid, together with
interest, if any, until such time as the former owner shall produce a receipt
from the Clerk- Treasurer showing that the taxes have been paid or a
certificate that no taxes are due.
   (B)   If the purchaser of a business shall fail to withhold purchase money
as above provided, and the taxes so collected shall be due and unpaid under the
30-day period allowed, he shall be liable for the payment of the taxes
collected and unpaid on account of the operation of the business by the former
owner, together with interest, as provided by this chapter.
   (C)   The lien for unpaid taxes herein imposed shall not become effective
until such time as the Clerk- Treasurer shall certify to the County Auditor of
Hamilton County the amount of taxes delinquent, and such certification is
placed on record by the County Recorder in a book maintained for that purpose. 
(Ord. 49-1984, passed 6-27-84)

than $750.00 or by imprisonment for a period of not more than 90 days, or by
both such fine and imprisonment for each offense.

§ 99.01  DEFINITIONS.
   For the purpose of this chapter the words and phrases defined in the
sections hereunder shall have the meanings therein respectively ascribed to
them, unless a different meaning is clearly indicated by the context.
   BLIGHTED PREMISES.  Premises which, because of their age, obsolescence,
dilapidation, deterioration, lack of maintenance or repair or any combination
thereof constitute a serious fire hazard, a serious health hazard, a
substantial and unreasonable interference with the reasonable and lawful use
and enjoyment of other premises within the neighborhood or a factor seriously
depreciating property values in the neighborhood.
   REDEVELOPMENT.  The acquisition of blighted premises, the demolition of a
structure or structures thereon, the making of site improvements, including the
construction or reconstruction thereon, or the sale of property for use in
accordance with the zoning code or Title XV, Chapter 152 of this code.
REDEVELOPMENT may include the construction or improvement by the city of any
buildings for public use or for resale to private persons.
   REHABILITATION.  The restoration, rehabilitation or conservation of blighted
premises by improvement, modernization or repair of a structure or structures

(Ord. 15-2005, passed 3-16-05)
§ 99.03  DETERMINATION OF BLIGHTED PREMISES.
   The Mayor or his or her designee shall present to Council, from time to
time, a report which shall list therein the location and ownership of premises
which the Mayor or his or her designee has reason to believe are blighted
premises as defined in this chapter, and which are located in the city outside
of urban renewal areas or “blighted areas” as defined in R.C. Chapter 725. The
report will state briefly the factors which, in the Mayor's or his or her
designee's opinion, would warrant the determination that the premises so listed
in the report are blighted. The premises so listed in the report shall be only
those blighted premises which, in the opinion of the Mayor or his or her
designee, are such that, in order to eliminate the existing blight and to
prevent future blight, acquisition thereof will be necessary for one or more of
the following reasons:
   (A)   The owner of the premises cannot or will not:
      (1)   Eliminate the blighted condition; and/or
      (2)   Prevent recurrence of blight; or
   (B)   The owner has not responded to a lawful order by the city to take
action to eliminate its recurrence within 30 days after notice of the request
or order has been given by:
      (1)   Posting such order or notice on the premises; or
      (2)   Personal delivery; or
      (3)   Mailing such order or notice to the last known address of the
owner; or
      (4)   Publishing once a week for three consecutive weeks in a newspaper
of general circulation a notice of the issuance of the order relating to the
premises and directing the owner to contact the Director of Buildings and
Inspections in regard to such order; or
   (C)   Direct action, short of acquisition by the City to eliminate the
blight, including but not limited to clearing the premises of the debris,
demolition of blighted structures, or barricading such structure has proved to
be unsuccessful:
      (1)   To eliminate the blight; or
      (2)   To prevent its recurrence; or
   (D)   In the opinion of the Mayor or his or her designee, based upon
conditions existing on the premises and in the neighborhood, such direct action
would be likely to prove inadequate to eliminate blight or prevent its
recurrence.
(Ord. 15-2005, passed 3-16-05)
§ 99.05  PUBLIC HEARING.
   Upon receipt of a report from the Mayor or his or her designee, Council
shall set a date for a public hearing in regard to the existence of blight on
the premises and necessity for acquisition by the city in order to eliminate
blight and prevent the recurrence thereof. Said hearing shall be held not less
than 30 nor more than 45 days from the time such report of the Mayor or his or
her designee is received. Upon the fixing of a day for a public hearing, the
Clerk of Council shall promptly cause notice to be given to the owner or owners
of record of the premises and the occupants thereof, if any, or the person in
charge of the premises, if any, notifying them of the time and place of the
hearing and apprising them of their right to appear at such hearing to show
cause why the premises should not be declared to be blighted or why the city
should not acquire said premises for the purpose of eliminating blight thereon
and preventing the recurrence of blight. Notice of such hearing shall be given
by:
   (A)   Posting the notice thereof on the premises; or
   (B)   Personal service; or
   (C)   Mailing such order or notice to the last known address of the owner or
person in charge of the premises or to the occupants thereof; or
   (D)   Publishing the notice once a week for three consecutive weeks in a
newspaper of general circulation within the city.
(Ord. 15-2005, passed 3-16-05)
§ 99.07  PROCEDURE.
   (A)   At the hearing required by §
99.05, the report of the Mayor or his or her designee shall be read and shall
constitute prima facie evidence of blight on the premises and need for the city
to acquire such premises in order to eliminate the blight and prevent
recurrence of blight thereon. Thereafter, the owner, person in charge, occupant
of the premises or any person having an interest therein may proceed to show
cause why the premises should not be declared blighted or the city should not
acquire said premises for the purposes of eliminating blight or preventing its
recurrence. At the hearing, the owner, person in charge of the premises or
occupant may cause to be presented to the Council any records of the city
pertaining to issues relevant to the hearing and may examine city employees in
regard thereto; provided that the production of such records or the presence of
such employees is requested by the owner, person in charge or occupant of the
premises in writing at least 24 hours prior to the hearing.
   (B)   If the owner, person in charge or occupant of the premises does appear
and present testimony for the purpose of showing cause why the premises should
not be declared blighted or the city should not acquire the premises for the
purposes of eliminating the blight and preventing recurrence of blight, the
Mayor or his or her designee shall proceed to present evidence to Council of
the existence of blight on the premises and need to acquire the premises for
elimination of the blight and the prevention of the recurrence of the blight
thereon. Members of the public residing in the neighborhood or who may
otherwise have knowledge of the condition of such premises may address the
Council at the hearing in regard to the proposed action of the city.
   (C)   Council may adjourn the hearing, from time to time, and grant
continuances to the Mayor or his or her designee, or the owner, person in
charge or occupant of the premises, in order for them to present further
argument or evidence in regard to the existence of blight on the premises, or
the need for the city to acquire the premises in order to eliminate blight or
prevent the recurrence of blight thereon.
(Ord. 15-2005, passed 3-16-05)
§ 99.09  LEGISLATIVE DETERMINATION.
   (A)   Council, upon completion of the hearing, shall at the same or a
subsequent meeting, decide and make findings as to:

chapter; and
      (2)   Whether or not it is necessary for the city to acquire the premises
in order to eliminate blight thereon and to prevent the recurrence of blight.
   (B)   Should Council determine that the premises are not blighted as defined
in this chapter, it may direct the Mayor or his or her designee to take action

acquisition.

chapter and that acquisition by the city is necessary in order to eliminate the
blight and prevent the recurrence of blight on the premises, the Mayor or his
or her designee shall be and hereby is authorized to proceed to take the proper
action to acquire the premises, eliminate the blight and prevent the recurrence
of blight in accordance with the provisions of this chapter.

§ 112.01  PURPOSE.
   The United States Supreme Court has recognized that door-to-door canvassers,
“whether selling pots or distributing leaflets, may lessen the peaceful
enjoyment of a home,” and that “burglars frequently pose as canvassers, wither
in order that they may have a pretense to discover whether a house is empty and
hence ripe for burglary, or for the purpose of spying out the premises in order
that they may return later.”  Martin v. City of Struthers, 319 U.S. 141, 144
(1943).  These problems continue to be associated with door-to-door canvassing,
as are even graver ones.  Therefore, the public purpose of this chapter is to
vigorously protect the First Amendment right of free speech and its
accompanying promise of anonymity for the door-to-door canvassers, while
prudently balancing that right with the government’s equally important role in
preventing fraud, minimizing crime, protecting the personal security of its
citizens, and above all, facilitating every citizen’s right to privacy.
(Ord. 19-2003, passed 5-7-03)
§ 112.02  DEFINITIONS.
   For the purpose of this chapter, the following definitions shall apply
unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning.
   DOOR-TO-DOOR CANVASSING.  Entering upon private property and/or private
residences with the purpose of contacting the occupants thereof either face-to-
face, by depositing documents at the residence, or both, but without invitation
or permission to do so by the owners or occupants of such private property or
residences.  This shall include but not be limited to such activities that are
for the purpose of advertising, promoting, selling, explaining and/or
proselytizing any product, service, organization or cause, or for the purpose
of soliciting orders for the sale of goods, wares, merchandise or services, or
for the purpose of distributing handbills or other literature, or for the
purpose of surveying or poll-taking.  Door-to-door canvassing shall include
both commercial solicitation and charitable/religious/political solicitation. 
It is not the purpose of this chapter to regulate activities such as a mail
carrier or meter reader entering upon private property in performance of his or
her duties, or other similar persons where permission to enter property is
implied by the service rendered.
   COMMERCIAL SOLICITATION.  The act of door-to-door canvassing for the purpose
of soliciting orders for or making sales of goods, wares, merchandise, or
service, or seeking donations or raising funds for any cause or organization
for profit without prior appointment or permission of the occupant or occupants
of such dwellings and which is not charitable/religious/political solicitation.
   CHARITABLE/RELIGIOUS/POLITICAL SOLICITATION.  Door-to-door canvassing by any
person, the primary purpose of which is to solicit funds or sell goods for the
benefit of charitable or not-for-profit organizations, or for the purpose of
providing information, either written or oral, to the occupants of the dwelling
about candidates for public office, political issues, or religious or church
related matters.
   CANVASSER.  Any individual who enters upon private property without
invitation or permission for the purposes of door-to-door canvassing, as
defined above.

goods to be sold under the license, and the amount of fee paid, the date of
issuance and the length of time the same shall be operative, as well as the

standard form authorized by the FCC.  Based on the City Council or the ICRC's
findings, the initial basic cable rates shall be established as follows:

shall become the initial basic cable rates and the cable operator's rates will

   (B)   If the current basic cable rates exceed the benchmark, the rates shall
be the greater of the cable operator's per channel rate on September 30, 1992,
reduced by 10%, or the applicable benchmark, adjusted for inflation and any
change in the number of channels occurring between September 30, 1992 and the
initial date of regulation.
   (C)   If the current basic cable rates exceed the benchmark, but the cable
operator's per channel rate was below the benchmark on September 30, 1992, the
initial basic cable rate shall be the benchmark, adjusted for inflation.
(Ord. 16-1994, passed 3-2-94)
§ 119.27  COST-OF-SERVICE SHOWINGS.
   If a cable operator does not wish to reduce the rates to the permitted

service showing in an attempt to justify an initial basic cable rate above the
FCC's reasonable rate standard.  The City Council will review a cost-of-service
review.  The City Council may approve initial basic cable rates above the
benchmark if the cable operator makes the necessary showing; however, a cost-
of-service determination resulting in rates below the benchmark or below the
cable operator's September 30, 1992 rates minimum 10%, will prescribe the cable
operator's new rates.
(Ord. 16-1994, passed 3-2-94)
§ 119.28  DECISION.
   (A)   By formal resolution.  After completion by the city or the ICRC of its
review of the cable operator's proposed rates, the City Council shall adopt its
decision by formal resolution.  The decision shall include one of the
following:
      (1)   If the proposal is within the FCC's reasonable rate standard or is
justified by a cost-of- service analysis, the City Council shall approve the
initial basic cable rates proposed by the cable operator;
      (2)   If the proposal is not within the FCC's reasonable rate standard
and the cost-of-service analysis, if any, does not justify the proposed rates,
the City Council shall establish initial basic cable rates that are within the
FCC's reasonable rate standard or that are justified by a cost-of-service
analysis.
   (B)   Rollbacks and refunds.  If the City Council determines that the
initial basic cable rates as submitted exceed the reasonable rate standard or
that the cable operator's cost-of-service showing justifies lower rates, the
City Council may order the rates reduced in accordance with §§
1192.6 or
119.27, as applicable.  In addition, the City Council may order the cable
operator to pay to subscribers refunds of the excessive portion of the rates
with interest (computed at applicable rates published by the Internal Revenue
Service for tax refunds and additional tax payments), retroactive to September
1, 1993.  The method for paying any refund and the interest rate will be in
accordance with FCC regulations as directed in the City Council's decision
resolution.
   (C)   Statement of reasons for decision and public notice.  If rates
proposed by a cable operator are disapproved in whole or in part, or if there
were objections made by other parties to the proposed rates, the resolution
must state the reasons for the decision and the City Council must give public
notice of its decision.  Public notice will be given by advertisement once in

§ 122.01  PURPOSE.
   The purpose of this chapter is to regulate teen clubs through the
application of uniform zoning and licensing requirements to promote the health,
safety, morals and general welfare of the patrons of such clubs and of all
citizens of the city, and to establish reasonable and uniform regulations for
the operation of teen clubs because of their nature as permitted uses in areas
of the city that are also zoned for uses deemed by the Council to be
incompatible with teen use, including, but not limited to, sexually oriented
businesses and liquor establishments. It is not the intent of this chapter to
limit or restrict the operation of any club geared toward a teen clientele as
their intended market, but to provide a safe and reasonable manner in which to
operate such clubs.
(Ord. 42-2002, passed 6-19-02)
§ 122.02  DEFINITIONS.
   For the purpose of this chapter, the following definitions shall apply
unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning.
   EMPLOYEE.  Any person who works in and/or for a teen club business,
regardless of whether or not said person is paid a salary, wage or other
compensation by the operator of said business and whether or not the person is
determined an employee, independent contractor, agent or otherwise. The term
EMPLOYEE does not include a person exclusively on the premises for repair or
maintenance of the premises or equipment on the premises, or for the delivery
of goods to the premises.
   PERMITTEE and/or LICENSEE.  Any person in whose name a permit and/or license
to operate a teen club business has been issued, as well as the individual
listed as an applicant on the application for a permit and/or license.
   TEEN CLUB.  All buildings and places of assembly where the intended
occupancy is either overwhelmingly or exclusively minors between 13 and 21
years of age unaccompanied by an adult parent or guardian, but not including
similar events operated by a non-profit organization. TEEN CLUB shall include,
but not be limited to, teen night clubs, teen dance clubs or teen entertainment
establishments.
(Ord. 42-2002, passed 6-19-02)
§ 122.03  ESTABLISHMENT AND CLASSIFICATION OF REGULATED BUSINESSES.
   Teen clubs shall be established only in identified zones as set forth in
Chapter 153 of the city’s Zoning Code and shall be subject to the restrictions
of this chapter.
(Ord. 42-2002, passed 6-19-02)
§ 122.04  NONCONFORMING USES.
   (A)   Any teen club lawfully operating at the time of the enactment of this
chapter that is in violation of §
122.03 shall be deemed a non-conforming teen club business use. A non-
conforming teen club may continue its business for three months as long as a
proper permit application has been filed within 30 days of the effective date
of this chapter, and may be extended by the City Administrator upon a showing
of extreme financial hardship, unless voluntarily discontinued for a period of
30 days or more. Such non-conforming uses may not be increased, enlarged,
extended or altered unless to a conforming use. Any non-conforming teen club
which has not applied for a permit within the required time, or which does not
ultimately qualify for a permit, shall cease its business immediately upon the
expiration of the three month period, or upon denial of a permit application,
whichever comes later.
   (B)   Any establishment subject to the provisions of this chapter shall
apply for a permit as provided under §

§ 123.01  APPLICABILITY.
   No owner of single household residential property located within the city
shall rent, or seek to rent, any dwelling or dwelling unit in such real
property for any form of consideration unless he or she holds a valid
conditional rental permit or rental permit issued by the Building Official in
the name of the owner and for the specific dwelling or dwelling unit for rent. 
The term “owner” shall have the same meaning as defined in § 155.011.
(Ord. 15-2008, passed 4-2-08)
§ 123.02  PERMIT PERIOD.
   (A)   A rental permit shall be valid for a one-year period except as
provided hereinafter.  An owner shall be required to obtain a new rental permit
at the expiration of the one year period. Except as provided hereinafter, a
conditional rental permit shall be valid for the period specified in the
conditional rental permit as set forth in §
123.06(B)(2) herein.
   (B)   If, during the time period specified above, the occupancy of the
dwelling or dwelling unit for which the rental permit or conditional rental
permit has been issued transfers from one tenant to another (“transfer of
occupancy”), the issued rental permit or conditional rental permit shall expire
and the owner shall be required to obtain a new rental permit or conditional
rental permit. The owner shall have two weeks after the transfer of the
occupancy of the dwelling or dwelling unit in which to apply for a new rental
permit or conditional rental permit. If an owner fails to notify the office of
the Building Official of a transfer of occupancy within two weeks, the rental
permit or conditional rental permit for the dwelling or dwelling unit in which
the occupancy has changed shall be deemed revoked and the owner shall be
required to apply for a conditional rental permit or rental permit or be
subject to the penalties contained in §
123.99 herein. A submitted application and payment of fees by an owner for the
renewal of a rental permit or conditional rental permit shall operate as
authority for the owner to rent the dwelling or dwelling unit for which the
renewal application has been made, until such time as the office of the
Building Official denies or issues a subsequent rental permit or conditional
rental permit. An owner will not be required to pay a fee for transfer of
occupancy for a specific dwelling or dwelling unit if a prior rental permit has
been issued for said dwelling or dwelling unit within the previous 180 days.
   (C)   Each dwelling or dwelling unit may be inspected for a new rental
permit or conditional rental permit prior to a transfer of occupancy. A
residential property will not be required to be inspected for a new rental
permit or conditional rental permit upon a transfer of occupancy if the
dwelling or dwelling unit has been inspected and approved for occupancy within
the 180 days prior to the transfer of occupancy. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
a dwelling or dwelling unit shall be required to be inspected if complaints
about the condition of the dwelling or dwelling unit have been filed with the
city by the occupants of the dwelling or dwelling unit during the preceding 60
days prior to the transfer of occupancy.

§ 123.03  PERMIT APPLICATION.

Official. Such application form shall include, at a minimum, the name of the
property owner, address and telephone number of the property owner, address of
the property, and name and telephone number of the proposed tenant, if known at
the time of the application. If an owner fails to notify the office of the

weeks after the tenant takes occupancy of the dwelling or dwelling unit, the
rental permit or conditional rental permit for the dwelling or dwelling unit
shall be deemed revoked.
   (B)   The application for a rental permit or conditional rental permit shall
be in affidavit form, and the owner shall be required therein to answer, to the
best of his or her knowledge, all pertinent questions with respect to the
conformance of the subject property to this chapter and to all other applicable
ordinances, rules, and regulations related to the construction, condition and
appearance of the dwelling or dwelling unit.

currently renting or seeking to rent a dwelling or dwelling unit within the

premises inspection and the office of the building official has determined that
the dwelling or dwelling unit complies with the applicable provisions of this
chapter.

office of the Building Official shall request an inspection of the dwelling or
dwelling unit by the Building Official or his or her designee (except as
provided under §
123.02(C) herein). If the property owner, after being given seven calendar days
to voluntarily consent to a request to make the subject property available for
inspection, refuses to provide such voluntary consent, the Building Official
may seek an administrative search warrant for the premises in order to complete
the inspection, prior to the issuance of the permit. For the purposes of this
administrative search warrant, probable cause in the criminal law sense is not
required. Probable cause justifying the issuance of an administrative search
warrant may be based not only on specific evidence of an existing violation,
but also on a showing that reasonable legislative or administrative standards
for conducting an inspection have been satisfied with respect to the particular
property, including but not limited to the passage of time, the nature of the
building, or the condition of the entire area.
   (B)   During an inspection, the Building Official shall inspect the dwelling
or dwelling unit, including the interior and exterior of any attached or
detached accessory structures such as sheds or garages, for compliance with all
ordinances, rules and regulations applicable to the construction, condition and
appearance of the subject property. If the building official determines, after
inspection, that the property is in compliance with the applicable code
sections, he or she shall certify the same and issue a rental permit.

and/or his or her designee finds violations of the rules, regulations and
ordinances set forth in §
123.04(B) herein. Should the Building Official and/or his or her designee be
required to make an additional inspection beyond the initial inspection and
first re-inspection to determine compliance of any violations of the rules,
regulations and ordinances set forth in §
123.04(B), the fees for any such additional inspection shall be $50.00. This
fee structure shall be reviewed yearly prior to the submittal of the city's
annual budget and adjusted if necessary and appropriate.

inspection, the Building Official is unable to certify that the dwelling or
dwelling unit for which a rental permit is sought conforms to the requirements
of this chapter or the rules, regulations and ordinances, the office of the
Building Official may, when the nonconformity in his or her opinion does not
constitute an immediate threat or danger to the health, safety, or public
welfare of the community or the inhabitants or potential inhabitants of the
dwelling or dwelling unit, issue a conditional rental permit to the applicant.
The office of the Building Official shall not grant a conditional rental permit
if the dwelling or dwelling unit constitutes an immediate threat or danger to
the health, safety or public welfare of the community or the inhabitants or
potential inhabitants of the dwelling or dwelling unit. The denial of any such
application shall be subject to the appeal procedure provided for in this
chapter.
      (2)   A conditional permit shall set forth the reasons why the dwelling
or dwelling unit does not conform to this chapter and the time allowed for the
owner to secure conformity (which time shall not exceed 90 days). The office of
the Building Official and/or his or her designee may give notice of its intent
to revoke the conditional permit at any time if he or she determines that the
continued nonconformity constitutes an immediate threat or danger to the
health, safety, or public welfare of the community, or the inhabitants or
potential inhabitants of the dwelling or dwelling unit, or he or she may extend
the period for securing conformity, if, in his or her opinion, the continued
nonconformity does not constitute a threat or danger, which extensions shall
not exceed an additional 60 days ("extension period").  If the owner has not
fulfilled the requirements under the conditional rental permit within the time
specified in the conditional rental permit and/or the extension period, the
conditional rental permit shall expire. If an owner fulfills the requirements
under a conditional rental permit within the time specified, the owner shall be
granted a rental permit which shall be valid for a one-year period from the
date of application.
   (C)   Whenever, upon inspection of any dwelling or dwelling unit requiring a
rental permit or conditional rental permit, the Building Official finds that
conditions or practices exist which are in violation of any provision set forth
in §
123.04(B) herein, the office of the Building Official shall give notice in
writing to the owner of such violations. If the owner has not corrected the
violations within 30 days of receiving notice from the office of the Building
Official, the Building Official shall give written notice to the owner that the
issued rental permit or conditional rental permit shall be revoked subject to
the appeal process provided for in this chapter. The Building Official shall be
authorized to extend the period for correcting violation if, in his or her
opinion, there is just cause to do so.

against conduct of a certain nature, regardless of what the offender intends to
accomplish thereby, it is the offender’s specific intention to engage in
conduct of that nature.
   (B)   A person acts knowingly, regardless of purpose, when the person is
aware that the person’s conduct will probably cause a certain result or will
probably be of a certain nature. A person has knowledge of circumstances when
the person is aware that such circumstances probably exist. When knowledge of
the existence of a particular fact is an element of an offense, such knowledge
is established if a person subjectively believes that there is a high
probability of its existence and fails to make inquiry or acts with a conscious
purpose to avoid learning the fact.
   (C)   A person acts recklessly when, with heedless indifference to the
consequences, the person disregards a substantial and unjustifiable risk that
the person’s conduct is likely to cause a certain result or is likely to be of
a certain nature. A person is reckless with respect to circumstances when, with
heedless indifference to the consequences, the person disregards a substantial
and unjustifiable risk that such circumstances are likely to exist.

due care, the person fails to perceive or avoid a risk that the person’s
conduct may cause a certain result or may be of a certain nature.  A person is
negligent with respect to circumstances when, because of a substantial lapse
from due care, the person fails to perceive or avoid a risk that such
circumstances may exist.
   (E)   When the section defining an offense provides that negligence suffices
to establish an element thereof, then recklessness, knowledge, or purpose is
also sufficient culpability for such element.  When recklessness suffices to
establish an element of an offense, then knowledge  or purpose is  also
sufficient culpability for such element.  When knowledge suffices to establish
an element of an offense, then purpose is also sufficient culpability for such
element.

      (4)   Except as otherwise provided in divisions (D) to (L) of this
section, a prosecution of a violation of R.C. § 2907.02 or 2907.03 or a

of the offense either by an aggrieved person or by the aggrieved persons’ legal
representative who is not a party to the offense.
      (2)   If the period of limitation provided in division (A)(1) or (A)(3)
of this section has expired, prosecution for a violation of R.C. §2913.49 shall
be commenced within five years after discovery of the offense either by an
aggrieved person or the aggrieved person’s legal representative who is not a
party to the offense.
   (C)   (1)   If the period of limitation provided in division (A)(1) or (A)
(3) of this section has expired, prosecution shall be commenced for the

         (a)   For an offense involving misconduct in office by a public
servant at any time while the accused remains a public servant, or within two
years thereafter;
         (b)   For an offense by a person who is not a public servant but whose
offense is directly related to the misconduct in office of a public servant, at
any time while that public servant remains a public servant, or within two
years thereafter.
      (2)   As used in this division:
         (a)   The phrase OFFENSE IS DIRECTLY RELATED TO THE MISCONDUCT IN
OFFICE OF A PUBLIC SERVANT includes, but is not limited to, a violation of R.C.
§ 101.71, 101.91, 121.61 or 2921.13, 102.03(F) or (H), 2921.02(A), 2921.43(A)
or (B), or 3517.13(F) or (G), that is directly related to an offense involving
misconduct in office of a public servant, or a violation of any municipal
ordinance substantially equivalent to those Ohio Revised Code sections listed
in this division (C)(2)(a).
         (b)   PUBLIC SERVANT has the same meaning as in R.C. § 2921.01.
   (D)   (1)   If a DNA record made in connection with the criminal
investigation of the commission of a violation of R.C. § 2907.02 or 2907.03 is
determined to match another DNA record that is of an identifiable person and if
the time of the determination is later than 25 years after the offense is
committed, prosecution of that person for a violation of the section may be
commenced within five years after the determination is complete.
      (2)   If a DNA record made in connection with the criminal investigation

Code is determined to match another DNA record that is of an identifiable
person and if the time of the determination is within 25 years after the
offense is committed, prosecution of that person for a violation of the section

      (3)   As used in this division, DNA RECORD has the same meaning as in
R.C. § 109.573.
   (E)   An offense is committed when every element of the offense occurs. In
the case of an offense of which an element is a continuing course of conduct,
the period of limitation does not begin to run until the course of conduct or
the accused's accountability for it terminates, whichever occurs first.
   (F)   A prosecution is commenced on the date an indictment is returned or an
information filed, or on the date a lawful arrest without a warrant is made, or
on the date a warrant, summons, citation or other process is issued, whichever
occurs first.  A prosecution is not commenced by the return of an indictment or

against the accused based on the same conduct is pending in the state, even
though the indictment, information, or process  that commenced the prosecution
is quashed or the proceedings on the indictment, information, or process are
set aside or reversed on appeal.
   (J)   The period of limitation for a violation of this Title or Title XXIX
of the Ohio Revised Code that involves a physical or mental wound, injury,
disability, or condition of a nature that reasonably indicates abuse or neglect

either of the following occurs:
      (1)   The victim of the offense reaches the age of majority.
      (2)   A public children services agency, or a municipal or county peace
officer that is not the parent or guardian of the child, in the county in which
the child resides or in which the abuse or neglect is occurring or has occurred
has been notified that abuse or neglect is known, suspected, or believed to
have occurred.
   (K)   As used in this section, PEACE OFFICER has the same meaning as in R.C.
§ 2935.01.
   (L)   The amendments to divisions (A) and (D) of this section apply to a
violation of R.C. § 2907.02 or 2907.03 committed on and after July 16, 2015,
and apply to a violation of either of those sections committed prior to July
16, 2015, if prosecution for that violation was not barred under this section
as it existed on July 15, 2015.
(R.C. § 2901.13)  (Rev. eff. with 2017 S-18)  (Ord. 79-1973, passed 12-19-73)
§ 130.07  (2901.21) REQUIREMENTS FOR CRIMINAL LIABILITY; VOLUNTARY
INTOXICATION.
   (A)   Except as provided in division (B) of this section, a person is not
guilty of an offense unless both of the following apply:
      (1)   The person’s liability is based on conduct that includes either a
voluntary act, or an omission to perform an act or duty that the person is
capable of performing;
      (2)   The person has the requisite degree of culpability for each element
as to which a culpable mental state is specified by the language defining the
offense.
   (B)   When the language defining an offense does not specify any degree of
culpability, and plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict criminal
liability for the conduct described in the section, then culpability is not
required for a person to be guilty of the offense. The fact that one division
of a section plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict liability for an
offense defined in that division does not by itself plainly indicate a purpose
to impose strict criminal liability for an offense defined in other divisions
of the section that do not specify a degree of culpability.
   (C)   (1)   When language defining an element of an offense that is related
to knowledge or intent or to which mens rea could fairly be applied neither
specifies culpability nor plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict
liability, the element of the offense is established only if a person acts
recklessly.
      (2)   Division (C)(1) of this section does not apply to offenses defined
in R.C. Title XLV.
      (3)   Division (C)(1) of this section does not relieve the prosecution of
the burden of proving the culpable mental state required by any definition
incorporated into the offense.
   (D)   Voluntary intoxication may not be taken into consideration in
determining the existence of a mental state that is an element of a criminal
offense.  Voluntary intoxication does not relieve a person of a duty to act if
failure to act constitutes a criminal offense.  Evidence that a person was
voluntarily intoxicated may be admissible to show whether or not the person was
physically capable of performing the act with which the person is charged.
   (E)   As used in this section:
      (1)   POSSESSION.  A voluntary act if the possessor knowingly procured or
received the thing possessed, or was aware of the possessor’s control of the
thing possessed for a sufficient time to have ended possession.
      (2)   INVOLUNTARY ACTS.  Reflexes, convulsions, body movements during
unconsciousness or sleep, and body movements that are not otherwise a product
of the actor's volition, are involuntary acts.
      (3)   CULPABILITY. Purpose, knowledge, recklessness, or negligence, as
defined in §
130.02, or any other specific mental state required by any section of this
title.
      (4)   INTOXICATION.  Includes, but it not limited to, intoxication
resulting from the ingestion of alcohol, a drug, or alcohol and a drug.
(R.C. § 2901.21) (Rev. eff. with 2016 S-17)  (Ord. 79-1973, passed 12-19-73)
§ 130.08  (2901.23)  ORGANIZATIONAL CRIMINAL LIABILITY.
   (A)   An organization may be convicted of an offense under any of the
following circumstances:
      (1)   The offense is a minor misdemeanor committed by an officer, agent,
or employee of the organization acting in its behalf and within the scope of
the officer’s, agent’s, or employee’s office or employment, except that if the
section defining the offense designates the officers, agents, or employees for
which conduct the organization is accountable or the circumstances under which
it is accountable, those provisions shall apply.
      (2)   A purpose to impose organizational liability plainly appears in the
section defining the offense and the offense is committed by an officer, agent,
or employee of the organization acting in its behalf and within the scope of
the officer’s, agent’s, or employee’s office or employment, except that if the
section defining the offense designates the officers, agents, or employees for
whose conduct the organization is accountable or the circumstances under which
it is accountable, those provisions shall apply.
      (3)   The offense consists of an omission to discharge a specific duty
imposed by law on the organization.
      (4)   If, acting with the kind of culpability otherwise required for the
commission of the offense, its commission was authorized, requested, commanded,
tolerated, or performed by the board of directors, trustees, partners or by a
high managerial officer, agent, or employee acting in behalf of the
organization and within the scope of such a board’s or person’s office or
employment.
   (B)   If strict liability is imposed for the commission of an offense, a
purpose to impose organizational liability shall be presumed, unless the
contrary plainly appears.
   (C)   In a prosecution of an organization for an offense other than one for
which strict liability is imposed, it is a defense that the high managerial
officer, agent, or employee having supervisory responsibility over the subject
matter of the offense exercised due diligence to prevent its commission. This
defense is not available if it plainly appears inconsistent with the purpose of
the section defining the offense.
   (D)   As used in this section, ORGANIZATION means a corporation for profit
or not for profit, partnership, limited partnership, joint venture,
unincorporated nonprofit association, estate, trust, or other commercial or
legal entity.  ORGANIZATION does not include an entity organized as or by a
governmental agency for the execution of a governmental program.
(R.C. § 2901.23) (Rev. eff. with 2013 S-14) (Ord. 79-1973, passed 12-19-73)
§ 130.09  (2901.24) PERSONAL ACCOUNTABILITY FOR ORGANIZATIONAL CONDUCT.
   (A)   An officer, agent, or employee of an organization may be prosecuted
for an offense committed by such organization if he acts with the kind of
culpability required for the commission of the offense and any of the following
applies:
      (1)   In the name of the organization or in its behalf he engages in
conduct constituting the offense or causes another to engage in such conduct or
tolerates such conduct when it is of a type for which he has direct
responsibility;
      (2)   He has primary responsibility to discharge a duty imposed on the
organization by law and such duty is not discharged.
   (B)   When a person is convicted of an offense by reason of this section, he
is subject to the same penalty as if he had acted in his own behalf.
(R.C. § 2901.24) (Ord. 79-1973, passed 12-19-73)

      (8)   The statement is in writing, and is made with purpose to induce
another to extend credit to or employ the offender, or to confer any degree,
diploma, certificate of attainment, award of excellence, or honor on the
offender, or to extend to or bestow upon the offender any other valuable
benefit or distinction, when the person to whom the statement is directed
relies upon it to his or her detriment.
      (9)   The statement is made with purpose to commit or facilitate the
commission of a theft offense.
      (10)   The statement is knowingly made to a probate court in connection
with any action, proceeding, or other matter within its jurisdiction, either
orally or in a written document, including, but not limited to, an application,

other document that contains false information about the purchaser's identity.
      (13)   The statement is made in a document or instrument of writing that
purports to be a judgment, lien, or claim of indebtedness and is filed or
recorded with the Secretary of State, a county recorder, or the clerk of a
court of record.
      (14)   The statement is made in an application filed with a county
sheriff pursuant to R.C. § 2923.125 in order to obtain or renew a concealed

      (15)   The statement is required under R.C. § 5743.71 in connection with
the person’s purchase of cigarettes or tobacco products in a delivery sale.
   (B)   No person, in connection with the purchase of a firearm as defined in

   (C)   No person, in an attempt to obtain a concealed handgun license under

   (E)   If contradictory statements relating to the same fact are made by the

this section, no person giving aid to a sick or injured person shall
negligently fail to report to law enforcement authorities any gunshot or stab
wound treated or observed by the person, or any serious physical harm to
persons that the person knows or has reasonable cause to believe resulted from
an offense of violence.
   (C)   No person who discovers the body or acquires the first knowledge of
the death of a person shall fail to report the death immediately to a physician
or advanced practice registered nurse whom the person knows to be treating the
deceased for a condition from which death at such time would not be unexpected,
or to a law enforcement officer, an ambulance service, an emergency squad, or
the coroner in a political subdivision in which the body is discovered, the
death is believed to have occurred, or knowledge concerning the death is
obtained. For purposes of this division, “advanced practice registered nurse”
does not include a certified registered nurse anesthetist.
   (D)   No person shall fail to provide upon request of the person to whom a
report required by division (C) of this section was made, or to any law
enforcement officer who has reasonable cause to assert the authority to

      (2)   No physician, nurse, physician assistant, or limited practitioner
who, outside a hospital, sanitarium, or other medical facility, attends or
treats a person who has sustained a burn injury inflicted by an explosion or
other incendiary device, or that shows evidence of having been inflicted in a
violent, malicious, or criminal manner, shall fail to report the burn injury

law enforcement authorities.
      (3)   No manager, superintendent, or other person in charge of a
hospital, sanitarium, or other medical facility in which a person is attended
or treated for any burn injury inflicted by an explosion or other incendiary

      (4)   No person who is required to report any burn injury under division

      (5)   Anyone participating in the making of reports under division (E) of
this section or anyone participating in a judicial proceeding resulting from
the reports is immune from any civil or criminal liability that otherwise might
be incurred or imposed as a result of such actions. Notwithstanding R.C. §
4731.22, the physician-patient relationship or advanced practice registered
nurse- patient relationship is not a ground for excluding evidence regarding a
person’s burn injury or the cause of the burn injury in any judicial proceeding
resulting from a report submitted under division (E) of this section.

§ 3113.31, shall note that knowledge or belief and the basis for it in the
patient’s or client’s records.
      (2)   Notwithstanding R.C. § 4731.22, the physician-patient privilege or
advanced practice registered nurse-patient privilege shall not be a ground for
excluding any information regarding the report containing the knowledge or
belief noted under division (F)(1) of this section, and the information may be
admitted as evidence in accordance with the Rules of Evidence.
   (G)   Division (A) or (D) of this section does not require disclosure of

      (1)   The information is privileged by reason of the relationship between
attorney and client; physician and patient; advanced practice registered nurse
and patient; licensed psychologist or licensed school psychologist and client;
licensed professional clinical counselor, licensed professional counselor,
independent social worker, social worker, independent marriage and family
therapist, or marriage and family therapist and client; member of the clergy,

religious counseling purpose of a professional character; husband and wife; or
a communications assistant and those who are a party to a telecommunications
relay service call.
      (2)   The information would tend to incriminate a member of the actor's
immediate family;
      (3)   Disclosure of the information would amount to revealing a news
source, privileged under R.C. §§ 2739.04 or 2739.12;
      (4)   Disclosure of the information would amount to dis closure of an
ordained clergyman of an organized religious body of a confidential
communication made to the clergyman in a capacity as a clergyman by a person
seeking aid or counsel;
      (5)   Disclosure would amount to revealing information acquired by the
actor in the course of the actor's duties in connection with a bona fide
program of treatment or services for drug dependent persons or persons in
danger of drug dependence, which program is maintained or conducted by a
hospital, clinic, person, agency, or community addiction services provider
whose alcohol and drug addiction services are certified pursuant to R.C. §
5119.36.
      (6)   Disclosure would amount to revealing information  acquired by the
actor in the course of the actor's duties in connection with a bona fide
program for providing counseling services to victims of crimes that are
violations of R.C. §§ 2907.02, 2907.05, or 2907.12.  As used in this division,
COUNSELING SERVICES include services provided in an informal setting by a
person who, by education or experience, is competent to provide such services.
   (H)  No disclosure of information pursuant to this section gives rise to any
liability or recrimination for a breach of privilege or confidence.
   (I)   Whoever violates division (A) or (B) of this section is guilty of
failure to report a crime.  Violation of division (A)(1) of this section is a
misdemeanor of the fourth degree.  Violation of division (A)(2) or (B) of this
section is a misdemeanor of the second degree.
   (J)   Whoever violates division (C) or (D) of this section is guilty of
failure to report knowledge of a death, a misdemeanor of the fourth degree.
   (K)   (1)   Whoever negligently violates division (E) of this section is
guilty of a minor misdemeanor.
      (2)   Whoever knowingly violates division (E) of this section is guilty
of a misdemeanor of the second degree.

commission of any offense under these codified ordinances or any felony of the
fifth degree, shall do either of the following:
      (1)   With another person or persons, plan or aid in planning the
commission of any of the specified offenses;
      (2)   Agree with another person or persons that one or more of them will
engage in conduct which facilitates the commission of any of the specified
offenses.
   (B)   No person shall be convicted of conspiracy unless a substantial overt
act in furtherance of the conspiracy is alleged and proved to have been done by
the accused or a person with whom the accused conspired, subsequent to the
accused's entrance into the conspiracy. For purposes of this section, an overt
act is substantial when it is of a character that manifests a purpose on the
part of the actor that the object of the conspiracy should be completed.
   (C)   When the offender knows or has reasonable cause to believe that a
person with whom the offender conspires also has conspired or is conspiring
with another to commit the same offense, the offender is guilty of conspiring
with that other person, even though the other person’s identity may be unknown
to the offender.
   (D)   It is no defense to a charge under this section that, in retrospect,
commission of the offense that was the object of the conspiracy was impossible
under the circumstances.
   (E)   A conspiracy terminates when the offense or offenses which are its
objects are committed, or when it is abandoned by all conspirators.  In the
absence of abandonment, it is no defense to a charge under this section that no
offense which was the object of the conspiracy was committed.
   (F)   A person who conspires to commit more than one offense is guilty of
only one conspiracy, when the offenses are the object of the same agreement or

a person with whom the defendant conspired, unsupported by other evidence.
      (2)   If a person with whom the defendant allegedly has conspired
testifies against the defendant in a case in which the defendant is charged
with conspiracy and if the testimony is supported by other evidence, the court,
when it charges the jury, shall state substantially the following:
“The testimony of an accomplice that is supported by other evidence does not
become inadmissible because of the accomplice’s complicity, moral turpitude, or
self-interest, but the admitted or claimed complicity of a witness may affect
the witness’ credibility and make the witness’ testimony subject to grave
suspicion, and require that it be weighed with great caution.
It is for you, as jurors, in the light of all the facts presented to you from
the witness stand, to evaluate such testimony and to determine its quality and
worth or its lack of quality and worth.”
      (3)   CONSPIRACY as used in division (H)(1) of this section, does not
include any conspiracy that results in an attempt to commit an offense or in
the commission of an offense.
   (I)   The following are affirmative defenses to a charge of conspiracy:
      (1)   After conspiring to commit an offense, the actor thwarted the
success of the conspiracy under circumstances manifesting a complete and
voluntary renunciation of the actor’s criminal purpose;
      (2)   After conspiring to commit an offense, the actor abandoned the
conspiracy prior to the commission of or attempt to commit any offense which
was the object of the conspiracy, either by advising all other conspirators of
the actor’s abandonment or by informing any law enforcement authority of the
existence of the conspiracy and of the actor’s participation in the conspiracy.
   (J)   This section does not define a separate conspiracy offense or penalty
where conspiracy is defined as an offense by one or more sections of these
codified ordinances or of the Revised Code, other than this section. In such a
case, however:
      (1)   With respect to the offense specified as the object of the
conspiracy in such other section or sections, division (A) defines the
voluntary act or acts and culpable mental state necessary to constitute the
conspiracy;
      (2)   Divisions (B) through (I) are incorporated by reference in the
conspiracy offense defined by such other section or sections of these codified
ordinances or of the Revised Code.
   (K)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of conspiracy, a misdemeanor
of the first degree when the most serious offense which is the object of the
conspiracy is a felony of the fifth degree.

Penalty, see §
130.99
§ 130.24 (2923.02)  ATTEMPT.
   (A)   No person, purposely or knowingly, and when purpose or knowledge is
sufficient culpability for the commission of an offense, shall engage in
contact which, if successful, would constitute or result in the offense.
   (B)   It is no defense to a charge under this section that, in retrospect,
commission of the offense which was the object of the attempt was either
factually or legally impossible under the attendant circumstances, if that
offense could have been committed had the attendant circumstances been as the
actor believed them to be.
   (C)   No person who is convicted of committing a specific offense, of
complicity in the commission of an offense, or of conspiracy to commit an
offense, shall be convicted of an attempt to commit the same offense in
violation of this section.
   (D)   It is an affirmative defense to a charge under this section that the
actor abandoned his or her effort to commit the offense or otherwise prevented
its commission, under circumstances manifesting a complete and voluntary
renunciation of his or her criminal purpose.
   (E)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of an attempt to commit an
offense.  An attempt to commit aggravated murder, murder, or an offense for
which the maximum penalty is imprisonment for life is a felony of the first
degree, to be prosecuted under appropriate state law. An attempt to commit a
drug abuse offense for which the penalty is determined by the amount or number
of unit doses of the controlled substance involved in the drug abuse offense is
an offense of the same degree as the drug abuse offense attempted would be if
that drug abuse offense had been committed and had involved an amount or number
of unit doses of the controlled substance that is within the next lower range
of controlled substance amounts than was involved in the attempt. An attempt to
commit any other offense is an offense of the next lesser degree than the
offense attempted.  In the case of an attempt to commit an offense other than a
violation of R.C. Chapter 3734 that is not specifically classified, an attempt
is a misdemeanor of the first degree if the offense attempted is a felony, and
a misdemeanor of the fourth degree if the offense attempted is a misdemeanor. 
In the case of an attempt to commit a violation of any provision of R.C.
Chapter 3734, other than R.C. § 3734.18, that relates to hazardous wastes, an
attempt is a felony to be prosecuted under appropriate state law.  An attempt
to commit a minor misdemeanor, or to engage in conspiracy, is not an offense
under this section.
   (F)   As used in this section:
      (1)   DRUG ABUSE OFFENSE has the same meaning as in R.C. § 2925.01.
      (2)   MOTOR VEHICLE has the same meaning as in R.C. § 4501.01.

Penalty, see §
130.99
§ 130.25 (2923.03)  COMPLICITY.
   (A)   No person, acting with the kind of culpability required for the
commission of an offense, shall do any of the following:
      (1)   Solicit or procure another to commit the offense;
      (2)   Aid or abet another in committing the offense;
      (3)   Conspire with another to commit the offense in violation of §
130.13;
      (4)   Cause an innocent or irresponsible person to commit the offense.
   (B)   It is no defense to a charge under this section that no person with
whom the accused was in complicity has been convicted as a principal offender.
   (C)   No person shall be convicted of complicity under this section unless
an offense is actually committed, but a person may be convicted of complicity
in an attempt to commit an offense in violation of §
130.23.
   (D)   No person shall be convicted of complicity under this section solely
upon the testimony of an accomplice, unsupported by other evidence.
   (E)   It is an affirmative defense to a charge under this section that,
prior to the commission of or attempt to commit the offense, the actor
terminated his complicity, under circumstances manifesting a complete and
voluntary renunciation of his criminal purpose.
   (F)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of complicity in the
commission of an offense, and shall be prosecuted and punished as if he were a
principal offender.  A charge of complicity may be stated in terms of this
section, or in terms of the principal offense.

enforcement agencies upon their request. If any tax imposed under R.C. Title 43
has not been paid in relation to the beer, intoxicating liquor, or alcohol, any
moneys acquired from the sale shall first be used to pay the tax. All other
money collected under this division (B)(1)(d) shall be paid into the State
Treasury. Any beer, intoxicating liquor, or alcohol that the Division
determines to be unfit for sale shall be destroyed.
         (e)   Money received by an inmate of a correctional institution from
an unauthorized source or in an unauthorized manner shall be returned to the
sender, if known, or deposited in the inmates’ industrial and entertainment
fund of the institution if the sender is not known.
         (f)   1.   Any mobile instrumentality forfeited under R.C. Chapter
2981 may be given to the law enforcement agency that initially seized the
mobile instrumentality for use in performing its duties, if the agency wants
the mobile instrumentality. The agency shall take the mobile instrumentality
subject to any security interest or lien on the mobile instrumentality.
            2.   Vehicles and vehicle parts forfeited under R.C. §§ 4549.61 to
4549.63 may be given to a law enforcement agency for use in performing its
duties. Those parts may be incorporated into any other official vehicle. Parts
that do not bear vehicle identification numbers or derivatives of them may be
sold or disposed of as provided by rules of the Director of Public Safety.
Parts from which a vehicle identification number or derivative of it has been
removed, defaced, covered, altered, or destroyed and that are not suitable for
police work or incorporation into an official vehicle shall be destroyed and
sold as junk or scrap.
         (g)   Computers, computer networks, computer systems, and computer
software suitable for police work may be given to a law enforcement agency for
that purpose or disposed of under division (C)(2) of this section.
         (h)   Money seized in connection with a violation of R.C. § 2905.32,
2907.21, or 2907.22 shall be deposited in the Victims of Human Trafficking Fund
created by R.C. § 5101.87.
      (2)   Unclaimed or forfeited property that is not described in division
(C)(1) of this section or division (B)(1)(b) of this section, with court
approval, may be used by the law enforcement agency in possession of it. If it
is not used by the agency, it may be sold without appraisal at a public auction
to the highest bidder for cash or disposed of in another manner that the court
considers proper.
      (3)   Except as provided in divisions (C)(1) and (C)(5) of this section
and after compliance with division (C)(4) of this section when applicable, any
moneys acquired from the sale of property disposed of pursuant to this section
shall be placed in the general revenue fund of the state, or the general fund
of the municipality.
      (4)   If the property was in the possession of the Police Department in
relation to a delinquent child proceeding in a juvenile court, 10% of any
moneys acquired from the sale of property disposed of under this section shall
be applied to one or more community addiction services providers, as defined in
R.C. § 5119.01. A juvenile court shall not specify a services provider, except
as provided in this division, unless the services provider is in the same
county as the court or in a contiguous county. If no services provider is
located in any of those counties, the juvenile court may specify a services
provider anywhere in Ohio. The remaining 90% of the proceeds or cash shall be
applied as provided in division (C)(3) of this section.
      (5)   (a)   If the Board of County Commissioners recognizes a citizens’
reward program under R.C. § 9.92, the Board shall notify the Police Department
of the recognition by filing a copy of its resolution conferring that
recognition with the Police Department. When the Board recognizes a citizens’
reward program and the county includes a part, but not all, of the territory of
the municipality, the Board shall so notify the Police Department of the
recognition of the citizens' reward program only if the county contains the
highest percentage of the municipality’s population.
         (b)   Upon being so notified, the Police Department shall pay 25% of
any forfeited proceeds or cash derived from each sale of property disposed of
pursuant to this section to the citizens’ reward program for use exclusively to
pay rewards. No part of the funds may be used to pay expenses associated with
the program. If a citizens’ reward program that operates in more than one
county or in another state in addition to this state receives funds under this
section, the funds shall be used to pay rewards only for tips and information
to law enforcement agencies concerning offenses committed in the county from
which the funds were received.
      (6)   Any property forfeited under R.C. Chapter 2981 not be used to pay
any fine imposed upon a person who is convicted of or pleads guilty to an
underlying criminal offense or a different offense arising out of the same
facts and circumstances.
      (7)   Any moneys acquired from the sale of personal effects, tools, or
other property seized because the personal effects, tools, or other property
were used in the commission of a violation of R.C. § 2905.32, 2907.21, or
2907.22 or derived from the proceeds of the commission of a violation of R.C. §
2905.32, 2907.21, or 2907.22 and disposed of pursuant to this division (B)
shall be placed in the Victims of Human Trafficking Fund created by R.C. §
5101.87.
(R.C. § 2981.12)  (Rev. eff. with 2016 S-17)
   (D)   Disposition of contraband, proceeds, or instrumentalities. Except as
otherwise provided in R.C. § 2981.13, property ordered forfeited as contraband,
proceeds, or an instrumentality pursuant to R.C. Chapter 2981 shall be disposed
of, used, or sold pursuant to division (B) of this section or R.C. § 2981.12.
If the property is to be sold under division (C) of this section or R.C. §
2981.12, the prosecutor shall cause notice of the proposed sale to be given in
accordance with law.

§ 130.28  (2929.22)  IMPOSING SENTENCE FOR MISDEMEANOR.
   (A)   (1)   Unless a mandatory jail term is required to be imposed by R.C.
§§ 1547.99(G), 4510.14(B), or 4511.19(G), or any other provision of the Revised
Code, or any municipal ordinance, a court that imposes a sentence under this
chapter upon an offender for a misdemeanor or minor misdemeanor has discretion
to determine the most effective way to achieve the purposes and principles of
sentencing set forth in §
130.99(B).
      (2)   Unless a specific sanction is required to be imposed or is
precluded from being imposed by the section setting forth an offense or the
penalty for an offense or by any provision of §§
130.99 or
134.99 of this Code or R.C. §§ 2929.23 to 2929.28, a court that imposes a
sentence upon an offender for a misdemeanor may impose on the offender any
sanction or combination of sanctions under §
130.99(C) to (G). The court shall not impose a sentence that imposes an
unnecessary burden on local government resources.
   (B)   (1)   In determining the appropriate sentence for a misdemeanor, the
court shall consider all of the following factors:
         (a)   The nature and circumstances of the offense or offenses;
         (b)   Whether the circumstances regarding the offender and the offense
or offenses indicate that the offender has a history of persistent criminal
activity and that the offender’s character and condition reveal a substantial
risk that the offender will commit another offense;
         (c)   Whether the circumstances regarding the offender and the offense
or offenses indicate that the offender’s history, character, and condition
reveal a substantial risk that the offender will be a danger to others and that
the offender’s conduct has been characterized by a pattern of repetitive,
compulsive, or aggressive behavior with heedless indifference to the
consequences;
         (d)   Whether the victim’s youth, age, disability, or other factor
made the victim particularly vulnerable to the offense or made the impact of
the offense more serious;
         (e)   Whether the offender is likely to commit future crimes in
general, in addition to the circumstances described in divisions (B)(1)(b) and
(c) of this section;
         (f)   Whether the offender has an emotional, mental, or physical
condition that is traceable to the offender’s service in the armed forces of
the United States and that was a contributing factor in the offender’s
commission of the offense or offenses;
         (g)   The offender’s military service record.
      (2)   In determining the appropriate sentence for a misdemeanor, in
addition to complying with division (B)(1) of this section, the court may
consider any other factors that are relevant to achieving the purposes and
principles of sentencing set forth in §
130.99(B).
   (C)   Before imposing a jail term as a sentence for a misdemeanor, a court
shall consider the appropriateness of imposing a community control sanction or
a combination of community control sanctions under §
130.99(D), (E), (F), and (G). A court may impose the longest jail term
authorized under §
130.99(C) only upon offenders who commit the worst forms of the offense or upon
offenders whose conduct and response to prior sanctions for prior offenses
demonstrate that the imposition of the longest jail term is necessary to deter
the offender from committing a future crime.
   (D)   (1)   A sentencing court shall consider any relevant oral or written
statement made by the victim, the defendant, the defense attorney, or the
prosecuting authority regarding sentencing for a misdemeanor. This division
does not create any rights to notice other than those rights authorized by R.C.
Chapter 2930.
      (2)   At the time of sentencing for a misdemeanor or as soon as possible
after sentencing, the court shall notify the victim of the offense of the
victim’s right to file an application for an award of reparations pursuant to
R.C. §§ 2743.51 to 2743.72.
(R.C. § 2929.22)  (Rev. eff. with 2014 S-15)  (Ord. 79-1973, passed 12-19-73;

§ 130.29  (2929.41)  MULTIPLE SENTENCES.
   (A)   Except as provided in division (B) of this section, R.C. § 2929.14(C),
or R.C. § 2971.03(D) or (E), a prison term, jail term, or sentence of
imprisonment shall be served concurrently with any other prison term, jail
term, or sentence of imprisonment imposed by a court of this municipality, the
state, another state, or the United States. Except as provided in division (B)
(2) of this section, a jail term or sentence of imprisonment for misdemeanor
shall be served concurrently with a prison term or sentence of imprisonment for
felony served in a state or federal correctional institution.
   (B)   (1)   A jail term or sentence of imprisonment for a misdemeanor shall
be served consecutively to any other prison term, jail term, or sentence of
imprisonment when the trial court specifies that it is to be served
consecutively or when it is imposed for a misdemeanor violation of R.C. §§
2907.322, 2921.34 or 2923.131. When consecutive sentences are imposed for
misdemeanors under this division, the term to be served is the aggregate of the
consecutive terms imposed, except that the aggregate term to be served shall
not exceed 18 months.
      (2)   A jail term or sentence of imprisonment imposed for a misdemeanor
violation of R.C. §§ 4510.11, 4510.14, 4510.16, 4510.21, or 4511.19, or a
substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, shall be served consecutively to
a prison term that is imposed for a felony violation of R.C. §§ 2903.06,
2903.07, 2903.08 or 4511.19 or a felony violation of R.C. § 2903.04 involving
the operation of a motor vehicle by the offender and that is served in a state
correctional institution when the trial court specifies that it is to be served
consecutively. When consecutive jail terms or sentences of imprisonment and
prison terms are imposed for one or more misdemeanors and one or more felonies
under this division, the term to be served is the aggregate of the consecutive
terms imposed, and the offender shall serve all terms imposed for a felony
before serving any term imposed for a misdemeanor.

§ 130.30 (2909.31)  FAILURE TO DISCLOSE PERSONAL INFORMATION.
   (A)   No person who is in a public place shall refuse to disclose the
person’s name, address, or date of birth, when requested by a law enforcement
officer who reasonably suspects either of the following:
      (1)   The person is committing, has committed, or is about to commit a
criminal offense.

         (a)   An offense of violence that would constitute a felony under the
laws of this state;
         (b)   A felony offense that causes or results in, or creates a
substantial risk of, serious physical harm to another person or property;
         (c)   Any attempt or conspiracy to commit, or complicity in
committing, any offenses identified in division (A)(2)(a) or (A)(2)(b) of this

         (d)   Any conduct reasonably indicating that any offense identified in
division (A)(2)(a) or (A)(2)(b) of this section or any attempt, conspiracy, or
complicity described in division (A)(2)(c) of this section has been, is being,
or is about to be committed.
   (B)   Whoever violates division (A) of this section is guilty of failure to
disclose one’s personal information, a misdemeanor of the fourth degree.
   (C)   Nothing in division (A) of this section requires a person to answer
any questions beyond that person’s name, address, or date of birth. Nothing in
division (A) of this section authorizes a law enforcement officer to arrest a
person for not providing any information beyond the person’s name, address, or
date of birth or for refusing to describe the offense observed.
   (D)   It is not a violation of division (A) of this section to refuse to
answer a question that would reveal a person’s age or date of birth if age is
an element of the crime that the person is suspected of committing.
(R.C. § 2921.29)
   (E)   No person entering an airport, train station, port, or other similar
critical transportation infrastructure site shall refuse to show identification
when requested by a law enforcement officer when there is a threat to security
and the law enforcement officer is requiring identification of all persons
entering the site.
   (F)   A law enforcement officer may prevent any person who refuses to show
identification when asked under the circumstances described in division (E) of
this section from entering the critical transportation infrastructure site.

individuals can request emergency service using the telephone number 9-1-1.
(R.C. § 128.01(A))  (Rev. eff. with 2014 S-15)
   (B)   No person shall knowingly use the telephone number of a 9-1-1 system
established under R.C. Chapter 128 to report an emergency if the person knows
that no emergency exists.

obtaining emergency service.
   (D)   No person shall disclose or use any information concerning telephone
numbers, addresses, or names obtained from the database that serves the public
safety answering point of a 9-1-1 system established under R.C. Chapter 128,
except for any of the following purposes or under any of the following
circumstances:
      (1)   For the purpose of the 9-1-1 system;
      (2)   For the purpose of responding to an emergency call to an emergency
service provider;
      (3)   In the circumstance of the inadvertent disclosure of such
information due solely to technology of the wireless telephone network portion
of the 9-1-1 system not allowing access to the database to be restricted to 9-
1-1 specific answering lines at a public safety answering point;
      (4)   In the circumstance of access to a database being given by a
telephone company that is a wireless service provider to a public utility or
municipal utility in handling customer calls in times of public emergency or
service outages. The charge, terms, and conditions for the disclosure or use of
such information for the purpose of such access to a database shall be subject
to the jurisdiction of the Steering Committee;
      (5)   In the circumstance of access to a database given by a telephone
company that is a wireline service provider to a state and local government in
warning of a public emergency, as determined by the Steering Committee. The
charge, terms and conditions for the disclosure or use of that information for
the purpose of access to a database is subject to the jurisdiction of the
Steering Committee.

§ 130.32  (2901.09)  SELF DEFENSE: LIMITATIONS ON DUTY TO RETREAT PRIOR TO

   (A)   As used in this section, RESIDENCE and VEHICLE have the same meanings
as in R.C. § 2901.05.
   (B)   For purposes of any section of this Code that sets forth a criminal
offense, a person who lawfully is in that person’s residence has no duty to
retreat before using force in self defense, defense of another, or defense of
that person’s residence, and a person who lawfully is an occupant of that
person’s vehicle or who lawfully is an occupant in a vehicle owned by an
immediate family member of the person has no duty to retreat before using force
in self defense or defense of another.

2929.31)  PENALTY.
   (A)   Except where otherwise specifically classified within the body of the
section of a chapter of this title, a violation of such section shall be deemed
a misdemeanor punishable upon conviction by a fine of not more than $500,
imprisonment of not more than six months, or both.
(R.C. § 715.67)
   (B)   Considerations in misdemeanor sentencing.
      (1)   A court that sentences an offender for a misdemeanor or minor
misdemeanor violation of any provision of the Ohio Revised Code, or of any
municipal ordinance that is substantially equivalent to a misdemeanor or minor
misdemeanor violation of a provision of the Ohio Revised Code, shall be guided
by the overriding purposes of misdemeanor sentencing. The overriding purposes
of misdemeanor sentencing are to protect the public from future crime by the
offender and others and to punish the offender. To achieve those purposes, the
sentencing court shall consider the impact of the offense upon the victim and
the need for changing the offender’s behavior, rehabilitating the defender, and
making restitution to the victim of the offense, the public, or the victim and
the public.
      (2)   A sentence imposed for a misdemeanor or minor misdemeanor violation
of an Ohio Revised Code provision or for a violation of a municipal ordinance
that is subject to division (B)(1) of this section shall be reasonably
calculated to achieve the two overriding purposes of misdemeanor sentencing set
forth in division (B)(1) of this section, commensurate with and not demeaning
to the seriousness of the offender’s conduct and its impact upon the victim,
and consistent with sentences imposed for similar offenses committed by similar
offenders.
      (3)   A court that imposes a sentence upon an offender for a misdemeanor
or minor misdemeanor violation of an Ohio Revised Code provision or for a
violation of a municipal ordinance that is subject to division (B)(1) of this
section shall not base the sentence upon the race, ethnic background, gender,
or religion of the offender.
      (4)   Divisions (B)(1) and (B)(2) of this section shall not apply to any
offense that is disposed of by a traffic violations bureau of any court
pursuant to Traffic Rule 13 and shall not apply to any violation of any
provision of the Ohio Revised Code that is a minor misdemeanor and that is
disposed of without a court appearance. Divisions (B)(1) to (B)(3) of this
section do not affect any penalties established by the municipality for a
violation of its ordinances that are not substantially equivalent to a
misdemeanor or minor misdemeanor violation of a provision of the Ohio Revised
Code.
(R.C. § 2929.21)
   (C)   Misdemeanor jail terms.
      (1)    Except as provided in §§
130.28 or
134.99 of this Code or R.C. §§ 2929.22 or 2929.23 or division (C)(5) or (C)(6)
of this section and unless another term is required or authorized pursuant to
law, if the sentencing court imposing a sentence upon an offender for a
misdemeanor elects or is required to impose a jail term on the offender
pursuant to this chapter, the court shall impose a definite jail term that
shall be one of the following:
         (a)   For a misdemeanor of the first degree, not more than 180 days;
         (b)   For a misdemeanor of the second degree, not more than 90 days;
         (c)   For a misdemeanor of the third degree, not more than 60 days;
         (d)   For a misdemeanor of the fourth degree, not more than 30 days.
      (2)   (a)   A court that sentences an offender to a jail term under
division (C) of this section may permit the offender to serve the sentence in
intermittent confinement or may authorize a limited release of the offender as
provided in division (E)(2) of this section.  The court retains jurisdiction
over every offender sentenced to jail to modify the jail sentence imposed at
any time, but the court shall not reduce any mandatory jail term.
         (b)   1.   If a prosecutor, as defined in R.C. § 2935.01, has filed a
notice with the court that the prosecutor wants to be notified about a
particular case and if the court is considering modifying the jail sentence of
the offender in that case, the court shall notify the prosecutor that the court
is considering modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case. The
prosecutor may request a hearing regarding the court’s consideration of
modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case, and, if the
prosecutor requests a hearing, the court shall notify the eligible offender of
the hearing.
            2.   If the prosecutor requests a hearing regarding the court’s
consideration of modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case, the
court shall hold the hearing before considering whether or not to release the
offender from the offender’s jail sentence.
      (3)   If a court sentences an offender to a jail term under division (C)
of this section and the court assigns the offender to a county jail that has
established a county jail industry program pursuant to R.C. § 5147.30, the
court shall specify, as part of the sentence, whether the offender may be
considered for participation in the program. During the offender’s term in the
county jail, the court retains jurisdiction to modify its specification
regarding the offender’s participation in the county jail industry program.
      (4)   If a person sentenced to a jail term pursuant to division (C) of
this section, the court may impose as part of the sentence pursuant to R.C. §
2929.28 a reimbursement sanction, and, if the local detention facility in which
the term is to be served is covered by a policy adopted pursuant to R.C. §§
307.93, 341.14, 341.19, 341.21, 341.23, 753.02, 753.04, 753.16, 2301.56, or
2947.19 and R.C. § 2929.37, both of the following apply:
         (a)   The court shall specify both of the following as part of the
sentence:
            1.   If the person is presented with an itemized bill pursuant to
R.C. § 2929.37 for payment of the costs of confinement, the person is required
to pay the bill in accordance with that section.
            2.   If the person does not dispute the bill described in division
(C)(4)(a)1. of this section and does not pay the bill by the times specified in
R.C. § 2929.37, the clerk of the court may issue a certificate of judgment
against the person as described in that section.
         (b)   The sentence automatically includes any certificate of judgment
issued as described in division (C)(4)(a)2. of this section.
      (5)   If an offender who is convicted of or pleads guilty to a violation
of R.C. § 4511.19(B), or any substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, also
is convicted of or also pleads guilty to a specification of the type described
in R.C. § 2941.1414 and if the court imposes a jail term on the offender for
the underlying offense, the court shall impose upon the offender an additional
definite jail term of not more than six months. The additional jail term shall
not be reduced pursuant to any provision of the Revised Code. The offender
shall serve the additional jail term consecutively to and prior to the jail
term imposed for the underlying offense and consecutively to any other
mandatory term imposed in relation to the offense.
      (6)   (a)   If an offender is convicted of or pleads guilty to a
misdemeanor violation of R.C. § 2907.23, 2907.24, 2907.241, or 2907.25, or any
substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, and to a specification of the
type described in R.C. § 2941.1421 and if the court imposes a jail term on the
offender for the misdemeanor violation, the court may impose upon the offender
an additional definite jail term as follows:
            1.   Subject to division (C)(6)(a)2. of this section, an additional
definite jail term of not more than 60 days;
            2.   If the offender previously has been convicted of or pleaded
guilty to one or more misdemeanor or felony violations of R.C. § 2907.22,
2907.23, 2907.24, 2907.241, or 2907.25, or any substantially equivalent
municipal ordinance, and also was convicted of or pleaded guilty to a
specification of the type described in R.C. § 2941.1421 regarding one or more
of those violations, an additional definite jail term of not more than 120
days.
         (b)   In lieu of imposing an additional definite jail term under
division (C)(6)(a) of this section, the court may directly impose on the
offender a sanction that requires the offender to wear a real-time processing,
continual tracking electronic monitoring device during the period of time
specified by the court. The period of time specified by the court shall equal
the duration of an additional jail term that the court could have imposed upon
the offender under division (C)(6)(a) of this section. A sanction imposed under
this division shall commence on the date specified by the court, provided that
the sanction shall not commence until after the offender has served the jail
term imposed for the misdemeanor violation of R.C. § 2907.23, 2907.24,
2907.241, or 2907.25, or any substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, and
any residential sanction imposed for the violation under division (E) of this
section or R.C. § 2929.26. A sanction imposed under this division shall be
considered to be a community control sanction for purposes of division (D) or
this section or R.C. § 2929.25, and all provisions of this Code and the Ohio
Revised Code that pertain to community control sanctions shall apply to a
sanction imposed under this division, except to the extent that they would by
their nature be clearly inapplicable. The offender shall pay all costs
associated with a sanction imposed under this division, including the cost of
the use of the monitoring device.
      (7)   If an offender is convicted of or pleads guilty to a misdemeanor
violation of R.C. § 2903.13 and also is convicted of or pleads guilty to a
specification of the type described in R.C. § 2941.1423 that charges that the
victim of the violation was a woman whom the offender knew was pregnant at the
time of the violation, the court shall impose on the offender a mandatory jail
term that is a definite term of at least 30 days.
      (8)   If a court sentences an offender to a jail term under this division
(C), the sentencing court retains jurisdiction over the offender and the jail
term. Upon motion of either party or upon the court’s own motion, the court, in
the court’s sole discretion and as the circumstances warrant, may substitute
one or more community control sanctions under division (E) or (F) of this
section for any jail days that are not mandatory jail days.
(R.C. § 2929.24)  (Rev. eff. with 2012 S-13)
   (D)   Misdemeanor community control sanctions.
      (1)   (a)   Except as provided in §§
130.28 and
134.99 of this Code or R.C. §§ 2929.22 and 2929.23 or when a jail term is
required by law, in sentencing an offender for a misdemeanor, other than a
minor misdemeanor, the sentencing court may do either of the following:
            1.   Directly impose a sentence that consists of one or more
community control sanctions authorized by divisions (E), (F), or (G) of this
section. The court may impose any other conditions of release under a community
control sanction that the court considers appropriate. If the court imposes a
jail term upon the offender, the court may impose any community control
sanction or combination of community control sanctions in addition to the jail
term.
            2.   Impose a jail term under division (C) of this section from the
range of jail terms authorized under that division for the offense, suspend all
or a portion of the jail term imposed, and place the offender under a community
control sanction or combination of community control sanctions authorized under
divisions (E), (F), or (G) of this section.
         (b)   The duration of all community control sanctions imposed upon an
offender and in effect for an offender at any time shall not exceed five years.
         (c)   At sentencing, if a court directly imposes a community control
sanction or combination of community control sanctions pursuant to division (D)
(1)(a)1. of this section, the court shall state the duration of the community
control sanctions imposed and shall notify the offender that if any of the
conditions of the community control sanctions are violated the court may do any
of the following:
            1.   Impose a longer time under the same community control sanction
if the total time under all of the offender’s community control sanctions does
not exceed the five-year limit specified in division (D)(1)(b) of this section;
            2.   Impose a more restrictive community control sanction under
division (E), (F), or (G) of this section, but the court is not required to
impose any particular sanction or sanctions;
            3.   Impose a definite jail term from the range of jail terms
authorized for the offense under division (C) of this section.
      (2)   If a court sentences an offender to any community control sanction
or combination of community control sanctions pursuant to division (D)(1)(a)1.
of this section, the sentencing court retains jurisdiction over the offender
and the period of community control for the duration of the period of community
control. Upon the motion of either party or on the court’s own motion, the
court, in the court’s sole discretion and as the circumstances warrant, may
modify the community control sanctions or conditions of release previously
imposed, substitute a community control sanction or condition of release for
another community control sanction or condition of release previously imposed,
or impose an additional community control sanction or condition of release.
      (3)   (a)   If a court sentences an offender to any community control
sanction or combination of community control sanctions authorized under
division (E), (F), or (G) of this section, the court shall place the offender
under the general control and supervision of the court or of a department of
probation in the jurisdiction that serves the court for purposes of reporting
to the court a violation of any of the conditions of the sanctions imposed. If
the offender resides in another jurisdiction and a department of probation has
been established to serve the municipal court or county court in that
jurisdiction, the sentencing court may request the municipal court or the
county court to receive the offender into the general control and supervision
of that department of probation for purposes of reporting to the sentencing
court a violation of any of the conditions of the sanctions imposed. The
sentencing court retains jurisdiction over any offender whom it sentences for
the duration of the sanction or sanctions imposed.
         (b)   The sentencing court shall require as a condition of any
community control sanction that the offender abide by the law and not leave the
state without the permission of the court or the offender’s probation officer.
In the interests of doing justice, rehabilitating the offender, and ensuring
the offender’s good behavior, the court may impose additional requirements on
the offender.  The offender’s compliance with the additional requirements also
shall be a condition of the community control sanction imposed upon the
offender.
      (4)   (a)   If the court imposing sentence upon an offender sentences the
offender to any community control sanction or combination of community control
sanctions authorized under division (E), (F), or (G) of this section, and the
offender violates any of the conditions of the sanctions, the public or private
person or entity that supervises or administers the program or activity that
comprises the sanction shall report the violation directly to the sentencing
court or to the department of probation or probation officer with general
control and supervision over the offender. If the public or private person or
entity reports the violation to the department of probation or probation
officer, the department or officer shall report the violation to the sentencing
court.
         (b)   If an offender violates any condition of a community control
sanction, the sentencing court may impose upon the violator one or more of the
following penalties:
            1.   A longer time under the same community control sanction if the
total time under all of the community control sanctions imposed on the violator
does not exceed the five-year limit specified in division (D)(1)(b) of this
section;
            2.   A more restrictive community control sanction;
            3.   A combination of community control sanctions, including a jail
term.
         (c)   If an offender was acting pursuant to R.C. § 2925.11(B)(2)(b),
or any substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, and in so doing violated
the conditions of a community control sanction based on a minor drug possession
offense, as defined in R.C. § 2925.11, the sentencing court may consider the
offender’s conduct in seeking or obtaining medical assistance for another in
good faith or for self or may consider the offender being the subject of
another person seeking or obtaining medical assistance in accordance with that
division as a mitigating factor before imposing any of the penalties described
in division (D)(4)(b) of this section.
         (d)   If the court imposes a jail term upon a violator pursuant to
division (D)(4)(b) of this section, the total time spent in jail for the
misdemeanor offense and the violation of a condition of the community control
sanction shall not exceed the maximum jail term available for the offense for
which the sanction that was violated was imposed. The court may reduce the
longer period of time that the violator is required to spend under the longer
sanction or the more restrictive sanction imposed under division (D)(4)(b) of
this section  by all or part of the time the violator successfully spent under
the sanction that was initially imposed.
      (5)   Except as otherwise provided in this division, if an offender, for
a significant period of time, fulfills the conditions of a community control
sanction imposed pursuant to division (E), (F), or (G) of this section in an
exemplary manner, the court may reduce the period of time under the community
control sanction or impose a less restrictive community control sanction.
Fulfilling the conditions of a community control sanction does not relieve the
offender of a duty to make restitution under division (G) of this section.
(R.C. § 2929.25)  (Rev. eff. with 2017 S-18)
   (E)   Community residential sanction.
      (1)   Except when a mandatory jail term is required by law, the court
imposing a sentence for a misdemeanor, other than a minor misdemeanor, may
impose upon the offender any community residential sanction or combination of
community residential sanctions under this division (E).  Community residential
sanctions include, but are not limited to, the following:
         (a)   A term of up to 180 days in a halfway house or a term in a
halfway house not to exceed the longest jail term available for the offense,
whichever is shorter, if the political subdivision that would have
responsibility for paying the costs of confining the offender in a jail has
entered into a contract with the halfway house for use of the facility for
misdemeanor offenders;
         (b)   If the offender is an eligible offender, as defined in R.C. §
307.932, a term in a community alternative sentencing center or district
community alternative sentencing center established and operated in accordance
with that section, in the circumstances specified in that section, with one of
the conditions of the sanction being that the offender successfully complete
the portion of the sentence to be served in the center.
      (2)   A sentence to a community residential sanction under division (E)
(1)(b) of this section shall be in accordance with R.C. § 307.932. In all other
cases, the court that sentences an offender to a community residential sanction
under this division (E) may do either or both of the following:
         (a)   Permit the offender to serve the offender’s sentence in
intermittent confinement, overnight, on weekends or at any other time or times
that will allow the offender to continue at the offender’s occupation or care
for the offender’s family;
         (b)   Authorize the offender to be released so that the offender may
seek or maintain employment, receive education or training, receive treatment,
perform community service, or otherwise fulfill an obligation imposed by law or
by the court. A release pursuant to this division shall be only for the
duration of time that is needed to fulfill the purpose of the release and for
travel that reasonably is necessary to fulfill the purposes of release.
      (3)   The court may order that a reasonable portion of the income earned
by the offender upon a release pursuant to division (E)(2) of this section be
applied to any financial sanction imposed under division (G) of this section.
      (4)   No court shall sentence any person to a prison term for a
misdemeanor or minor misdemeanor or to a jail term for a minor misdemeanor.
      (5)   If a court sentences a person who has been convicted of or pleaded
guilty to a misdemeanor to a community residential sanction as described in
division (E)(1) of this section, at the time of reception and at other times
the person in charge of the operation of the halfway house, community
alternative sentencing center, district community alternative sentencing
center, or other place at which the offender will serve the residential
sanction determines to be appropriate, the person in charge of the operation of
the halfway house, community alternative sentencing center, district community
alternative sentencing center, or other place may cause the convicted offender
to be examined and tested for tuberculosis, HIV infection, hepatitis,
including, but not limited to, hepatitis A, B, and C, and other contagious
diseases. The person in charge of the operation of the halfway house, community
alternative sentencing center, district community alternative sentencing
center, or other place at which the offender will serve the residential
sanction may cause a convicted offender in the halfway house, community
alternative sentencing center, district community alternative sentencing
center, or other place who refuses to be tested or treated for tuberculosis,
HIV infection, hepatitis, including, but not limited to, hepatitis A, B, and C,
or another contagious disease to be tested and treated involuntarily.
      (6)   The municipality may enter into a contract with a halfway house for
use of the halfway house to house misdemeanor offenders under a sanction
imposed under division (E)(1)(a) of this section.
(R.C. § 2929.26)  (Rev. eff. with 2016 S-17)
   (F)   Nonresidential sanction where jail term is not mandatory.
      (1)   Except when a mandatory jail term is required by law, the court
imposing a sentence for a misdemeanor, other than a minor misdemeanor, may
impose upon the offender any nonresidential sanction or combination of
nonresidential sanctions authorized under this division.  Nonresidential
sanctions include, but are not limited to, the following:
         (a)   A term of day reporting;
         (b)   A term of house arrest with electronic monitoring or continuous
alcohol monitoring or both electronic monitoring and continuous alcohol
monitoring, a term of electronic monitoring or continuous alcohol monitoring
without house arrest, or a term of house arrest without electronic monitoring
or continuous alcohol monitoring;
         (c)   A term of community service of up to  500 hours for misdemeanor
of the first degree or 200 hours for a misdemeanor of the second, third, or
fourth degree;
         (d)   A term in a drug treatment program with a level of security for
the offender as determined necessary by the court;
         (e)   A term of intensive probation supervision;
         (f)   A term of basic probation supervision;
         (g)   A term of monitored time;
         (h)   A term of drug and alcohol use monitoring, including random drug
testing;
         (i)   A curfew term;
         (j)   A requirement that the offender obtain employment;
         (k)   A requirement that the offender obtain education or training;
         (l)   Provided the court obtains the prior approval of the victim, a
requirement that the offender participate in victim-offender mediation;
         (m)   If authorized by law, suspension of the offender’s privilege to
operate a motor vehicle, immobilization or forfeiture of the offender’s motor
vehicle, a requirement that the offender obtain a valid motor vehicle
operator’s license, or any other related sanction;
         (n)    A requirement that the offender obtain counseling if the
offense is a violation of R.C. § 2919.25 or a substantially equivalent
municipal ordinance or a violation of R.C. § 2903.13 or a substantially
equivalent municipal ordinance involving a person who was a family or household
member at the time of the violation, if the offender committed the offense in
the vicinity of one or more children who are not victims of the offense, and if
the offender or the victim of the offense is a parent, guardian, custodian, or
person in loco parentis of one or more of those children. This division does
not limit the court in requiring that the offender obtain counseling for any
offense or in any circumstance not specified in this division.
      (2)   If the court imposes a term of community service pursuant to
division (F)(1)(c) of this section, the offender may request that the court
modify the sentence to authorize the offender to make a reasonable
contribution, as determined by the court, to the general fund of the county,
municipality, or other local entity that provides funding to the court. The
court may grant the request if the offender demonstrates a change in
circumstances from the date the court imposes the sentence or that the
modification would otherwise be in the interests of justice. If the court
grants the request, the offender shall make a reasonable contribution to the
court, and the clerk of the court shall deposit that contribution into the
general fund of the county, municipality, or other local entity that provides
funding to the court. If more than one entity provides funding to the court,
the clerk shall deposit a percentage of the reasonable contribution equal to
the percentage of funding the entity provides to the court in that entity’s
general fund.
      (3)   In addition to the sanctions authorized under division (F)(1) of
this section, the court imposing a sentence for a misdemeanor, other than a
minor misdemeanor, upon an offender who is not required to serve a mandatory
jail term may impose any other sanction that is intended to discourage the
offender or other persons from committing a similar offense if the sanction is
reasonably related to the overriding purposes and principles of misdemeanor
sentencing.
      (4)   The court imposing a sentence for a minor misdemeanor may impose a
term of community service in lieu of all or part of a fine. The term of
community service imposed for a minor misdemeanor shall not exceed 30 hours.
After imposing a term of community service, the court may modify the sentence
to authorize a reasonable contribution, as determined by the court, to the
appropriate general fund as provided in division (F)(2) of this section.
(R.C. § 2929.27)  (Rev. eff. with 2019 S-21)
   (G)   Financial sanctions.
      (1)   In addition to imposing court costs pursuant to R.C. § 2947.23, the
court imposing a sentence upon an offender for a misdemeanor, including a minor
misdemeanor, may sentence the offender to any financial sanction or combination
of financial sanctions authorized under this division (G). If the court in its
discretion imposes one or more financial sanctions, the financial sanctions
that may be imposed pursuant to this section include, but are not limited to,
the following:
         (a)   Restitution.
            1.   Unless the misdemeanor offense is a minor misdemeanor or could
be disposed of by the Traffic Violations Bureau serving the court under Traffic
Rule 13, restitution by the offender to the victim of the offender’s crime or
any survivor of the victim, in an amount based upon the victim’s economic loss.
The court may not impose restitution as a sanction pursuant to this division if
the offense is a minor misdemeanor or could be disposed of by the Traffic
Violations Bureau serving the court under Traffic Rule 13. If the court
requires restitution, the court shall order that the restitution be made to the
victim in open court or to the adult probation department that serves the
jurisdiction or the clerk of the court on behalf of the victim.
            2.   If the court imposes restitution, the court shall determine
the amount of restitution to be paid by the offender. If the court imposes
restitution, the court may base the amount of restitution it orders on an
amount recommended by the victim, the offender, a presentence investigation
report, estimates or receipts indicating the cost of repairing or replacing
property, and other information, provided that the amount the court orders as
restitution shall not exceed the amount of economic loss suffered by the victim
as a direct and proximate result of the commission of the offense. If the court
decides to impose restitution, the court shall hold an evidentiary hearing on
restitution if the offender, victim, or survivor disputes the amount of
restitution. If the court holds an evidentiary hearing, at the hearing the
victim or survivor has the burden to prove by a preponderance of the evidence
the amount of restitution sought from the offender.
            3.    All restitution payments shall be credited against any
recovery of economic loss in a civil action brought by the victim or any
survivor of the victim against the offender. No person may introduce evidence
of an award of restitution under this section in a civil action for purposes of
imposing liability against an insurer under R.C. § 3937.18.
            4.   If the court imposes restitution, the court may order that the
offender pay a surcharge, of not more than 5% of the amount of the restitution
otherwise ordered, to the entity responsible for collecting and processing
restitution payments.
            5.   The victim or survivor of the victim may request that the
prosecutor in the case file a motion, or the offender may file a motion, for
modification of the payment terms of any restitution ordered. If the court
grants the motion, it may modify the payment terms as it determines
appropriate.
         (b)   Fines. A fine of the type described in divisions (G)(1)(b)1. and
2. of this section payable to the appropriate entity as required by law:
            1.   A fine in the following amount:
               A.   For a misdemeanor of the first degree, not more than
$1,000;
               B.   For a misdemeanor of the second degree, not more than $750;
               C.   For a misdemeanor of the third degree, not more than $500;
               D.   For a misdemeanor of the fourth degree, not more than $250;
               E.   For a minor misdemeanor, not more than $150.
            2.   A state fine or cost as defined in R.C. § 2949.111.
         (c)   Reimbursement.
            1.   Reimbursement by the offender of any or all of the costs of
sanctions incurred by the government, including, but not limited to, the
following:
               A.   All or part of the costs of implementing any community
control sanction, including a supervision fee under R.C. § 2951.021;
               B.   All or part of the costs of confinement in a jail or other
residential facility, including, but not limited to, a per diem fee for room
and board, the costs of medical and dental treatment, and the costs of
repairing property damaged by the offender while confined;
               c.   All or part of the cost of purchasing and using an
immobilizing or disabling device, including a certified ignition interlock
device, or a remote alcohol monitoring device that a court orders an offender
to use under R.C. §4510.13.
            2.   The amount of reimbursement under division (G)(1)(c)1. of this
section shall not exceed the total amount of reimbursement the offender is able
to pay and shall not exceed the actual cost of the sanctions. The court may
collect any amount of reimbursement the offender is required to pay under that
division. If the court does not order reimbursement under that division,
confinement costs may be assessed pursuant to a repayment policy adopted under
R.C. § 2929.37. In addition, the offender may be required to pay the fees
specified in R.C. § 2929.38 in accordance with that section.
      (2)   (a)   If the court determines a hearing is necessary, the court may
hold a hearing to determine whether the offender is able to pay the financial
sanction imposed pursuant to this division (G) or court costs or is likely in
the future to be able to pay the sanction or costs.
         (b)   If the court determines that the offender is indigent and unable
to pay the financial sanction or court costs, the court shall consider imposing
and may impose a term of community service under division (F)(1) of this
section in lieu of imposing a financial sanction or court costs. If the court
does not determine that the offender is indigent, the court may impose a term
of community service under division (F)(1) of this section in lieu of or in
addition to imposing a financial sanction under this division (G) and in
addition to imposing court costs. The court may order community service for a
minor misdemeanor pursuant to division (F)(3) of this section in lieu of or in
addition to imposing a financial sanction under this section and in addition to
imposing court costs. If a person fails to pay a financial sanction or court
costs, the court may order community service in lieu of the financial sanction
or court costs.
      (3)   (a)   The offender shall pay reimbursements imposed upon the
offender pursuant to division (G)(1)(c) of this section to pay the costs
incurred by a county pursuant to any sanction imposed under division (E), (F),
or (G) of this section or in operating a facility used to confine offenders
pursuant to a sanction imposed under division (E) of this section to the county
treasurer. The county treasurer shall deposit the reimbursements in the
county’s general fund. The county shall use the amounts deposited in the fund
to pay the costs incurred by the county pursuant to any sanction imposed under
division (E), (F), or (G) of this section or in operating a facility used to
confine offenders pursuant to a sanction imposed under division (E) of this
section.
         (b)   The offender shall pay reimbursements imposed upon the offender
pursuant to division (G)(1)(c) of this section to pay the costs incurred by a
municipal corporation pursuant to any sanction imposed under division  (E),
(F), or (G) of this section or in operating a facility used to confine
offenders pursuant to a sanction imposed under division (E) of this section to
the treasurer of the municipal corporation. The treasurer shall deposit the
reimbursements in the municipal corporation’s general fund. The municipal
corporation shall use the amounts deposited in the fund to pay the costs
incurred by the municipal corporation pursuant to any sanction imposed under
division (E), (F), or (G) of this section or in operating a facility used to
confine offenders pursuant to a sanction imposed under division (E) of this
section.
         (c)   The offender shall pay reimbursements imposed pursuant to
division (G)(1)(c) of this section for the costs incurred by a private provider
pursuant to a sanction imposed under division (E), (F), or (G) of this section
to the provider.
      (4)   In addition to any other fine that is or may be imposed under this
division (G), the court imposing sentence upon an offender for misdemeanor
domestic violence or menacing by stalking may impose a fine of not less than
$70 nor more than $500, which shall be transmitted to the Treasurer of Ohio to
be credited to the address confidentiality program fund created by R.C. §
111.48.
      (5)   (a)   Except as otherwise provided in this division (G)(5), a
financial sanction imposed under division (G)(1) of this section is a judgment
in favor of the state or the political subdivision that operates the court that
imposed the financial sanction, and the offender subject to the financial
sanction is the judgment debtor. A financial sanction of reimbursement imposed
pursuant to division (G)(1)(c)1.a. of this section upon an offender is a
judgment in favor of the entity administering the community control sanction,
and the offender subject to the financial sanction is the judgment debtor. A
financial sanction of reimbursement imposed pursuant to division (G)(1)(c)1.b.
of this section upon an offender confined in a jail or other residential
facility is a judgment in favor of the entity operating the jail or other
residential facility, and the offender subject to the financial sanction is the
judgment debtor. A financial sanction of restitution imposed pursuant to
division (G)(1)(a) of this section is an order in favor of the victim of the
offender’s criminal act that can be collected through a certificate of judgment
as described in division (G)(5)(b)1. of this section, through execution as
described in division (G)(5)(b)2. of this section or through an order as
described in division (G)(5)(b)3. of this section and the offender shall be
considered for purposes of the collection as a judgment debtor.
         (b)   Once a financial sanction is imposed as a judgment or order
under this division, the victim, private provider, state, or political
subdivision may do any of the following:
            1.   Obtain from the clerk of the court in which the judgment was
entered a certificate of judgment that shall be in the same manner and form as
a certificate of judgment issued in a civil action;
            2.   Obtain execution of the judgment or order through any
available procedure, including any of the procedures identified in R.C. §
2929.18(D)(1) and (D)(2) or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance.
            3.   Obtain an order for the assignment of wages of the judgment
debtor under R.C. § 1321.33 or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance.
      (6)   The civil remedies authorized under division (G)(5) of this section
for the collection of the financial sanction supplement, but do not preclude,
enforcement of the criminal sentence.
      (7)   Each court imposing a financial sanction upon an offender under
this division (G) may designate the clerk of the court or another person to
collect the financial sanction. The clerk, or another person authorized by law
or the court to collect the financial sanction may do the following:
         (a)   Enter into contracts with one or more public agencies or private
vendors for the collection of amounts due under the sanction. Before entering
into a contract for the collection of amounts due from an offender pursuant to
any financial sanction imposed pursuant to this division (G), a court shall
comply with R.C. §§ 307.86 to 307.92.
         (b)   Permit payment of all or any portion of the sanction in
installments, by financial transaction device if the court is a county court or
a municipal court operated by a county, or by any other reasonable method, in
any time, and on any terms that the court considers just, except that the
maximum time permitted for payment shall not exceed five years. If the court is
a county court or a municipal court operated by a county, the acceptance of
payments by any financial transaction device shall be governed by the policy
adopted by the board of county commissioners of the county pursuant to R.C. §
301.28. If the court is a municipal court not operated by a county, the clerk
may pay any fee associated with processing an electronic transfer out of public
money or may charge the fee to the offender.
         (c)   To defray administrative costs, charge a reasonable fee to an
offender who elects a payment plan rather than a lump sum payment of any
financial sanction.
      (8)   No financial sanction imposed under this division (G) shall
preclude a victim from bringing a civil action against the offender.
(R.C. §§ 2929.28)  (Rev. eff. with 2019 S-21)
   (H)   Organizational penalties.
      (1)   Regardless of the other penalties provided in this section, an
organization convicted of an offense pursuant to §
130.08 shall be fined by the court as follows:
         (a)   For a misdemeanor of the first degree, not more than $5,000;
         (b)   For a misdemeanor of the second degree, not more than $4,000;
         (c)   For a misdemeanor of the third degree, not more than $3,000;
         (d)   For a misdemeanor of the fourth degree, not more than $2,000;
         (e)   For a minor misdemeanor, not more than $1,000;
         (f)   For a misdemeanor not specifically classified, not more than
$2,000;
         (g)   For a minor misdemeanor not specifically classified, not more
than $1,000.
      (2)   When an organization is convicted of an offense not specifically
classified, and the section defining the offense or penalty plainly indicates a
purpose to impose the penalty provided for violation upon organizations, then
such penalty shall be imposed in lieu of the penalty provided in this section.
      (3)   When an organization is convicted of an offense not specifically
classified, and the penalty provided includes a higher fine than that provided
in this section, then the penalty imposed shall be pursuant to the penalty
provided for violation of the section defining the offense.
      (4)   This section does not prevent the imposition of available civil
sanctions against an organization convicted of an offense pursuant to §
130.08, either in addition to or in lieu of a fine imposed pursuant to this
section.

or a mentally or physically disabled child under 21 years of age, shall create
a substantial risk to the health or safety of the child, by violating a duty of
care, protection, or support. It is not a violation of a duty of care,

or mental illness or disability of the child by spiritual means through prayer
alone, in accordance with the tenets of a recognized religious body.

child when there is a substantial risk that such conduct, if continued, will
seriously impair or retard the child's mental health or development;

offender was subject to the sanctions described in division (D) of that
section, endangering children in violation of division (C) of this section is a

divisions (E)(3)(a), (E)(3)(b), or (E)(3)(c) of this section or pursuant to any
other provisions of law, and in addition to any suspension of the offender’s

   (F)   (1)   (a)   A court may require an offender to perform not more than
two hundred hours of supervised community service work under the authority of
an agency, subdivision, or charitable organization. The requirement shall be
part of the community control sanction or sentence of the offender, and the
court shall impose the community service in accordance with and subject to
divisions (F)(1)(a) and (b) of this section.  The court may require an offender
whom it requires to perform supervised community service work as part of the
offender's community control sanction or sentence to pay the court a reasonable
fee to cover the costs of the offender’s participation in the work, including,
but not limited to, the costs of procuring a policy or policies of liability
insurance to cover the period during which the offender will perform the work. 
If the court requires the offender to perform supervised community service work

offender does not adequately perform, as determined by the court, all of the
required community service work, the court may order that the offender be
committed to a jail or workhouse for a period of time that does not exceed the
term of imprisonment that the court could have imposed upon the offender for
the violation of division (C) of this section, reduced by the total amount of
time that the offender actually was imprisoned under the sentence or term that
was imposed upon the offender for that violation and by the total amount of
time that the offender was confined for any reason arising out of the offense
for which the offender was convicted and sentenced as described in R.C. §§
2949.08 and 2967.191, and that, if the court orders that the offender be so

may order that the offender be committed to a jail or workhouse for a period of
time that does not exceed the term of imprisonment that the court could have
imposed upon the offender for the violation of division (C) of this section,
reduced by the total amount of time that the offender actually was imprisoned
under the sentence or term that was imposed upon the offender for that
violation and by the total amount of time that the offender was confined for
any reason arising out of the offense for which the offender was convicted and
sentenced as described in R.C. §§ 2949.08 and 2967.191.  The court may order
that a person committed pursuant to this division shall receive hour-for-hour

shall exceed the period of the term of imprisonment that the sentencing court
could have imposed upon the offender for the violation of division (C) of this
section, reduced by the total amount of time that the offender actually was
imprisoned under that sentence or term and by the total amount of time that the
offender was confined for any reason arising out of the offense for which the
offender was convicted and sentenced as described in R.C. §§ 2949.08 and
2967.191.
      (2)   Division (F)(1) of this section does not limit or affect the
authority of the court to suspend the sentence imposed upon a misdemeanor
offender and place the offender under a community control sanction pursuant to
R.C. § 2929.25, to require a misdemeanor or felony offender to perform
supervised community service work in accordance with division R.C. § 2951.02

driver's license or permit or nonresident operating privilege under division

to, and commence after, the period of suspension of the offender's driver's or
commercial driver's license or permit or nonresident operating privilege that
is imposed under R.C. Chs. 4506, 4509, 4510, or 4511 or under any other
provision of law in relation to the violation of division (C) of this section
that is the basis of the suspension under division (E)(4)(d) of this section or
in relation to the violation of R.C. 4511.19(A) that is the basis for that
violation of division (C) of this section.
      (2)   An offender is not entitled to request, and the court shall not

time of the violation, there were two or more children under 18 years of age in
the motor vehicle involved in the violation, the offender may be convicted of a
violation of division (C) of this section for each of the children, but the
court may sentence the offender for only one of the violations.
      (2)   (a)   If a person is convicted of or pleads guilty to a violation
of division (C) of this section but the person is not also convicted of and
does not also plead guilty to a separate charge of violating R.C. § 4511.19(A),
or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance that was the basis of the
charge of the violation of division (C) of this section, both of the following
apply:

substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, that set forth the penalties and
sanctions for a violation of R.C. § 4511.19(A), or a substantially equivalent
municipal ordinance, the conviction of or plea of guilty to the violation of
division (C) of this section shall not constitute a violation of R.C. § 4511.19
(A), or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance;
            2.   For purposes of any provision of law that refers to a
conviction of or plea of guilty to a violation of division R.C. § 4511.19(A)
and that is not described in division (H)(2)(a)1. of this section, the
conviction of or plea of guilty to the violation of division (C) of this
section shall constitute a conviction of or plea of guilty to a violation of
R.C. § 4511.19(A), or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance.
         (b)   If  a person is  convicted of  or pleads guilty to a violation
of division (C) of this section and the person also is convicted of or pleads
guilty to a separate charge of violating R.C. § 4511.19(A), or a substantially
equivalent municipal ordinance, that was the basis of the charge of the
violation of division (C) of this section, the conviction of or plea of guilty
to the violation of division (C) of this section shall not constitute, for
purposes of any provision of law that refers to a conviction of or plea of
guilty to a violation of R.C. § 4511.19(A) or a substantially equivalent
municipal ordinance, a conviction of or plea of guilty to a violation of R.C. §

that the substance that is the basis of the alleged offense has been weighed
and analyzed and stating the findings as to the content, weight, and identity
of the substance and that it contains any amount of a controlled substance and

be preserved and given to the accused's analyst, the prosecuting attorney shall
so inform the accused person, or his attorney. In such a circumstance, the
accused person is entitled, upon written request made to the prosecuting
attorney, to have the accused’s privately employed or court appointed analyst
present at an analysis of the substance that is, or the substances that are,
the basis of the alleged violation, and, upon further written request, to
receive copies of all recorded scientific data that result from the analysis

basis of, or involved in, the offense to determine whether the substance
contained any amount of a controlled substance if the results of the tests

(Ord. 26-1978, passed 6-21-78)
§ 150.13  DESIGN STANDARDS.
   (A)   Thoroughfare plan.
      (1)   Streets shall conform substantially to the thoroughfare plan
adopted by the planning commission and any revisions or amendments thereto. 
Whenever a tract to be subdivided includes any part of a street indicated on
the thoroughfare plan, such part of the street shall be included in the
development.  This required dedication shall also apply to the widening of
existing bordering streets. The required dedication shall not exceed 50 feet in
width as measured from the centerline of the bordering street.  If a
thoroughfare within a proposed subdivision has a recommended width in excess of
100 feet, the planning commission will recommend to the city council that the
additional width be acquired by the proper public agency. If, within a maximum
of 90 days thereafter, the city council has not indicated that proceedings have
been initiated to acquire the additional width, then the recommendation by the
planning commission for a width in excess of 100 feet will not be used as a
ground for disapproval of either the subdivision preliminary plan or the record
plat.  Whenever a tract to be subdivided includes any part of an expressway
proposed by the thoroughfare plan, wherein the right of access is denied the
subdivider, then the planning commission will recommend to the city council
that the right-of-way for the expressway be acquired by the proper public
agency.  If, within a maximum of 6 months thereafter, the city council has not
indicated that proceedings have been initiated to acquire the property, then
the recommendation of the planning commission for the right-of-way will not be
used as a ground for disapproval of either the subdivision preliminary plan or
the record plat.  In the case of a right-of-way in excess of 100 feet of an
expressway, if the city council advises the planning commission prior to the
maximum time limits set out above that there are no intentions of proceeding
with the desired acquisition, then the planning commission will consider a
design for the subdivision which does not deny the immediate lawful use of the
property within the proposed right-of-way, but recognizes a possible future
acquisition of the right-of-way, and provides accordingly for a minimum degree
of resultant disruption to the remaining streets and lots of the subdivision.
      (2)   Where, as indicated by the master plan, a proposed subdivision
contains, wholly or in part, lands proposed to be used for public open space or
a site for a public building, the subdivider shall show the lands on the plans,
and the proper public agency shall have a period of not less than 2 years from
the date of approval of the subdivision preliminary plan in which it may make
arrangements for acquiring the lands.  In case of a lack of agreement as to the
value of the lands, it shall be established by an appraisal to be made by 3
qualified appraisers, one of whom shall be appointed by the public agency
involved, one of whom shall be appointed by the subdivider, and one of whom
shall be mutually agreed upon by the 2 appraisers named above.  The cost of any
appraisal shall be divided equally between the subdivider and the public
agency.  In the event the public agency fails to enter into binding commitments
for the acquisition of the lands within 2 years, or within that period of time
delivers to the developer a formal statement of its intention not to acquire
the lands, then the subdivider may submit to the planning commission for its
approval an amended subdivision preliminary plan and record plat showing the
private use.
   (B)   Neighborhood plan.  If a tentative plan has been prepared by the
planning commission for the neighborhood of the proposed subdivision, the
street of the latter shall conform in general thereto.
   (C)  Physical features.  Streets shall be platted with appropriate regard
for topography, creeks, wooded areas, and other natural features which would
enhance attractive development.  Existing trees shall be carefully preserved,
and no tree with a trunk of more than 4 inches in diameter that is not within a
roadway or within an area to be occupied by a building may be removed without a
permit issued by the city building official.  Removal of trees in violation of
the above shall be cause for requiring the subdivider, at his expense, to plant
trees of such number, size, and species so as to effectively replace those so
removed in accordance with plans approved by the city building official.
   (D)  Existing streets.  Existing streets constructed or recorded in
adjoining territory shall be continued at equal or greater width and in similar
alignment in the proposed subdivision, unless variations are recommended by the
planning commission.
   (E)  Circulation.  The street pattern shall provide ease of circulation
within the subdivision as well as convenient access to adjoining streets,
thoroughfares, or unsubdivided land, as may be required by the planning
commission.  Minor residential streets should be so planned as to discourage
their use by nonlocal traffic. Where a street will eventually be extended
beyond the plat, but is temporarily dead-ended, an interim turn-around may be
required.
   (F)  Major and secondary arterials.  If a new subdivision involves frontage
on a major or secondary arterial street, the street layout should be planned to
limit as far as possible the number of intersecting streets having access to
the arterial.  On major arterials it is recommended that access to private
residential driveways be provided by means of a service roadway with motor
access at suitably spaced points.  Deed convenants shall be provided as
required to limit access, and shall appear on the plat.
   (G)   Street intersections.  Streets shall intersect as nearly at right
angles as possible.
   (H)   Cul-de-sacs.  Cul-de-sacs shall not be longer than 800 feet, unless
necessitated by topography or other circumstances beyond the subdivider's
control, and then only with the approval of the planning commission.
   (I)   Half-streets.  The street layout shall be planned to avoid half-
streets, if possible.  Where there exists a dedicated or platted half-street
adjacent to the tract to be subdivided, the other half shall be platted if
deemed necessary by the planning commission.
   (J)   Alleys.  Except where justified by special conditions, alleys will not
be approved in residential districts.  At an intersection of alleys, a 5 foot
chord shall cut off each corner. Dead-end alleys are prohibited.
   (K)   Utility easements.  Where utilities are located outside of street
right-of-way lines, easements shall be provided. Easements along rear or side
lot lines are preferable where possible.
   (L)   Drainage easements.
      (1)   Whenever any stream or surface drainage course is located in an
area that is being developed, the developer shall provide a riparian corridor
easement at a width based on the below chart. The width being beyond the normal
water elevation of the stream, limiting the usage and constructability within
said easement.
 
Contributing Drainage Area (ac) Riparian Easement Width (ft., both sides of
                                stream)
<=20                            10
21-50                           20
51-1200                         25
>1200                           50
 
A copy of actual easement restrictions of riparian buffer easement may be
obtained thru the City Engineer’s office.  The following shall appear on the
plat:
      "The City of Springdale does not accept any private drainage easement
shown on this plat and the City of Springdale is not obligated to maintain or
repair any channels or installations in the easement.  The subdivider agrees,
as a condition of approval of these plats, that there will be included in the
deed of conveyance of every lot in this subdivision subservient to a drainage
easement a condition requiring the grantee, his heirs and assigns, to
continuously maintain the easement area for the purpose designated, and a
condition that within the easement no structure, planting, or other material
shall be placed or permitted to remain which may obstruct, retard, or change
the direction of the flow of the water in the drainage channel of the easement,
with a recitation that the conditions are for the mutual benefit of the owners
of all lots in the subdivision on which similar easements are reserved."
      (2)   The above conditions shall prevail unless there are specific cases
covered by separate agreement.
   (M)   Blocks.
      (1)   Length.  Normal maximum length for blocks, 1800 feet.  In a block
over 900 feet long, a crosswalkway may be required.
      (2)   Width.  The width of a block shall normally be sufficient to allow
2 tiers of lots of appropriate depth.
      (3)   Irregular shape.  Irregular shaped blocks (including super blocks),
indented by cul-de-sacs, containing interior parks or playgrounds, and adequate
parking space will be acceptable when properly designed and covered by
agreements as to the maintenance of such park areas.
      (4)   Orientation to arterial.  If frontage on an arterial is involved,
the long dimension of the block shall be the preferable front thereon, in order
to create as few intersections as possible with the arterial.
      (5)   Business or industrial.  Blocks intended for business or industry
shall be of such length as may be considered most suitable for their
prospective use, including adequate provision for parking and deliveries.
   (N)   Lots.
      (1)   Size, shape, and orientation.  Size, shape, and orientation of lots
shall be appropriate to the location of the proposed subdivision, and for the
type of development contemplated.  All sizes shall meet the minimum
requirements of the current zoning regulations for the site.
      (2)   Length and width ratio.  Excessive depth in relation to width shall
be avoided.
      (3)   Fronting on arterials.  Lots fronting on arterials should have
extra depth and deep setbacks, if topography permits.
      (4)   Double frontage.  Double frontage lots shall be avoided as far as
possible.
      (5)    Side lot lines.  Side lines of lots shall be approximately at
right angles or radial to the street line, unless, in the opinion of the
planning commission, a variation from this rule will give a better street and
lot plan.
      (6)   Corner lots.  Corner lots shall have an extra width sufficient to
allow for a building setback on both front and side.
   (O)   Minimum right-of-way widths for roadways as designated on the
thoroughfare plan.  Rights-of- way shall be of equal distance on each side of
the center line, and shall be dedicated for public use on the record plat.
      (1)   Expressway - Limited access right-of-way of varying widths.
      (2)   Major arterial - 100 feet, may have access limited or controlled.
      (3)   Secondary arterial - 80 feet.
      (4)   Collector - 60 feet.
      (5)   All county and state roads not classified on the thoroughfare plan
- 60 feet.
      (6)   Local street - 50 feet.
      (7)   Cul-de-sacs.  All cul-de-sacs shall be designed in accordance with
the City Standard Construction Drawing for cul-de-sacs.
      (8)   Easements - 5 feet on each side of the designated centerline or of
such width as may be required for the necessary maintenance of the facility
involved.

   (C)   Storm retention/detention.  In order to minimize storm runoff damage
to downstream properties and overloading of existing drainage courses, the
criteria found
Chapter 151: Storm Water Management shall be followed on all development of
parcels one acre or larger in size, and on all redevelopment of existing
buildings or site usage as determined by Planning Commission.
   (D)   Storm Sewers.
      (1)   Minor Systems.  All on-site storm sewers shall be designed based on
a 10-year storm curve with the exception of the retention outlet, unless the

   (I)   Duration of storm in minutes (tc). TR-55 criteria for time of
concentration determination shall be utilized.
   (J)   Inlet time.  At the head of the system the inlet time may vary from 10
to 15 minutes, depending upon the size of the area and factors affecting rapid
runoff.
   (K)   Runoff coefficient.  Compute a weighted value of the drainage areas,
using 0.9 for roof areas and hard-surfaced paved area, 0.9 for sidewalk and
macadam driveways, and 0.4 for unpaved areas, yards, and lawns.
   (L)   Size of sewer.  The size of the sewer shall be determined on the basis
of the hydraulic gradient to provide adequate capacity for the computed runoff,
using n = .015 for concrete pipe, bituminous paved corrugated metal, and n =
.013 for corrugated polyethylene smooth lined pipe. In no case shall the size
be less than 12 inches in diameter.
   (M)   Depth.  The minimum depth for storm sewers shall be planned to provide
clearance for all utilities and to permit inlet leads to be laid on not less
than 2% slope, with the invert of the inlet pipe at the manhole, no lower than
the top of the bench wall.
   (N)   Minimum and maximum velocities.  Velocities in storm sewer pipe, when
flowing full at average peak flows, shall be no less than 2.5 feet per second
nor more than 12 feet per second.  For velocities greater than 12 feet per
second, special provisions shall be made to protect the sewer pipe against
erosion and against displacement by shock, or for checking the flow velocity.
   (O)   Gradients of pipe.  The sewer pipe shall be laid on such gradients so
that the full flow velocities shall be kept within the foregoing stated minimum
and maximum.  The pipe sizes should be so selected as to avoid large
differences in velocities between consecutive reaches. Hydraulic grade analysis
to be submitted to ensure the water level is not within 12" of the proposed top
of grate elevation, based on the 25-year storm event.
   (P)   Manholes.  Manholes shall be placed at intersections and termini of
sewers; at all changes in size, alignment, and slope of sewer; and at
intermediate intervals as required for maintenance. Manholes shall be
constructed in accordance with the latest edition of ODOT standard construction
drawings, or as approved by the City Engineer.
   (Q)   Inlets.
      (1)   Capacity.  The capacity of the inlet should not be less than the
quantity of flow tributary to the inlet. Inlets at low points or grade pockets
should have extra capacity as a safeguard for flooding from flows in excess of
design flows.  Calculations shall be submitted verifying the capacity of each
inlet.  Special inlets may be required for streets with steep gradients to
provide the extra capacity such situations require.
      (2)   Type.  Single or double gutter style inlets shall be used and
installed as shown on the latest edition of ODOT standard construction drawings
for “CB-3" and “CB-3A,” or an approved detail.  Any inlets having a depth in
excess of 5 feet shall be provided with manhole-type steps.  Wingwall and
ditch- type inlets shall be used where required to drain storm water from
watercourses and drainage channels.
      (3)   Gutter spread and inlet capacity calculations shall be submitted.
   (R)   Outfalls.
      (1)   When a storm sewer system outfalls into a flood plain of any major
watercourse, the outfall must not be subject to frequent floods or backwaters. 
Standard wingwalls with erosion control shall be constructed for all outfalls.
Suitable baffles or other energy dissipaters shall be provided if determined to
be necessary by the city engineer.
      (2)   The invert of the first storm sewer appurtenance upstream of the
outfall structure shall be above the elevations of the flood plain.
   (S)   Specifications for construction and materials.  In all other respects,
the materials and construction shall be as specified in Sections 603, 604, 706,
and 707, State of Ohio Department of Transportation "Construction and Material
Specifications".

§ 150.35  STORM WATER DRAINAGE CHANNELS AND WATERCOURSES.
   (A)   Authority for the improvement or disturbance.  The authority for the
construction, improvement, or disturbance of open channels and water courses is
with the city engineer.  Open channels, such as vegetated swales, may be used
for the collection of surface flows from relatively small areas, generally
lying within a city block.
   (B)   Degree of protection.  The storm water drainage channels and
watercourses shall be adequate to handle the runoff from storms of the
frequencies of occurrence shown for the degree of site development as follows:
      (1)   For all residential, commercial, and industrial areas with drainage
areas of less than one square mile - 10-year frequency.
      (2)   For concentrated high value districts, and for all areas providing
drainage flows in excess of the capacity of an 84-inch diameter sewer pipe -
25-year frequency.
      (3)   For main flood control channels - 50-year frequency. The runoff
computed from these storms shall be that from the area within the subdivision,
and from all other areas considered as fully developed in accordance with the
ultimate development planned in the master plan.
   (C)   Determination of quantity of runoff.  Each portion the storm water
system of drainage channels and watercourses shall be capable of handling the
peak flows as determined by the "Rational Method."
   (D)   Drainage channel capacities.
      (1)   Drainage channels shall be designed to carry the peak flows as
determined by the methods given in the preceding divisions.  Channel cross
section areas shall be determined by Manning's formula, based on the following
chart:
 
DESCRIPTION COEFFICIENT
Channels - Concrete           0.0130
Channels - Gunite             0.0170
Channels - Earth              0.0200
Channels - Cut in Rock        0.0250
Channels - Fine Gravel        0.0240
Channels - Coarse Gravel      0.0280
Dense Turf / Tree Switches    0.0750
Stemmy Grass / Brushy Growth  0.0175
Weeds, Brush, & Bushy Willows 0.0375
Cattails, Brush, & Trees      0.0750
 
      (2)   When open drainage channels require pavement lining to attain their
ultimate design capacity, the earth sections of the drainage channel and its
structure shall be designed and constructed to the ultimate design required. 
Lining will not be required in the initial construction, and may be delayed
until the development of the area produces runoff quantities large enough to
result in erosive channel flows, unless drainage channel velocities are
excessive initially.
   (E)   Erosion control for drainage channels.
      (1)   The design velocity shall be less than 4 feet per second.  The
bottom and sides of the earth channel shall be completely sodded to an
elevation of 3 feet above the design water surface.  The sod on the sides shall
be sufficiently pegged to remain in place. Velocity 4 feet per second and
higher.  The bottom shall be paved with a reinforced turf product. Sides shall
be completely sodded and fertilized as detailed above.
      (2)   Where sodding or seeding is required, and the soil is not capable
in its natural state of supporting vegetation (such as excessively sandy soil
or certain types of clay), appropriate actions shall be taken to bring the soil
to a condition which will support the growth of sod or seed.
      (3)   Consideration may be given to the construction of check dams and
drop structures for drainage channel erosion control, with the approval of the
city engineer.
   (F)   Swales.
      (1)   Turfed swales shall be permitted with lots of 1/2 acre or larger. 
They may be located at the rear of lots or along common property lines.  The
swale flow shall discharge into an open drainage channel or into an inlet-
manhole. Inlet-manholes shall be provided with a paved apron and transition
section to funnel the swale flow into the inlet.
      (2)   If an owner desires to eliminate a swale through his property, he
shall first secure approval by the city engineer and a work permit for the
installation therein, of a yard drain of adequate capacity, with a sewer
connection to a storm water sewer or drainage channel.  This process may also
entail the requirement of a post-construction best management practice.
   (G)   Culverts and bridges.  Culverts and bridges shall be designed in
accordance with the methods given in the "Manual of Location and Design,"
published by the Department of Transportation of the State of Ohio.
   (H)   Headwalls.  Standard headwalls or wingwalls shall be constructed for
all culvert inlets and outlets in swales, and at the out fall of all storm
sewers.
   (I)   Other drainage improvement measures.  Drainage improvement measures
other than the foregoing may be undertaken to provide the necessary hydraulic
characteristics required for adequate drainage.  These other measures may be
stream bed clearing, removal of obstructions, reduction of construction,
stabilization of banks or areas to eliminate erosion; widening, deepening, or
realignment of streams; or the construction of ponds behind dams or pump
stations.
   (J)   Specifications for construction and material.  In all other respects,
the material and construction shall be as specified in §§ 603, 604, 706, and
707, State of Ohio Department of Transportation “Construction and Material
Specifications.”

graded or otherwise disturbed by the movement of earth, regardless of
exemptions outlined in §
151.02(B). The following principles are effective in minimizing erosion and
sedimentation and shall be included where applicable in the Storm Water
Management Plan:
      (1)   Stripping of vegetation, regrading or other development shall be
done in such a way that will minimize erosion. Whenever feasible, natural
vegetation shall be retained, protected and supplemented;
      (2)   Development plans shall preserve salient natural features, keep
Cut-Fill operations to a minimum, and ensure conformity with topography so as
to create the least erosion potential;
      (3)   The smallest practical area of land shall be exposed at any one
time and the duration of exposure shall be kept to a practical minimum.  The
topsoil shall be preserved and returned to the surface of areas to be
revegetated, or new topsoil will be provided, or the surface shall be covered
with sod;
      (4)   Disturbed soils shall be stabilized as quickly as practical with
temporary vegetation or mulching to protect exposed critical areas during
development;
      (5)   The permanent final vegetation and structural erosion control and
drainage measures shall be installed as soon as practical in the development;
      (6)   (a)   Provisions shall be utilized in the design to minimize
changes to the surface conditions which increase the percentage of impervious
surface.
         (b)   Provisions shall be made to effectively mitigate the increased
runoff rates caused by changed soil and surface conditions in addition to
addressing water quality measures during and after development.  Where
necessary, Detention/ Retention Basins shall be provided according to the
requirements of this chapter as well as water quality measures.
      (7)   Sediment in the runoff water shall be trapped by the use of debris
basins, sediment basins, silt traps, or similar measures until the disturbed
area is stabilized.
   (B)   The following standards shall be followed in preparing the Storm Water
Management Plan;
      (1)   All lots, tracts, or parcels shall be graded to provide proper
drainage away from the building and dispose of it without ponding.  Each lot
shall be graded such that water from the lot drains to a natural stream, swale,
storm sewers or other watercourse. New storm water outfalls shall not discharge
undetained and/or untreated storm water into jurisdictional wetlands, aquifers,
or sensitive areas.
      (2)   All drainage provisions shall be of such design to adequately
convey quantity and preserve quality of the surface runoff.
      (3)   Concentration of surface water runoff shall only be permitted in
swales or watercourses;

§ 151.04  STORMWATER MANAGEMENT PROVISIONS.
   (A)   Introduction
      (1)   Every Subdivision and land development shall be provided with a
Storm Water Management System which is adequate to serve the area and meets the
requirements of this chapter and other criteria of the City. Any unsubdivided
parcel less than 1 AC. in size is exempt from the detention requirement per §
151.04(D) of these regulations.
      (2)   Regarding storm water quantity, developers are required to design
improvements in accordance with § 151.04(D)(2)(d) of these regulations.
      Where an existing site is being partially or totally redeveloped  all
requirements  of this chapter  will be in full force and effect.  If conditions
warrant on partially redeveloped sites and the developer  can show that the
application of all requirements would cause a hardship, he may request partial
relief from Planning Commission.
      (3)   The Planning Commission may waive requirements for an individual
Detention/Retention Basin if a common or regional Detention/Retention Basin of
adequate design is available or if the City is reasonably certain one will be
constructed and if the major drainage system from the Project Area to the
common or regional Detention/Retention Basin is such that the public health,
safety, and welfare will not be in jeopardy.
      If this option is exercised, the Developer must agree in writing to
participate in the cost of the common or regional Detention/Retention Basin
whether already constructed or planned.  The amount of participation and method
of collection will be determined by the City.
      (4)   Improvements shall be designed such that, at a minimum, all
developed areas are treated with an acceptable post-construction storm water
quality best management practice.  Practices chosen must be sized to treat the
water quality volume (WQv) and to ensure compliance to the maximum extent
practicable with Ohio EPA Water Quality Standards (Ohio Administrative Code
Chapter 3745-1) and Ohio EPA Construction General Storm Water NPDES discharge
permit requirements applicable to the property.  The WQv shall be equal to the
volume of runoff from a 0.75 inch rainfall.
         Sites that have been previously developed where no Post-Construction
BMP’s were installed are required to provide:
         (a)   A 20 percent net reduction of the site’s current impervious
area, achieved by either the use of pervious pavement or removing the
impervious surface.
         (b)   Treatment of at least 20 percent of the WQv.
         (c)   A combination of (a) and (b).
         The City accepted post-construction storm water quality best
management practices can be found in the list of “City of Springdale Post-
Construction Best Management Practices”, available from the Building
Department.
      (5)   Although the submission requirements are specific, they are also
the minimum requirements.  The City Engineer may recommend to Planning
Commission a higher degree of protection than specified if the design results
do not appear adequate to protect the health, safety, and welfare of the
community.
      (6)   Stormwater management Systems shall be designed for the ultimate
use of the land.
      (7)   Continued maintenance.
         (a)   Once a Storm Water Management Plan has been approved and
constructed it shall be the responsibility of the property owner to maintain
the facility as designed and constructed and to ensure its proper operation to
meet the intent and requirements of this chapter at all times.
         (b)   An Inspection and Maintenance Agreement shall be made between
the property owner and the city ensuring that the Post-Construction Stormwater
BMP(s) are inspected and properly maintained.  Such agreement shall be in the
form of a covenant to run with the land and shall be recorded with the Hamilton
County Recorder.  A template of such an agreement is available from the city.
   (B)   Stormwater Management System
      (1)   The development of a comprehensive Stormwater Management System
requires providing two separate and distinct drainage systems, the minor system
and the major system, and providing adequate post-construction storm water
quality best management practices.
         (a)   The minor drainage system is for collecting and transporting
runoff from frequently occurring storms (both for water quantity and water
quality measures).  It includes open channels, street curbs and gutters, and
underground storm sewers, manholes, catch basins, and culverts.  This system's
purpose is to lessen or eliminate inconveniences and safety and health hazards
associated with frequent storms.  Except where indicated otherwise, design
criteria and requirements of this chapter are directed to the minor drainage
system.
         (b)   The major drainage system is to insure that stormwater runoff
which exceeds the capacity of the minor drainage system has a route to follow
to the retention basin.  It must be recognized that the major drainage system
exists even when it is not planned and whether or not physical facilities are
intelligently located in respect to it.
      (2)   Submission requirements for development.  Plans, profiles, and
supporting documentation to verify conformance with this chapter shall be
submitted along with the usual plan submissions required in Land Development
Rules and Regulations.
         (a)   Preliminary Plans.  In addition to the Land Development Rules

project.  These shall include all required design features except those waived
by the City Engineer.  All revisions to the approved plans must be approved by
the City prior to construction.
            See Building Official for “As-Built Plan Requirements”.
   (C)   Stormwater Runoff Analysis.  See §
150.34 of the Springdale Land Development Rules and Regulations.
   (D)   Detention/Retention Basins.
      (1)   Introduction.  Detention/retention of stormwater refers to storage
of excess runoff on the site of a development area or redeveloped area and
gradual release of the stored runoff at an acceptable rate.  The detention
facility may be a dry surface structure, a pond or lake with additional
freeboard or underground structure. The parking lot may not be used to provide
for any of the detention requirements.
      (2)   Design.
         (a)   Supporting calculations will be required by the City Engineer. 
Any computer analysis method should be confirmed as acceptable with the City
Engineer prior to design commencing.  Computer Analysis systems for detention
volume may be acceptable at the discretion of the City Engineer.  The following
items (a - h) need to be included in a summary sheet of the support
information, with references to the applicable page where the corresponding
calculation is noted.  All information must be submitted in a summary form.
            1.   Pre-developed 10-year Q, allowable Stage 1 discharge (in the
situation where offsite tributary area is involved use only on-site area).
            2.   Post-developed 10-year Q and required Stage 1 detention
volume.
               a.   Required Stage 1 Detention Volume (CF) = (Q10-post - Q10-
PRE)*(25 minutes)*(60).
            3.   Pre-developed 25-year Q, allowable Stage 2 discharge (in the
situation where off- site tributary area is involved use only on-site area).
            4.   Direct runoff (non-detained) 100-year, post-developed, flow
subtracted from allowable discharge.
            5.   Post-developed 100-year Q, and stage 2 required detention/
retention volume.
               a.   Required Stage 2 Detention Volume (CF) = (Q100-post - Q25-
PRE)*(25 minutes)*(60).
            6.   100-year flow from off-site tributary areas to be added to
allowable discharge to provide direct pass through from off-site drainage (this
is not utilized in the volume determination).
               a.   If the pass-thru flow is equal to, or greater than, the on-
site developed 100- year peak flow, the City Engineer may require that
hydrographs be prepared and both areas be routed through to the detention basin
for design.
            7.   A stage/storage/release table, which also specifically notes
Actual discharge from outlet structure at stage 1 and stage 2 storage volumes.
         (b)   Allowable discharge.
            1.   The volume and peak rate of runoff from an area after full
development shall not exceed the volume and peak rate of runoff from the same
area before development for each design frequency storm, or as noted in §
151.04(D)(2)(d), whichever is more restrictive.
            2.   For those areas where a study of the downstream area indicates
the extended time of high discharge or velocity due to restricted release rate
and storage may cause flooding or excessive erosion, the City Engineer may
recommend that additional controls be required.
         (d)   Detention Volume.  The detention of storm water shall occur in 2
stages.
            1.   Stage 1 shall allow the discharge of the 10 year pre-developed
storm flow and provide for the detention of a volume equal to the 10 year storm
flow, post-development, less the 10 year pre-developed discharge.
               a.   If the Detention (Water Quantity Basin) is being utilized
as a water quality pond, then an additional initial stage for the Water Quality
Volume (WQV) will be required.
            2.   Stage 2 shall allow the discharge of the 25 year pre-developed
storm flow and provide for the detention of a volume equal to the 100 year
storm flow, post-development, less the 25 year pre-developed discharge.  The
detention volume shall be determined by multiplying the above difference by 25
minutes.
            3.   Outlet flow control devices shall be multistage.
            4.   Other requirements may be imposed for specific cases.
            5.   All detention systems must include an emergency overflow to
control the post-developed 100-year storm water flow when maximum storage
capacity is surpassed.
            6.   No on-site storm drainage shall outlet downstream of the main
retention facility without providing supplemental retention as per the above
criteria.
   (E)   Major Storms - Water Control.
      (1)   Introduction.  Planning for the major storm is to insure that
stormwater runoff which exceeds the capacity of the drainage system has a route
to follow that will not cause loss of property or any loss of life.  This
system exists whether or not it is planned.
      (2)   Criteria.
         (a)   Storm frequencies.  Surface runoff for the major drainage system
shall be determined using a storm with a frequency of 100 years.
         (b)   Total runoff.  The peak discharge of storm water will be
determined as previously outlined in this chapter. The peak discharge may be
reduced by an amount equal to the flow in the minor storm system as designed.
      (3)   Points of Consideration.
         (a)   All open channels, street cross sections, low points, and
culvert entrances will be considered as possible flood areas due to the 100-
year storm and will be included as part of the major storm investigation.  The
investigation may include downstream facilities to a point designated by the
City Engineer whether or not these facilities are contained within the project
area or controlled by the land developer requesting approvals.
         (b)   All calculations will be submitted with the drainage plan. 
   (F)   Inspection of Stormwater Control Facilities and Post Construction
Stormwater Quality BMP(s).
      (1)   Inspection Requirements.  All detention/retention and Post
Construction BMP(s) shall be routinely inspected as determined by the city.
         (a)   All underground detention chambers shall be inspected by the
property owner to insure that the detention chambers are in compliance with the
approved water management and sediment control plan and the city's
regulations.  Such inspections shall be conducted at a minimum of every three
years for underground detention chambers which are 10,000 cubic feet in size or
greater, and every four years for underground detention chambers which are less
than 10,000 cubic feet. The inspection shall be conducted in compliance with
applicable law and regulations concerning confined space entry and shall be
videotaped, a copy of which shall be provided to the city Building Department
for its review. The property owner of an underground detention chamber shall be
responsible to perform any maintenance or repairs which are discovered as a
result of the inspection.  If the detention facility also functions in whole or
in part as a stormwater quality BMP, such facility shall be inspected annually.
         (b)   Post Construction BMP(s) shall be inspected annually to insure
that BMP(s) are in compliance with the approved water management and sediment
control plan and to identify and facilitate the removal of any pollutants. 
Inspection reports shall be submitted to the city no later than 30 days after
the inspection. Templates of inspection reports are available from the city.
      (2)   Correction of Identified Deficiencies.  If inspections identify
corrections which need to be performed to return the facilities to proper
function in accordance with the approved water management and sediment control
plan, such corrections shall be made by the owner at his expense within 30 days
of discovering such deficiencies.  If inspections of Post Construction
Stormwater Quality BMP(s) identify pollutants which must be removed, they must
be removed and disposed of by the owner at his expense in accordance with city,
state and federal guidelines within 30 days.
      (3)   Failure to Inspect or Correct Deficiencies.  If a property owner
fails or refuses to conduct an inspection as required by this section, the city
shall cause an inspection to be conducted and all costs that the city incurs in
performing the inspection shall be the responsibility of the property owner. If
the property owner fails or refuses to perform the maintenance and repairs
within the time specified by the city, the city shall cause the maintenance or
repairs to be performed and the cost shall be the responsibility of the
property owner. In addition, the failure or refusal of a property owner to
conduct an inspection or make correction/repairs as required by this section
shall be deemed to be a misdemeanor and punishable as provided in §
151.06(B).  Costs shall be assessed in the same manner as provided for in §§
155.064 and
155.065.

2010, passed 12-15-10; Am. Ord. 29-2012, passed 9-5-12)
§ 151.05  APPROVAL PROCEDURES.
   (A)   The building permit review process shall not begin until the Storm
Water Management Plan, together with other submissions required by this chapter
are approved by the City Engineer.
   (B)   Three copies of complete plan and supporting data shall be filed with
the Building Department in accordance with the submission schedule of the
Planning Commission.  The City Engineer or his representative shall review and
recommend such changes or modifications as are deemed necessary to the Planning
Commission.
   (C)   The Planning Commission shall review these plans as submitted,
together with the recommendations of the City Administrator, Building Official,
and City Engineer.  If the Commission approves the plans, it shall so advise
the Building Official who shall insure compliance by the applicant with the
plans as finally approved.
   (D)   Every Storm Water Management plan approval shall expire and become
null and void if the work authorized has not commenced within 120 days, or is
not completed within two years from date of issue.  The Planning Commission may
grant a reasonable extension of time if the permit holder presents satisfactory
evidence that unusual difficulties have prevented work being started or
completed within the specified time limits and if written application is made
before the expiration date of this permit.
   (E)   In order to insure that emergency measures could be taken by the City
if the water management and sediment control measures were not implemented
according to the agreed upon plan and schedule, a performance bond in the
amount of the cost of the Storm Water Management Plan measures shall be
required to be filed with the City Finance Director. This bond shall include
post-construction best-management practices. Said performance bond shall
authorize immediate payment to the City of Springdale upon certification by the
City Administrator with the concurrence of the Planning Commission, that
necessary emergency work must be done immediately to insure proper water
management and sediment control as a result of the landowner's failure to
complete or adhere to the approved Stormwater Management Plan.
   (F)   The Planning Commission and the City Administrator shall make a
continuing review and evaluation of the methods used and overall effectiveness
of the storm water management and sediment control program.

GRADES
§ 152.15  GRADING REQUIREMENTS.
   The finished grades, resulting from grading land, shall be such that
drainage of surface water away from buildings and structures will be adequate
to prevent damage to foundations, dampness within buildings and structures, to
prevent damage to adjoining properties, and unhealthful conditions caused by
water lying upon the land. All roofs and paved areas shall be drained away from
foundations and into a recognized storm water system. All buildings, except as
provided herein, shall be provided with gutters, downspouts, and drains which
conduct roof water so as to prevent damage to building walls, foundations, and
adjoining property. Drains used for this purpose shall be of solid, tight
jointed pipe not less than four inches in diameter. Those discharging to the
street, ditch, or curb shall pass under the sidewalk and there shall be at
least one length of cast iron pipe at the ditch or curb connection. Sump pumps
shall discharge to a recognized storm water system and may not discharge to the
curb of the public street. Sump pumps shall in no circumstance be permitted to
drain in such a way as to cause damage to adjoining properties or present a
health hazard. Roofs of accessory buildings, not exceeding 800 square feet in
area, will not be required to have gutters and downspouts unless the building
official determines that gutters and downspouts, in compliance with the
regulations hereof, are necessary to prevent serious damage to nearby property
or present a health hazard.

§ 152.16  FINAL INSPECTION.
   The building official shall cause to be made an inspection of the final
grading of a lot to ascertain that positive drainage has been provided so as to
preclude the accumulation of surface water in pockets against the building or
elsewhere on the lot, and there is no impediment to the natural ground drainage
of the surrounding area. Where these provisions have not been satisfied, the
issuance of the certificate of occupancy for the building shall be deferred
until compliance is accomplished. In order to assist the building official to
carry out the provisions of this section, he shall be authorized to require
grading plans to be submitted with all applications for building permits. These
plans are to show the existing topographical conditions and all proposed
changes of grading including swales for storm water run-off. ('68 Code, §
506.4)  (Ord. 58-2001, passed 12-5-01)  Penalty, see §

§ 152.17  GRAVITY DRAINAGE REQUIRED WHEN NO SEWER AVAILABLE.
   Where no storm or combined sewer is available, no garage, apron, runway, or
other area below ground level shall be permitted unless it has gravity drainage
to the street or natural ground surface. The storm or combined sewer shall not
be considered available unless the lateral for the proposed building is
installed so that the flow line of the lateral in the basement of the building
is at an elevation of not less than 30 inches above the crown of the sewer at
the point of connection.

FEES
§ 152.20  PERMITS.
   (A)   No permit shall be issued by the Building Official until the fees set
forth in the following division (G) shall have been paid. Each permit shall
show the owner's name, the location of the premises, the operations involved,
and shall include a receipt for the amount paid.
   (B)   Except as provided below, any person, firm, or corporation who
performs work for which a permit is required by this chapter without first
having secured a permit, shall be deemed in violation and subject to the
penalties provided in this chapter.
      (1)   Emergencies. In case of emergency where there is actual and
immediate risk of failure or collapse of a building or structure or the
existence of defective equipment or service facilities such as to endanger life
or health or such other condition as to require immediate action to make
repairs necessary to prevent the occurrence of such failure or collapse or the
occurrence of such danger and time available is not sufficient to allow the
securing of a permit from the Building Official as required by this chapter,
the person, firm, or corporation required to perform such repairs may proceed
to do so after having first notified the Building Official of such fact without
obtaining a permit as required by this chapter. In case the Building Official
is unavailable, notice shall be given to the nearest fire or police official.
      (2)   Any person who shall commence any installation of work for which a
permit is required by this chapter without first having obtained a permit
therefor shall be subject to penalties as outlined in §
152.99 and shall, if legally authorized and subsequently allowed to obtain a
permit, pay double the permit fees prescribed by division (G), except work
covered by division (G)(1), in which case they shall pay a $50 penalty,
provided, however, that this requirement shall not apply to emergency work or
installations as provided by division (B)(1), when it shall be proved to the
satisfaction of the Building Official that such work or installation was
urgently necessary and that it would have been impractical to have awaited the
normal time consumed in application for and issuance of the permit.
Nevertheless, even in such emergencies the required permit shall be obtained
without unreasonable delay after installation starts, and in no case more than
three days in which the office of the Building Official is open for business,
or the extra fee as herein provided shall be charged for the permit. In no case
shall the extra penalty fee exceed $2,000.  Before issuing such permit, the
Building Official shall take necessary steps to determine whether work
performed prior to the date of permit and inspection conform to the chapter.
Such steps may include but shall not be limited to directing the tearing out of
sections of surface work for access to subsurface sections, digging for access
to foundations, piping, and other subterranean work and the like. The applicant
for the permit shall perform all such work as may be directed at his own
expense.
   (C)   Time limitation of permit. Work authorized by a permit must start
within 12 months of the date of plan approval; except that for reasonable
cause, the Building Official may grant not more than one extension of time for
an additional period of 12 months per paragraph (C)(1). Any permit shall become
invalid if work authorized under the permit has had no substantial progress
within 12 months of plan approval. A permit shall also become invalid if work
is suspended, postponed or abandoned with no substantial progress for a period
of six months. In the case of suspension of work, two extensions may be granted
for six months each per paragraph (C)(2).
      (1)   When a permit is about to expire, the owner and/or applicant shall
submit a letter to the Building Official stating reasons for and requesting an
extension at least ten days prior to the expiration. Should the Building
Official determine an extension is justified, he or she may issue an extension
upon and payment of a fee of $50.
      (2)   Ten days prior to the expiration of the permit because work has
been suspended, the owner and/or applicant shall submit a letter to the
Building Official stating the reasons for and requesting a six-month extension.
Should the Building Official determine an extension is justified, he or she may
issue an extension upon and payment of a fee of $50. If a second extension of
the permit is necessary due to suspension of work, the owner and/or applicant
shall submit a letter to the Building Official ten days prior to the expiration
of the first extension, stating the reasons for and requesting a second six-
month extension. Should the Building Official determine an additional extension
is justified, he or she may issue an extension upon and payment of a fee of
$50.
   When a permit has expired, the Building Official shall issue a stop work
order requiring the owner to make conditions safe and informing him that he
shall be responsible for obtaining new permits prior to such time that he
decides to commence the work. Where work has progressed to a point, the
Building Official shall place a notation in the file indicating the extent of
work completed.
   (D)   Revocation of permits. The Building Official may revoke any permit or
approval issued under the provisions of this chapter or may stop the work for
any of the following reasons:
      (1)   Whenever the continuance of any work becomes dangerous to life or
property;
      (2)   Whenever there is a violation or alteration of any condition on
which the issuance of the permit or approval was based; or
      (3)   Whenever any false statement or misrepresentation has been made
upon the application, drawings, or specifications on which the issuance of the
permit or approval was based.
   The revocation notice of the permit in every instance shall be in writing
and shall be served upon the holder of the permit, the owner, his agent, or the
person having charge of the work. Any revocation notice shall be posted upon
the building or structure in question by the Building Official. After the
notice is received or posted, it shall be unlawful for any person to proceed
with any operation for which such a permit was issued. No part of the fees for
such permit shall be returned. Revocation of a permit shall be subject to
appeal.
   (E)   Rescinding the revocation. The Building Official may rescind the
revocation of the permit in which case the applicant shall pay a fee equal to
the original permit fee or $50, whichever is less, or the applicant may appeal
to the Ohio Board of Building Appeals for those permits regulated by the Ohio
Building Code or the Board of Housing, Building, and Fire Appeals for all other
permits, in which case he shall pay the appropriate fee for a hearing.
   (F)   Records of fees. Records shall be kept by the Building Official of all
fees received, and all fees received by said Building Official shall be
deposited with the fiscal officer of the city to the credit of the General

§ 153.100  TITLE.
   
Chapter 153 of the Springdale Code of Ordinances shall be known as the “City of
Springdale Zoning Code” or referred to as the “zoning code” or the “code”.
(Ord. 4-2016, passed 3-2-16)
§ 153.101  PURPOSE AND INTENT.
   (A)   The purpose of this zoning code and the intent of the legislative
authority in its adoption is to promote and protect to the fullest extent
permissible under the provisions of the Constitution of the State of Ohio, and
the Ohio Revised Code as modified by the Charter of the City of Springdale, the
public health, safety, convenience, comfort, prosperity, and the general
welfare of the city by regulating the following:
      (1)   The use of buildings, other structures, and land for residences,
public facilities, business, services, industry, or other purposes;
      (2)   The bulk, height, design, percent of lot coverage, and location of
buildings;
      (3)   The population densities within the city;
      (4)   The division of land into districts of such numbers and dimensions
as will best serve the public welfare;
      (5)   The administration and amendments to this zoning code; and
      (6)   The penalties for the violation of this zoning code.
   (B)   This zoning code is intended to achieve, among others, the following
objectives:
      (1)   To protect the character and value of residential, institutional,
public, business, commercial and manufacturing uses; and to ensure their
orderly and beneficial development;
      (2)   To provide adequate open spaces for light, air, and outdoor uses;
      (3)   To prevent overcrowding of the land;
      (4)   To prevent excessive concentration of population;
      (5)   To regulate and control the location and spacing of buildings on
the lot, and in relation to the surrounding property;
      (6)   To regulate the location of buildings and intensity of uses in
relation to streets to cause the least interference with and damage by traffic
movements, and hence result in less street congestion and improved public
safety;
      (7)   To ensure economical extensions to sewers, water supply, waste
disposal, and other public utilities, as well as development of recreation,
schools, and other public facilities;
      (8)   To accomplish the respective goals set forth in the purpose and
“intent” subsections of each section; and
      (9)   To protect the public health, safety, morals, comfort, and general
welfare.
(Ord. 4-2016, passed 3-2-16)
§ 153.102  INTERPRETATION AND APPLICATION.
   (A)   The provisions of this zoning code shall be interpreted and applied as
the minimum requirements for the promotion of the public health, safety,
morals, comfort, and general welfare.
   (B)   Whenever the regulations of this zoning code require a greater width
of side yard or other open space, a lower height of buildings or less number of
stories, a greater percentage of lot to be left unoccupied, a lower intensity
of populations, a more restricted use of land, or impose higher standards than
are required in any other ordinance or regulation, private deed restrictions,
or private covenants, these regulations shall govern. If requirements of the
other ordinance or regulation are the more restrictive, then those requirements
shall govern.
   (C)   In the interpretation of this code, if a use within this code is not
specifically permitted, it shall be prohibited.
(Ord. 4-2016, passed 3-2-16)

of ordinances of the municipality in conflict with any regulation, provision,
amendment, or supplement of this zoning code are, to the extent of such
conflict, repealed.

(Ord. 4-2016, passed 3-2-16)
§ 153.204  CONDITIONAL USE PERMITS.
   Conditional use permits shall be required for types of uses designated as
conditionally permitted in a particular zoning district. Such particular use
may be permitted and desirable in certain districts, but not without
consideration. In each case, the effect of the use upon neighboring land and
the effect the neighboring land will have on the use will be reviewed. The
application of the planning standards for determining the location and extent
of such use is a planning function, and not in the nature of a variance or an
appeal. Enumerated throughout this code are certain uses and the districts in
which they may be permitted as conditional uses provided the following
standards are fulfilled and a conditional use permit is granted by the Planning
Commission. Application requirements shall be as established on the checklist
provided by the city.
   (A)   Application and notification requirements.
      (1)   An owner or owner’s authorized agent shall submit an application
for a conditional use permit that is complete and includes all the required
information per the approved checklist.
      (2)   The Planning Commission shall hold a public hearing subject to the
requirements of §
153.201(B): Public Notification for Public Hearings.
   (B)   Review factors. The Planning Commission shall consider the following
standards when determining whether the issuance of a conditional use permit is
warranted:
      (1)   The conditional use is consistent with the spirit, purpose, and
intent of the comprehensive plan and will not negatively affect or harm the
appropriate use of neighboring property.
      (2)   The proposed conditional use is to be located in a district wherein
such use may be permitted, subject to the requirements of this section.
      (3)   The use complies with all applicable use-specific provisions
established in §
153.252(E): Public and Institutional Use-Specific Regulations and §
153.253(D): Non-Residential Use-Specific Regulations.
      (4)   The proposed use shall be adequately served by essential public
facilities and services such as, but not limited to, roads, public safety
forces, storm water facilities, water, sanitary sewer, refuse pick-up, and
schools, or that the persons or agencies responsible for the establishment of
the proposed use shall be able to provide adequately any such services.
      (5)   The proposed use will comply with all applicable development
standards, except as specifically altered by the Planning Commission in the
approved conditional use.
      (6)   The proposed use will be harmonious with the existing or intended
character of the area, will not be hazardous or have a negative impact on
adjacent properties, and will not be detrimental to property values or the
economic welfare of the general vicinity.
      (7)   The proposed use will not involve uses, activities, processes,
materials, equipment, and conditions of operations, including but not limited
to, hours of operation, that will be detrimental to any persons, property, or
the general welfare by reason of excessive production of traffic, noise, smoke,
fumes, glare, odor, or other characteristic not compatible to the uses
permitted in the base zoning district.
      (8)   The proposed use will not impede the normal and orderly development
and improvement of the surrounding properties for uses permitted in the
district.
   (C)   Approval conditions.
      (1)   The Planning Commission shall approve the conditional use permit if
it determines that the proposed application satisfies, or through the
imposition of conditions pursuant to §
153.204(C)(3) satisfies, the standards set forth in §
153.204(B): Review Factors.
      (2)   If the Planning Commission determines that the issuance of a
conditional use permit is warranted, the Planning Commission may condition such
issuance upon specific requirements and limitations with respect to the
location, construction, maintenance, landscaping, operation, and other factors
and features of the application it deems necessary or appropriate to protect
the interests of the community and to ensure satisfaction of the standards set
forth in §
153.204(B): Review Factors.
      (3)   If the Planning Commission determines that such proposed use does
not, and with the imposition of conditions, will not, satisfy the standards set
forth in §
153.204(B): Review Factors, the Planning Commission shall deny the issuance of
a conditional use permit.
      (4)   If the Planning Commission denies the conditional use permit, the
owner or the owner’s authorized agent has the option to appeal the decision to
the Board of Zoning Appeals subject to the requirements set forth in §
153.208: Appeals. The determination by the Board of Zoning Appeals constitutes
a final decision by the city.
   (D)   Period of validity of conditional use permit. The approval of a
conditional use permit shall become null and void if building permits have not
been issued for all buildings and structures within six months after approval
of a conditional use permit. The Planning Commission may extend this time
period if requested and justified by the owner or owner's authorized agent. In
no situation shall the Planning Commission extend this time period for longer
than two years from the date of approval of the conditional use permit.
(Ord. 4-2016, passed 3-2-16)
§ 153.205  DETERMINATION OF SIMILAR USE.
   (A)   Where there is a proposed use that is not currently listed in
Table 252-1: Residential Permitted Uses or
Table 253-1: Non-Residential Permitted Uses, the Building Official, in
consultation with the chair of the Planning Commission, may review the use to
determine the appropriate zoning districts, if any, where the use may be
permitted. The nature, operation, and function of the use shall be analyzed in
the determination of the appropriate district(s).
   (B)   The Building Official may forward his or her decision to the Planning
Commission for review and to determine if the proposed use should be enumerated
in this zoning code as a permitted use in the appropriate zoning district(s)
pursuant to §
153.202: Zoning Text and Map Amendments. 
   (C)   The Building Official may find that the proposed use is not compatible
with any existing zoning districts and not permit the use under the current
zoning code. The owner or owner's authorized agent may appeal the decision of
the Building Official to Planning Commission for review and final decision.
(Ord. 4-2016, passed 3-2-16)
§ 153.206  VARIANCES.
   (A)   Application and notification requirements.
      (1)   An owner or owner's authorized agent shall submit an application
for a variance that is complete and includes all the required information per
the approved checklist.
      (2)   The Board of Zoning Appeals shall hold a public hearing subject to
the requirements of §
153.201(B): Public Notification for Public Hearings.
   (B)   Review factors.
      (1)   The Board of Zoning Appeals shall have the power to authorize
variances in specific cases as described herein and that are consistent with
the provisions of the City Charter.
      (2)   The Board of Zoning Appeals shall hear and decide all applications
for variances from the requirements and standards set forth in this zoning code
and that are not contrary to the public interest. When an owner or owner's
authorized agent seeks a variance, said owner or owner's authorized agent shall
be required to establish that the literal enforcement of this code would result
in an unnecessary hardship unless a variance is granted.
      (3)   Variances shall not be granted for the use of any land, structure,
or building that is not permitted in the applicable zoning district. In those
cases, an application to rezone the property is required.
      (4)   The Board of Zoning Appeals shall not grant variances, as
authorized in this zoning code, unless it can determine that there is an
unnecessary hardship for the owner in complying with the requirements of this
zoning code. The evaluation shall include, but is not limited to, the following
factors:
         a)   Whether special conditions and circumstances exist which are
peculiar to the land or structure involved and which are not applicable
generally to other lands or structures in the same zoning district; examples of
such special conditions or circumstances are: exceptional irregularity,
narrowness, shallowness, or steepness of the lot, or adjacency to nonconforming
and inharmonious uses, structures, or conditions.
         b)   Whether the property in question will yield a reasonable return
or whether there can be any beneficial use of the property without the
variance.
         c)   Whether the variance is substantial and is the minimum necessary
to make possible the reasonable use of the land or structures.
         d)   Whether the essential character of the neighborhood would be
substantially altered or whether adjacent properties would suffer substantial
detriment as a result of the variance.
         e)   Whether the variance would adversely affect the delivery of
governmental services such as water, sewer, and refuse pick-up.
         f)   Whether special conditions or circumstances exist as a result of
actions of the owner.
         g)   Whether the property owner's predicament can feasibly be obviated
through some method other than a variance.
         h)   Whether the spirit and intent behind these code requirements
would be observed and substantial justice done by granting a variance.
         i)   Whether the granting of the variance requested will confer on the
owner any special privilege that is denied by this regulation to other lands,
structures, or buildings in the same district.
         j)   No single factor listed above may control, and not all factors
may be applicable in each case. Each case shall be determined on its own facts.
      (5)   The Board of Zoning Appeals shall not grant a variance unless the
Board finds that special conditions or circumstances exist which are particular
to the land, structure, or building involved and which are not generally
applicable to other lands, structures, or buildings in the same district.
   (C)   Approval.  Following the public hearing, the Board of Zoning Appeals
shall approve, approve with conditions, or disapprove the request. If the
variance is disapproved by the Board of Zoning Appeals, the owner or owner's
authorized agent may seek relief through the Court of Common Pleas. Failure to
act within 30 days shall not constitute an approval of the variance.
(Ord. 4-2016, passed 3-2-16)
§ 153.207  CERTIFICATE OF USE AND OCCUPANCY.
   (A)   Certificate of use and occupancy required. A certificate of use and
occupancy is required and shall be issued for any of the following after the
work has been completed and found to be in compliance with the provisions of
this code and other regulations of the city including applicable building and
fire codes:
      (1)   Newly constructed, relocated, reconstructed, erected, or altered
building or structure or portion thereof;
      (2)   Before occupancy of an existing building or any portion thereof,
which has been altered or changed;
      (3)   When an existing use has been altered, changed, or enlarged;
      (4)   When an additional use is to commence that is different than the
prior use; or
      (5)   When a nonconforming building or use is changed.
   (B)   Application for certificate.
      (1)   Applications for a certificate of use and occupancy shall be
submitted by an owner, or an owner’s authorized agent, to the Building
Official. If any occupancy or use within a building or structure will be by a
tenant or person other than a single owner, such application shall be required
to be made on behalf of all owners and proposed tenants, and shall only be made
when the work for which the application is submitted has been completed.
      (2)   Accurate information shall be furnished along with the application
by the owner, or an owner's authorized agent, as to the size and location of
the lot, buildings, or structures occupying the lot, the dimensions of all
yards and open spaces, the proposed use of each portion of land or building,
and all such other information as may be requested by the city.
      (3)   A statement shall be furnished by each owner or owner's authorized
agent stating the exact intentions of the intended use of the subject property.
If different uses will occupy different portions of the land, building, or
structure, the statement shall set forth the uses and specifically refer to
designated areas on the plan to which each use will be restricted. 
   (C)   Conformance to plans and statements required. Notwithstanding anything
to the contrary herein, a certificate of use and occupancy may not be issued
for any use or building or portion thereof which does not conform to the
application and plans submitted upon which a zoning certificate or building
permit was issued, or for a use differing in type or location from that set
forth in the owner's statement. A certificate of use and occupancy shall not be
issued where any conditions imposed under this code have not been met.
   (D)   Temporary use and occupancy certificates. When requested by the owner
or owner's authorized agent and when the Building Official finds that a
violation or violations of this code are minor and do not represent a serious
danger to life or property, he or she may issue a temporary certificate of use
and occupancy setting forth corrective steps which must be taken before
occupancy or a use can be commenced. Such temporary occupancy certificate shall
specify a time limitation, not more than 60 days, after which upon inspection,
if conditions are not met, the conditional approval shall terminate. A
temporary occupancy certificate may likewise be issued for the period of time
work is being performed on occupied premises, provided a valid zoning
certificate and building permit have been issued for the work. Temporary
occupancy certificates may not extend beyond 60 days, or be renewed.
   (E)   Record of all applications and certificates. A record of all
applications and certificates issued shall be kept on file in the office of the
Building Official. Copies shall be furnished, upon request, to any person.
(Ord. 4-2016, passed 3-2-16)

to the requirements of §
153.201(B): Public Notification for Public Hearings.

ZONING DISTRICTS AND REGULATIONS
§ 153.250  PURPOSE.
   The incorporated territory of Springdale, Ohio, is hereby divided into
zoning use districts wherein regulations are uniform for each class or kind of
building or structure or use throughout each zoning district, in order to:
   (A)   Classify, regulate, and restrict the location of commercial
establishments, industries, residences, recreation, and other land uses, and
the location of buildings designed for specific uses;
   (B)   Regulate and limit the height, number of stories, size of buildings
and other structures hereafter erected or altered;
   (C)   Regulate and limit the percentage of lot area which may be occupied,
and the density of population; and
   (D)   Establish setback lines, sizes of yards, and other open spaces
surrounding such buildings.
(Ord. 4-2016, passed 3-2-16)
§ 153.251  DISTRICT ESTABLISHMENT AND MAP.
   (A)   Districts established. For the purpose of this code, all land falling
within the incorporated territory of Springdale, Ohio, is hereby divided into
the districts established in
Table 251-1: Zoning Districts.

      (1)   Whenever the abbreviated terms, such as OB, RSH-L, or GB, are used
in this code, they shall be construed as referring to their corresponding
district titles.
      (2)   The above classification of districts shall not be construed as
enumerated of most restrictive to least restrictive districts except for the
specific purposes set forth in this code.
   (B)   Scope of regulations. Any building or parcel of land may be used, and
the use of any building or any parcel of land shall only be changed or
extended, and any existing building shall only be altered, converted, enlarged,
reconstructed, moved, or maintained, only for the uses specifically enumerated
or referred to as permitted, or required, in the district in which the building
or parcel of land is located and for no other use. The enumeration of uses
within a district shall not be construed as a ranking of the most desirable to
less desirable uses.
   (C)   Map and notations incorporated. The boundaries of the districts are
shown upon the zoning map of the City of Springdale which was adopted by
ordinance (and as may be amended from time to time), which is hereby
incorporated as if fully set forth herein. The map is made a part of this
zoning code and all notations, references, and other information shown thereon
are a part of this zoning code and have the same force and effect as if the
zoning map and all notations, references, and other information shown thereon
were fully set forth and described herein.
   (D)   Zoning vacated properties. Whenever any street, alley, or other public
way is vacated by official action of City Council, the zoning of the district
adjoining each side of such street, alley, or other public way shall be
automatically extended to the center of such vacation, and all area included in
the vacation shall henceforth be subject to all appropriate regulations of the
extended districts.
   (E)   Zoning annexed territories.  All territory which may hereafter be
annexed to the municipality shall be rezoned to the zoning district most
similar to the previous zoning of the territory.
   (F)   Rules for uncertain boundaries. The district boundary lines of the
zoning map enclose an area of a designated district, and generally follow
recorded lot lines, the center line of streets, railroad rights-of-way or their
extensions, or fixed points. However:
      (1)   Where the district boundary line is shown by dimension or
relationship as being located a specific distance from or parallel to a street
line, such distance shall control; or
      (2)   Where a district boundary line is shown as adjoining a railroad, it
shall, unless otherwise fixed, be construed to coincide with the nearest
boundary line of the railroad right-of-way; or
      (3)   Where a district boundary line does not coincide with any of the
aforesaid lines and where it is not located by dimensions or fixed points shown
on the map, the Planning Commission shall determine the exact location by use
of an engineer's scale as measured on the zoning map.
   (G)   Relationship of overlay districts.
      (1)   Where land is classified into an overlay zoning district as well as
an underlying base zoning district, the regulations governing development in
the overlay zoning district shall apply in addition to the regulations
governing the underlying base district.
      (2)   In the event of an express conflict between the standards of the
overlay zoning district and the underlying base zoning district, the standards
governing the overlay district shall control.
      (3)   In some instances, land may be classified into multiple overlay
districts. In the event of an express conflict between the standards of the
multiple overlay districts, the most restrictive standards shall apply.

§ 153.252  RESIDENTIAL ZONING DISTRICTS.
   (A)   Purpose statement. The following are the purpose statements for each
of the city's residential zoning districts:
      (1)   Residential Single Household - Estate Density (RSH-E). It is the
purpose of the “RSH-E” district to encourage the establishment and retention of
residential neighborhoods consisting of single household dwellings on large
lots while preserving the undeveloped lands within this district for similar
types of residential uses.
      (2)   Residential Single Household - Low Density (RSH-L). It is the
purpose of the “RSH-L” district to encourage the establishment and retention of
residential neighborhoods consisting of single household dwellings on medium
sized lots while preserving the undeveloped lands within this district for
similar types of residential uses.
      (3)   Residential Single Household - High Density (RSH-H). It is the
purpose of the “RSH-H” district to encourage the establishment and retention of
residential neighborhoods consisting of single household dwellings on very
small lots while preserving the undeveloped lands within this district for
similar types of residential uses.
      (4)   Residential Multi-Household (RMH). It is the purpose of the “RMH”
district to encourage the establishment and retention of varying densities of
residential neighborhoods consisting of multi-household dwellings, two
household dwellings and single household dwellings while preserving the
undeveloped lands within this district for similar types of residential uses.
   (B)   Permitted uses.

of this code.
      (4)   Conditional uses.
         a)   A “C” in a cell indicates that a use may be permitted if approved
through a conditional use permit (see §
153.204: Conditional Use Permits). Conditional uses may be subject to use-
specific standards as identified in the last column of
Table 252-1: Residential Permitted Uses. Conditional uses are subject to all
other applicable regulations of this code.
         b)   The existence or lack of additional use-specific standards in
this code shall not be implied to be the only standards the use is required to
meet. Any use that is permitted as a conditional use shall be subject to the
general review standards for all conditional uses established in §
153.204: Conditional Use Permits.
      (5)   Prohibited uses. A blank cell in
Table 252-1: Residential Permitted Uses indicates that a use is prohibited in
the respective zoning district.
      (6)   Numerical references. The subsections contained in the “Additional
Requirements” column are references to additional standards and requirements
that apply to the use type listed. Standards referenced in the “Additional
Requirements” column apply in all zoning districts unless otherwise expressly
stated.

* It is intended that garages be proportional to both the size of the lot and
the dwelling, and therefore, a garage may have a larger maximum floor area that
does not exceed the average of 2.5% of the lot area and 55% of the area of the
dwelling unit. However, in no instance shall the floor area of the garage
exceed 75% of the area of the dwelling unit.

§ 153.253  NON-RESIDENTIAL ZONING DISTRICTS.
   (A)   Purpose statement. The following are the purpose statements for each
of the city's non-residential zoning districts:
      (1)   Public Facilities (PF). It is the purpose of the “PF” district to
promote the establishment and location of governmental, civic, educational,
welfare, and recreational facilities which provide necessary services to the
city.
      (2)   Office Building (OB). It is the purpose of the “OB” district to
provide appropriate and convenient locations for the provision of professional
and administrative services and similar ancillary uses.
      (3)   General Business (GB). It is the purpose of the “GB” district to
provide appropriate and convenient locations for shopping and convenience goods
and services for the entire community which tend to generate large volumes of
vehicular traffic.
      (4)   Support Services (SS). It is the purpose of the “SS” district to
provide appropriate and convenient locations for service and related types of
minor production and fabricating processes.
      (5)   General Industrial (GI). It is the purpose of the “GI” district to
provide appropriate and convenient locations for the manufacture of products
and processes which normally require a large amount of motor vehicle trucking
and rail services for the transportation of the raw materials and finished
products, but in which dust, smoke, fumes, glare, odors, noise, or other
potentially objectionable influences can be controlled.
   (B)   Permitted Uses.
      (1)   
Table 253-1: Non-Residential Permitted Uses lists the uses allowed within the
non-residential zoning districts.
      (2)   Permitted uses. A “P” in a cell indicates that a use is allowed by-
right in the respective zoning district. Permitted uses are subject to all
other applicable regulations of this code.
      (3)   Permitted uses with standards. A “PS” in a cell indicates that a
use category is allowed by-right in the respective zoning district if it meets
the additional standards set forth in the numerically referenced sections.
Permitted uses with standards are subject to all other applicable regulations
of this code.
      (4)   Conditional uses.
         a)   A “C” in a cell indicates that a use may be permitted if approved
through a conditional use permit (see §
153.204: Conditional Use Permits). Conditional uses may be subject to use-
specific standards as identified in the last column of
Table 253-1: Non-Residential Permitted Uses. Conditional uses are subject to
all other applicable regulations of this code.
         b)   The existence or lack of additional use-specific standards in
this code shall not be implied to be the only standards the use is required to
meet. Any use that is permitted as a conditional use shall be subject to the
general review standards for all conditional uses established in §
153.204(B): Review Factors.
      (5)   Prohibited uses. A blank cell indicates that a use is prohibited in
the respective zoning district.
      (6)   Numerical references. The numbers contained in the “Additional
Requirements” column are references to additional standards and requirements
that apply to the use type listed. Standards referenced in the “Additional
Requirements” column apply in all zoning districts unless otherwise expressly
stated.
   (C)   Table of permitted uses.

§ 153.254  SUPPLEMENTAL DISTRICT REGULATIONS.
   (A)   Cellular or wireless communication standards. Cellular or wireless
communication systems shall be regulated as follows:
      (1)   Intent. In recognition of the quasi-public nature of cellular and/
or wireless communication systems, it is the purpose of these regulations to:
         a)   Accommodate the need for cellular or wireless communication
towers while regulating their location and number in the city.
         b)   Minimize adverse visual effects of communication towers and
support structures through proper siting, design, and screening.
         c)   Avoid potential damage to adjacent properties from communication
towers and support structure failure.
         d)   Encourage the joint use of any new and existing communication
towers and support structures to reduce the number of such structures needed in
the future.
      (2)   Use regulations. The following use regulations shall apply to
cellular or wireless communication antennas and towers:
         a)   A cellular or wireless communications antenna that is mounted to
an existing communications tower (whether said tower is for cellular purposes
or not), smoke stack, water tower, or other tall structure, shall be a
permitted use in all zoning districts. Cellular or wireless communications
antenna may also be located on the top of buildings which are no less than 50
feet in height.
         b)   Any cellular or wireless communications antenna that is mounted
to an existing structure as indicated in a) above shall be painted a color
which matches, or is compatible with, the structure on which it is located.
         c)   A cellular or wireless communications antenna that is not mounted
on an existing structure or is more than 15 feet higher than the structure on
which it is mounted, is permitted in all zoning districts, with the exception
of any single household or multi-household zoning district where it is
prohibited, as a conditional use and subject to the requirements set forth in §
153.204: Conditional Use Permits.
         d)   All other uses accessory to the cellular or wireless
communications antenna and towers including, but not limited to, business
offices, maintenance depots, and materials and vehicle storage, are prohibited
from the site unless otherwise permitted in the zoning district in which the
cellular or wireless communications antenna and/or tower is located.
         e)   Cellular or wireless communications sites shall not be located in
any single household or multi-household residential zoning district nor shall
they be located any closer to any residential zoning district as follows:

      (3)   Standards of approval for conditionally permitted cellular or
wireless communications antennas and towers. The following standards shall
apply to all conditionally permitted cellular or wireless communications
antennas and towers:
         a)   The cellular or wireless communications company shall be required
to demonstrate, using the latest technological evidence, that the antenna or
tower must be placed where it is proposed in order to satisfy its necessary
function in the company’s grid system.
         b)   If the cellular or wireless communications company proposes to
build a cellular or wireless communications tower (as opposed to mounting the
antenna on an existing structure), it is required to demonstrate that it has
contacted the owners of nearby tall structures within a one-mile radius of the
site proposed, asked for permission to install the cellular or wireless
communications antenna on those structures, and was denied for reasons other
than economic ones. Tall structures shall include, but not be limited to: smoke
stacks, water towers, buildings over 50 feet in height, antenna support
structures of other cellular or wireless communication companies, other
communication towers, and roadway lighting poles.
         c)   The city may deny the application to construct a new cellular or
wireless communications tower if the owner or owner’s authorized agent has not
made a good faith effort to mount the antenna on existing structures.
      (4)   Standards of approval of all cellular or wireless communications
antennas and towers.
         a)   Antenna/tower height. The owner or owner’s authorized agent shall
demonstrate that the antenna/tower is the minimum height required to function
satisfactorily. No antenna that is taller than the minimum height shall be
approved.

the PUD District and compatible with other uses in the development plan and
adjoining areas.
         d)   Outdoor advertising devices as regulated by the Ohio Revised
Code.
      (2)   Accessory buildings and uses. Accessory buildings and uses may be
permitted if approved by the Planning Commission as being consistent with the
purposes and provisions of this section.
   (C)   Development standards for all PUDs. The following development
standards are established to guide and control the planning, development, and
use of land in all PUDs located within the City of Springdale:
      (1)   Minimum development area.
         a)   The minimum area to qualify as a PUD area shall be not less than
three contiguous acres.
         b)   A parcel or parcels of land with less than three contiguous acres
may be considered for planned development when it is demonstrated that such
smaller area has a unique feature of geography, topography, or other
development aspect which is determined to be appropriate for such district
designation. The Planning Commission shall review the request and make a
determination on the request.
         c)   Contiguous property of less than three acres may be added to an
adjacent previously established PUD District.
      (2)   Building and use requirements. The main and accessory buildings and
uses shall meet the regulations of the zoning district in which such building
or use would be permitted, and if applicable any adopted plans, in which such
building or use would be permitted unless otherwise permitted or restricted by
the Planning Commission.
      (3)   Setbacks. Along the boundary of any PUD District, each non-
residential and mixed use building shall be set back at least 75 feet from any
residential use or district. Non-residential uses or mixed use buildings that
are adjacent to other non-residential uses or mixed use buildings shall meet
the setback regulations of the zoning district in which such building or use
would be permitted. In a situation where the proposed buildings or uses would
be allowed in multiple zoning districts, the most restrictive setback
regulations shall apply to the PUD development. The Planning Commission may
modify these setback regulations if the development is in conformance with the
provisions and purposes of this section.
      (4)   Density. The overall density of a development area shall conform to
the basic overall density requirements of the zoning district in which such
building or use would be permitted. The Planning Commission may approve a
higher density for proposals if the development is in conformance with the
provisions and purposes of this section.
      (5)   Local circulation system. The vehicular circulation system and
parking facilities shall be designed to fully accommodate vehicular and
pedestrian traffic with safety and efficiency within the development. Driveways
and access points for developments shall be located in areas where traffic can
be controlled and operated in a safe and effective manner. The amount of
traffic generated by commercial uses passing through residential areas shall be
minimized.
      (6)   Signage. Proposed ground signs for the PUD including shopping
center identification signage and subdivision signage shall be included with
the preliminary development plan submittal for review and approval. Wall
signage and any additional development signage including directional signs
shall be submitted with the final development plan submittal for review and
approval. All signage shall conform to the regulations set forth in the Signs
section unless approved by the Planning Commission.
   (D)   Residential PUD development standards.
      (1)   Building and use arrangements. The design and development factors
set forth in this section are intended to provide considerable latitude and
freedom in order to encourage a variety in the arrangement of residential uses
and of the location, bulk and shape of buildings, open space, and landscape
features. Buildings and uses shall be arranged, designed, and located in order
to screen and preserve residential uses from the adverse effects of non-
residential uses and mixed use buildings within or nearby the PUD District. The
buildings and uses may be arranged in various groups, courts, sequences, or
clusters with open spaces organized and related to the buildings in order to
provide privacy, and to form a unified composition of buildings and space, and
to maximize the peace and tranquility of the residential occupants of the PUD
District and the nearby area.  The following design standards shall be met in
Planned Unit Development areas:
         a)   That the adjacent property or properties be protected from loss
of light, air, and view because of the proximity of the bulk or shape of a
neighboring building;
         b)   That usable open spaces be created within a development while
maintaining privacy for individual residential properties;
         c)   That required yards and setbacks should not be excessive so as to
prevent the reasonable development of open land for landscape features,
recreation, or other private uses; and
         d)   That the latitude in design shall also apply to the planning of
landscape features such as walls, fences, hedges and other features to create a
variety of common open spaces and private areas.
      (2)   Topography and site appearance. It is a requirement of this code
that such developments shall be designed to take advantage of the topography of
the land in order to utilize the natural contours, to economize on the
construction of utilities, to reduce the amount of grading, and to maximize the
conservation of trees and top soil. The natural features and other distinctive
characteristics of the site shall be integrated into the plan to create
functional variations in the arrangements of buildings, open spaces, and site
features.
      (3)   Open space.
         a)   In any residential PUD development, the total public or common
space shall be not less than 20 percent of the gross acreage or area of the PUD
area.
         b)   Common open space shall be protected by recorded covenants and
restrictions to assure that such open space will be permanently preserved and
maintained.
         c)   For the purpose of this section, open space is defined as an area
of land or an area of water, or a combination thereof, that is designed for
either environmental, scenic, or recreational purposes. It may include buffer
areas, active and passive recreation areas, wooded areas, water courses, and
similar amenities. Open space shall not include off-street parking areas,
streets, or part of road rights-of-way, except in the case of roadway median in
excess of ten feet in width.
   (E)   Non-residential and mixed use PUD development standards. The following
development standards are established to guide and control the planning,
development, and use of land in non-residential and mixed use PUDs:
      (1)   Building materials. Exterior facades should be constructed with one
or more of the following materials: brick, wood, stone, tile, stucco,
decorative block, decorative concrete panels, fiber cement siding, and/or
transparent materials such as glass or Plexiglas. Additional materials may be
approved by the Planning Commission.
      (2)   Building design. There shall be no uninterrupted lengths of blank
wall longer than 40 feet, for façades that are at least 60 feet wide. This
applies to all elevations visible from road rights-of-way and adjacent
properties. The following techniques may be utilized to implement this
standard:
         a)   Recesses or projections in the wall that are at least two feet in
depth;
         b)   Façade material changes following the same dimensional
requirements; and/or
         c)   Pilasters having a minimum depth of one foot, minimum width of
one foot, and a minimum height of 80 percent of the height of the façade may
also be utilized to accommodate the variation in walls.
      (3)   Franchise architecture. No building or addition constructed in a
PUD district shall be designed with or modeled after franchise or formula based
architecture, unless the Planning Commission determines that the franchise
architecture is consistent with the intent of the district based on a
determination that the proposed building:
         a)   Substantially meets the overall intent of the district
guidelines;
         b)   Does not create visual inconsistencies with surrounding areas or
structures in relation to colors and materials; and
         c)   Will enhance the character and business climate of the area.
      (4)   Windows. All building elevations visible from road rights-of-way
shall include window openings at regular intervals. The main front elevation of
a building should include at least 35 percent transparency at the pedestrian
level, 15 feet in height or the height of the building, whichever is less.
      (5)   Open space. In any non-residential or mixed use PUD development,
the total public or common space shall meet the regulations of the zoning
district in which such building or use would be permitted. In a situation where
the proposed buildings or uses would be allowed in multiple zoning districts,
the most restrictive open space regulation shall apply to the PUD development.

§ 153.256  TRANSITION OVERLAY DISTRICT.
   (A)   Purpose statement. The purpose of the Transition Overlay District
(hereinafter referred to as “T-District”) regulations is to institute
procedures, whereby the Planning Commission and City Council may determine the
most appropriate type and intensity of land use in transitional areas by:
      (1)   Providing a flexible instrument which governs development by the
factors of intensity and impacts of a use rather than its general nature.
      (2)   Providing adequate buffering for the protection of residential uses
from the adverse impact of less restrictive districts.
      (3)   Protecting and enhancing the environmental, cultural, aesthetics,
and historic assets of the community through careful planning in the design and
arrangement of buildings, preservation of open space, and the optimal
utilization of natural site features.
      (4)   Permitting the creation of transitional zones within the city that
provide for the orderly transition from more restrictive to less restrictive
districts.
      (5)   Providing flexibility for an appropriate development in such
transitional zones, taking into account adjacent and surrounding uses and
zoning districts.
      (6)   Allowing the application of performance standards to development in
transitional areas, so as to facilitate the consideration of a broader spectrum
of appropriate land uses than permitted by conventional districting.
      (7)   Securing optimal development of critically important parcels in
transitional areas where the harmonization of a more restrictive district with
a less restrictive district is a major objective.
      (8)   Promoting the public health, safety, and welfare of the city.

§ 153.257  ROUTE 4 CORRIDOR REVIEW DISTRICT.
   (A)   Purpose statement. The purpose of the Route 4 Corridor Review District
(CRD) is to implement the objectives of the adopted master plan for this
corridor which include:
      (1)   The Route 4 corridor will contain the original village core of
Springdale as well as the north and south entries to the core. Future
development and redevelopment within this corridor should both protect and
enhance historical and modern day features of the area that are or can be a
source of community identity and pride.
      (2)   The Route 4 corridor serves as one of the major entryways into
Springdale. Developments within this corridor shall be attractive, well-
maintained, and representative of the high standard of development that
Springdale strives to achieve with both new and redevelopment projects.
      (3)   Developments within the Route 4 district shall respect adjacent
developments and be of a similar character and scale as those adjacent
developments. Special considerations shall be made to developments adjacent to
residential neighborhoods to ensure compatible land uses and adequate buffering
between residential and non-residential use developments.
      (4)   Within the Route 4 corridor there are four distinct subareas, or
segments, each having unique physical characteristics. Many of these will add
significantly to the aesthetic as well as functional qualities of the total
district. It is also the purpose of these regulations to identify, protect and
enhance the appropriate functional and aesthetic characteristics of each
subarea within the corridor.
   (B)   District boundaries. The Route 4 Corridor Review District (CRD) shall
include all of those properties as established on the city's zoning map.
   (C)   Development standards. The Route 4 Corridor Review District (CRD)
establishes special regulations and development standards that either augment
or supersede those development standards otherwise in force through the
underlying zoning districts within the corridor. The following development
standards shall apply to all four subareas within the CRD:
      (1)   Building materials.
         a)   All buildings and structures to be constructed within the CRD
shall have an equal level of finish on all sides and shall generally utilize no
more than two primary materials with one or two accent materials.
         b)   The primary building materials shall be brick and/or stone which
shall not be painted or stained.
         c)   A traditional architectural style that respects the character of
adjacent residential neighborhoods shall be utilized where applicable.
         d)   Minor accenting of a structure or the use of a third building
material may be permitted.
      (2)   Building color.
         a)   One coordinated color scheme shall be utilized for all
structures. Said color scheme shall have a predominant color and may use
additional colors to accent, demark, or otherwise provide interest or to
achieve a more compatible scale for the individual structure.
         b)   Building colors shall primarily consist of earth tones and the
use of bright, high chroma shades as dominant building colors shall be
prohibited.
         c)   The use of non-earth tone accent colors on a building shall be
limited to a maximum of 10 percent of any elevation including features on an
elevation (columns, archways, canopies, etc.).
         d)   Pitched roofs shall be generally dark in color and non-
reflective.
      (3)   Building design.
         a)   There shall be no uninterrupted length of blank walls longer than
40 feet, for facades that are at least 60 feet wide. This applies to all
elevations visible from road rights-of-way and adjacent properties. This can be
achieved by:
            i)   Recesses or projections in the wall that are at least two feet
in depth;
            ii)   Façade material changes following the same dimensional
requirements; and/or

         a)   Any new structures.
         b)   Non-residential additions over 10 percent of the original floor
area or additions exceeding 2,000 square feet, whichever is less.
         c)   A change in use which results in a more intense use occupying the
subject property or space. For the intent of this section, a more intense use
is defined by either a 10 percent increase in parking demand due to the change
in use, an increased impact due to potential traffic generation, noise, smoke,

conditions shall not be in conflict with the promotion of the public health,
safety, and general welfare of the city or the purpose and objectives of the
CRD.
      (4)   For those properties within the district undergoing a rezoning or
conditional use consideration, the CRD application review is intended to be
parallel to and a normal part of the overall review process. However, the city
may elect, at its option, to review and determine rezonings and conditional use
applications. The CRD approval must be secured prior to the issuance of a
certificate of occupancy for any such use within the district.
      (5)   Application and review by the Planning Commission shall be in
accordance with §
153.203: Development Plan Review.
      (6)   Appeals. Any decision of the Planning Commission regarding an

provisions, and regulations, shall be permitted to continue. However, any
maintenance, repair, and restoration may be made only in accordance with and to
the extent of the regulations provided in the Nonconformities section. Any
maintenance, repair, restoration, alteration, or extensions of a structure or
use in excess of that permitted in the Nonconformities section shall comply
with the standards, provisions, and regulations of the CRD.

nearest intersecting street.
      (4)   Parking areas of more than 20 spaces shall have two two-way access
driveways located at least 50 feet from the right-of-way line of the nearest
intersecting street.
      (5)   All access drives shall have travel lanes of a minimum width of ten
feet and a maximum width of 12 feet.
      (6)   The angle of intersection between the driveway and the street shall
be between 70 degrees and 90 degrees. The radius of the driveway apron shall be
at least 20 feet.
      (7)   With the exception of driveways serving single household dwellings
and two household dwellings, wherever more than three parking spaces are served
by a single driveway, a turnaround area shall be provided, or other provision
shall be made to permit vehicles to exit the parking lot or garage without
backing onto any street or sidewalk.
      (8)   Cross-access is encouraged between adjacent commercial properties;
therefore, parking lots for nonresidential developments that have direct access
to a public street shall have at least one vehicular connection to adjacent
properties unless deemed infeasible or inappropriate due to topography or other
constraints by planning commission. Lots in the General Industrial "GI" zoning
district are exempt from this interconnectivity requirement.

stone.
      (3)   Off-street parking areas and residential driveways may be
constructed of pervious pavement if approved by the City Engineer.
   (K)   Curbing. Off-street parking lots shall be improved with a poured
concrete curb, precast concrete barrier, or other approved barrier to define
the limits of paved areas except at the points of entrance and exit. Wherever a
parking lot extends to a property line, fencing, wheel stops, concrete curbs,
or other suitable barriers shall be provided in order to prevent any part of a
parked vehicle from extending beyond the property line and from destroying
screening materials.
   (L)   Drainage. Off-street parking areas for more than five vehicles shall
be graded and drained so that the natural flow of surface water shall not be
changed or concentrated onto adjacent property by means other than a designated
drainage course.
   (M)   Visibility.
      (1)   Access of driveways for off-street parking areas shall be located
in such a way that any vehicle entering or leaving such parking area shall be
clearly visible by any pedestrian or motorist approaching the access or
driveway from a public street, private street, or alley.
      (2)   No object, including parking lot lighting, signage, or landscaping
shall be located in an area that obstructs vision in the sight triangles as
specified in §
153.254(D): Sight Visibility Triangle.
   (N)   Maintenance. Any owner of property used for off-street parking areas
shall maintain such areas in good condition in accordance with the property
maintenance code of the City of Springdale.
   (O)   Rules for computation. The following rules shall apply when computing
parking, loading, or stacking spaces:
      (1)   When floor area is designated as the standard for determining
parking space requirements, floor area shall be the sum of the net leasable
horizontal area of all floors of a non-residential building.
      (2)   Where seating capacity is designated as the standard for
determining parking space requirements, the capacity shall mean the number of
seating units as determined by the Building Official.
      (3)   Where the required parking is determined by the number of
employees, the maximum number of employees on duty on the premises at one time
or any two successive shifts, whichever is greater, shall be used.
      (4)   When determination of the number of required spaces results in the

Notes:
   1)  (A, B, C, D, or E) means plantings from the list(s) in parentheses in §
153.407: Plant Lists.
   2)  O.C. means on center unless otherwise noted.
   3)  Two household and single household dwellings are both permitted in the
RMH district. No landscaping is
       required between these uses when both exist side by side within the RMH
zone district.
 
      (2)   An applicant may propose to group required landscaping in the
bufferyard in order to create vision corridors for signage, building, or access
visibility, or for other similar reasons. Grouping of landscaping does not
allow for a reduction in the number of required plant materials, only an
alteration to the lineal on center planting requirements. Grouping of
landscaping is also not allowed when screening is required.
      (3)   Existing vegetation, fences, walls, or berms on a parcel may be
counted toward the requirements for any required bufferyard provided that it
meets the standards established in §
153.403: Landscape Materials and Standards.
(Ord. 4-2016, passed 3-2-16; Am. Ord. 36-2017, passed 9-20-17)
§ 153.405  MAINTENANCE.
   (A)   All landscaping materials shall be installed and maintained according
to accepted nursery industry procedures.
   (B)   All bufferyards and landscape areas, once approved by the Planning
Commission and established by the owner, may not be used, disturbed or altered
for any purpose unless specifically approved by the city.
   (C)   The owner of the property shall be responsible for the continued
property maintenance of all landscaping materials, and shall keep them in
proper, neat, and orderly appearance, free from refuse and debris at all times.
   (D)   All unhealthy or dead plant material shall be replaced within six
months, or by the next planting period, whichever comes first, by plant
material similar in type to that which was removed.
   (E)   Violation of these installation and maintenance provisions shall be
grounds for the Building Official to refuse a building occupancy permit,
require replacement of the landscape materials, or institute legal proceedings
to enforce the provisions of this section.
(Ord. 4-2016, passed 3-2-16)
§ 153.406  MODIFICATIONS.
   (A)   The Planning Commission may approve modifications to the landscaping
and bufferyard requirements. The Commission shall base its decision on all of
the following factors:
      (1)   The specific conditions which are unique to the applicant's land.
      (2)   The manner in which the strict application of the provisions of
this section would deprive the applicant of a reasonable use of the land in a
manner equivalent to the use permitted other landowners in the same zone.
      (3)   The unique conditions and circumstances are not the result of
actions of the applicant subsequent to the adoption of this section.
      (4)   Reasons that the modification shall preserve, not harm, the public
safety and welfare, and shall not alter the essential character of the
neighborhood.
      (5)   A demonstration that the applicant has provided for a buffer that
achieves the spirit of this section.
   (B)   The Planning Commission may also approve the use of existing trees
within the proposed bufferyard area if the tree is not included on the plant
lists in §
153.407: Plant Lists, if native and hardy to zones 5-6 of the United States
Department of Agriculture Plant Hardiness Zone Map.
(Ord. 4-2016, passed 3-2-16)
§ 153.407  PLANT LISTS.
   The list of plants in
Table 407-1: Plant List shall be used for
Table 404-1: Landscape and Bufferyard Requirements.
   (A)   Species of plant material. To meet the requirements, plants shall be
species listed in the required groups or shall be otherwise identified as
appropriate for this region by a licensed landscape architect or certified
horticulturist and approved by the city.
   (B)   Recommended plant list.

GENERAL PROVISIONS
§ 154.01  FINDINGS OF FACT.
   The City of Springdale has special flood hazard areas that are subject to
periodic inundation which may result in loss of life and property, health and
safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary
public expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax
base.  Additionally, structures that are inadequately elevated, floodproofed,
or otherwise protected from flood damage also contribute to the flood loss.  In
order to minimize the threat of such damages and to achieve the purposes
hereinafter set forth, these regulations are adopted.
(Ord. 18-2004, passed 5-5-04)
§ 154.02  STATEMENT OF PURPOSE.

responsibility for their actions;
   (H)   Minimize the impact of development on adjacent properties within and
near flood prone areas;

of the floodplain;
   (K)   Prevent floodplain uses that are either hazardous or environmentally
incompatible; and

Insurance Program.
(Ord. 18-2004, passed 5-5-04)
§ 154.03  METHODS OF REDUCING FLOOD LOSS.
   In order to accomplish its purposes, these regulations include methods and
provisions for:
   (A)   Restricting or prohibiting uses which are dangerous to health, safety,
and property due to water hazards, or which result in damaging increases in
flood heights or velocities;
   (B)   Requiring that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which
serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction;
   (C)   Controlling the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels,
and natural protective barriers, which help accommodate or channel flood
waters;
   (D)   Controlling filling, grading, dredging, excavating, and other
development which may increase flood damage; and,
   (E)   Preventing or regulating the construction of flood barriers which will
unnaturally divert flood waters or which may increase flood hazards in other
areas.
(Ord. 18-2004, passed 5-5-04)

   BASE (100-YEAR) FLOOD ELEVATION (BFE).  The water surface elevation of the
base flood in relation to a specified datum, usually the National Geodetic
Vertical Datum of 1929 or the North American Vertical Datum of 1988, and
usually expressed in Feet Mean Sea Level (MSL).
   BASEMENT.  Any area of the building having its floor subgrade (below ground
level) on all sides.
   DEVELOPMENT.  Any manmade change to improved or unimproved real estate,
including but not limited to buildings or other structures, mining, dredging,
filling, grading, paving, excavation or drilling operations or storage of
equipment or materials.
   ENCLOSURE BELOW THE LOWEST FLOOR.  See LOWEST FLOOR. 
   EXECUTIVE ORDER 11988 (FLOODPLAIN MANAGEMENT).  Issued by President Carter
in 1977, this order requires that no federally assisted activities be conducted
in or have the potential to affect identified special flood hazard areas,
unless there is no practicable alternative.
   FEDERAL EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT AGENCY (FEMA).  The agency with the overall
responsibility for administering the National Flood Insurance Program.
   FILL.  A deposit of earth material placed by artificial means.
   FLOOD or FLOODING.  A general and temporary condition of partial or complete
inundation of normally dry land areas from:
      (1)   The overflow of inland or tidal waters, and/or
      (2)   The unusual and rapid accumulation or runoff of surface waters from
any source.
   FLOOD INSURANCE RATE MAP (FIRM).  An official map on which the Federal
Emergency Management Agency has delineated the areas of special flood hazard.
   FLOOD INSURANCE RISK ZONES.  Zone designations on FIRMs that indicate the
magnitude of the flood hazard in specific areas of a community.  Following are
the zone definitions:
      Zone A:  Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year flood; base
flood elevations are not determined.
      Zone AE:  Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year flood;
base flood elevations are determined.
      Zone X (unshaded):  Areas determined to be outside the 500-year
floodplain.
   FLOOD INSURANCE STUDY (FIS).  The official report in which the Federal
Emergency Management Agency has provided flood profiles, floodway boundaries
(sometimes shown on Flood Boundary and Floodway Maps), and the water surface
elevations of the base flood.
   FLOOD PROTECTION ELEVATION.  The Flood Protection Elevation, or FPE, is the
base flood elevation plus one foot of freeboard.  In areas where no base flood
elevations exist from any authoritative source, the flood protection elevation
can be historical flood elevations, or base flood elevations determined and/or
approved by the floodplain administrator.
   FLOODWAY.  A floodway is the channel of a river or other watercourse and the
adjacent land areas that have been reserved in order to pass the base flood
discharge.  A floodway is typically determined through a hydraulic and
hydrologic engineering analysis such that the cumulative increase in the water
surface elevation of the base flood discharge is no more than a designated
height.  In no case shall the designated height be more than 0 feet at any
point within the community.  The floodway is an extremely hazardous area, and
is usually characterized by any of the following:  Moderate to high velocity
flood waters, high potential for debris and projectile impacts, and moderate to
high erosion forces.
   FREEBOARD.  A factor of safety usually expressed in feet above a flood level
for the purposes of floodplain management. Freeboard tends to compensate for
the many unknown factors that could contribute to flood heights greater than
the height calculated for a selected size flood and floodway conditions, such
as wave action, obstructed bridge openings, debris and ice jams, and the
hydrologic effect of urbanization in a watershed.
   HISTORIC STRUCTURE. Any structure that is:
      (1)   Listed individually in the National Register of Historic Places (a
listing maintained by the U.S. Department of Interior) or preliminarily
determined by the Secretary of the Interior as meeting the requirements for
individual listings on the National Register;
      (2)   Certified or preliminarily determined by the Secretary of the
Interior as contributing to the historical significance of a registered
historic district or a district preliminarily determined by the Secretary to
qualify as a registered historic district; or
      (3)   Individually listed on the State of Ohio's inventory of historic
places maintained by the Ohio Historic Preservation Office.
   HYDROLOGIC AND HYDRAULIC ENGINEERING ANALYSIS.  An analysis performed by a
professional engineer, registered in the State of Ohio, in accordance with
standard engineering practices as accepted by FEMA, used to determine flood
elevations and/or floodway boundaries.
   LETTER OF MAP CHANGE (LOMC).  A Letter of Map Change is an official FEMA
determination, by letter, to amend or revise effective Flood Insurance Rate
Maps, Flood Boundary and Floodway Maps, and Flood Insurance Studies.  LOMC's
are broken down into the following categories:
      LETTER OF MAP AMENDMENT (LOMA).  A revision based on technical data
showing that a property was incorrectly included in a designated special flood
hazard area.  A LOMA amends the current effective Flood Insurance Rate Map and
establishes that a specific property is not located in a special flood hazard
area.
      LETTER OF MAP REVISION (LOMR).  A revision based on technical data that,
usually due to manmade changes, shows changes to flood zones, flood elevations,
floodplain and floodway delineations, and planimetric features.  One common
type of LOMR, a LOMR-F, is a determination concerning whether a structure or
parcel has been elevated by fill above the base flood elevation and is,
therefore, excluded from the special flood hazard area.
      CONDITIONAL LETTER OF MAP REVISION (CLOMR).  A formal review and comment
by FEMA as to whether a proposed project complies with the minimum National
Flood Insurance Program floodplain management criteria.  A CLOMR does not amend
or revise effective Flood Insurance Rate Maps, Flood Boundary and Floodway
Maps, or Flood Insurance Studies.
   LOWEST FLOOR.  The lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area (including
basement) of a structure.  This definition excludes an "enclosure below the
lowest floor" which is an unfinished or flood resistant enclosure usable solely
for parking of vehicles, building access or storage, in an area other than a
basement area, provided that such enclosure is built in accordance with the
applicable design requirements specified in these regulations for enclosures
below the lowest floor.
   NATIONAL FLOOD INSURANCE PROGRAM (NFIP).  The NFIP is a federal program
enabling property owners in participating communities to purchase insurance
protection against losses from flooding.  This insurance is designed to provide
an insurance alternative to disaster assistance to meet the escalating costs of
repairing damage to buildings and their contents caused by floods. 
Participation in the NFIP is based on an agreement between local communities
and the Federal government that states if a community will adopt and enforce
floodplain management regulations to reduce future flood risks to all
development in special flood hazard areas, the federal government will make
flood insurance available within the community as a financial protection
against flood loss.
   NEW CONSTRUCTION.  Structures for which the "start of construction"
commenced on or after the initial effective date of the City of Springdale's
FIRM, dated December 5, 1990, and includes any subsequent improvements to such
structures.
   PERSON.  Includes any individual or group of individuals, corporation,
partnership, association, or any other entity, including state and local
governments and agencies. An agency is further defined in the R.C. §
111.15 as any governmental entity of the state and includes, but is not limited
to, any board, department, division, commission, bureau, society, council,
institution, state college or university, community college district, technical
college district, or state community college.  "Agency" does not include the
general assembly, the controlling board, the adjutant general's department, or
any court.
   REGISTERED PROFESSIONAL ARCHITECT.  A person registered to engage in the
practice of architecture under the provisions of R.C. §§ 4703.01 to 4703.19.
   REGISTERED PROFESSIONAL ENGINEER.  A person registered as a professional
engineer under R.C. Chapter 4733.
   REGISTERED PROFESSIONAL SURVEYOR.  A person registered as a professional
surveyor under R.C. Chapter 4733.
   SPECIAL FLOOD HAZARD AREA.  Also known as AREAS OF SPECIAL FLOOD HAZARD, it
is the land in the floodplain subject to a 1% or greater chance of flooding in
any given year.  SPECIAL FLOOD HAZARD AREAS are designated by the Federal
Emergency Management Agency on Flood Insurance Rate Maps, Flood Insurance
Studies, Flood Boundary and Floodway Maps and Flood Hazard Boundary Maps as
Zones A, and AE.  SPECIAL FLOOD HAZARD AREAS may also refer to areas that are
flood prone and designated from other federal state or local sources of data
including but not limited to historical flood information reflecting high water
marks, previous flood inundation areas, and flood prone soils associated with a
watercourse.
   START OF CONSTRUCTION.  The date the building permit was issued, provided
the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation,
addition, placement, or other improvement was within 180 days of the permit
date.  The actual start means either the first placement of permanent
construction of a structure on a site, such as the pouring of slab or footings,
the installation of piles, the construction of columns, or any work beyond the
stage of excavation; or the placement of a manufactured home on a foundation. 
Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as clearing,
grading and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets and/or
walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings, piers, or
foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the
installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds
not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main structure.  For a
substantial improvement, the actual start of construction means the first
alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building,
whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of a building.
   STRUCTURE.  A walled and roofed building, manufactured home, or gas or
liquid storage tank that is principally above ground.
   SUBSTANTIAL DAMAGE.  Damage of any origin sustained by a structure whereby
the cost of restoring the structure to its before damaged condition would equal
or exceed 50% of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred.
   SUBSTANTIAL IMPROVEMENT.  Any reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, or
other improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds 50% of
the market value of the structure before the "start of construction" of the
improvement.  This term includes structures which have incurred "substantial
damage", regardless of the actual repair work performed.  The term does not,
however, include:
      (1)   Any improvement to a structure which is considered "new
construction";
      (2)   Any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing
violations of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications
which have been identified prior to the application for a development permit by
the local code enforcement official and which are the minimum necessary to
assure safe living conditions; or
      (3)   Any alteration of a "historic structure," provided that the
alteration will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a
"historic structure".
   VARIANCE.  A grant of relief from the standards of these regulations
consistent with the variance conditions herein.
   VIOLATION.  The failure of a structure or other development to be fully
compliant with these regulations.

§ 154.17  MAP MAINTENANCE ACTIVITIES.
   To meet national flood insurance program minimum requirements to have flood
data reviewed and approved by FEMA, and to ensure that City of Springdale flood
maps, studies and other data identified in §
154.05 accurately represent flooding conditions so appropriate floodplain
management criteria are based on current data, the following map maintenance
activities are identified:
   (A)   Requirement to submit new technical data.
      (1)   For all development proposals that impact floodway delineations or
base flood elevations, the community shall ensure that technical data
reflecting such changes be submitted to FEMA within six months of the date such
information becomes available.  These development proposals include:
         (a)   Floodway encroachments that increase or decrease base flood
elevations or alter floodway boundaries;
         (b)   Fill sites to be used for the placement of proposed structures
where the applicant desires to remove the site from the special flood hazard
area;
         (c)   Alteration of watercourses that result in a relocation or
elimination of the special flood hazard area, including the placement of
culverts; and
         (d)   Subdivision or large scale development proposals requiring the
establishment of base flood elevations in accordance with §
154.20(C).
      (2)   It is the responsibility of the applicant to have technical data,
required in accordance with §
154.17(A), prepared in a format required for a conditional letter of map
revision or letter of map revision, and submitted to FEMA.  Submittal and
processing fees for these map revisions shall be the responsibility of the
applicant.
      (3)   The Floodplain Administrator shall require a conditional letter of
map revisions prior to the issuance of a floodplain development permit for:
         (a)   Proposed floodway encroachments that increase the base flood
elevation; and
         (b)   Proposed development which increases the base flood elevation by
any amount in areas where FEMA has provided base flood elevations but no
floodway.
      (4)   Floodplain development permits issued by the Floodplain
Administrator shall be conditioned upon the applicant obtaining a Letter of Map
Revision from FEMA for any development proposal subject to §
154.17(A)(1).
   (B)   Right to submit new technical data.  The Floodplain Administrator may
request changes to any of the information shown on an effective map that does
not impact floodplain or floodway delineations or base flood elevations, such
as labeling or planimetric details.  Such a submission shall include
appropriate supporting documentation made in writing by the Mayor of the City
of Springdale, and may be submitted at any time.
   (C)   Annexation/Detachment.  Upon occurrence, the Floodplain Administrator
shall notify FEMA in writing whenever the boundaries of the City of Springdale
have been modified by annexation or the community has assumed authority over an
area, or no longer has authority to adopt and enforce floodplain management
regulations for a particular area.  In order that the City of Springdale Flood
Insurance Rate Map accurately represent the City of Springdale boundaries,
include within such notification a copy of a map of the City of Springdale
suitable for reproduction, clearly showing the new corporate limits or the new
area for which the City of Springdale has assumed or relinquished floodplain
management regulatory authority.
(Ord. 18-2004, passed 5-5-04)
§ 154.18  DATA USE AND FLOOD MAP INTERPRETATION.
   The following guidelines shall apply to the use and interpretation of maps
and other data showing areas of special flood hazard:
   (A)   In areas where FEMA has not identified special flood hazard areas, or
in FEMA identified special flood hazard areas where base flood elevation and
floodway data have not been identified, the Floodplain Administrator shall
review and reasonably utilize any other flood hazard data available from a
federal, state, or other source.
   (B)   Base flood elevations and floodway boundaries produced on FEMA flood
maps and studies shall take precedence over base flood elevations and floodway
boundaries by any other source that reflect a reduced floodway width and/or
lower base flood elevations. Other sources of data, showing increased base
flood elevations and/or larger floodway areas than are shown on FEMA flood maps
and studies, shall be reasonably used by the Floodplain Administrator.
   (C)   When preliminary flood insurance rate maps and/or flood insurance
study have been provided by FEMA:
      (1)   Upon the issuance of a letter of final determination by the FEMA,
the preliminary flood hazard data shall be used and replace all previously
existing flood hazard data provided from FEMA for the purposes of administering
these regulations.
      (2)   Prior to the issuance of a letter of final determination by FEMA,
the use of preliminary flood hazard data shall only be required where no base
flood elevations and/or floodway areas exist or where the preliminary base
flood elevations of floodway area exceed the base flood elevations and/or
floodway widths in existing flood hazard data provided from FEMA.  Such
preliminary data may be subject to change and/or appeal to FEMA.
   (D)   The Floodplain Administrator shall make interpretations, where needed,
as to the exact location of the flood boundaries and areas of special flood
hazard.  A person contesting the determination of the location of the boundary
shall be given a reasonable opportunity to appeal the interpretation as
provided in §
154.22, Appeals and Variances.
   (E)   Where a map boundary showing an area of special flood hazard and field
elevations disagree, the base flood elevations of flood protection elevations
(as found on an elevation profile, floodway data table, established high water
marks, etc.) shall prevail.
(Ord. 18-2004, passed 5-5-04)
§ 154.19  SUBSTANTIAL DAMAGE DETERMINATIONS.
   (A)   Damages to structures may result from a variety of causes including
tornado, wind, heavy snow, flood, fire, etc.  After such a damage event, the
Floodplain Administrator shall:
      (1)   Determine whether damages structures are located in special flood
hazard areas;
      (2)   Conduct substantial damage determinations for damaged structures
located in special flood hazard areas; and
      (3)   Make reasonable attempt to notify owners of substantially damaged
structures of the need to obtain a floodplain development permit prior to
repair, rehabilitation, or reconstruction.
   (B)   Additionally, the Floodplain Administrator may implement other
measures to assist with the substantial damage determination and subsequent
repair process.  These measures include issuing press releases, public service
announcements, and other public information materials related to the floodplain
development permits and repair of damages structures; coordinating with other
federal, state, and local agencies to assist with substantial damage
determinations; providing owners of damaged structures materials and other
information related to the proper repair of damaged structures in special flood
hazard areas; and assist owners of substantially damaged structures with
increased cost of compliance insurance claims.

§ 154.21  ASSURANCE OF FLOOD CARRYING CAPACITY.
   Pursuant to the purpose and methods of reducing flood damage stated in these
regulations, the following additional standards are adopted to assure that the
reduction of the flood carrying capacity of watercourses is minimized:
   (A)   Development in floodways.
      (1)   In floodway areas, development shall cause no increase in flood
levels during the occurrence of the base flood discharge.  Prior to issuance of
a floodplain development permit, the applicant must submit a hydrologic and
hydraulic analysis, conducted by a registered professional engineer,
demonstrating that the proposed development would not result in any increase in
the base flood elevation; or
      (2)   Development in floodway areas causing increases in the base flood
elevation may be permitted provided all of the following are completed by the
applicant:
         (a)   Meet the requirements to submit technical data in §
154.17(A);
         (b)   An evaluation of alternatives which would not result in
increased base flood elevations and an explanation why these alternatives are
not feasible;
         (c)   Certification that no structures are located in areas which
would be impacted by the increased base flood elevation;
         (d)   Documentation of individual legal notices to all impacted
property owners within and outside the community, explaining the impact of the
proposed action on their property; and
         (e)   Concurrence of the Mayor of the City of Springdale and the Chief
Executive Officer of any other communities impacted by the proposed actions.
   (B)   Development in riverine areas with base flood elevations but no
floodways.
      (1)   In riverine special flood hazard areas identified by FEMA where
base flood elevation data are provided but no floodways have been designated,
the cumulative effect of any proposed development, when combined with all other
existing and anticipated development, shall not increase the base flood
elevation at any point.  Prior to issuance of a floodplain development permit,
the applicant must submit a hydrologic and hydraulic analysis, conducted by a
registered professional engineer, demonstrating that this standard has been
met; or,
      (2)   Development in riverine special flood hazard areas identified by
FEMA where base flood elevation data are provided but no floodways have been
designated causing an increase in the base flood elevation may be permitted
provided all of the following are completed by the applicant:
         (a)   An evaluation of alternatives which would result in no increase
of the base flood elevation and an explanation why these alternatives are not
feasible;
         (b)   Section 154.21(A)(2)(a), (c), (d) and (e).
   (C)   Alterations of a watercourse.  For the purpose of these regulations, a
watercourse is altered when any change occurs within its banks.  The extent of
the banks shall be established by a field determination of the "bankfull
stage."  The field determination of "bankfull stage" shall be based on methods
presented in Chapter 7 of the "USDA Forest Service General Technical Report RM-
245, Stream Channel Reference Sites: An Illustrated Guide to Field Technique"
or other applicable publication available from a federal, state, or other
authoritative source.  For all proposed developments that alter a watercourse,
the following standards apply:
      (1)   The bankfull flood carrying capacity of the altered or relocated
portion of the watercourse shall not be diminished.  Prior to the issuance of a
floodplain development permit, the applicant must submit a description of the
extent to which any watercourse will be altered or relocated as a result of the
proposed development, and certification by a registered professional engineer
that the bankfull flood carrying capacity of the watercourse will not be
diminished.
      (2)   Adjacent communities, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, and the
Ohio Department of Natural Resources, Division of Water, must be notified prior
to any alteration or relocation of a watercourse.  Evidence of such
notification must be submitted to the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
      (3)   The applicant shall be responsible for providing the necessary
maintenance for the altered or relocated portion of said watercourse so that
the flood carrying capacity will not be diminished.  The Floodplain
Administrator may require the permit holder to enter into an agreement with
City of Springdale specifying the maintenance responsibilities.  If an
agreement is required, it shall be made a condition of the floodplain
development permit.
      (4)   The applicant shall meet the requirements to submit technical data
in §
154.17(A)(1)(c) when an alteration of a watercourse results in the relocation
or elimination of the special flood hazard area, including the placement of
culverts.
(Ord. 18-2004, passed 5-5-04)
§ 154.22  APPEALS AND VARIANCES.
   (A)   Appeals Board.
      (1)   The Board of Housing, Building and Fire Appeals as established by
Council shall hear and decide appeals and requests for variances from the
requirements of this chapter and that to that extent the power of such Board as
provided in §
36.31 are expanded.
      (2)   The Board shall hear and decide appeals when it is alleged there is
an error in any requirement, decision or determination made by the Mayor
through the appropriate city official in the enforcement or administration of
this chapter.
      (3)   Those aggrieved by the decision of the Board or any taxpayer, may
appeal such decision to the Hamilton County Court of Common Pleas, as provided
in R.C. Chapter 2506.
   (B)   Board action.
      (1)   In passing upon such applications, the Board shall consider and
make findings of fact on all technical evaluations, all relevant factors,
standards specified in other sections of the chapter, and the following
factors:
         (a)   The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the
injury of others.
         (b)   The danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion
damage.
         (c)   The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to
flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner.
         (d)   The importance of the services provided by the proposed facility
to the community.
         (e)   The availability of alternative locations for the proposed use
which are not subject to flooding or erosion damage.
         (f)   The necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where
applicable.
         (g)   The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and
anticipated development.
         (h)   The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan
and floodplain management program for that area.
         (i)   The safety of access to the property in times of flood for
ordinary and emergency vehicles.
         (j)   The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise, and
sediment transport of the flood waters and the effects of wave action, if
applicable, expected at the site.
         (k)   The costs of providing governmental services during and after
flood conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities and
facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water systems, and streets and
bridges.
      (2)   Variances shall only be issued upon:
         (a)   A showing of good and sufficient cause.
         (b)   A determination that failure to grant the variance would result
in exceptional hardship due to the physical characteristics of the property. 
Increased cost or inconvenience of meeting the requirements of these
regulations does not constitute an exceptional hardship to the applicant.
         (c)   A determination that the granting of a variance will not result
in increased flood heights beyond that which is allowed in these regulations;
additional threats to public safety; extraordinary public expense, nuisances,
fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local laws.
         (d)   A determination that the structure or other development is
protected by methods to minimize flood damages.
         (e)   A determination that the variance is the minimum necessary,
considering the flood hazard, to afford relief.
         (f)   Upon consideration of the above factors and the purposes of
these regulations, the Appeals Board may attach such conditions to the granting
of variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes of these
regulations.
      (3)   Other conditions for variances.
         (a)   Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if
any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.
         (b)   Generally, variances may be issued for new construction and
substantial improvements to be erected on a lot of one-half acre or less in
size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed
below the base flood level, providing items in §
154.22(B)(1) (a) to (k) have been fully considered.  As the lot size increases
beyond one-half acre, the technical justification required for issuing the
variance increases.
         (c)   Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given
written notice that the structure will be permitted to be built with a lowest
floor elevation below the base flood elevation and the cost of flood insurance
will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the reduced lowest
floor elevation.
(Ord. 18-2004, passed 5-5-04)
§ 154.23  ENFORCEMENT.
   (A)   Compliance required.
      (1)   No structure or land shall hereafter be located, erected,
constructed, reconstructed, repaired, extended, converted, enlarged or altered

applicable regulations which apply to uses within the jurisdiction of these
regulations, unless specifically exempted from filing for a development permit
as stated in §
154.16(F).
      (2)   Failure to obtain a floodplain development permit shall be a
violation of these regulations and shall be punishable in accordance with §
154.99.
      (3)   Floodplain development permits issued on the basis of plans and
applications approved by the Floodplain Administrator authorize only the use,
and arrangement, set forth in such approved plans and applications or
amendments thereto.  Use, arrangement, or construction contrary to that

§ 155.111  MINIMUM STANDARDS FOR EFFECTIVE BOARDING.
   (A)   The effective boarding of a building shall include, but not be limited
to, doors, windows or other areas open to ingress and egress and to weather
elements.  Such openings shall be secured by exterior grade plywood, not less
than one-half inch (½") thick, or other material of equal strength, cut and fit
into the openings.  Openings in excess of forty-eight inches (48") wide shall
be framed with two inch by four inch (2" x 4") lumber and plywood, or
equivalent material fastened twenty-four inches (24") on center onto frame. 
The plywood or equivalent material shall be fastened into the openings by screw
type nails or lag screws and painted to match the exterior color scheme.
   (B)   Any portion of the exterior which is deemed to be potentially
hazardous due to deteriorated conditions, or to be structurally unsound shall
be removed or treated in such a manner so as to eliminate the hazard.  The
exterior premises shall be maintained free of high weeds, debris, junk, junk
vehicles and any other conditions that may provide harborage for rodents. Prior
to securing the building, the owners, operators or prior occupants, shall
inform the PMO, in writing, of intent to secure the building and shall specify
the method and type of material to be used.  The PMO shall review the condition
of the building and exterior, and respond to the writer, setting forth special
requirements, if any, necessary for compliance with minimum standards for
effective boarding, and allow a reasonable time to complete the work.  Upon the
proper securing of the premises, and approval by the PMO, the owner, operator
or prior occupant shall monitor and maintain the structure in a safe, sanitary
and secured condition.  Failure to properly maintain the building in the above
condition, shall result in the structure being deemed a public nuisance, and
scheduled for demolition.
   (C)   Whenever the PMO finds a vacant building open to entry at doors,
windows or other points accessible to the general public, he may cause the
building to be secured at those points of entry.  The PMO shall be authorized
at any time to enter upon the premises to secure the structure in order to
lessen the severity of the public nuisance.  In securing such structure, the
PMO may call upon any department, division or bureau of the City for whatever
assistance may be necessary, or may, by private contract, secure such
structure.  The costs of such work shall be charged against the land on which
the building exists as a municipal lien or may be recovered in a civil suit
against the owner. Such securing shall not be deemed to constitute "effective
boarding" pursuant to subsection (B) hereof, and it does not abate the nuisance
condition of a dangerous building, as declared pursuant to §
155.029, unless so declared in writing by the PMO.  Subsequent notice shall
include the fact that the PMO has found it necessary to take appropriate action
to secure the building.
